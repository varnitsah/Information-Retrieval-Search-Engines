during the first two months of the year 1844 the greatest possible excitement existed in dublin respecting the state trials in which mr oconnell 1 his son the editors of three different repeal newspapers tom steele the rev mr tierneya priest who had taken a somewhat prominent part in the repeal movementand mr ray the secretary to the repeal association were indicted for conspiracy those who only read of the proceedings in papers which gave them as a mere portion of the news of the day or learned what was going on in dublin by chance conversation can have no idea of the absorbing interest which the whole affair created in ireland but more especially in the metropolis every one felt strongly on one side or on the other every one had brought the matter home to his own bosom and looked to the result of the trial with individual interest and suspense       footnote 1 the historical events described here form a backdrop                   to the novel daniel oconnell 17751847 came from                   a wealthy irish catholic family he was educated in                   the law which he practiced most successfully and                   developed a passion for religious and political                   liberty in 1823 together with lalor sheil and                   thomas wyse he organized the catholic association                   whose major goal was catholic emancipation this was                   achieved by act of parliament the following year                   oconnell served in parliament in the 1830s and was                   active in the passage of bills emancipating the jews                   and outlawing slavery in 1840 he formed the repeal                   association whose goal was repeal of the 1800 act                   of union which joined ireland to great britain in                   1842 after serving a year as lord mayor of dublin                   oconnell challenged the british government by                   announcing that he intended to achieve repeal within                   a year though he openly opposed violence prime                   minister peels government considered him a threat                   and arrested oconnell and his associates in 1843                   on trumpedup charges of conspiracy sedition and                   unlawfule assembly they were tried in 1844 and all                   but one were convicted although the conviction was                   later overturned in the house of lords oconnell did                   serve some time in jail and was considered a martyr                   to the cause of irish independence  even at this short interval irishmen can now see how completely they put judgment aside and allowed feeling and passion to predominate in the matter many of the hottest protestants of the staunchest foes to oconnell now believe that his absolute imprisonment was not to be desired and that whether he were acquitted or convicted the government would have sufficiently shown by instituting his trial its determination to put down proceedings of which they did not approve on the other hand that class of men who then styled themselves repealers are now aware that the continued imprisonment of their leaderthe persecution as they believed it to be of the liberator 2would have been the one thing most certain to have sustained his influence and to have given fresh force to their agitation nothing ever so strengthened the love of the irish for and the obedience of the irish to oconnell as his imprisonment nothing ever so weakened his power over them as his unexpected enfranchisement 3 the country shouted for joy when he was set free and expended all its enthusiasm in the effort       footnote 2 the irish often referred to daniel oconnell as                   the liberator       footnote 3 enfranchisementbeing set free this is a political                   observation by trollope  at the time however to which i am now referring each party felt the most intense interest in the struggle and the most eager desire for success every repealer and every antirepealer in dublin felt that it was a contest in which he himself was to a certain extent individually engaged all the tactics of the opposed armies down to the minutest legal details were eagerly and passionately canvassed in every circle ladies who had before probably never heard of panels in forensic phraseology now spoke enthusiastically on the subject and those on one side expressed themselves indignant at the fraudulent omission of certain names from the lists of jurors while those on the other were capable of proving the legality of choosing the jury from the names which were given and stated most positively that the omissions were accidental  the traversers 4 were in everybodys moutha term heretofore confined to law courts and lawyers rooms the attorneygeneral the commanderinchief of the government forces was most virulently assailed every legal step which he took was scrutinised and abused every measure which he used was base enough of itself to hand down his name to everlasting infamy such were the tenets of the repealers and oconnell and his counsel their base artifices falsehoods delays and unprofessional proceedings were declared by the saxon party to be equally abominable       footnote 4 traverserstrollope repeatedly refers to the                   defendants as traversers the term probably comes                   from the legal term to traverse which is to deny                   the charges against one in a common law proceeding                   thus the traversers would have been those who pled                   innocent  the whole irish bar seemed for the time to have laid aside the habitual sang froid 5 and indifference of lawyers and to have employed their hearts as well as their heads on behalf of the different parties by whom they were engaged the very jurors themselves for a time became famous or infamous according to the opinions of those by whom their position was discussed their names and additions were published and republished they were declared to be men who would stand by their country and do their duty without fear or favourso said the protestants by the roman catholics they were looked on as perjurors determined to stick to the government with blind indifference to their oaths their names are now for the most part forgotten though so little time has elapsed since they appeared so frequently before the public       footnote 5 sang froidfrench coolness in a trying situation                   lack of excitability  every days proceedings gave rise to new hopes and fears the evidence rested chiefly on the reports of certain shorthand writers who had been employed to attend repeal meetings and their examinations and crossexaminations were read reread and scanned with the minutest care then the various and long speeches of the different counsel who day after day continued to address the jury the heat of one the weary legal technicalities of another the perspicuity of a third and the splendid forensic eloquence of a fourth were criticised depreciated and admired it seemed as though the chief lawyers of the day were standing an examination and were candidates for some high honour which each was striving to secure  the dublin papers were full of the trial no other subject could at the time either interest or amuse i doubt whether any affair of the kind was ever to use the phrase of the trade so well and perfectly reported the speeches appeared word for word the same in the columns of newspapers of different politics for fourfifths of the contents of the paper it would have been the same to you whether you were reading the evening mail or the freeman every word that was uttered in the court was of importance to every one in dublin and halfanhours delay in ascertaining to the minutest shade what had taken place in court during any period was accounted a sad misfortune  the press round the four courts 6 every morning before the doors were open was very great and except by the favoured few who were able to obtain seats it was only with extreme difficulty and perseverance that an entrance into the body of the court could be obtained       footnote 6 the four courts was a landmark courthouse in dublin                   named for the four divisions of the irish judicial                   system common pleas chancery exchequer and kings                   bench  it was on the eleventh morning of the proceedings on the day on which the defence of the traversers was to be commenced that two young men who had been standing for a couple of hours in front of the doors of the court were still waiting there with what patience was left to them after having been pressed and jostled for so long a time richard lalor sheil however was to address the jury on behalf of mr john oconnelland every one in dublin knew that that was a treat not to be lost the two young men too were violent repealers the elder of them was a threeyearold denizen of dublin who knew the names of the contributors to the nation who had constantly listened to the indignation and enthusiasm of oconnell smith obrien and oneill daunt in their addresses from the rostrum of the conciliation hall 7 who had drank much porter at judes who had eaten many oysters at burton bindons who had seen and contributed to many rows in the abbey street theatre who during his life in dublin had done many things which he ought not to have done and had probably made as many omissions of things which it had behoved him to do he had that knowledge of the persons of his fellowcitizens which appears to be so much more general in dublin than in any other large town he could tell you the name and trade of every one he met in the streets and was a judge of the character and talents of all whose employments partook in any degree of a public nature his name was kelly and as his calling was that of an attorneys clerk his knowledge of character would be peculiarly valuable in the scene at which he and his companion were so anxious to be present       footnote 7 conciliation hall dublin was built in 1843 as a                   meeting place for oconnells repeal association  the younger of the two brothers for such they were was a somewhat different character though perhaps a more enthusiastic repealer than his brother he was not so well versed in the details of repeal tactics or in the strength and weakness of the repeal ranks he was a young farmer of the better class from the county mayo where he held three or four hundred wretchedly bad acres under lord ballindine and one or two other small farms under different landlords he was a goodlooking young fellow about twentyfive years of age with that mixture of cunning and frankness in his bright eye which is so common among those of his class in ireland but more especially so in connaught  the mother of these two young men kept an inn in the small town of dunmore and though from the appearance of the place one would be led to suppose that there could not be in dunmore much of that kind of traffic which innkeepers love mrs kelly was accounted a warm comfortable woman her husband had left her for a better world some ten years since with six children and the widow instead of making continual use as her chief support of that common wail of being a poor lone woman had put her shoulders to the wheel and had earned comfortably by sheer industry that which so many of her class when similarly situated are willing to owe to compassion  she held on the farm which her husband rented from lord ballindine till her eldest son was able to take it he however was now a gauger 8 in the north of ireland her second son was the attorneys clerk and the farm had descended to martin the younger whom we have left jostling and jostled at one of the great doors of the four courts and whom we must still leave there for a short time while a few more of the circumstances of his family are narrated       footnote 8 gaugera british revenue officer often engaged in                   the collection of duties on distilled spirits  mrs kelly had after her husbands death added a small grocers establishment to her inn people wondered where she had found the means of supplying her shop some said that old mick kelly must have had money when he died though it was odd how a man who drank so much could ever have kept a shilling by him others remarked how easy it was to get credit in these days and expressed a hope that the wholesale dealer in pill lane might be none the worse however this might be the widow kelly kept her station firmly and constantly behind her counter wore her weeds and her warm black stuff dress decently and becomingly and never asked anything of anybody  at the time of which we are writing her two elder sons had left her and gone forth to make their own way and take the burden of the world on their own shoulders martin still lived with his mother though his farm lay four miles distant on the road to ballindine and in another countyfor dunmore is in county galway and the lands of toneroe as martins farm was called were in the county mayo one of her three daughters had lately been married to a shopkeeper in tuam and rumour said that he had got £500 with her and pat daly was not the man to have taken a wife for nothing the other two girls meg and jane still remained under their mothers wing and though it was to be presumed that they would soon fly abroad with the same comfortable plumage which had enabled their sister to find so warm a nest they were obliged while sharing their mothers home to share also her labours and were not allowed to be too proud to cut off pennyworths of tobacco and mix dandies of punch for such of their customers as still preferred the indulgence of their throats to the blessing of father mathew  mrs kelly kept two ordinary indoor servants to assist in the work of the house one an antiquated female named sally who was more devoted to her teapot than ever was any bacchanalian to his glass were there four different teas in the inn in one evening she would have drained the pot after each though she burst in the effort sally was in all an honest woman and certainly a religious oneshe never neglected her devotional duties confessed with most scrupulous accuracy the various peccadillos of which she might consider herself guilty and it was thought with reason by those who knew her best that all the extra prayers she saidand they were very manywere in atonement for commissions of continual petty larceny with regard to sugar on this subject did her old mistress quarrel with her her young mistress ridicule her of this sin did her fellowservant accuse her and doubtless for this sin did her priest continually reprove her but in vain though she would not own it there was always sugar in her pocket and though she declared that she usually drank her tea unsweetened those who had come upon her unawares had seen her extracting the pinches of moist brown saccharine from the huge slit in her petticoat and could not believe her  kate the other servant was a redlegged lass who washed the potatoes fed the pigs and ate her food nobody knew when or where kates particularly irish kates are pretty by prescription but mrs kellys kate had been excepted and was certainly a most positive exception poor kate was very ugly her hair had that appearance of having been dressed by the turkeycock which is sometimes presented by the heads of young women in her situation her mouth extended nearly from ear to ear her neck and throat which were always nearly bare presented no feminine charms to view and her short coarse petticoat showed her red legs nearly to the knee for except on sundays she knew not the use of shoes and stockings but though kate was ungainly and ugly she was useful and gratefulvery fond of the whole family and particularly attached to the two young ladies in whose behalf she doubtless performed many a service acceptable enough to them but of which had she known of them the widow would have been but little likely to approve  such was mrs kellys household at the time that her son martin left connaught to pay a short visit to the metropolis during the period of oconnells trial but although martin was a staunch repealer and had gone as far as galway and athlone to be present at the monster repeal meetings which had been held there it was not political anxiety alone which led him to dublin his landlord the young lord ballindine was there and though martin could not exactly be said to act as his lordships agentfor lord ballindine had unfortunately a legal agent with whose services his pecuniary embarrassments did not allow him to dispensehe was a kind of confidential tenant and his attendance had been requested martin moreover had a somewhat important piece of business of his own in hand which he expected would tend greatly to his own advantage and although he had fully made up his mind to carry it out if possible he wanted in conducting it a little of his brothers legal advice and above all his landlords sanction  this business was nothing less than an intended elopement with an heiress belonging to a rank somewhat higher than that in which martin kelly might be supposed to look with propriety for his bride but martin was a handsome fellow not much burdened with natural modesty and he had as he supposed managed to engage the affections of anastasia lynch a lady resident near dunmore  all particulars respecting martins intendedthe amount of her fortuneher birth and parentageher age and attractionsshall in due time be made known or rather perhaps be suffered to make themselves known in the mean time we will return to the two brothers who are still anxiously waiting to effect an entrance into the august presence of the law  martin had already told his brother of his matrimonial speculations and had received certain hints from that learned youth as to the proper means of getting correct information as to the amount of the ladys wealthher power to dispose of it by her own deedand certain other particulars always interesting to gentlemen who seek money and love at the same time john did not quite approve of the plan there might have been a shade of envy at his brothers good fortune there might be some doubt as to his brothers power of carrying the affair through successfully but though he had not encouraged him he gave him the information he wanted and was as willing to talk over the matter as martin could desire  as they were standing in the crowd their conversation ran partly on repeal and oconnell and partly on matrimony and anty lynch as the lady was usually called by those who knew her best  tear and ouns misther lord chief justice exclaimed martin and are ye niver going to opin them big doors  and whatd be the good of his opening them yet answered john when a bigger man than himself ant there dan and the other boys isnt in it yet and sure all the twelve judges couldnt get on a peg without them  well dan my darling said the other youre thought more of here this day than the lot of em though the place in a manner belongs to them and youre only a prisoner  faix and thats what hes not martin no more than yourself nor so likely maybe hes the traverser as i told you before and thats not being a prisoner if he were a prisoner how did he manage to tell us all what he did at the hall yesterday  av hes not a prisoner hes the nextdoor to it its not of his own free will and pleasure hed come here to listen to all the lies them thundhering saxon ruffians choose to say about him  and why not why wouldnt he come here and vindicate himself when you hear sheil by and by youll see then whether they think themselves likely to be prisoners nono they never will be av theres a ghost of a conscience left in one of them protesthant raps that theyve picked so carefully out of all dublin to make jurors of they cant convict em i heard ford the night before last offer four to one that they didnt find the lot guilty and he knows what hes about and isnt the man to thrust a protestant half as far as hed see him  isnt tom steele a protesthant himself john  well i believe he is sos gray and more of em too but theres a difference between them and the downright murdhering tory set poor tom doesnt throuble the church much but youll be all for protesthants now martin when youve your new brotherinlaw barry used to be one of your raal outandouters  its little im thinking i and barryll be having to do together unless it be about the brads and the law about them now thank god makes no differ for roman and protesthant antys as good a catholic as ever breathed and so was her mother before her and when shes mrs kelly as i mane to make her master barry may shell out the cash and go to heaven his own way for me  it aint the family then youre fond of martin and i wondher at that considering how old sim loved us all  niver mind sim john hes dead and gone and av he niver did a good deed before he did one when he didnt lave all his cash to that precious son of his barry lynch  youre prepared for squalls with barry i suppose  hell have all the squalling on his own side im thinking john i dont mane to squall for one i dont see why i need with £400 ayear in my pocket and a good wife to the fore  the £400 ayears good enough av you touch it certainly said the man of law thinking of his own insufficient guinea aweek and you must look to have some throuble yet afore you do that but as to the wifewhy the less said the bettereh martin  av its not asking too much might i throuble you sir to set anywhere else but on my shouldher this was addressed to a very fat citizen who was wheezing behind martin and who to escape suffocation in the crowd was endeavouring to raise himself on his neighbours shoulders and why the less said the betteri wish yourself may never have a worse  i wish i maynt martin as far as the cash goes and a man like me might look a long time in dublin before he got a quarter of the money but you must own antys no great beauty and shes not over young either  av shes no beauty shes not downright ugly like many a girl that gets a good husband and av shes not over young shes not over old shes not so much older than myself after all its only because her own people have always made nothing of her thats what has made everybody else do the same  why martin i know shes ten years older than barry and barrys older than you  one year and antys not full ten years older than him besides whats ten years between man and wife  not much when its on the right side but its the wrong side with you martin  well john now by virtue of your oath as you chaps say wouldnt you marry a woman twice her age av shed half the moneybegad you would and leap at it  perhaps i would id a deal sooner have a woman eighty than forty thered be some chance then of having the money after the throuble was over antys neither ould enough nor young enough  shes not forty any way and wont be yet for five years and more and as i hope for glory johnthough i know you wont believe mei wouldnt marry her av shed all sim lynchs illgotten property instead of only half av i wasnt really fond of her and av i didnt think id make her a good husband  you didnt tell mother what youre afther did you  sorrow a word but shes so cute she partly guesses and i think meg let slip something the girls and anty are thick as thiefs since old sim died though they couldnt be at the house much since barry came home and anty darent for her life come down to the shop  did mother say anything about the schame  faix not much but what she did say didnt show shed much mind for it since sim lynch tried to get toneroe from her when father died shed never a good word for any of them not but what shes always a civil look for anty when she sees her  theres not much fear shell look black on the wife when you bring the money home with her but wherell you live martin the little shop at dunmorell be no place for mrs kelly when theres a lady of the name with £400 ayear of her own  deed then john and thats what i dont know maybe ill build up the ould house at toneroe some of the okellys themselves lived there years ago  i believe they did but it was years ago and very many years ago too since they lived there why youd have to pull it all down before you began to build it up  maybe id build a new house out and out av i got three new lifes in the laise id do that and the lord wouldnt be refusing me av i asked him  bother the lord martin why youd be asking anything of any lord and you with £400 ayear of your own give up toneroe and go and live at dunmore house at once  what along with barrywhen i and antys married the biggest house in county galway wouldnt hould the three of us  you dont think barry lynchll stay at dunmore afther youve married his sisther  and why not  why not dont you know barry thinks himself one of the raal gentry now any ways he wishes others to think so why hed even himself to lord ballindine av he could didnt old sim send him to the same english school with the lord on purposetho little he got by it by all accounts and dyou think hell remain in dunmore to be brotherinlaw to the son of the woman that keeps the little grocers shop in the villagenot he hell soon be out of dunmore when he hears what his sisters afther doing and youll have dunmore house to yourselves then av you like it  id sooner live at toneroe and thats the truth and id not give up the farm av shed double the money but john faith heres the judges at last hark to the boys screeching  theyd not screech that way for the judges my boy its the traversersthats dan and the rest of em theyre coming into court thank god theyll soon be at work now  and will they come through this way faith av they do theyll have as hard work to get in as theyll have to get out by and by  theyll not come this waytheres another way in for them tho they are traversers now they didnt dare but let them go in at the same door as the judges themselves  hurrah dan more power to you three cheers for the traversers and repale for ever success to every mothers son of you my darlings youll be free

and the board of trade more power gavan duffy youre the boy thatll settle em at last three cheers more for the lord mayor god bless him well yer reverence mr tierneynever mind they could come to no good when theyd be parsecuting the likes of you bravo tomhurrah for tom steele  such and such like were the exclamations which greeted the traversers and their cortège as they drew up to the front of the four courts dan oconnell was in the lord mayors state carriage accompanied by that high official and came up to stand his trial for conspiracy and sedition in just such a manner as he might be presumed to proceed to take the chair at some popular municipal assembly and this was just the thing qualified to please those who were on his own side and mortify the feelings of the party so bitterly opposed to him there was a bravado in it and an apparent contempt not of the law so much as of the existing authorities of the law which was well qualified to have this double effect  and now the outer doors of the court were opened and the crowdat least as many as were able to effect an entrancerushed in martin and john kelly were among those nearest to the door and in reward of their long patience got sufficiently into the body of the court to be in a position to see when standing on tiptoe the noses of three of the four judges and the wigs of four of the numerous counsel employed the court was so filled by those who had a place there by right or influence enough to assume that they had so that it was impossible to obtain a more favourable situation but this of itself was a great dealquite sufficient to justify martin in detailing to his connaught friends every particular of the whole trial they would probably be able to hear everything they could positively see three of the judges and if those two big policemen with high hats could by any possibility be got to remove themselves it was very probable that they would be able to see sheils back when he stood up  john soon began to show off his forensic knowledge he gave a near guess at the names of the four counsel whose heads were visible merely from the different shades and shapes of their wigs then he particularised the inferior angels of that busy elysium  thats fordthats gartlanthats peirce mahony he exclaimed as the different attorneys for the traversers furiously busy with their huge bags fidgetted about rapidly or stood up in their seats telegraphing others in different parts of the court  theres old kemmis as they caught a glimpse of the crown agent hes the boy that doctored the jury list fancy a jury chosen out of all dublin and not one catholic as if that could be fair and then he named the different judges look at that bigheaded pigfaced fellow on the rightthats pennefather hes the blackest sheep of the lotand the head of them hes a thoroughbred tory and as fit to be a judge as i am to be a general that queer little fellow with the long chin hes burtonhes a hundred if hes a dayhe was fifty when he was called seventy when they benched him and im sure hes a judge thirty years but hes the sharpest chap of the whole twelve and no end of a boy afther the girls if you only saw him walking in his robesim sure hes not three feet high that next with the skinny neck hes cramptonhes one of father mathews lads an out and out teetotaller and he looks it hes a desperate cross fellow sometimes the other one you cant see hes perrin there hes leaning overyou can just catch the side of his facehes perrin its hell acquit the traversers av anything doeshes a fair fellow is perrin and not a redhot thoroughgoing tory like the rest of em  here john was obliged to give over the instruction of his brother being enjoined so to do by one of the heavyhatted policemen in his front who enforced his commands for silence with a backward shove of his wooden truncheon which came with rather unnecessary violence against the pit of johns stomach  the fear of being turned out made him for the nonce refrain from that vengeance of abuse which his education as a dublin jackeen well qualified him to inflict but he put down the mans face in his retentive memory and made up his mind to pay him off  and now the business of the day commenced after some official delays and arrangements sheil arose and began his speech in defence of john oconnell it would be out of place here to give either his words or his arguments besides they have probably before this been read by all who would care to read them when he commenced his voice appeared to those who were not accustomed to hear him weak piping and most unfit for a popular orator but this effect was soon lost in the elegance of his language and the energy of his manner and before he had been ten minutes on his legs the disagreeable tone was forgotten though it was sounding in the eager ears of every one in the court  his speech was certainly brilliant effective and eloquent but it satisfied none that heard him though it pleased all it was neither a defence of the general conduct and politics of the party such as oconnell himself attempted in his own case nor did it contain a chain of legal arguments to prove that john oconnell individually had not been guilty of conspiracy such as others of the counsel employed subsequently in favour of their own clients  sheils speech was one of those numerous anomalies with which this singular trial was crowded and which together showed the great difficulty of coming to a legal decision on a political question in a criminal court of this the present day gave two specimens which will not be forgotten when a privy councillor a member of a former government whilst defending his client as a barrister proposed in court a new form of legislation for ireland equally distant from that adopted by government and that sought to be established by him whom he was defending and when the traverser on his trial rejected the defence of his counsel and declared aloud in court that he would not by his silence appear to agree in the suggestions then made  this spirit of turning the court into a political debating arena extended to all present in spite of the vast efforts made by them all only one of the barristers employed has added much to his legal reputation by the occasion imputations were made such as i presume were never before uttered by one lawyer against another in a court of law an attorneygeneral sent a challenge from his very seat of office and though that challenge was read in court it was passed over by four judges with hardly a reprimand if any seditious speech was ever made by oconnell that which he made in his defence was especially so and he was without check allowed to use his position as a traverser at the bar as a rostrum from which to fulminate more thoroughly and publicly than ever those doctrines for uttering which he was then being tried and to crown it all even the silent dignity of the bench was forgotten and the lawyers pleading against the crown were unhappily alluded to by the chief justice as the gentlemen on the other side  martin and john patiently and enduringly remained standing the whole day till four oclock and then the latter had to effect his escape in order to keep an appointment which he had made to meet lord ballindine  as they walked along the quays they both discussed the proceedings of the day and both expressed themselves positively certain of the result of the trial and of the complete triumph of oconnell and his party to these pleasant certainties martin added his conviction that repeal must soon follow so decided a victory and that the hopes of ireland would be realised before the close of 1844 john was neither so sanguine nor so enthusiastic it was the battle rather than the thing battled for that was dear to him the strife rather than the result he felt that it would be dull times in dublin when they should have no usurping government to abuse no saxon parliament to upbraid no english laws to ridicule and no established church to curse  the only thing which could reconcile him to immediate repeal would be the probability of having then to contend for the election of an irish sovereign and the possible dear delight which might follow of ireland going to war with england in a national and becoming manner  discussing these important measures they reached the dublin brothers lodgings and martin turned in to wash his face and hands and put on clean boots before he presented himself to his landlord and patron the young lord ballindine     ii  the two heiresses   francis john mountmorris okelly lord viscount ballindine was twentyfour years of age when he came into possession of the ballindine property and succeeded to an irish peerage as the third viscount and he is now twentysix at this time of oconnells trial the head of the family had for many years back been styled the okelly and had enjoyed much more local influence under that denomination than their descendants had possessed since they had obtained a more substantial though not a more respected title the okellys had possessed large tracts of not very good land chiefly in county roscommon but partly in mayo and galway their property had extended from dunmore nearly to roscommon and again on the other side to castlerea and ballyhaunis but this had been in their palmy days long long ago when the government in consideration of past services in the year 1800 converted the okelly into viscount ballindine the family property consisted of the greater portion of the land lying between the villages of dunmore and ballindine their old residence which the peer still kept up was called kellys court and is situated in that corner of county roscommnon which runs up between mayo and galway  the first lord lived long enough to regret his change of title and to lament the increased expenditure with which he had thought it necessary to accompany his more elevated rank his son succeeded and showed in his character much more of the newfangled viscount than of the ancient okelly his whole long life was passed in hovering about the english court from the time of his fathers death he never once put his foot in ireland he had been appointed at different times from his youth upwards page gentleman in waiting usher of the black rod deputy groom of the stole chief equerry to the princess royal which appointment only lasted till the princess was five years old lord gold stick keeper of the royal robes till at last he had culminated for ten halcyon years in a lord of the bedchamber in the latter portion of his life he had grown too old for this and it was reported at ballindine dunmore and kellys courtwith how much truth i dont knowthat since her majestys accession he had been joined with the spinster sister of a scotch marquis and an antiquated english countess in the custody of the laces belonging to the queen dowager  this nobleman publicly useful as his life had no doubt been had done little for his own tenants or his own property on his fathers death he had succeeded to about three thousand ayear and he left about one and he would have spent or mortgaged this had he not on his marriage put it beyond his own power to do so it was not only by thriftless extravagance that he thus destroyed a property which with care and without extortion would have doubled its value in the thirtyfive years during which it was in his hands but he had been afraid to come to ireland and had been duped by his agent when he came to the title simeon lynch had been recommended to him as a fit person to manage his property and look after his interests and simeon had managed it well in that manner most conducive to the prosperity of the person he loved best in the world and that was himself when large tracts of land fell out of lease sim had represented that tenants could not be foundthat the land was not worth cultivatingthat the country was in a state which prevented the possibility of letting and ultimately put himself into possession with a lease for ever at a rent varying from half a crown to five shillings an acre  the courtier lord had one son of whom he made a soldier but who never rose to a higher rank than that of captain about a dozen years before the date of my story the honourable captain okelly after numerous quarrels with the right honourable lord of the bedchamber had at last come to some family settlement with him and having obtained the power of managing the property himself came over to live at his paternal residence of kellys court  a very sorry kind of court he found itneglected dirty and out of repair one of the first retainers whom he met was jack kelly the family fool jack was not such a fool as those who of yore were valued appendages to noble english establishments he resembled them in nothing but his occasional wit he was a dirty barefooted unshorn ragged ruffian who ate potatoes in the kitchen of the court and had never done a days work in his life such as he was however he was presented to captain okelly as his honour the masthers fool  so youre my fool jack are ye said the captain  faix i war the lords fool ance but ill no be anybodys fool but sim lynchs now i and the lord are both sims fools now not but im the first of the two for id never be fool enough to give away all my land av my fatherd been wise enough to lave me any  captain okelly soon found out the manner in which the agent had managed his fathers affairs simeon lynch was dismissed and proceedings at common law were taken against him to break such of the leases as were thought by clever attorneys to have the ghost of a flaw in them money was borrowed from a dublin house for the purpose of carrying on the suit paying off debts and making kellys court habitable and the estate was put into their hands simeon lynch built himself a large staring house at dunmore defended his leases set up for a country gentleman on his own account and sent his only son barry to etonmerely because young okelly was also there and he was determined to show that he was as rich and ambitious as the lords family whom he had done so much to ruin  kellys court was restored to such respectability as could ever belong to so ugly a place it was a large red stone mansion standing in a demesne of very poor ground ungifted by nature with any beauty and but little assisted by cultivation or improvement a belt of baldlooking firs ran round the demesne inside the dilapidated wall but this was hardly sufficient to relieve the barren aspect of the locality fine trees there were none and the race of okellys had never been great gardeners  captain okelly was a man of more practical sense or of better education than most of his family and he did do a good deal to humanise the place he planted tilled manured and improved he imported rosetrees and strawberryplants and civilised kellys court a little but his reign was not long he died about five years after he had begun his career as a country gentleman leaving a widow and two daughters in ireland a son at school at eton and an expensive lawsuit with numerous ramifications all unsettled  francis the son went to eton and oxford was presented at court by his grandfather and came hack to ireland at twentytwo to idle away his time till the old lord should die till this occurred he could neither call himself the master of the place nor touch the rents in the meantime the lawsuits were dropped both parties having seriously injured their resources without either of them obtaining any benefit barry lynch was recalled from his english education where he had not shown off to any great credit and both he and his father were obliged to sit down prepared to make the best show they could on eight hundred pounds ayear and to wage an underhand internecine war with the okellys  simeon and his son however did not live altogether alone anastasia lynch was barrys sister and older than him by about ten years their mother had been a roman catholic whereas sim was a protestant and in consequence the daughter had been brought up in the mothers and the son in the fathers religion when this mother died simeon no doubt out of respect to the memory of the departed tried hard to induce his daughter to prove her religious zeal and enter a nunnery but this anty though in most things a docile creature absolutely refused to do her father advised implored and threatened but in vain and the poor girl became a great thorn in the side of both father and son she had neither beauty talent nor attraction to get her a husband and her father was determined not to encumber his already diminished property with such a fortune as would make her on that ground acceptable to any respectable suitor  poor anty led a miserable life associating neither with superiors nor inferiors and her own position was not sufficiently declared to enable her to have any equals she was slighted by her father and the servants and bullied by her brother and was only just enabled by humble unpresuming disposition to carry on her tedious life from year to year without grumbling  in the meantime the cidevant 9 black rod gold stick royal equerry and lord of the bedchamber was called away from his robes and his finery to give an account of the manner in which he had renounced the pomps and vanities of this wicked world and frank became lord ballindine with as i have before said an honourable mother two sisters a large red house and a thousand ayear he was not at all a man after the pattern of his grandfather but he appeared as little likely to redeem the old family acres he seemed to be a reviving chip of the old block of the okellys during the two years he had been living at kellys court as frank okelly he had won the hearts of all the tenantsof all those who would have been tenants if the property had not been sold and who still looked up to him as their raal young mastherand of the whole country round the thrue dhrop of the ould blood was in his veins and whatever faults he might have he wasnt likely to waste his time and his cash with furs laces and hangings       footnote 9 cidevantfrench former previous  this was a great comfort to the neighbourhood which had learned heartily to despise the name of lord ballindine and frank was encouraged in shooting hunting racingin preparing to be a thorough irish gentleman and in determining to make good the prophecies of his friends that he would be at last one more raal okelly to brighten the counthry  and if he could have continued to be frank okelly or even the okelly he would probably have done well enough for he was fond of his mother and sisters and he might have continued to hunt shoot and farm on his remaining property without further encroaching on it but the title was sure to be his ruin when he felt himself to be a lord he could not be content with the simple life of a country gentleman or at any rate without taking the lead in the country so as soon as the old man was buried he bought a pack of harriers and despatched a couple of racehorses to the skilful hands of old jack igoe the curragh trainer  frank was a very handsome fellow full six feet high with black hair and jetblack silky whiskers meeting under his chinthe men said he dyed them and the women declared he did not i am inclined myself to think he must have done so they were so very black he had an eye like a hawk round bright and bold a mouth and chin almost too well formed for a man and that kind of broad forehead which conveys rather the idea of a generous kind openhearted disposition than of a deep mind or a commanding intellect  frank was a very handsome fellow and he knew it and when he commenced so many illauthorised expenses immediately on his grandfathers death he consoled himself with the idea that with his person and rank he would soon be able by some happy matrimonial speculation to make up for what he wanted in wealth and he had not been long his own master before he met with the lady to whom he destined the honour of doing so  he had however not properly considered his own disposition when he determined upon looking out for great wealth and on disregarding other qualifications in his bride so that he obtained that in sufficient quantity he absolutely fell in love with fanny wyndham though her twenty thousand pounds was felt by him to be hardly enough to excuse him in doing socertainly not enough to make his doing so an accomplishment of his prudential resolutions what would twenty thousand pounds do towards clearing the okelly property and establishing himself in a manner and style fitting for a lord ballindine however he did propose to her was accepted and the match after many difficulties was acceded to by the ladys guardian the earl of cashel it was stipulated however that the marriage should not take place till the lady was of age and at the time of the bargain she wanted twelve months of that period of universal discretion lord cashel had added in his prosy sensible aristocratic lecture on the subject to lord ballindine that he trusted that during the interval considering their united limited income his lordship would see the wisdom of giving up his hounds or at any rate of withdrawing from the turf  frank poohpoohed at the hounds said that horses cost nothing in connaught and dogs less and that he could not well do there without them but promised to turn in his mind what lord cashel had said about the turf and at last went so far as to say that when a good opportunity offered of backing out he would part with finn mcoul and granuellas the two nags at igoes were patriotically denominated  they continued however appearing in the curragh lists in lord ballindines name as a part of igoes string and running for queens whips wellingtons and madrids sometimes with good and sometimes with indifferent success while their noble owner when staying at grey abbey lord cashels magnificent seat near kilcullen spent too much of his time at least so thought the earl and fanny wyndham in seeing them get their gallops and in lecturing the grooms and being lectured by mr igoe nothing more however could be done and it was trusted that when the day of the wedding should come he would be found minus the animals what however was lord cashels surprise when after an absence of two months from grey abbey lord ballindine declared in the earls presence with an air of illassumed carelessness that he had been elected one of the stewards of the curragh in the room of walter blake esq who had retired in rotation from that honourable office the next morning the earls chagrin was woefully increased by his hearing that that very valuable and promising derby colt brien boru now two years old by sir hercules out of eloisa had been added to his lordships lot  lord cashel felt that he could not interfere further than by remarking that it appeared his young friend was determined to leave the turf with éclat and fanny wyndham could only be silent and reserved for one evening this occurred about four months before the commencement of my tale and about five before the period fixed for the marriage but at the time at which lord ballindine will be introduced in person to the reader he had certainly made no improvement in his manner of going on he had during this period received from lord cashel a letter intimating to him that his lordship thought some further postponement advisable that it was as well not to fix any day and that though his lordship would always be welcome at grey abbey when his personal attendance was not required at the curragh it was better that no correspondence by letter should at present be carried on between him and miss wyndham and that miss wyndham herself perfectly agreed in the propriety of these suggestions  now grey abbey was only about eight miles distant from the curragh and lord ballindine had at one time been in the habit of staying at his friends mansion during the period of his attendance at the racecourse but since lord cashel had shown an entire absence of interest in the doings of finn mcoul and fanny had ceased to ask after granuells cough he had discontinued doing so and had spent much of his time at his friend walter blakes residence at the curragh now handicap lodge offered much more dangerous quarters for him than did grey abbey  in the meantime his friends in connaught were delighted at the prospect of his bringing home a bride fannys twenty thousand were magnified to fifty and the capabilities even of fifty were greatly exaggerated besides the connection was so good a one so exactly the thing for the okellys lord cashel was one of the first resident noblemen in ireland a representative peer a wealthy man and possessed of great influence not unlikely to be a cabinet minister if the whigs came in and able to shower down into connaught a degree of patronage such as had never yet warmed that poor unfriended region and fanny wyndham was not only his lordships ward but his favourite niece also the match was in every way a good one and greatly pleasing to all the kellys whether with an o or without for shure they were all the one family  old simeon lynch and his son barry did not participate in the general joy they had calculated that their neighbour was on the high road to ruin and that he would soon have nothing but his coronet left they could not therefore bear the idea of his making so eligible a match they had moreover had domestic dissensions to disturb the peace of dunmore house simeon had insisted on barrys taking a farm into his own hands and looking after it barry had declared his inability to do so and had nearly petrified the old man by expressing a wish to go to paris then barrys debts had showered in and simeon had pledged himself not to pay them simeon had threatened to disinherit barry and barry had called his father a dd obstinate old fool  these quarrels had got to the ears of the neighbours and it was being calculated that in the end barry would get the best of the battle when one morning the war was brought to an end by a fit of apoplexy and the old man was found dead in his chair and then a terrible blow fell upon the son for a recent will was found in the old mans desk dividing his property equally and without any other specification between barry and anty  this was a dreadful blow to barry he consulted with his friend molloy the attorney of tuam as to the validity of the document and the power of breaking it but in vain it was properly attested though drawn up in the old mans own handwriting and his sister whom he looked upon but as little better than a head mainservant had not only an equal right to all the property but was equally mistress of the house the money at the bank the wine in the cellar and the very horses in the stable  this was a hard blow but barry was obliged to bear it at first he showed his illhumour plainly enough in his treatment of his sister but he soon saw that this was folly and that though her quiet disposition prevented her from resenting it such conduct would drive her to marry some needy man then he began with an ill grace to try what coaxing would do he kept however a sharp watch on all her actions and on once hearing that in his absence the two kelly girls from the hotel had been seen walking with her he gave her a long lecture on what was due to her own dignity and the memory of her departed parents  he made many overtures to her as to the division of the property but easy and humble as anty was she was careful enough to put her name to nothing that could injure her rights they had divided the money at the bankers and she had once rather startled barry by asking him for his moiety towards paying the butchers bill and his dismay was completed shortly afterwards by being informed by a steady old gentleman in dunmore whom he did not like a bit too well that he had been appointed by miss lynch to manage her business and receive her rents  as soon as it could be decently done after his fathers burial barry took himself off to dublin to consult his friends there as to what he should do but he soon returned determined to put a bold face on it and come to some understanding with his sister  he first proposed to her to go and live in dublin but she said she preferred dunmore he then talked of selling the house and to this she agreed he next tried to borrow money for the payment of his debts on which she referred him to the steady old man though apparently docile and obedient she would not put herself in his hands nor would her agent allow him to take any unfair advantage of her  whilst this was going on our friend martin kelly had set his eye upon the prize and by means of his sisters intimacy with anty and his own good looks had succeeded in obtaining from her half a promise to become his wife anty had but little innate respect for gentry and though she feared her brothers displeasure she felt no degradation at the idea of uniting herself to a man in martin kellys rank she could not however be brought to tell her brother openly and declare her determination and martin had at length come to the conclusion that he must carry her off before delay and unforeseen changes might either alter her mind or enable her brother to entice her out of the country  thus matters stood at dunmore when martin kelly started for dublin and at the time when he was about to wait on his patron at morrisons hotel  both martin and lord ballindine and they were related in some distant degree at least so always said the kellys and i never knew that the okellys denied itboth the young men were at the time anxious to get married and both with the same somewhat mercenary views and i have fatigued the reader with the long history of past affairs in order to imbue him if possible with some interest in the ways and means which they both adopted to accomplish their objects     iii  morrisons hotel   at about five oclock on the evening of the day of sheils speech lord ballindine and his friend walter blake were lounging on different sofas in a room at morrisons hotel before they went up to dress for dinner walter blake was an effeminatelooking slightmade man about thirty or thirtythree years of age good looking and gentlemanlike but presenting quite a contrast in his appearance to his friend lord ballindine he had a cold quiet grey eye and a thin lip and though he was in reality a much cleverer he was a much less engaging man yet blake could be very amusing but he rather laughed at people than with them and when there were more than two in company he would usually be found making a butt of one nevertheless his society was greatly sought after on matters connected with racing his word was infallible he rode boldly and always rode good horses and though he was anything but rich he managed to keep up a comfortable snuggery at the curragh and to drink the very best claret that dublin could procure  walter blake was a finished gambler and thus it was that with about six hundred a year he managed to live on equal terms with the richest around him his father laurence blake of castleblakeney in county galway was a very embarrassed man of good property strictly entailed and when walter came of age he and his father who could never be happy in the same house though possessing in most things similar tastes had made such a disposition of the estate as gave the father a clear though narrowed income and enabled the son at once to start into the world without waiting for his fathers death though by so doing he greatly lessened the property which he must otherwise have inherited  blake was a thorough gambler and knew well how to make the most of the numerous chances which the turf afforded him he had a large stud of horses to the training and working of which he attended almost as closely as the person whom he paid for doing so but it was in the bettingring that he was most formidable it was said in kildare street that no one at tattersalls could beat him at a book he had latterly been trying a wider field than the curragh supplied him and had on one or two occasions run a horse in england with such success as had placed him at any rate quite at the top of the irish sporting tree  he was commonly called dot blake in consequence of his having told one of his friends that the cause of his the friends losing so much money on the turf was that he did not mind the dot and carry on part of the business meaning thereby that he did not attend to the necessary calculations for a short time after giving this piece of friendly caution he had been nicknamed dot and carry on but that was too long to last and he had now for some years been known to every sporting man in ireland as dot blake  this man was at present lord ballindines most intimate friend and he could hardly have selected a more dangerous one they were now going down together to handicap lodge though there was nothing to be done in the way of racing for months to come yet blake knew his business too well to suppose that his presence was necessary only when the horses were running and he easily persuaded his friend that it was equally important that he should go and see that it was all right with the derby colt  they were talking almost in the dark on these allabsorbing topics when the waiter knocked at the door and informed them that a young man named kelly wished to see lord ballindine  show him up said frank a tenant of mine dot one of the respectable few of that cattle indeed almost the only one that ive got a sort of subagent and a fifteenth cousin to boot i believe i am going to put him to the best use i know for such respectable fellows and that is to get him to borrow money for me  and hell charge you twice as much for it and make three times as much bother about it as the fellows in the next street who have your titledeeds when i want lawyers business done i go to a lawyer and when i want to borrow money i go to my own man of business he makes it his business to find money and he darent rob me more than is decent fitting and customary because he has a character to lose  those fellows at guinnesss make such a fuss about everything and i dont put my nose into that little back room but what every word i say by some means or other finds its way down to grey abbey  well frank you know your own affairs best but i dont think youll make money by being afraid of your agent or your wifes guardian if she is to be your wife  afraid man im as much afraid of lord cashel as you are i dont think ive shown myself much afraid but i dont choose to make him my guardian just when hes ceasing to be hers nor do i wish just now to break with grey abbey altogether  do you mean to go over there from the curragh next week  i dont think i shall they dont like me a bit too well when ive the smell of the stables on me  there it is again frank what is it to you what lord cashel likes if you wish to see miss wyndham and if the heavypated old don doesnt mean to close his doors against you what business has he to inquire where you came from i suppose he doesnt like me a bit too well but youre not weak enough to be afraid to say that youve been at handicap lodge  the truth is dot i dont think ill go to grey abbey at all till fannys of age she only wants a month of it now and then i can meet lord cashel in a business way as one man should meet another  i cant for the life of me said blake make out what it is that has set that old fellow so strong against horses he won the oaks twice himself and that not so very long ago and his own son kilcullen is deeper a good deal on the turf than i am and by a long chalk less likely to pull through as i take it but heres the connaught man on the stairsi could swear to galway by the tread of his footand martin knocked at the door and walked in  well kelly said lord ballindine how does dublin agree with you and i hope i see your lordship well my lord said martin  how are they all at dunmore and kellys court  why thin theyre all well my lord except sim lynchand hes dead but your lordshipll have heard that  what old simeon lynch dead said blake well then theres promotion peter mahon that was the agent at castleblakeney is now the biggest rogue alive in connaught  dont swear to that said lord ballindine theres some of sims breed still left at dunmore it wouldnt be easy to beat barry would it kelly  why then i dont know i wouldnt like to be saying against the gentlemans friend that he spoke of and doubtless his honour knows him well or he wouldnt say so much of him  indeed i do said blake i never give a man a good character till i know he deserves it well frank ill go and dress and leave you and mr kelly to your business and he left the room  im sorry to hear you speak so hard agin mr barry my lord began martin maybe he maynt be so bad not but that hes a crossgrained piece of timber to dale with  and why should you be sorry id speak against him theres not more friendship i suppose between you and barry lynch now than there used to be  why not exactly frindship my lord but ive my rasons why id wish you not to belittle the lynches your lordship might forgive them all now the old mans dead  forgive themindeed i can and easily i dont know i ever did any of them an injury except when i thrashed barry at eton for calling himself the son of a gentleman but what makes you stick up for them youre not going to marry the daughter are you  martin blushed up to his forehead as his landlord thus hit the nail on the head but as it was dark his blushes couldnt be seen so after dangling his hat about for a minute and standing first on one foot and then on the other he took courage and answered  well mr frank that is your lordship i manei blieve i might do worse  body and soul man exclaimed the other jumping from his recumbent position on the sofa you dont mean to tell me youre going to marry anty lynch  in course not answered martin av your lordship objects  object manhow the devil can i object why shes six hundred a year hasnt she  about four my lord i thinks nearest the mark  four hundred a year and i dont suppose you owe a penny in the world  not much unless the last gale 10 to your lordship and we never pay that till next may       footnote 10 galerent payment gale day was the day on which                    rent was due  and so youre going to marry anty lynch again repeated frank as though he couldnt bring himself to realise the idea and now martin tell me all about ithow the devil you managed itwhen its to come offand how you and barry mean to hit it off together when youre brothers i suppose ill lose a good tenant any way  not av im a good one you wont with my consent my lord  ah but itll be antys consent now you know she maynt like toneroe but tell me all about it what put it into your head  why my lord you run away so fast one cant tell you anything i didnt say i was going to marry herat laist not for certaini only said i might do worse  well then are you going to marry her or rather is she going to marry you or is she not  why i dont know ill tell your lordship just how it is you know when old sim died my lord  of course i do why i was at kellys court at the time  so you were my lord i was forgetting but you went away again immediately and didnt hear how barry tried to come round his sisther when he heard how the will went and how he tried to break the will and to chouse her out of the money  why this is the very man you wouldnt let me call a rogue a minute or two ago  ah my lord that was just before sthrangers besides its no use calling ones own people bad names not that he belongs to me yet and maybe never will but between you and i he is a rogue and his fathers son every inch of him  well martin ill remember ill not abuse him when hes your brotherinlaw but how did you get round the sisterthats the question  well my lord ill tell you you know there was always a kind of frindship between anty and the girls at home and they set her up to going to old moylanhe that receives the rents on young barrons property away at strype moylans uncle to flaherty that married mothers sister well she went to himhes a kind of office at dunmore my lord  oh i know him and his office he knows the value of a name at the back of a bit of paper as well as any one  maybe he does my lord but hes an honest old fellow is moylan and manages a little for mother  oh of course hes honest martin because he belongs to you you know barrys to be an honest chap then  and thats what he niver will be the longest day he lives but however moylan got her to sign all the papers and when barry was out he went and took an inventhory to the house and made out everything square and right and you may be sure barryd have to get up very arly before hed come round him well after a little the ould chap came to me one morning and asked me all manner of questionswhether i knew anty lynch whether we didnt used to be great friends and a lot more i never minded him much for though i and anty used to speak and shed dhrank tay on the sly with us two or three times before her fathers death id never thought much about her  nor wouldnt now martin eh if it wasnt for the old mans will  in course i wouldnt my lord i wont be denying it but on the other hand i wouldnt marry her now for all her money av i didnt mane to trate her well well my lord after beating about the bush for a long time the ould thief popped it out and told me that he thought antyd be all the betther for a husband and that av i was wanting a wife he blieved i might suit myself now well i thought of it a little and tould him id take the hint the next day he comes to me again all the way down to toneroe where i was walking the big grassfield by myself and began saying that as he was antys agent of course he wouldnt see her wronged quite right mr moylan says i and as i mane to be her husband i wont see her wronged neither ah but says he i mane that i must see her property properly settled why not says i and isnt the best way for her to marry and then you know no one can schame her out of it theres lots of them schamers about now says i thats thrue for you says he and theyre not far to look forand that was thrue too my lord for he and i were both schaming about poor antys money at that moment well says he afther walking on a little quite quiet av you war to marry heroh ive made up my mind about that mr moylan says i well av it should come to pass that you do marry herof course youd expect to have the money settled on herself in course i would when i die says i no but says he at once wouldnt it be enough for you to have a warm roof over your head and a leg of mutton on the table every day and no work to do for it and so my lord it came out that the money was to be settled on herself and that he was to be her agent  well martin after that i think you neednt go to sim lynch or barry for the biggest rogues in connaughtto be settling the poor girls money between you that way  well but listen my lord i gave in to the ould man that is i made no objection to his schame but i was determined av i ever did marry anty lynch that i would be agent and owner too myself as long as i lived though in course it was but right that they should settle it so that av i died first the poor crature shouldnt be out of her money but i didnt let on to him about all that for av he was angered the ould fool might perhaps spoil the game and i knew av anty married me at all itd be for liking and av iver i got on the soft side of her id soon be able to manage matthers as i plazed and ould moyland soon find his best gamed be to go asy  upon my soul martin i think you seem to have been the sharpest rogue of the two is there an honest man in connaught at all i wonder  i cant say rightly just at present my lord but therell be two plaze god when i and your lordship are there  thank ye kelly for the compliment and especially for the good company but let me hear how on earth you ever got face enough to go up and ask anty lynch to marry you  oha little soft sawther did it i wasnt long in putting my comether on her when i once began well my lord from that day outfrom afther moylans visit you knowi began really to think of it im sure the ould robber meant to have asked for a wapping sum of money down for his good will in the bargain but when he saw me he got afeard  he was another honest man just now  only among sthrangers my lord i blieve hes a faroff cousin of your own and i wouldnt like to spake ill of the blood  god forbid but go on kelly  well so from that out i began to think of it in arnest the lord forgive me but my first thoughts was how id like to pull down barry lynch and my second that id not demane myself by marrying the sisther of such an outandout ruffian and that it wouldnt become me to live on the money thatd been got by chating your lordships grandfather  my lordships grandfather ought to have looked after that himself if those are all your scruples they neednt stick in your throat much  i said as much as that to myself too so i soon went to work i was rather shy about it at first but the girls helped me they put it into her head i think before i mentioned it at all however by degrees i asked her plump whether shed any mind to be mrs kelly and though she didnt say yes she didnt say no  but how the devil man did you manage to get at her im told barry watches her like a dragon ever since he read his fathers will  he couldnt watch her so close but what she could make her way down to mothers shop now and again or for the matter of that but what i could make my way up to the house  thats true for what need she mind barry now she may marry whom she pleases and neednt tell him unless she likes until the priest has his book ready  ah my lord but theres the rub she is afraid of barry and though she didnt say so she wont agree to tell him or to let me tell him or just to let the priest walk into the house without telling him shes fond of barry though for the life of me i cant see what there is in him for anybody to be fond of he and his father led her the divils own life mewed up there because she wouldnt be a nun but still is both fond and afraid of him and though i dont think shell marry anybody elseat laist not yet awhile i dont think shell ever get courage to marry meat any rate not in the ordinary way  why then martin you must do something extraordinary i suppose  thats just it my lord and what i wanted was to ask your lordships advice and sanction like  sanction why i shouldnt think youd want anybodys sanction for marrying a wife with four hundred ayear but if thats anything to you i can assure you i approve of it  thank you my lord thats kind  to tell the truth continued lord ballindine ive a little of your own first feeling id be glad of it if it were only for the rise it would take out of my schoolfellow barry not but that i think youre a deal too good to be his brotherinlaw and you know kelly or ought to know that id be heartily glad of anything for your own welfare so id advise you to hammer away while the irons hot as the saying is  thats just what im coming to whatd your lordship advise me to do  advise you why you must know best yourself how the matter stands talk her over and make her tell barry  divil a tell my lord in her she wouldnt do it in a month of sundays  then do you tell him at once i suppose youre not afraid of him  shed niver come to the scratch av i did hed bully the life out of her or get her out of the counthry some way  then wait till his backs turned for a month or so when hes out let the priest walk in and do the matter quietly that way  well i thought of that myself my lord but hes as wary as a weazel and im afeard he smells something in the wind theres that blackguard moylan too hed be telling barryand would when he came to find things werent to be settled as he intended  then you must carry her off and marry her up here or in galway or down in connemara or over at liverpool or any where you please  now youve hit it my lord thats just what im thinking myself unless i take her off gretna green fashion ill never get her  then why do you want my advice if youve made up your mind to that i think youre quite right and whats more i think you ought to lose no time in doing it will she go do you think  why with a little talking i think she will  then what are you losing your time for man hurry down and off with her i think dublins probably your best ground  then you think my lord id betther do it at once  of course i do what is there to delay you  why you see my lord the poor girls as good as got no friends and i wouldnt like it to be thought in the counthry id taken her at a disadvantage its thrue enough in one way im marrying her for the money that is in course i wouldnt marry her without it and i tould her out open before her face and before the girls that av shed ten times as much i wouldnt marry her unless i was to be masther as long as i lived of everything in my own house like another man and i think she liked me the betther for it but for all that i wouldnt like to catch her up without having something fair done by the property  the lawyers martin can manage that afterwards when shes once mrs kelly you can do what you like about the fortune  thats thrue my lord but i wouldnt like the bad name id get through the counthry av i whisked her off without letting her settle anything theyd be saying i robbed her whether i did or no and when a things once said its difficult to unsay it the like of me my lord cant do things like you noblemen and gentry besides motherd never forgive me they think down there that poor antys simple like tho shes cute enough av they knew her i wouldnt for all the money wish it should be said that martin kelly ran off with a fool and robbed her barry d be making her out a dale more simple than she is and altogether my lord i wouldnt like it  well martin perhaps youre right at any rate youre on the right side what is it then you think of doing  why i was thinking my lord av i could get some lawyer here to draw up a deed just settling all antys property on herself when i die and on her children av she has anyso that i couldnt spend it you know she could sign it and so could i before we started and then id feel shed been traited as well as tho shed all the friends in connaught to her back  and a great deal better probably well martin im no lawyer but i should think thered not be much difficulty about that any attorney could do it  but id look so quare my lord walking into a sthrangers room and explaining what i wantedall about the running away and everything to be sure theres my brother johns people theyre attorneys but its about robberies and hanging and such things theyre most engaged and i was thinking av your lordship wouldnt think it too much throuble to give me a line to your own people or maybe youd say a word to them explaining what i want itd be the greatest favour in life  ill tell you what ill do kelly ill go with you tomorrow to mr blakes lawyersthats my friend that was sitting hereand ive no doubt well get the matter settled the guinnesses you know do all my business and theyre not lawyers  long life to your lordship and thats just like yourself i knew youd stick by me and shall i call on you tomorrow my lord and at what time  wait heres mr blake ill ask him and you might as well meet me there grey and forrests the name its in clare street i think here mr blake again entered the room  what said he isnt your business over yet ballindine i suppose im de trop then only mind dinners ordered for half past six and its that now and youre not dressed yet  youre not de trop and i was just wanting you were all friends here kelly you know and you neednt mind my telling mr blake heres this fellow going to elope with an heiress from connaught and he wants a decently honest lawyer first  i should have thought said blake that an indecently dishonest clergyman would have suited him better under those circumstances  maybe hell want that too and ive no doubt you can recommend one but at present he wants a lawyer and as i have none of my own i think forrest would serve his turn  ive always found mr forrest ready to do anything in the way of his professionfor money  no buthed draw up a deed wouldnt he blake its a sort of a marriage settlement  oh hes quite at home at that work he drew up five for my five sisters and thereby ruined my fathers property and my prospects  well hed see me tomorrow wouldnt he said lord ballindine  of course he would but mind were to be off early we ought to be at the curragh by three  i suppose i could see him at ten said his lordship  it was then settled that blake should write a line to the lawyer informing him that lord ballindine wished to see him at his office at ten oclock the next morning it was also agreed that martin should meet him there at that hour and kelly took his leave much relieved on the subject nearest his heart  well frank said blake as soon as the door was closed and have you got the money you wanted  indeed ive not then  and why not if your protégé is going to elope with an heiress he ought to have money at command  and so he will and itll be a great temptation to me to know where i can get it so easily but he was telling me all about this woman before i thought of my own concernsand i didnt like to be talking to him of what i wanted myself when hed been asking a favour of me it would be too much like looking for payment  there youre wrong fair barter is the truest and honestest system all the world overca me ca thee as the scotch call it is the best system to go by i never do or ask a favour that is for whatever i do i expect a return and for whatever i get i intend to make one  ill get the money from guinness after all thatll be the best and as you say the cheapest  there youre right his business is to lend money and hell lend it you as long as youve means to repay it and im sure no connaught man will do morethat is if i know them  i suppose he will but heaven only knows how long thatll be and the young lord threw himself back on the sofa as if he thought a little meditation would do him good however very little seemed to do for him for he soon roused himself and said i wonder how the devil dot you do without borrowing my incomes larger than yours bad as it is ive only three horses in training and youve i suppose above a dozen and take the year through i dont entertain half the fellows at kellys court that you do at handicap lodge and yet i never hear of your borrowing money  theres many reasons for that in the first place i havent an estate in the second i havent a mother in the third i havent a pack of hounds in the fourth i havent a title and in the fifth no one would lend me money if i asked it  as for the estate its devilish little i spend on it as for my mother she has her own jointure as for the hounds they eat my own potatoes and as for the title i dont support it but i havent your luck dot youd never want for money though the mint broke  very likely i maynt when it does but im likely to be poor enough till that happy accident occurs but as far as luck goes youve had more than me you won nearly as much in stakes as i did last autumn and your stable expenses werent much above a quarter what mine were but the truth is i manage better i know where my money goes to and you dont i work hard and you dont i spend my money on whats necessary to my style of living you spend yours on whats not necessary what the deuce have the fellows in mayo and roscommon done for you that you should mount two or three rascals twice aweek to show them sport when youre not there yourself two months in the season i suppose you dont keep the horses and men for nothing if you do the dogs and i much doubt whether theyre not the dearest part of the bargain  of course they cost something but its the only thing i can do for the country and there were always hounds at kellys court till my grandfather got the property and they looked upon him as no better than an old woman because he gave them up besides i suppose i shall be living at kellys court soon altogether and i could never get on then without hounds its bad enough as it is  i havent a doubt in the world its bad enough i know what castleblakeney is but i doubt your living there ive no doubt youll try that is if you do marry miss wyndham but shell be sick of it in three months and you in six and youll go and live at paris florence or naples and therell be another end of the okellys for thirty or forty years as far as irelands concerned youll never do for a poor country lord youre not sufficiently proud or stingy youd do very well as a country gentleman and youd make a decent nobleman with such a fortune as lord cashels but your game if you lived on your own property would be a very difficult one and one for which youve neither tact nor temper  well i hope ill never live out of ireland though i maynt have tact to make one thousand go as far as five ive sense enough to see that a poor absentee landlord is a great curse to his country and thats what i hope i never shall be  my dear lord ballindine all poor men are curses to themselves or some one else  a poor absentees the worst of all he leaves nothing behind and can leave nothing he wants all he has for himself and if he doesnt give his neighbours the profit which must arise somewhere from his own consumption he can give nothing a rich man can afford to leave three or four thousand a year behind him in the way of wages for labour  my gracious frank you should put all that in a pamphlet and not inflict it on a poor devil waiting for his dinner at present give your profit to morrison and come and consume some mockturtle and ill tell you what sheils going to do for us all  lord ballindine did as he was bid and left the room to prepare for dinner by the time that he had eaten his soup and drank a glass of wine he had got rid of the fit of blue devils which the thoughts of his poverty had brought on and he spent the rest of the evening comfortably enough listening to his friends comical version of shells speech receiving instruction from that great master of the art as to the manner in which he should treat his derby colt and being flattered into the belief that he would be a prominent favourite for that great race  when they had finished their wine they sauntered into the kildare street club  blake was soon busy with his little bettingbook and lord ballindine followed his example brien boru was before long in great demand blake took fifty to one and then talked the horse up till he ended by giving twentyfive he was soon ranked the first of the irish lot and the success of the hibernians had made them very sanguine of late lord ballindine found himself the centre of a little sporting circle as being the man with the crack nag of the day he was talked of courted and appealed to and i regret to say that before he left the club he was again nearly forgetting kellys court and miss wyndham had altogether got rid of his patriotic notions as to the propriety of living on his own estate had determined forthwith to send brien boru over to scotts english stables and then went to bed and dreamed that he was a winner of the derby and was preparing for the glories of newmarket with five or six thousand pounds in his pocket  martin kelly dined with his brother at judes and spent his evening equally unreasonably at least it may be supposed so from the fact that at one oclock in the morning he was to be seen standing on one of the tables at burton bindons oysterhouse with a pewter pot full of porter in his hand and insisting that every one in the room should drink the health of anty lynch whom on that occasion he swore to be the prettiest and the youngest girl in connaught  it was lucky he was so intoxicated that no one could understand him and that his hearers were so drunk that they could understand nothing as otherwise the publicity of his admiration might have had the effect of preventing the accomplishment of his design  he managed however to meet his patron the next morning at the lawyers though his eyes were very red and his cheeks pale and after being there for some half hour left the office with the assurance that whenever he and the lady might please to call there they should find a deed prepared for their signature which would adjust the property in the manner required  that afternoon lord ballindine left dublin with his friend to make instant arrangements for the exportation of brien boru and at two oclock the next day martin left by the boat for ballinaslie having evinced his patriotism by paying a years subscription in advance to the nation newspaper and with his mind fully made up to bring anty away to dublin with as little delay as possible     iv  the dunmore inn   anty lynch was not the prettiest or the youngest girl in connaught nor would martin have affirmed her to be so unless he had been very much inebriated indeed however young she might have been once she was never pretty but in all ireland there was not a more singlehearted simpleminded young woman i do not use the word simple as foolish for though uneducated she was not foolish but she was unaffected honest humble and true entertaining a very lowly idea of her own value and unelated by her newly acquired wealth  she had been so little thought of all her life by others that she had never learned to think much of herself she had had but few acquaintances and no friends and had spent her life hitherto so quietly and silently that her apparent apathy was attributable rather to want of subjects of excitement than to any sluggishness of disposition her mother had died early and since then the only case in which anty had been called on to exercise her own judgment was in refusing to comply with her fathers wish that she should become a nun on this subject though often pressed she had remained positive always pleading that she felt no call to the sacred duties which would be required and innocently assuring her father that if allowed to remain at home she would cause him no trouble and but little expense  so she had remained at home and had inured herself to bear without grumbling or thinking that she had cause for grumbling the petulance of her father and the more cruel harshness and illhumour of her brother in all the family schemes of aggrandisement she had been set aside and barry had been intended by the father as the scion on whom all the family honours were to fall his education had been expensive his allowance liberal and his whims permitted while anty was never better dressed than a decent english servant and had been taught nothing save the lessons she had learnt from her mother who died when she was but thirteen  mrs lynch had died before the commencement of sims palmy days they had seen no company in her timefor they were then only rising people and since that the great friends to whom sim in his wealth had attached himself and with whom alone he intended that barry should associate were all of the masculine gender he gave bachelor dinnerparties to harddrinking young men for whom anty was well contented to cook and when theyas they often from the effect of their potations were perforce obliged to dostayed the night at dunmore house anty never showed herself in the breakfast parlour but boiled the eggs made the tea and took her own breakfast in the kitchen  it was not wonderful therefore that no one proposed for anty and though all who knew the lynches knew that sim had a daughter it was very generally given out that she was not so wise as her neighbours and the father and brother took no pains to deny the rumour the inhabitants of the village knew better the lynches were very generally disliked and the shameful way miss anty was trated was often discussed in the little shops and many of the townspeople were ready to aver that simple or no anty lynch was the best of the breed outandout  matters stood thus at dunmore when the quarrel before alluded to occurred and when sim made his will dividing his property and died before destroying it as he doubtless would have done when his passion was over  great was the surprise of every one concerned and of many who were not at all concerned when it was ascertained that anty lynch was an heiress and that she was now possessed of four hundred pounds ayear in her own right but the passion of her brother it would be impossible to describe he soon however found that it was too literally true and that no direct means were at hand by which he could deprive his sister of her patrimony the lawyer when he informed anty of her fortune and present station made her understand that she had an equal right with her brother in everything in the house and though at first she tacitly acquiesced in his management she was not at all simple enough to be ignorant of the rights of possession or weak enough to relinquish them  barry soon made up his mind that as she had and must have the property all he could now do was to take care that it should revert to him as her heir and the measure of most importance in effecting this would be to take care that she did not marry in his first passion after his fathers death he had been rough and cruel to her but he soon changed his conduct and endeavoured to flatter her into docility at one moment and to frighten her into obedience in the next  he soon received another blow which was also a severe one moylan the old man who proposed the match to martin called on him and showed him that anty had appointed him her agent and had executed the necessary legal documents for the purpose upon this subject he argued for a long time with his sisterpointing out to her that the old man would surely rob heroffering to act as her agent himselfrecommending others as more honest and fittingand lastly telling her that she was an obstinate fool who would soon be robbed of every penny she had and that she would die in a workhouse at last  but anty though she dreaded her brother was firm wonderful as it may appear she even loved him she begged him not to quarrel with herpromised to do everything to oblige him and answered his wrath with gentleness but it was of no avail barry knew that her agent was a plotterthat he would plot against his influencethough he little guessed then what would be the first step moylan would take or how likely it would be if really acted on to lead to his sisters comfort and happiness after this barry passed two months of great misery and vexation he could not make up his mind what to do or what final steps to take either about the property his sister or himself at first he thought of frightening moylan and his sister by pretending that he would prove anty to be of weak mind and not fit to manage her own affairs and that he would indict the old man for conspiracy but he felt that moylan was not a man to be frightened by such bugbears then he made up his mind to turn all he had into money to leave his sister to the dogs or any one who might choose to rob her and go and live abroad then he thought if his sister should die what a pity it would be he should lose it all and how he should blame himself if she were to die soon after having married some low adventurer and he reflected how probable such a thing would behow likely that such a man would soon get rid of her and then his mind began to dwell on her death and to wish for it he found himself constantly thinking of it and ruminating on it and determining that it was the only event which could set him right his own debts would swallow up half his present property and how could he bring himself to live on the pitiful remainder when that stupid idiot as he called her to himself had three times more than she could possibly want morning after morning he walked about the small grounds round the house with his hat over his eyes and his hands tossing about the money in his pockets thinking of thiscursing his father and longingalmost praying for his sisters death then he would have his horse and flog the poor beast along the roads without going anywhere or having any object in view but always turning the same thing over and over in his mind and after dinner he would sit by the hour over the fire drinking longing for his sisters money and calculating the probabilities of his ever possessing it he began to imagine all the circumstances which might lead to her death he thought of all the ways in which persons situated as she was might and often did die he reflected without knowing that he was doing so on the probability of robbers breaking into the house if she were left alone in it and of their murdering her he thought of silly women setting their own clothes on fireof their falling out of windowdrowning themselvesof their perishing in a hundred possible but improbable ways it was after he had been drinking a while that these ideas became most vivid before his eyes and seemed like golden dreams the accomplishment of which he could hardly wish for and at last as the fumes of the spirit gave him courage other and more horrible images would rise to his imagination and the drops of sweat would stand on his brow as he would invent schemes by which were he so inclined he could accelerate without detection the event for which he so ardently longed with such thoughts would he turn into bed and though in the morning he would try to dispel the ideas in which he had indulged overnight they still left their impression on his mindthey added bitterness to his hatredand made him look on himself as a man injured by his father and sister and think that he owed it to himself to redress his injuries by some extraordinary means  it was whilst barry lynch was giving way to such thoughts as these and vainly endeavouring to make up his mind as to what he would do that martin made his offer to anty to tell the truth it was martins sister meg who had made the first overture and as anty had not rejected it with any great disdain but had rather shown a disposition to talk about it as a thing just possible martin had repeated it in person and had reiterated it till anty had at last taught herself to look upon it as a likely and desirable circumstance martin had behaved openly and honourably with regard to the money part of the business telling his contemplated bride that it was of course her fortune which had first induced him to think of her but adding that he would also value her and love her for herself if she would allow him he described to her the sort of settlement he should propose and ended by recommending an early day for the wedding  anty had sense enough to be pleased at his straightforward and honest manner and though she did not say much to himself she said a great deal in his praise to meg which all found its way to martins ears but still he could not get over the difficulty which he had described to lord ballindine anty wanted to wait till her brother should go out of the country and martin was afraid that he would not go and things were in this state when he started for dublin  the village of dunmore has nothing about it which can especially recommend it to the reader it has none of those beauties of nature which have taught irishmen to consider their country as the first flower of the earth and first gem of the sea it is a dirty ragged little town standing in a very poor part of the country with nothing about it to induce the traveller to go out of his beaten track it is on no high road and is blessed with no adventitious circumstances to add to its prosperity  it was once the property of the okellys but in those times the landed proprietors thought but little of the towns and now it is parcelled out among different owners some of whom would think it folly to throw away a penny on the place and others of whom have not a penny to throw away it consists of a big street two little streets and a few very little lanes there is a courthouse where the barrister sits twice a year a barrack once inhabited by soldiers but now given up to the police a large slated chapel not quite finished a few shops for soft goods half a dozen shebeenhouses 11 ruined by father mathew a score of dirty cabins offering lodging and enthertainment as announced on the windowshutters mrs kellys inn and groceryshop and last though not least simeon lynchs new staring house built just at the edge of the town on the road to roscommon which is dignified with the name of dunmore house the people of most influence in the village were mrs kelly of the inn and her two sworn friends the parish priest and his curate the former father geoghegan lived about three miles out of dunmore near toneroe and his curate father pat connel inhabited one of the small houses in the place very little better in appearance than those which offered accommodation to travellers and trampers       footnote 11 shebeenhousesunlicensed drinking houses where                    untaxed moonshine liquor was often served  such was and is the town of dunmore in the county of galway and i must beg the reader to presume himself to be present there with me on the morning on which the two young kellys went to hear sheils speech at about ten oclock the widow kelly and her daughters were busy in the shop which occupied the most important part of the groundfloor of the inn it was a long scrambling uglylooking house next to the shop and opening out of it was a large drinkingroom furnished with narrow benches and rickety tables and here the more humble of mrs kellys guests regaled themselves on the other side of this was the hall or passage of the house and next to that again a large dingy dark kitchen over which sally reigned with her teapot dynasty and in which were always congregated a parcel of ragged old men boys and noisy women pretending to be busy but usually doing but little good and attracted by the warmth of the big fire and the hopes of some scraps of food and drink  for the widow kellygod bless her was a thrue christhian and didnt begrudge the poormore power to herlike some upstarts who might live to be in want yet glory be to the almighty  the difference of the english and irish character is nowhere more plainly discerned than in their respective kitchens with the former this apartment is probably the cleanest and certainly the most orderly in the house it is rarely intruded into by those unconnected in some way with its business everything it contains is under the vigilant eye of its chief occupant who would imagine it quite impossible to carry on her business whether of an humble or important nature if her apparatus was subjected to the hands of the unauthorised an irish kitchen is devoted to hospitality in every sense of the word its doors are open to almost all loungers and idlers and the chances are that billy bawn the cripple or judy molloy the deaf old hag are more likely to know where to find the required utensil than the cook herself it is usually a temple dedicated to the goddess of disorder and too often joined with her is the potent deity of dirt it is not that things are out of their place for they have no place it isnt that the floor is not scoured for you cannot scour dry mud into anything but wet mud it isnt that the chairs and tables look filthy for there are none it isnt that the pots and plates and pans dont shine for you see none to shine all you see is a grimy black ceiling an uneven clay floor a small darkened window one or two unearthlylooking recesses a heap of potatoes in the corner a pile of turf against the wall two pigs and a dog under the single dresser three or four chickens on the windowsill an old cock moaning on the top of a rickety press and a crowd of ragged garments squatting standing kneeling and crouching round the fire from which issues a babel of strange tongues not one word of which is at first intelligible to ears unaccustomed to such eloquence  and yet out of these unfathomable unintelligible dens proceed in due time dinners of which the appearance of them gives no promise such a kitchen was mrs kellys and yet it was well known and attested by those who had often tried the experiment that a man need think it no misfortune to have to get his dinner his punch and his bed at the widows  above stairs were two sittingrooms and a colony of bedrooms occupied indiscriminately by the family or by such customers as might require them if you came back to dine at the inn after a days shooting on the bogs you would probably find miss janes workbox on the table or miss megs album on the sofa and when a little accustomed to sojourn at such places you would feel no surprise at discovering their dresses turned inside out and hanging on the pegs in your bedroom or at seeing their sidecombs and black pins in the drawer of your dressingtable  on the morning in question the widow and her daughters were engaged in the shop putting up pennorths of sugar cutting bits of tobacco tying bundles of dip candles attending to chance customers and preparing for the more busy hours of the day it was evident that something had occurred at the inn which had ruffled the even tenor of its way the widow was peculiarly gloomy though fond of her children she was an autocrat in her house and accustomed as autocrats usually are to scold a good deal and now she was using her tongue pretty freely it wasnt the girls however she was rating for they could answer for themselvesand did when they thought it necessary but now they were demure conscious and quiet mrs kelly was denouncing one of the reputed sins of the province to which she belonged and describing the horrors of schaming  them underhand ways she declared niver come to no good av its thrue what father connels afther telling me therell harum come of it before its done and over schaming schaming and schaming for iver the back of my hand to such doings i wish the tongue had been out of moylans mouth the ould rogue before he put the thing in his head av he wanted the young woman and she was willing why not take her in a dacent way and have done with it im sure shes ould enough but what does he want with a wife like hermaking innimies for himself i suppose hell be sitting up for a gentleman nowbad cess to them for gentry not but that hes as good a right as some and a dale more than others who are ashamed to put their hand to a turn of work i hate such huggery muggery work up in a corner its half your own doing and a nice piece of work itll be when hes got an ould wife and a dozen lawsuitswhen he finds his farm gone and his pockets empty for itll be a dale asier for him to be getting the wife than the moneywhen hes got every bodys abuse and nothing else by his bargain  it was very apparent that martins secret had not been well kept and that the fact of his intended marriage with anty lynch was soon likely to be known to all dunmore the truth was that moylan had begun to think himself overreached in the matterto be afraid that by the very measure he had himself proposed he would lose all share in the great prize he had put in martins way and that he should himself be the means of excluding his own finger from the pie it appeared to him that if he allowed this his own folly would only be equalled by the young mans ingratitude and he determined therefore if possible to prevent the match whereupon he told the matter as a secret to those whom he knew would set it moving in a very short space of time it reached the ears of father connel and he lost none in stepping down to learn the truth of so important a piece of luck to one of his parishioners and to congratulate the widow here however he was out in his reckoning for she declared she did not believe itthat it wasnt and couldnt be true and it was only after his departure that she succeeded in extracting the truth from her daughters  the news however quickly reached the kitchen and its lazy crowd and the inn door and its constant loungers and was readily and gladly credited in both places  crone after crone and cripple after cripple hurried into the shop to congratulate the angry widow on masther martins luck and warnt he worthy of it the handsome jeweland wouldnt he look the gintleman every inch of him and sally expatiated greatly on it in the kitchen and drank both their healths in an extra pot of tea and kate grinned her delight and jack the ostler who took care of martins horse boasted loudly of it in the street declaring that it was a good thing enough for anty lynch with all her money to get a husband at all out of the kellys for the divil a know any one knowed in the counthry where the lynchs come from but every one knowed who the kellys worand martin wasnt that far from the lord himself  there was great commotion during the whole day at the inn some said martin had gone to town to buy furniture others that he had done so to prove the will one suggested that hed surely have to fight barry and another prayed that if he did he might kill the blackguard and have all the fortin to himself out and out god bless him     v  a loving brother   the great news was not long before it reached the ears of one not disposed to receive the information with much satisfaction and this was barry lynch the proposed brides amiable brother the medium through which he first heard it was not one likely to add to his good humour jacky the fool had for many years been attached to the kellys court family that is to say he had attached himself to it by getting his food in the kitchen and calling himself the lords fool but latterly he had quarrelled with kellys court and had insisted on being sim lynchs fool much to the chagrin of that old man and since his death he had nearly maddened barry by following him through the street and being continually found at the housedoor when he went out jacks attendance was certainly dictated by affection rather than any mercenary views for he never got a scrap out of the dunmore house kitchen or a halfpenny from his new patron but still he was barrys fool and like other fools a desperate annoyance to his master  on the day in question as young mr lynch was riding out of the gate about three in the afternoon there as usual was jack  now yer honour mr barry darling shure you wont forget jacky today youll not forget your own fool mr barry  barry did not condescend to answer this customary appeal but only looked at the poor ragged fellow as though hed like to flog the life out of him  shure your honour mr barry isnt this the time then to open yer honours hand when miss anty god bless her is afther making sich a great match for the familyglory be to god  what dye mean you ruffian  isnt the kellys great people intirely mr barry and wont it be a great thing for miss anty to be sib to a lord shure yer honourd not be refusing me this blessed day  what the d are you saying about miss lynch said barry his attention somewhat arrested by the mention of his sisters name  isnt she going to be married then to the dacentest fellow in dunmore martin kelly god bless him ah therell be fine times at dunmore then hes not the boy to rattle a poor divil out of the kitchen into the cold winther night the kellys was always the right sort for the poor  barry was frightened in earnest now it struck him at once that jack couldnt have made the story out of his own head and the idea that there was any truth in it nearly knocked him off his horse he rode on however trying to appear to be regardless of what had been said to him and as he trotted off he heard the fools parting salutation  and will yer honour be forgething me afther the news ive brought yer well hard as ye are misther barry ive hot yer now any way  and in truth jack had hit him hard of all things that could happen to him this would be about the worst he had often thought with dread of his sisters marrying and of his thus being forced to divide everythingall his spoil with some confounded stranger but for her to marry a shopkeepers son in the very village in which he lived was more than he could bear he could never hold up his head in the county again and then he thought of his debts and tried to calculate whether he might get over to france without paying them and be able to carry his share of the property with him and so he went on pursuing his wretched uneasy solitary ride sometimes sauntering along at a snails pace and then again spurring the poor brute and endeavouring to bring his mind to some settled plan but whenever he did so the idea of his sisters death was the only one which seemed to present either comfort or happiness  he made up his mind at last to put a bold face on the matter to find out from anty herself whether there was any truth in the story and if there should befor he felt confident she would not be able to deceive himto frighten her and the whole party of the kellys out of what he considered a damnable conspiracy to rob him of his fathers property  he got off his horse and stalked into the house on inquiry he found that anty was in her own room he was sorry she was not out for to tell the truth he was rather anxious to put off the meeting as he did not feel himself quite up to the mark and was ashamed of seeming afraid of her he went into the stable and abused the groom into the kitchen and swore at the maid and then into the garden it was a nasty cold february day and he walked up and down the damp muddy walks till he was too tired and cold to walk longer and then turned into the parlour and remained with his back to the fire till the man came in to lay the cloth thinking on the one subject that occupied all his mindoccasionally grinding his teeth and heaping curses on his father and sister who together had inflicted such grievous such unexpected injuries upon him  if at this moment there was a soul in all ireland over whom satan had full dominionif there was a breast unoccupied by one good thoughtif there was a heart wishing a brain conceiving and organs ready to execute all that was evil from the worst motives they were to be found in that miserable creature as he stood there urging himself on to hate those whom he should have lovedcursing those who were nearest to himfearing her whom he had illtreated all his lifeand striving to pluck up courage to take such measures as might entirely quell her money was to him the only source of gratification he had looked forward when a boy to his manhood as a period when he might indulge unrestrained in pleasures which money would buy and when a man to his fathers death as a time when those means would be at his full command he had neither ambition nor affection in his nature his father had taught him nothing but the excellence of money and having fully imbued him with this had cut him off from the use of it  he was glad when he found that dinner was at hand and that he could not now see his sister until after he had fortified himself with drink anty rarely if ever dined with him so he sat down and swallowed his solitary meal he did not eat much but he gulped down three or four glasses of wine and immediately on having done so he desired the servant with a curse to bring him hot water and sugar and not to keep him waiting all night for a tumbler of punch as he did usually before the man had got into the kitchen he rang the bell again and when the servant returned breathless with the steaming jug he threatened to turn him out of the house at once if he was not quicker in obeying the orders given him he then made a tumbler of punch filling the glass half full of spirits and drinking it so hot as to scald his throat and when that was done he again rang the bell and desired the servant to tell miss anty that he wanted to speak to her when the door was shut he mixed more drink to support his courage during the interview and made up his mind that nothing should daunt him from preventing the marriage in one way or another when anty opened the door he was again standing with his back to the fire his hands in his pockets the flaps of his coat hanging over his arms his shoulders against the mantelpiece and his foot on the chair on which he had been sitting his face was red and his eyes were somewhat bloodshot he had always a surly look though from his black hair and large bushy whiskers many people would have called him good looking but now there was a scowl in his restless eyes which frightened anty when she saw it and the thick drops of perspiration on his forehead did not add benignity to his face  were you wanting me barry said anty who was the first to speak  what do you stand there for with the door open replied her brother d you think i want the servants to hear what ive got to say  deed i dont know said anty shutting the door but theyll hear just as well now av they wish for theyll come to the kayhole  will they by g said barry and he rushed to the door which he banged open finding no victim outside on whom to exercise his wrathlet me catch em and he returned to his position by the fire  anty had sat down on a sofa that stood by the wall opposite the fireplace and barry remained for a minute thinking how hed open the campaign at last he began  anty look you here now what scheme have you got in your headyoud better let me know at once  what schame barry  wellwhat schame if you like that better  ive no schame in my head that i know ofat laist and then anty blushed it would evidently be easy enough to make the poor girl tell her own secret  well go onat laist  i dont know what you mane barry av youre going to be badgering me again ill go away  its evident youre going to do something youre ashamed of when youre afraid to sit still and answer a common question but you must answer me im your brother and have a right to know whats this youre going to do he didnt like to ask her at once whether she was going to get married it might not be true and then he would only be putting the idea into her head wellwhy dont you answer me what is it youre going to do  is it about the property you mane barry  what a dd hypocrite you are as if you didnt know what i mean as for the property i tell you therell be little left the way youre going on and as to that ill tell you what im going to do so mind i warn you beforehand youre not ablethat is youre too foolish and weakheaded to manage it yourself and i mean as your guardian to put it into the hands of those that shall manage it for you im not going to see you robbed and duped and myself destroyed by such fellows as moylan and a crew of huxtering blackguards down in dunmore and now tell me at once whats this i hear about you and the kellys  what kellys said anty blushing deeply and half beside herself with fearfor barrys face was very red and full of fierce anger and his rough words frightened her  what kellys did you ever hear of martin kelly dd young robber that he is anty blushed still deeperrose a little way from the sofa and then sat down again look you here antyill have the truth out of you im not going to be bamboozled by such an idiot as you you got an old man when he was dying to make a will that has robbed me of what was my own and now you think youll play your own low game but youre mistaken youve lived long enough without a husband to do without one now and i can tell you im not going to see my property carried off by such a low paltry blackguard as martin kelly  how can he take your property barry sobbed forth the poor creature who was by this time far gone in tears  then the long and the short of it is he shant have what you call yours tell me at once will youis it true that youve promised to marry him  anty replied nothing but continued sobbing violently  cease your nonsense you blubbering fool a precious creature you are to take on yourself to marry any man are you going to answer me anty and he walked away from the fire and came and stood opposite to her as she sat upon the sofa are you going to answer me or not he continued stamping on the floor  ill not stop hereand be trated this waybarryim surei do all ii can for youand youre alwaysbullying me because father divided the property and anty continued sobbing more violently than ever i wont stop in the room any more and she got up to go to the door  barry however rushed before her and prevented her he turned the lock and put the key in his pocket and then he caught her arm as she attempted to get to the bell and dragged her back to the sofa  youre not off so easy as that i can tell you why d you think youre to marry whom you please without even telling me of it what dyou think the world would say of me if i were to let such an idiot as you be caught up by the first sharper that tried to rob you of your money now look here and he sat down beside her and laid his hand violently on her arm as he spoke you dont go out of this room alive until youve given me your solemn promise and sworn on the cross that youll never marry without my consent and youll give me that in writing too  anty at first turned very pale when she felt his heavy hand on her arm and saw his red glaring eyes so near her own but when he said she shouldnt leave the room alive she jumped from the sofa and shrieked at the top of her shrill voiceoh barry youll not murdher me shure you wouldnt murdher your own sisther  barry was rather frightened at the noise and moreover the word murder quelled him but when he found after a moments pause that the servants had not heard or had not heeded his sister he determined to carry on his game now that he had proceeded so far he took however a long drink out of his tumbler to give him fresh courage and then returned to the charge  who talked of murdering you but if you bellow in that way ill gag you its a great deal im asking indeedthat when im your only guardian my advice should be asked for before you throw away your money on a low ruffian youre more fit for a madhouse than to be any mans wife and by heaven thats where ill put you if you dont give me the promise i ask will you swear youll marry no one without my leave  poor anty shook with fear as she sate with her eyes fixed on her brothers face he was nearly drunk now and she felt that he was soand he looked so hot and so fierceso red and cruel that she was all but paralysed nevertheless she mustered strength to say  let me go now barry and tomorrow ill tell you everythingindeed i willand ill thry to do all youd have me indeed and indeed i will only do let me go now for youve frighted me  youre likely to be more frighted yet as you call it and be tramping along the roads i suppose with martin kelly before the morning no ill have an answer from you any way ive a right to that  oh barrywhat is it you wantpray let me gopray pray for the love of the blessed jesus let me go  ill tell you where youll go and thats into ballinasloe madhouse now mark meso help meill set off with you this night and have you there in the morningas an idiot as you are if you wont make the promise im telling you  by this time antys presence of mind had clean left her indeed all the faculties of her reason had vanished and as she saw her brothers scowling face so near her own and heard him threatening to drag her to a madhouse she put her hands before her eyes and made one rush to escape from himto the doorto the windowanywhere to get out of his reach  barry was quite drunk now had he not been so even he would hardly have done what he then did as she endeavoured to rush by him he raised his fist and struck her on the face with all his force the blow fell upon her hands as they were crossed over her face but the force of the blow knocked her down and she fell upon the floor senseless striking the back of her head against the table  confound her muttered the brute between his teeth as she fell for an obstinate pigheaded fool what the dl shall i do now anty get upget up will youwhat ails youand then again to himself the dl seize her what am i to do now and he succeeded in dragging her on to the sofa  the manservant and the cook although up to this point they had considered it would be ill manners to interrupt the brother and sister in their family interview were nevertheless at the door and though they could see nothing and did not succeed in hearing much were not the less fully aware that the conversation was of a somewhat stormy nature on the part of the brother when they heard the noise which followed the blow though not exactly knowing what had happened they became frightened and began to think something terrible was being done  go in terry avich whispered the womanknock man and go inshure hes murdhering her  what ud he do to me thin av hed strick a woman and she his own flesh and blood hell not murdher herbut faix hes afther doing something now knock biddy knock i say and screech out that youre afther wanting miss anty  the woman had more courage than the manor else more compassion for without further parleying she rapped her knuckles loudly against the door and as she did so terry sneaked away to the kitchen  barry had just succeeded in raising his sister to the sofa as he heard the knock  whos that he called out loudly what do you want  plaze yer honer miss antys wanting in the kitchen  shes busy and cant come at present shell be there directly  is she ill at all mr barry god bless you spake miss anty in gods name spake thin ah mr barry thin shure shed spake av she were able  go away you fool your mistressll be out in a minute then after a moments consideration he went and unlocked the door orgo in and see what she wants shes fainted i think  barry lynch walked out of the room and into the garden before the house to think over what he had done and what hed better do for the future leaving anty to the care of the frightened woman  she soon came to herself and excepting that her head was bruised in the fall was not much hurt the blow falling on her hands had neither cut nor marked her but she was for a long time so flurried that she did not know where she was and in answer to all biddys tender inquiries as to the cause of her fall and anathemas as to the masters bad temper merely said that shed get to bed for her head ached so she didnt know where she was  to bed accordingly she went and glad she was to have escaped alive from that drunken face which had glared on her for the last half hour  after wandering about round the house and through the grounds for above an hour barry returned half sobered to the room but in his present state of mind he could not go to bed sober he ordered more hot water and again sat down alone to drink and drown the remorse he was beginning to feel for what he had doneor rather not remorse but the feeling of fear that every one would know how he had treated anty and that they would side with her against him whichever way he looked all was misery and disappointment to him and his only hope for the present was in drink there he sat for a long time with his eyes fixed on the turf till it was all burnt out trying to get fresh courage from the spirits he swallowed and swearing to himself that he would not be beat by a woman  about one oclock he seized one of the candles and staggered up to bed as he passed his sisters door he opened it and went in she was fast asleep her shoes were off and the bedclothes were thrown over her but she was not undressed he slowly shut the door and stood for some moments looking at her then walking to the bed he took her shoulder and shook it as gently as his drunkenness would let him this did not wake her so he put the candle down on the table close beside the bed and steadying himself against the bedstead he shook her again and again anty he whispered anty and at last she opened her eyes directly she saw his face she closed them again and buried her own in the clothes however he saw that she was awake and bending his head he muttered loud enough for her to hear but in a thick harsh hurried drunken voice antydye hear if you marry that man ill have your life and then leaving the candle behind him he staggered off into his own room in the dark     vi  the escape   in vain after that did anty try to sleep turn which way she would she saw the bloodshot eyes and horrid drunken face of her cruel brother for a long time she lay trembling and anxious fearing she knew not what and trying to compose herselftrying to make herself think that she had no present cause for fear but in vain if she heard a noise she thought it was her brothers footstep and when the house was perfectly silent and still she feared the very silence itself at last she crept out of bed and taking the candle left by her brother which had now burned down to the socket stepped softly down the stairs to the place where the two maidservants slept and having awakened them she made biddy return with her and keep her company for the remainder of the night she did not quite tell the goodnatured girl all that had passed she did not own that her brother had threatened to send her to a madhouse or that he had sworn to have her life but she said enough to show that he had shamefully illtreated her and to convince biddy that wherever her mistress might find a home it would be very unadvisable that she and barry should continue to live under the same roof  early in the morning long afore the break o day as the song says biddy got up from her hard bed on the floor of her mistress room and seeing that anty was at last asleep started to carry into immediate execution the counsels she had given during the night as she passed the head of the stairs she heard the loud snore of barry in his drunken slumber and wishing that he might sleep as sound for ever and ever she crept down to her own domicile and awakened her comrade  whist judywhist darlint up wid ye and let me out  and whatd you be doing out now yawned judy  an arrand of the misthressshure he used her disperate faix its a wondher he didnt murther her outright  and where are ye going now  jist down to dunmoreto the kellys then avich asy now ill be telling you all bye and bye she must be out of this intirely  ist miss anty whered she be going thin out of this  divil a matther where hed murther her the ruffian av he cotched her another night in his dhrunkenness we must git her out before he sleeps hisself right but hurry now ill be telling you all when im back again  the two crept off to the back door together and judy having opened it biddy sallied out on her important and goodnatured mission it was still dark though the morning was beginning to break as she stood panting at the front door of the inn she tried to get in at the back but the yard gates were fastened and jack the ostler did not seem to be about yet so she gave a timid modest knock with the iron knocker on the front door a pause and then a second knock a little louder another pause and then a third and then as no one came she remembered the importance of her message and gave such a rap as a man might do who badly wanted a glass of hot drink after travelling the whole night  the servants had good or hardy consciences for they slept soundly but the widow kelly in her little bedroom behind the shop well knew the sound of that knocker and hurrying on her slippers and her gown she got to the door and asked who was there  is that sally maam said biddy well knowing the widows voice  no its not what is it youre wanting  is it kate thin maam  no its not kate who are you i say and what dyou want  im biddy plaze maamfrom lynchs and im wanting to spake

anty is maam av youd just be good enough to open the door id tell you in no time  it would i am sure be doing injustice to mrs kelly to say that her curiosity was stronger than her charity they both however no doubt had their effect and the door was speedily opened  oh maam commenced biddy sich terrible doings up at the house miss antys almost kilt  come out of the cowld girl in to the kitchen fire said the widow who didnt like the february blast to which biddy in her anxiety had been quite indifferent and the careful widow again bolted the door and followed the woman into certainly the warmest place in dunmore for the turf fire in the inn kitchen was burning day and night and now tell me what is it ails miss anty she war well enough yesterday i think and i heard more of her then than i wished  biddy now pulled her cloak from off her head settled it over her shoulders and prepared for telling a good substantial story  oh misthress kelly maam theres been disperate doings last

to the door and pulls her to the sofa and swears outright that hell murdher her av she dont swear by the blessed mary and the cross that shell niver dhrame of marrying no one  who tould you all this biddy was it herself  why thin partly herself it war who tould me maam and partly you see when mr barry war in his tantrums and dhrunken like i didnt like to be laving miss anty alone wid him and

it as bould as brass and rushes out into the garden saying as how miss anty war afther fainting well in course i goes in to her where he had dragged her upon the sofa and thrue enough she war faint indeed  and did she tell you biddy that her own brother had trated her that way  wait mrs kelly maam till i tell yer how it all happened when she comed to herselfand she warnt long coming roundshe didnt say much nor did i for i didnt just like then to be saying much agin the masther for who could know where his ears wereperish his sowl the blackguard  dont be cursing biddy  no maam only he must be cursed sooner or later well when she comed to herself she begged av me to help her to bed and she went up to her room and laid herself down and i thought to myself that at any rate it was all over for that night when she war gone the masther he soon come back into the house and begun calling for the sperrits again like mad and terry said that when he tuk the biling wather into the room mr barry war just like the divilas hes painted only for his ears after that terry wint to bed and i and judy werent long afther him for we didnt care to be sitting up alone wid him and he mad dhrunk so we turned in and we were in bed maybe two hours or so and fast enough when down come the misthressas pale as a sheet wid a candle in her hand and begged me for dear life to come up into her room to her and so i did in coorse and then she tould me alland not contint with what hed done down stairs but the dhrunken ruffian must come up into her bedroom and swear the most dreadfullest things to her you iver heerd mrs kelly the words he war afther using and the things he said war most horrid and miss anty wouldnt for her dear life nor for all the money in dunmore stop another night nor another day in the house wid him  but is she much hurt biddy  oh her heads cut dreadful where she fell maam and he shuck the very life out of her poor carcase so he did mrs kelly the ruffian  dont be cursing i tell you girl and what is it your misthress is wishing to do now did she tell you to come to me  no maam she didnt exactly tell meonly as she war saying that she wouldnt for anything be staying in the house with mr barry and as she didnt seem to be knowing where shed be going and av she be raally going to be married to mr martin  drat mr martin you fool did she tell you she wanted to come here  she didnt quite say as much as that to tell the thruth thin it wor i that said it and she didnt unsay it so wid that i thought id come down here the first thing and av you mrs kelly wor thinking it right wed get her out of the house before the masthers stirring  the widow was a prudent woman and she stood for some time considering for she felt that if she held out her hand to anty now she must stick to her through and through in the battle which there would be between her and her brother and there might be more plague than profit in that but then again she was not at all so indifferent as she had appeared to be to her favourite sons marrying four hundred ayear she was angry at his thinking of such a thing without consulting her she feared the legal difficulties he must encounter and she didnt like the thoughts of its being said that her son had married an old fool and cozened her out of her money but still four hundred ayear was a great thing and anty was a goodtempered tractable young woman of the right religion and would not make a bad wife and on reconsideration mrs kelly thought the thing wasnt to be sneezed at then again she hated barry and having a high spirit felt indignant that he should think of preventing her son from marrying his sister if the two of them chose to do it and she knew shed be able and willing enough too to tell him a bit of her mind if there should be occasion and lastly and most powerfully of all the womans feeling came in to overcome her prudential scruples and to open her heart and her house to a poor kindly innocent creature illtreated as anty lynch had been she was making up her mind what to do and determining to give battle royal to barry and all his satellites on behalf of anty when biddy interrupted her by saying  i hope i warnt wrong maam in coming down and throubling you so arly i thought maybe youd be glad to befrind miss antyseeing she and miss meg and miss jane is so frindly  no biddyfor a wondher youre right this morning mr barry wont be stirring yet  divil a stir maam the dhrunkenness wont be off him yet this long while and will i go up and be bringing miss anty down maam  wait a while sit to the fire there and warm your shins youre a good girl ill go and get on my shoes and stockings and my cloak and bonnet i must go up wid you myself and ask yer misthress down as she should be asked theyll be telling lies on her av she dont lave the house dacently as she ought  more power to you thin mrs kelly this blessed morning for a kind good woman as you are god bless you whimpered forth biddy who now that she had obtained her request began to cry and to stuff the corner of her petticoat into her eyes  whist you foolwhist said the widow go and get up sallyyou know where she sleepsand tell her to put down a fire in the little parlour upstairs and to get a cup of tay ready and to have miss meg up your misthressll be the better of a quiet sleep afther the night shes had and itll be betther for her jist popping into miss megs bed than getting between a pair of cowld sheets  these preparations met with biddys entire approval for she reiterated her blessings on the widow as she went to announce all the news to sally and kate while mrs kelly made such preparations as were fitting for a walk at that early hour up to dunmore house  they were not long before they were under weigh but they did not reach the house quite so quickly as biddy had left it mrs kelly had to pick her way in the half light and observed that shed never been up to the house since old simeon lynch built it and when the stones were laying for it she didnt think she ever would but one never knowed what changes might happen in this world  they were soon in the house for judy was up to let them in and though she stared when she saw mrs kelly she merely curtsied and said nothing  the girl went upstairs first with the candle and mrs kelly followed very gently on tiptoe she need not have been so careful to avoid waking barry for had a drove of oxen been driven upstairs it would not have roused him however up she crepther thick shoes creaking on every stairand stood outside the door while biddy went in to break the news of her arrival  anty was still asleep but it did not take much to rouse her and she trembled in her bed when on her asking what was the matter mrs kelly popped her bonnet inside the door and said  its only me my dear mrs kelly you know from the inn and then she very cautiously insinuated the rest of her body into the room as though she thought that barry was asleep under the bed and she was afraid of treading on one of his stray fingers its only me my dear biddys been down to me like a good girl and i tell you whatthis is no place for you just at present miss anty not till such time as things is settled a little so im thinking youd betther be slipping down wid me to the inn there before your brothers up theres nobody in it not a sowl only meg and jane and me and well make you snug enough between us never fear  do miss anty dear do darling added biddy itll be a dale betther for you than waiting here to be batthered and bruised and perhaps murthered out and out  hush biddydont be saying such things said the widow who had a great idea of carrying on the war on her own premises but who felt seriously afraid of barry now that she was in his house dont be saying such things to frighthen her but youll be asier there than here she continued to anty and theres nothin like having things asy so get up alanna 12 and well have you warm and snug down there in no time       footnote 12 alannamy child  anty did not want much persuading she was soon induced to get up and dress herself to put on her cloak and bonnet and hurry off with the widow before the people of dunmore should be up to look at her going through the town to the inn while biddy was left to pack up such things as were necessary for her mistress use and enjoined to hurry down with them to the inn as quick as she could for as the widow said there war no use in letting every idle bosthoon 13 in the place see her crossing with a lot of baggage and set them all asking the where and the why and the wherefore though for the matther of that theyd all hear it soon enough       footnote 13 bosthoona worthless fellow  to tell the truth mrs kellys courage waned from the moment of her leaving her own door and it did not return till she felt herself within it again indeed as she was leaving the gate of dunmore house with anty on her arm she was already beginning to repent what she was doing for there were idlers about and she felt ashamed of carrying off the young heiress but these feelings vanished the moment she had crossed her own sill when she had once got anty home it was all right the widow kelly seldom went out into the world she seldom went anywhere except to mass and when out she was a very modest and retiring old lady but she could face the devil if necessary across her own counter  and so anty was rescued for a while from her brothers persecution this happened on the morning on which martin and lord ballindine met together at the lawyers when the deeds were prepared which young kellys genuine honesty made him think necessary before he eloped with old sim lynchs heiress he would have been rather surprised to hear at that moment that his mother had been before him and carried off his bride elect to the inn  anty was soon domesticated the widow very properly wouldnt let her friends meg and jane ask her any questions at present sally had made on the occasion a pot of tea sufficient to supply the morning wants of half a regiment and had fully determined that it should not be wasted the kelly girls were both up and ready to do anything for their friend so they got her to take a little of sallys specific and put her into a warm bed to sleep quiet and secure from any interruption  while her guest was sleeping the widow made up her mind that her best and safest course for the present would be as she expressed it to her daughter meg to keep her toe in her pump and say nothing to nobody  anty can just stay quiet and asy she continued till we see what master barry manes to be afther hell find it difficult enough to move her out of this im thinking and i doubt his trying as to money matthers ill neither meddle nor make nor will you mind so listen to that girls and as to moylan hes a dacent quiet poor manbut its bad thrusting any one av hes her agent however i spose hell look afther the estate only barryll be smashing the things up there at the house yonder in his anger and dhrunken fits and its a pity the poor girls property should go to rack but hes such a born divil shes lucky to be out of his clutches alive though thank the almighty that put a good roof over the lone widow this day he cant clutch her here wouldnt i like to see him come to the door and ax for her and he cant smash the acres nor the money they say mulholland has at tuam and faix av he does any harm up there at the house shure enough anty can make him pay forit every pot and pan of itout of his share and shell do it tooav shes said by me but mind ill neither meddle nor make neither do you and then were safe and anty too and martinll be here sooni wondher what good dublinll do himthey might have the repale without him i supposeand when hes here why av hes minded to marry her and shes plased why father geoghegan may come down and do it before the whole counthry and whos ashamed but therell be no huggerymuggery and schaming that is av theyre said by me faix id like to know who shes to be afeared of and she undher this roof i spose martin aint fool enough to care for what such a fellow as barry lynch can do or sayand he with all the kellys to back him as shure they would and why not from the lord down not that i recommend the match i think martin a dale betther off as he is for hes wanting nothing and hes his own industhryand maybe a handful of money besides but as for being afeardi niver heard yet that a kelly need be afeard of a lynch in dunmore  in this manner did mrs kelly express the various thoughts that ran through her head as she considered antys affairs and if we could analyse the good ladys mind we should probably find that the result of her reflections was a pleasing assurance that she could exercise the christian virtues of charity and hospitality towards anty and at the same time secure her sons wishes and welfare without subjecting her own name to any obloquy or putting herself to any loss or inconvenience she determined to put no questions to anty nor even to allude to her brother unless spoken to on the subject but at the same time she stoutly resolved to come to no terms with barry and to defy him to the utmost should he attempt to invade her in her own territories  after a sound sleep anty got up much strengthened and refreshed and found the two kelly girls ready to condole with or congratulate her according to her mood and spirits in spite of their mothers caution they were quite prepared for gossiping as soon as anty showed the slightest inclination that way and though she at first was afraid to talk about her brother and was even from kindly feeling unwilling to do so the luxury of such an opportunity of unrestrained confidence overcame her and before the three had been sitting together for a couple of hours she had described the whole interview as well as the last drunken midnight visit of barrys to her own bedroom which to her imagination was the most horrible of all the horrors of the night  poor anty she cried vehemently that morningmore in sorrow for her brother than in remembrance of her own fears as she told her friends how he had threatened to shut her up in a madhouse and then to murder her unless she promised him not to marry and when she described how brutally he had struck her and how afterwards he had crept to her room with his red eyes and swollen face in the dead of the night and placing his hot mouth close to her ears had dreadfully sworn that she should die if she thought of martin kelly as her husband she trembled as though she was in an ague fit  the girls said all they could to comfort her and they succeeded in a great degree but they could not bring her to talk of martin she shuddered whenever his name was mentioned and they began to fear that barrys threat would have the intended effect and frighten her from the match however they kindly talked of other thingsof how impossible it was that she should go back to dunmore house and how comfortable and snug they would make her at the inn till she got a home for herself of what she should do and of all their little household plans together till anty when she could forget her brothers threats for a time seemed to be more comfortable and happy than she had been for years  in vain did the widow that morning repeatedly invoke meg and jane first one and then the other to assist in her commercial labours in vain were sally and kate commissioned to bring them down if on some urgent behest one of them darted down to mix a dandy of punch or weigh a pound of sugar when the widow was imperatively employed elsewhere she was upstairs again before her mother could look about her and at last mrs kelly was obliged to content herself with the reflection that girls would be girls and that it was nathural and right they shouldnt wish to lave anty alone the first morning and she sthrange to the place  at five oclock the widow as was her custom went up to her dinner and meg was then obliged to come down and mind the shop till her sister having dined should come down and relieve guard she had only just ensconced herself behind the counter when who should walk into the shop but barry lynch  had meg seen an ogre or the enemy of all mankind himself she could not at the moment have been more frightened and she stood staring at him as if the sudden loss of the power of motion alone prevented her from running away  i want to see mrs kelly said barry dye hear i want to see your mother go and tell her  but we must go back and see how mr lynch had managed to get up and pass his morning     vii  mr barry lynch makes a morning call   it was noon before barry first opened his eyes and discovered the reality of the headache which the nights miserable and solitary debauch had entailed on him for in spite of the oftrepeated assurance that there is not a headache in a hogshead of it whiskey punch will sicken one as well as more expensive and more fashionable potent drinks barry was very sick when he first awoke and very miserable too for vague recollections of what he had done and doubtful fears of what he might have done crowded on him a drunken man always feels more anxiety about what he has not done in his drunkenness than about what he has and so it was with barry he remembered having used rough language with his sister but he could not remember how far he had gone he remembered striking her and he knew that the servant had come in but he could not remember how or with what he had struck her or whether he had done so more than once or whether she had been much hurt he could not even think whether he had seen her since or not he remembered being in the garden after she had fallen and drinking again after that but nothing further surely he could not have killed her he could not even have hurt her very much or he would have heard of it before this if anything serious had happened the servants would have taken care that he should have heard enough about it ere now then he began to think what oclock it could be and that it must be late for his watch was run down the general fate of drunkards who are doomed to utter ignorance of the hour at which they wake to the consciousness of their miserable disgrace he feared to ring the bell for the servant he was afraid to ask the particulars of last nights work so he turned on his pillow and tried to sleep again but in vain if he closed his eyes anty was before them and he was dreaming half awake that he was trying to stifle her and that she was escaping to tell all the world of his brutality and cruelty this happened over and over again for when he dozed but for a minute the same thing reoccurred as vividly as before and made even his waking consciousness preferable to the visions of his disturbed slumbers so at last he roused himself and endeavoured to think what he should do  whilst he was sitting up in his bed and reflecting that he must undress himself before he could dress himselffor he had tumbled into bed with most of his clothes onterrys red head appeared at the door showing an anxiety on the part of its owner to see if the masther was awake but to take no step to bring about such a state if luckily he still slept  whats the time terry said lynch frightened by his own state into rather more courtesy than he usually displayed to those dependent on him  well then i blieve its past one yer honer  the dl it is ive such a headache i was screwed last night eh terry  i blieve yer war yer honer  what oclock was it when i went to bed  well then i dont rightly know mr barry it wasnt only about ten when i tuk in the last hot wather and i didnt see yer honer afther that  well tell miss anty to make me a cup of tea and do you bring it up here this was a feeler if anything was the matter with anty terry would be sure to tell him now but he only said yis yer honer and retreated  barry now comforted himself with the reflection that there was no great harm done and that though certainly there had been some row between him and anty it would probably blow over and then also he began to reflect that perhaps what he had said and done would frighten her out of her match with kelly  in the meantime terry went into the kitchen with the news that masther was awake and axing for tay biddy had considered herself entitled to remain all the morning at the inn having in a manner earned a right to be idle for that day by her activity during the night and the other girl had endeavoured to enjoy the same luxury for she had been found once or twice during the morning ensconced in the kitchen under sallys wing but mrs kelly had hunted her back to go and wait on her master giving her to understand that she would not receive the whole household  and yere afther telling him where miss antys gone terry inquired the injured fair one  divil a tell for me thinshure he may find it out hisself widout my telling him  faix its hell be mad thin when he finds shes taken up with the likes of the widdy kelly  and aint she betther there nor being murthered up here hed be killing her out and out some night  well but terry hes not so bad as all that theres worse than him and aint it rasonable he shouldnt be quiet and asy and she taking up with the likes of martin kelly  may be so but wouldnt she be a dale happier with martin than up here wid him any ways it dont do angering him so get him the tay judy  it was soon found that this was easier said than done for anty in her confusion had taken away the keys in her pocket and there was no tea to be had  the bell was now rung and as barry had gradually reassured himself rung violently and terry when he arrived distracted at the bedroom door was angrily asked by his thirsty master why the tea didnt appear the truth was now obliged to come out or at any rate part of it so terry answered that miss anty was out and had the keys with her  miss anty was so rarely out that barry instantly trembled again had she gone to a magistrate to swear against him had she run away from him had she gone off with martin  where the dls she gone terry said he in his extremity  faix yer honour thin im not rightly knowing but i hear tell shes down at the widow kellys  who told you you fool  well thin yer honer it war judy  and wheres judy  and it ended in judys being produced and the two of them at length explained to their master that the widow had come up early in the morning and fetched her away and judy swore that not a know she knowed how it had come about or what had induced the widow to come or miss anty to go or anything about it only for shure miss anty was down there snug enough with miss jane and miss meg and the widdy war in her tantrums and wouldnt let ony dacent person inside the housedoorbarring biddy and that wor all she knowed av she wor on the book  the secret was now out anty had left him and put herself under the protection of martin kellys mother had absolutely defied him after all his threats of the preceding night what should he do now all his hatred for her returned again all his anxious wishes that she might be somehow removed from his path as an obnoxious stumblingblock a few minutes ago he was afraid he had murdered her and he now almost wished that he had done so he finished dressing himself and then sat down in the parlour which had been the scene of his last nights brutality to concoct fresh schemes for the persecution of his sister  in the meantime terry rushed down to the inn demanding the keys and giving mrs kelly a fearful history of his masters anger this she very wisely refrained from retailing but having procured the keys gave them to the messenger merely informing him that thanks to gods kind protection miss anty was tolerably well over the last nights work and he might tell his master so  this message terry thought it wisest to suppress so he took the breakfast up in silence and his master asked no more questions he was very sick and pale and could eat nothing but he drank a quantity of tea and a couple of glasses of brandyandwater and then he felt better and again began to think what measures he should take what scheme he could concoct for stopping this horrid marriage and making his sister obedient to his wishes confound her he said almost aloud as he thought with bitter vexation of spirit of her unincumbered moiety of the property confound them all grinding his teeth and meaning by the all to include with anty his father and every one who might have assisted his father in making the odious will as well as his own attorney in tuam who wouldnt find out some legal expedient by which he could set it aside and then as he thought of the shameful persecution of which he was the victim he kicked the fender with impotent violence and as the noise of the falling fire irons added to his passion he reiterated his kicks till the unoffending piece of furniture was smashed and then with manly indignation he turned away to the window  but breaking the furniture though it was what the widow predicted of him wouldnt in any way mend matters or assist him in getting out of his difficulties what was he to do he couldnt live on £200 ayear he couldnt remain in dunmore to be known by every one as martin kellys brotherinlaw he couldnt endure the thoughts of dividing the property with such a lowborn huxtering blackguard as he called him over and over again he couldnt stay there to be beaten by him in the course of legal proceedings or to give him up amicable possession of what ought to have beenwhat should have been hiswhat he looked upon as his own he came back and sat down again over the fire contemplating the debris of the fender and turning all these miserable circumstances over in his mind after remaining there till five oclock and having fortified himself with sundry glasses of wine he formed his resolution he would make one struggle more he would first go down to the widow and claim his sister as a poor simple young woman inveigled away from her natural guardian and if this were unsuccessful as he felt pretty sure it would be he would take proceedings to prove her a lunatic if he failed he might still delay and finally put off the marriage and he was sure he could get some attorney to put him in the way of doing it and to undertake the work for him his late fathers attorney had been a fool in not breaking the will or at any rate trying it and he would go to daly young daly he knew was a sharp fellow and wanted practice and this would just suit him and then if at last he found that nothing could be done by this means if his sister and the property must go from him he would compromise the matter with the bridegroom he would meet him half way and raising what money he could on his share of the estate give leg bail to his creditors and go to some place abroad where tidings of dunmore would never reach him what did it matter what people said he should never hear it he would make over the whole property to kelly on getting a good life income out of it martin was a prudent fellow and would jump at such a plan as he thought of this he even began to wish that it was done he pictured to himself the easy pleasures the cardtables the billiardrooms and cafés of some calais or boulogne pleasures which he had never known but which had been so glowingly described to him and he got almost cheerful again as he felt that in any way there might be bright days yet in store for him  he would however still make the last effort for the whole stake it would be time enough to give in and make the best of a pis aller 14 when he was forced to do so if beaten he would make use of martin kelly but he would first try if he couldnt prove him to be a swindling adventurer and his sister to be an idiot       footnote 14 pis allerfrench last resort  much satisfied at having come to this salutary resolution he took up his hat and set out for the widows in order to put into operation the first part of the scheme he rather wished it over as he knew that mrs kelly was no coward and had a strong tongue in her head however it must be done and the sooner the better he first of all looked at himself in his glass to see that his appearance was sufficiently haughty and indignant and as he flattered himself like that of a gentleman singularly out of his element in such a village as dunmore and then having ordered his dinner to be ready on his return he proceeded on his voyage for the recovery of his dear sister  entering the shop he communicated his wishes to meg in the manner before described and while she was gone on her errand he remained alone there lashing his boot in the most approved but still in a very commonplace manner  oh mother said meg rushing into the room where her mother and jane and anty were at dinner theres barry lynch down in the shop wanting you  oh my said jane now sit still anty dear and he cant come near you shure hell niver be afther coming upstairs will he meg  anty who had begun to feel quite happy in her new quarters and among her kind friends turned pale and dropped her knife and fork whatll i do mrs kelly she said as she saw the old lady complacently get up youre not going to give me up youll not go to him  faith i will thin my dear replied the widow never fear elseill go to him or any one else that sends to me in a dacent manner maybe its wanting tay in the shop he is ill go to him immediately but as for giving you up i mane you to stay here till youve a proper home of your own and barry lynch has more in him than i think av he makes me alter my mind set down quiet meg and get your dinner and the widow got up and proceeded to the shop  the girls were all in commotion one went to the door at the top of the stairs to overhear as much as possible of what was to take place and the other clasped antys hand to reassure her having first thrown open the door of one of the bedrooms that she might have a place of retreat in the event of the enemy succeeding in pushing his way upstairs  your humble sarvant mr lynch said the widow entering the shop and immediately taking up a position of strength in her accustomed place behind the counter were you wanting me this evening and she took up the knife with which she cut pennorths of tobacco for her customers and hitting the counter with its wooden handle looked as hard as copper and as bold as brass  yes mrs kelly said barry with as much dignity as he could muster i do want to speak to you my sister has foolishly left her home this morning and my servants tell me she is under your roof is this true  is it anty indeed she is thin ating her dinner upstairs this very moment and she rapped the counter again and looked her foe in the face  then with your leave mrs kelly ill step up and speak to her i suppose shes alone  indeed she aint thin for shes the two girls ating wid her and myself too barring that im just come down at your bidding no were not so bad as that to lave her all alone and as for your seeing her mr lynch i dont think shes exactly wishing it at present so av youve a message ill take it  you dont mean to say that miss lynchmy sisteris in this inn and that you intend to prevent my seeing her youd better take care what youre doing mrs kelly i dont want to say anything harsh at present but youd better take care what youre about with me and my family or youll find yourself in a scrape that you little bargain for  ill take care of myself mr barry never fear for me darling and whats more ill take care of your sister too and to give you a bit of my mindshell want my care im thinking while youre in the counthry  ive not come here to listen to impertinence mrs kelly and i will not do so in fact it is very unwillingly that i came into this house at all  oh pray lave it thin pray lave it we can do without you  perhaps you will have the civility to listen to me it is very unwillingly i say that i have come here at all but my sister who is unfortunately not able to judge for herself is here how she came here i dont pretend to say  oh she walked said the widow interrupting him she walked quiet and asy out of your door and into mine but thats a lie for it was out of her own she didnt come through the kayhole nor yet out of the window  im saying nothing about how she came here but here she is poor creature  poor crature indeed she was like to be a poor crature av she stayed up there much longer  here she is i say and i consider it my duty to look after her you cannot but be aware mrs kelly that this is not a fit place for miss lynch you must be aware that a roadside publichouse however decent or a village shop however respectable is not the proper place for my sister and though i may not yet be legally her guardian i am her brother and am in charge of her property and i insist on seeing her it will be at your peril if you prevent me  have you done now misther barry  thats what ive got to say and i think youve sense enough to see the follynot to speak of the danger of preventing me from seeing my sister  thats your say misther lynch and now listen to mine av miss anty was wishing to see you youd be welcome upstairs for her sake but she aint so theres an end of that for not a foot will you put inside this unless youre intending to force your way and i dont think youll be for trying that and as to bearing the danger why ill do my best and for all the harm youre likely to do methats by fair manesi dont think ill be axing any one to help me out of it so good bye t ye av youve no further commands for i didnt yet well finish the bit i was ating  and you mean to say mrs kelly youll take upon yourself to prevent my seeing my sister  indeed i do unless she was wishing it as well as yourself and no mistake  and youll do that knowing as you do that the unfortunate young woman is of weak mind and unable to judge for herself and that im her brother and her only living relative and guardian  all blathershin masther barry said the uncourteous widow dropping the knife from her hand and smacking her fingers as for wake mind its sthrong enough to take good care of herself and her money too now shes once out of dunmore house there many waker than anty lynch though few have had worse tratement to make them so as for guardian im thinking its long since she was of age and av her father didnt think she wanted one when he made his will you neednt bother yourself about it now shes no one to plaze only herself and as for brother masther barry why didnt you think of that before you struck her like a brute as you arebefore you got dhrunk like a baste and then threatened to murdher her why didnt you think about brother and sisther before you thried to rob the poor wake crature as you call her and when you found she wasnt quite wake enough as you call it swore to have her life av she wouldnt act at your bidding thats being a brother and a guardian is it masther barry talk to me of danger you ruffian continued the widow with her back now thoroughly up youd betther look to yourself or i know wholl be in most danger av it wasnt the throuble itd be to antyand god knows shes had throubles enough id have had her before the magisthrates before this to tell of what was done last night up at the house yonder but mind she can do it yet and av you dont take yourself very asy she shall danger indeed a robber and ruffian like you to talk of danger to meand his dear sisther too and aftimer trying his best last night to murdher her  these last words with a long drawl on the word dear were addressed rather to the crowd whom the widows loud voice had attracted into the open shop than to barry who stood during this tirade half stupefied with rage and half frightened at the open attack made on him with reference to his illtreatment of anty however he couldnt pull in his horns now and he was obliged in selfdefence to brazen it out  very well mrs kellyyou shall pay for this impudence and that dearly youve invented these lies as a pretext for getting my sister and her property into your hands  lies screamed the widow av you say lies to me agin in this house ill smash the bones of ye myself with the broomhandle lies indeed and from you barry lynch the biggest liar in all connaughtnot to talk of robber and ruffian youd betther take yourself out of that fair and asy while youre let youll find youll have the worst of it av you come rampaging here wid me my man and she turned round to the listening crowd for sympathy which those who dared were not slow in giving her  and thats thrue for you mrs kelly maam exclaimed one  its a shame for him to come storming here agin a lone widdy so it is said a virago who seemed well able like the widow herself to take her own part  who iver knew any good of a lynchbarring miss anty herself argued a third  the kellys is always too good for the likes of them put in a fourth presuming that the intended marriage was the subject immediately in discourse  faix mr martins too good for the best of em declared another  niver mind mr martin boys said the widow who wasnt well pleased to have her sons name mentioned in the affairits no business of his one way or another he aint in dunmore nor yet nigh it miss anty lynch has come to me for protection and by the blessed virgin she shall have it as long as my names mary kelly and i aint like to change it so thats the long and short of it barry lynch so you may go and get dhrunk agin as soon as you plaze and bate and bang terry rooney or judy smith only i think either on ems more than a match for you  then i tell you mrs kelly replied barry who was hardly able to get in a word that youll hear more about it steps are now being taken to prove miss lynch a lunatic as every one here knows she unfortunately is and as sure as you stand there youll have to answer for detaining her and youre much mistaken if you think youll get hold of her property even though she were to marry your son for i warn you shes not her own mistress or able to be so  drat your impudence you lowborn ruffian answered his opponent who cares for her money its not come to that yet that a kelly is wanting to schame money out of a lynch  ive nothing more to say since you insist on keeping possession of my sister and barry turned to the door but youll be indicted for conspiracy so youd better be prepared  conspiracy is it said one of mrs kellys admirers maybe maam hell get you put in along with dan and father tierney god bless them its conspiracy theyre afore the judges for  barry now took himself off before hearing the last of the widows final peal of thunder  get out wid you youre no good and never will be an it wasnt for the young woman upstairs id have the coat off your back and your face well mauled before i let you out of the shop and so ended the interview in which the anxious brother can hardly be said to have been triumphant or successful  the widow on the other hand seemed to feel that she had acquitted herself well and that she had taken the orphans part like a woman a christian and a mother and merely saying with a kind of inward chuckle come to me indeed with his roguery hes got the wrong pig by the ear she walked off to join the more timid trio upstairs one of whom was speedily sent down to see that business did not go astray  and then she gave a long account of the interview to anty and meg which was hardly necessary as they had heard most of what had passed the widow however was not to know that and she was very voluble in her description of barrys insolence and of the dreadfully abusive things he had said to herhow he had given her the lie and called her out of her name she did not however seem to be aware that she had herself said a word which was more than necessarily violent and assured anty over and over again that out of respect to her feelings and because the man was after all her brother she had refrained from doing and saying what she would have done and said had she been treated in such a manner by anybody else she seemed however in spite of the illtreatment which she had undergone to be in a serene and happy state of mind she shook antys two hands in hers and told her to make herself snug and asy where she was like a dear girl and to fret for nothing for no one could hurt or harum her and she undher mary kellys roof then she wiped her face in her apron set to at her dinner and even went so far as to drink a glass of porter a thing she hadnt done except on a sunday since her eldest daughters marriage  barry lynch sneaked up the town like a beaten dog he felt that the widow had had the best of it and he also felt that every one in dunmore was against him it was however only what he had expected and calculated upon and what should he care for the dunmore people they wouldnt rise up and kill him nor would they be likely even to injure him let them hate on he would follow his own plan as he came near the house gate there was sitting as usual jacky the fool  well yer honer masther barry said jacky dont forget your poor fool this blessed morning  away with you if i see you there again ill have you in bridewell you blackguard  ah youre joking masther barry you wouldnt like to be afther doing that so yer honers been down to the widdys thats well its a fine thing to see you on good terms since youre soon like to be so sib well there ant no betther fellow from this to galway than martin kelly thats one comfort masther barry  barry looked round for something wherewith to avenge himself for this but jacky was out of his reach so he merely muttered some customary but inaudible curses and turned into the house  he immediately took pen ink and paper and writing the following note dispatched it to tuam by terry mounted for the occasion and directed on no account to return without an answer if mr daly wasnt at home he was to wait for his return that is if he was expected home that night      dunmore house feb 1844     my dear sir     i wish to consult you on legal business which will bear no    delay the subject is of considerable importance and i am    induced to think it will be more ably handled by you than by    mr blake my fathers man of business there is a bed at your    service at dunmore house and i shall be glad to see you to    dinner tomorrow     i am dear sir your faithful servant     barry lynch     psyou had better not mention in tuam that you are coming    to menot that my business is one that i intend to keep    secret     j daly esq solicitor tuam   in about two hours time terry had put the above into the hands of the person for whom it was intended and in two more he had brought back an answer saying that mr daly would be at dunmore house to dinner on the following day and terry on his journey there and back did not forget to tell everyone he saw from whom he came and to whom he was going     viii  mr martin kelly returns to dunmore   we will now return to martin kelly i have before said that as soon as he had completed his legal businessnamely his instructions for the settlement of anty lynchs property respecting which he and lord ballindine had been together to the lawyers in clare streethe started for home by the ballinasloe canalboat and reached that famous depôt of the fleecy tribe without adventure i will not attempt to describe the tedium of that horrid voyage for it has been often described before and to martin who was in no ways fastidious it was not so unendurable as it must always be to those who have been accustomed to more rapid movement nor yet will i attempt to put on record the miserable resources of those who doomed to a twenty hours sojourn in one of these floating prisons vainly endeavour to occupy or amuse their minds but i will advise any who from illcontrived arrangements or unforeseen misfortune 15 may find themselves on board the ballinasloe canalboat to entertain no such vain dream the vis inertiæ 16 of patient endurance is the only weapon of any use in attempting to overcome the lengthened ennui of this most tedious transit reading is out of the question i have tried it myself and seen others try it but in vain the sense of the motion almost imperceptible but still perceptible the noises above you the smells around you the diversified crowd of which you are a part at one moment the heat this crowd creates at the next the draught which a window just opened behind your ears lets in on you the fumes of punch the snores of the man under the table the noisy anger of his neighbour who reviles the attendant sylph the wouldbe witticisms of a third who makes continual amorous overtures to the same overtasked damsel notwithstanding the publicity of his situation the loud complaints of the old lady near the door who cannot obtain the gratuitous kindness of a glass of water and the babysoothing lullabies of the young one who is suckling her infant under your elbow these things alike prevent one from reading sleeping or thinking all one can do is to wait till the long night gradually wears itself away and reflect that      time and the hour run through the longest day 17        footnote 15 of course it will be remembered that this was                    written before railways in ireland had been                    constructed original footnote by trollope       footnote 16 vis inertiaelatin the power of inertia       footnote 17 macbeth act i sc 3 come what come may                    time and the hour runs through the roughest day   i hardly know why a journey in one of these boats should be much more intolerable than travelling either outside or inside a coach for either in or on the coach one has less room for motion and less opportunity of employment i believe the misery of the canalboat chiefly consists in a preconceived and erroneous idea of its capabilities one prepares oneself for occupationan attempt is made to achieve actual comfortand both end in disappointment the limbs become weary with endeavouring to fix themselves in a position of repose and the mind is fatigued more by the search after than the want of occupation  martin however made no complaints and felt no misery he made great play at the eternal halfboiled leg of mutton floating in a bloody sea of grease and gravy which always comes on the table three hours after the departure from porto bello he and others equally gifted with the dura ilia messorum 18 swallowed huge collops 19 of the raw animal and vast heaps of yellow turnips till the pity with which a stranger would at first be inclined to contemplate the consumer of such unsavoury food is transferred to the victim who has to provide the meal at two shillings a head neither love nor drinkand martin had on the previous day been much troubled with bothhad affected his appetite and he ate out his money with the true persevering prudence of a connaught man who firmly determines not to be done       footnote 18 dura ilia messorumlatin the strong intestines                    of reapersa quotation from horaces epodes iii                    trollope was an accomplished latin scholar and later                    wrote a life of cicero his books are full of                    quotations from many roman writers       footnote 19 collopsportions of food or slices of meat  he was equally diligent at breakfast and at last reached ballinasloe at ten oclock the morning after he had left dublin in a flourishing condition from thence he travelled by bianconis car as far as tuam and when there he went at once to the hotel to get a hack car to take him home to dunmore  in the hotel yard he found a car already prepared for a journey and on giving his order for a similar vehicle for his own use was informed by the disinterested ostler that the horse then being harnessed was to take mr daly the attorney to tuam 20 and that probably that gentleman would not object to join him martin in the conveyance martin thinking it preferable to pay fourpence rather than sixpence a mile for his jaunt acquiesced in this arrangement and as he had a sort of speaking acquaintance with mr daly whom he rightly imagined would not despise the economy which actuated himself he had his carpetbag put into the well of the car and placing himself on it he proceeded to the attorneys door       footnote 20 the text says tuam but the destination is                    really dunmore  he soon made the necessary explanation to mr daly who made no objection to the proposal and he also throwing a somewhat diminutive carpetbag into the same well placed himself alongside of our friend and they proceeded on their journey with the most amicable feelings towards each other  they little guessed either the one or the other as they commenced talking on the now allabsorbing subject of the great trial that they were going to dunmore for the express objectthough not with the expressed purpose of opposing each otherthat daly was to be employed to suggest any legal means for robbing martin of a wife and anty of her property and that martin was going home with the fixed determination of effecting a wedding to prevent which his companion was in consideration of liberal payment to use all his ingenuity and energy  when they had discussed oconnel and his companions and their chances of liberation for four or five miles and when martin had warmly expressed his assurance that no jury could convict the saviours of their country and daly had given utterance to his legal opinion that saltpetre couldnt save them from two years in newgate martin asked his companion whether he was going beyond dunmore that night  no indeed then replied daly i have a client there nowa thing i never had in that part of the country before yesterday  well have you at the inn then i suppose mr daly  faith you wont for i shall dine on velvet my new client is one of the right sort that can feed as well as fee a lawyer ive got my dinner and bed tonight whatever else i may get  theres not many of that sort in dunmore thin any way there werent when i left it a week since whose house are you going to mr daly av its not impertinent asking  barry lynchs  barry lynchs reechoed martin the divil you are i wonder whats in the wind with him now i thought blake always did his business  the devil a know i know so i cant tell you and if i did i shouldnt you may be sure but a man thats just come to his property always wants a lawyer and many a one besides barry lynch aint satisfied without two  well any way i wish you joy of your new client im not over fond of him myself ill own but then there were always rasons why he and i shouldnt pull well together barrys always been a dale too high for me since he was at school with the young lord well good evening mr daly never mind time car coming down the street as youre at your friends gate and martin took his bag on his arm and walked down to the inn  though martin couldnt guess as he walked quickly down the street what barry lynch could want with young daly who was beginning to be known as a clever though not overscrupulous practitioner he felt a presentiment that it must have some reference to anty and himself and this made him rather uncomfortable could barry have heard of his engagement had anty repented of her bargain during his short absence had that old reptile moylan played him false and spoilt his game that must be it said martin to himself and its odd but ill be even with the schamer yet only shes so asy frightenedav shed the laist pluck in life its little id care for moylan or barry either  this little soliloquy brought him to the inn door some of the tribe of loungers who were always hanging about the door and whom in her hatred of idleness the widow would one day rout from the place and in her charity feed the next had seen martin coming down the street and had given intelligence in the kitchen as he walked in therefore at the open door meg and jane were ready to receive him in the passage their looks were big with some important news martin soon saw that they had something to tell  well girls he said as he chucked his bag and coat to sally for heavens sake get me something to ate for im starved whats the news at dunmore  its you should have the news thin said one and you just from dublin  theres lots of news there then ill tell you when ive got my dinner hows the ould lady and he stepped on as if to pass by them upstairs  stop a moment martin said meg dont be in a hurry theres some one there  whos there is it a stranger  why then it is and it isnt said jane  but you dont ask afther the young lady said her sister  may i be hanged thin av i know what the two of ye are afther is there people in both the rooms come girls av yeve anything to tell why dont you out wid it and have done i suppose i can go into the bedroom at any rate  aisy martin and ill tell you antys in the parlour  in the parlour upstairs said he the deuce she is and what brought her here did she quarrel with barry meg added he in a whisper  indeed she did out and out said meg  oh he used her horrible said jane  hell hear all about that by and by said meg come up and see her now martin  but does mother know shes here  why it was she brought her here she fetched her down from the house yesterday before we was up  thus assured that anty had not been smuggled upstairs her lover or suitor as he might perhaps be more confidently called proceeded to visit her if he wished her to believe that his first impulse on hearing of her being in the house had been to throw himself at her feet it would have been well that this conversation should have been carried on out of her hearing but anty was not an exigent mistress and was perfectly contented that as much of her recent history as possible should be explained before martin presented himself  martin went slowly upstairs and paused a moment at the door as if he was a little afraid of commencing the interview he looked round to his sisters and made a sign to them to come in with him and then quickly pushing open the unfastened door walked briskly up to anty and shook hands with her  i hope youre very well anty said he seeing you here is what i didnt expect but im very glad youve come down  thank ye martin replied she it was very good of your mother fetching me shes been the best friend ive had many a day  begad its a fine thing to see you and the ould lady pull so well together it was yesterday you came here  yesterday morning i was so glad to come i dont know what theyd been saying to barry but the night before last he got drinking and then he was very bad to me and tried to frighten me and so you see i come down to your mother till we could be friends again  antys apology for being at the inn was perhaps unnecessary but with the feeling so natural to a woman she was half afraid that martin would fancy she had run after him and she therefore thought it as well to tell him that it was only a temporary measure poor anty at the moment she said so she trembled at the very idea of putting herself again in her brothers power  frinds indeed said meg how can you iver be frinds with the like of him what nonsense you talk anty why martin he was like to murdher herhe raised his fist to her and knocked her downand afther that swore to her hed kill her outright av she wouldnt sware that shed niver  whist meg how can you go on that way said anty interrupting her and blushing ill not stop in the room dont you know he was dhrunk when he done all that  and wont he be dhrunk again anty suggested jane  shure he will hell be dhrunk always now hes once begun replied meg who of all the family was the most anxious to push her brothers suit and who though really fond of her friend thought the present opportunity a great deal too good to be thrown away and could not bear the idea of antys even thinking of being reconciled to her brother wont he be always dhrunk now she continued and aint we all frinds here and why shouldnt you let me tell martin all afther alls said and done isnt he the best frind youve gothere anty blushed very red and to tell the truth so did martin toowell so he is and unless you tell him whats happened hows he to know what to advise and to tell the truth wouldnt you sooner do what he says than any one else  im sure im very much obliged to mr martinit had been plain martin before megs appeal but your mother knows whats best for me and ill do whatever she says av it hadnt been for her i dont know where id be now  but you neednt quarrel with martin because youre frinds with mother answered meg  nonsense meg said jane antys not going to quarrel with him you hurry her too much  martin looked rather stupid all this time but he plucked up courage and said whos going to quarrel im shure anty you and i wont but whatever it is barry did to you i hope you wont go back there again now youre once here but did he railly sthrike you in arnest  he did and knocked her down said jane  but wont you get your brother his dinner said anty he must be very hungry afther his rideand wont you see your mother afther your journey mr martin im shure shes expecting you  this for the present put an end to the conversation the girls went to get something for their brother to eat and he descended into the lower regions to pay his filial respects to his mother  a considerable time passed before martin returned to the meal the three young women had provided for him during which he was in close consultation with the widow in the first place she began upbraiding him for his folly in wishing to marry an old maid for her money she then taxed him with villany for trying to cheat anty out of her property and when he defended himself from that charge by telling her what he had done about the settlement she asked him how much he had to pay the rogue of a lawyer for that ganders job she then proceeded to point out all the difficulties which lay in the way of a marriage between him martin and her anty and showed how mad it was for either of them to think about it from that she got into a narrative of barrys conduct and antys sufferings neither of which lost anything in the telling and having by this time gossiped herself into a good humour she proceeded to show how through her means and assistance the marriage might take place if he was still bent upon it she eschewed all running away and would hear of no clandestine proceedings they should be married in the face of day as the kellys ought with all their friends round them theyd have no huggerymuggery work up in a corner not they indeed why should theyfor fear of barry lynchwho cared for a dhrunken blackguard like thatnot she indeed who ever heard of a kelly being afraid of a lynchtheyd ax him to come and see his sister married and av he didnt like it he might do the other thing  and so the widow got quite eloquent on the glories of the wedding and the enormities of her sons future brotherinlaw who had she assured martin come down and abused her horribly in her own shop before all the town because she allowed anty to stay in the house she then proceeded to the consequences of the marriage and expressed her hope that when martin got all that ready money he would do something for his poor sisthersfor heaven knew they war like to be bad enough off for all shed be able to do for them from this she got to martins own future mode of life suggesting a small snug cottage on the farm just big enough for them two and maybe a slip of a girl servant and not to be taring and tatthering away as av money had no eend and afther all she added there war nothing like industhry and who knowd whether that born villain barry mightnt yet get sich a hoult of the money that thered be no getting it out of his fist and she then depicted in most pathetic language what would be the misery of herself and all the kellys if martin flushed with his prosperity were to give up the farm at toneroe and afterwards find that he had been robbed of his expected property and that he had no support for himself and his young bride  on this subject martin considerably comforted her by assuring her that he had no thoughts of abandoning toneroe although he did not go so far as to acquiesce in the very small cottage and he moreover expressed his thorough confidence that he would neither be led himself nor lead anty into the imprudence of a marriage until he had well satisfied himself that the property was safe  the widow was well pleased to find from martins prudent resolves that he was her own son and that she neednt blush for him and then they parted she to her shop and he to his dinner not however before he had promised her to give up all ideas of a clandestine marriage and to permit himself to be united to his wife in the face of day as became a kelly  the evening passed over quietly and snugly at the inn martin had not much difficulty in persuading his three companions to take a glass of punch each out of his tumbler and less in getting them to take a second and before they went to bed he and anty were again intimate and as he was sitting next her for a couple of hours on the little sofa opposite the fire it is more than probable that he got his arm round her waista comfortable position which seemed in no way to shock the decorum of either meg or jane     ix  mr daly the attorney   we must now see how things went on in the enemys camp  the attorney drove up to the door of dunmore house on his car and was shown into the drawingroom where he met barry lynch the two young men were acquainted though not intimate with each other and they bowed and then shook hands and barry told the attorney that he was welcome to dunmore house and the attorney made another bow rubbed his hands before the fire and said it was a very cold evening and barry said it was nation cold for that time of the year which considering that they were now in the middle of february showed that barry was rather abroad and didnt exactly know what to say he remained for about a minute silent before the fire and then asked daly if hed like to see his room and the attorney acquiescing he led him up to it and left him there  the truth was that as the time of the mans visit had drawn nearer barry had become more and more embarrassed and now that the attorney had absolutely come his employer felt himself unable to explain the business before dinner these fellows are so confoundedly sharpi shall never be up to him till i get a tumbler of punch on board said he to himself comforting himself with the reflection besides im never well able for anything till i get a little warmed well get along like a house on fire when weve got the hot water between us the true meaning of all which was that he hadnt the courage to make known his villanous schemes respecting his sister till he was half drunk and in order the earlier to bring about this necessary and now daily consummation he sneaked downstairs and took a solitary glass of brandy to fortify himself for entertaining the attorney  the dinner was dull enough for of course as long as the man was in the room there was no talking on business and in his present frame of mind barry was not likely to be an agreeable companion the attorney ate his dinner as if it was a part of the fee received in payment of the work he was to do and with a determination to make the most of it  at last the dishes disappeared and with them terry rooney who however like a faithful servant felt too strong an interest in his masters affairs to be very far absent when matters of importance were likely to be discussed  and now mr daly said lynch we can be snug here without interruption for an hour or two youll find that whiskey old and good i think but if you prefer wine that port on the table came from bartons in sackville street  thank ye if i take anything itll be a glass of punch but as weve business to talk of maybe id better keep my head clear  my heads never so clear then as when ive done my second tumbler im never so sure of what im about as when im a little warmed but says you because my heads strong its no reason anothers shouldnt be weak but do as you like liberty hall here now mr daly that is as far as im concerned you knew my father i believe mr daly  well then mr lynch i didnt exactly know him but living so near him and he having so much business in the county and myself having a little i believe ive been in company with him odd times  he was a queer man wasnt he mr daly  was he then i dare say i didnt know much about him ill take the sugar from you mr lynch i believe i might as well mix a drop as the nights cold  thats right i thought you werent the fellow to sit with an empty glass before you but as i was saying before the old boy was a queer hand that is latterlyfor the last year or so of course you know all about his will  faith then not much i heard he left a will dividing the property between you and miss lynch  he did just at the last moment when the breath wasnt much more than left in him he signed a will making away half the estate just as you say to my sister blake could have broke the will only he was so d pigheaded and stupid its too late now i suppose  why i could hardly answer that you know as i never heard the circumstances but i was given to understand that blake consulted mcmahon and that mcmahon wouldnt take up the case as there was nothing he could put before the chancellor mind im only repeating what people said in tuam and about there of course i couldnt think of advising till i knew the particulars was it on this subject mr lynch you were good enough to send for me  not at all mr daly i look upon that as done and gone bad luck to blake and mcmahon both the truth is between you and me dalyi dont mind telling you as i hope now you will become my man of business and its only fair you should know all about itthe truth is blake was more interested on the other side and he was determined the case shouldnt go before the chancellor but when my father signed that will it was just after one of those fits he had lately that could be proved and he didnt know what he was doing from adam he didnt know what was in the will nor that he was signing a will at all so help me he didnt however thats over it wasnt to talk about that that i sent for you only sorrow seize the rogue that made the old man rob me it wasnt anty herself poor creature she knew nothing about it it was those who meant to get hold of my money through her that did it poor anty heaven knows she wasnt up to such a dodge as that  well mr lynch of course i know nothing of the absolute facts but from what i hear i think its as well to let the will alone the chancellor wont put a will aside in a hurry its always a difficult jobwould cost an immense sum of money which should any way come out of the property and after all the chances are ten to one youd be beat  perhaps youre right now though im sure had the matter been properly taken up at firsthad you seen the whole case at the first start the thing could have been done im sure you would have said so but thats over now its another business i want you for but you dont drink your punchand its dry work talking without wetting ones whistle and barry carried out his own recommendation  im doing very well thank ye mr lynch and what is it i can do for you  thats what im coming to you know that by the will my sister anty gets from four to five hundred a year  i didnt know the amount but i believe she has half whatever there is  exactly half the land half the cash half the house half everything except the debts and those were contracted in my name and i must pay them all isnt that hard mr daly  i didnt know your father had debts  oh but he haddebts which ought to have been his though as i said they stand in my name and i must pay them  and i suppose what you now want is to saddle the debts on the entire property if you can really prove that the debts were incurred for your fathers benefit i should think you might do that but has your sister refused to pay the half they cant be heavy wont miss lynch agree to pay the half herself  this last lie of barrysfor to give the devil his due old sim hadnt owed one penny for the last twenty yearswas only a bright invention of the moment thrown off by our injured hero to aggravate the hardships of his case but he was determined to make the most of it  not heavyfaith they are heavy and dd heavy too mr dalywhatll take two hundred ayear out of my miserable share of the property divil a less oh theres never any knowing how a manll cut up till hes gone  thats true but how could your father owe such a sum as that and no one know it why that must be four or five thousand pounds  about five i believe  and youve put your name to them isnt that it  something like it you know he and lord ballindine years ago were fighting about the leases we held under the old lord and then the old man wanted ready money and borrowed it in dublin and some years sincethat is about three years agosooner than see any of the property sold i took up the debt myself you know it was all as good as my own then and now confound it i must pay the whole out of the miserable thing thats left me under this infernal will but it wasnt even about that i sent for you only i must explain exactly how matters are before i come to the real point  but your fathers name must be joined with yours in the debt and if so you can come upon the entire property for the payment theres no difficulty about that your sister of course must pay the half  its not so my dear fellow i cant explain the thing exactly but its i that owe the money and i must pay it but its no good talking of that well you see anty thats my sister has this property all in her own hands but you dont drink your punch and barry mixed his third tumbler  of course she has and surely she wont refuse to pay half the claims on the estate  never mind the claims answered barry who began to fear that he had pushed his little invention a thought too far i tell you i must stand to them you dont suppose id ask her to pay a penny as a favour no im a little too proud for that besides itd be no use not the least and thats what im coming to you see antys got this money andyou know dont you mr daly poor antys not just like other people  no said mr dalyi didnt i cant say i know much about miss lynch i never had the pleasure of seeing her  but did you never hear she wasnt quite right  indeed i never did then  well thats odd but we never had it much talked about poor creature indeed there was no necessity for people to know much about it for she never gave any trouble and to tell the truth as long as she was kept quiet she never gave us occasion to think much about it but confound them for roguesthose who have got hold of her now have quite upset her  but what is it ails your sister mr lynch  to have it out at once thenshes not right in her upper story mind i dont mean shes a downright lunatic but shes cracked poor thing and quite unable to judge for herself in moneymatters and such like and though she might have done very well poor thing and passed without notice if shed been left quiet as was always intended im afraid now unless shes well managed shed end her life in the ballinasloe asylum  the attorney made no answer to this although barry paused to allow him to do so daly was too sharp and knew his employers character too well to believe all he said and he now began to fancy that he saw what the affectionate brother was after well daly continued barry after a minutes pause after the old man died we went on quiet enough for some time i was up in dublin mostly about that confounded loan and poor anty was left here by herself and what should she do but take up with a low huxters family in the town here  thats bad said the attorney was there an unmarried young man among them at all  faith there was so as great a blackguard as there is in connaught  and miss lynch is going to marry him  thats just it daly thats what we must prevent you know for the sake of the family i couldnt let it go on then poor creature shed be plundered and illtreatedshed be a downright idiot in no time and you know daly the propertyd go to the devil and whered i be then  daly couldnt help thinking that in all probability his kind host would not be long in following the property but he did not say so he merely asked the name of the blackguard whom miss anty meant to marry  wait till i tell you the whole of it the first thing i heard was that anty had made a low ruffian named moylan her agent  i know him she couldnt have done much worse well  she made him her agent without speaking to me or telling me a word about it and i couldnt make out what had put it into her head till i heard that this old rogue was a kind of cousin to some people living here named kelly  what the widow that keeps the inn  the very same confound her for an impertinent scheming old hag as she is well thats the house that anty was always going to drinking tea with the daughters and walking with the sonan infernal young farmer that lives with them the worst of the whole set  what martin kellytheres worse fellows than him mr lynch  ill be hanged if i know them then but if there are i dont choose my poor sisteronly one remove from an idiot and hardly thatto be carried off from her mothers house and married to such a fellow as that why its all the same infernal plot its the same people that got the old man to sign the will when he was past his senses  begad they must have been clever to do that how the deuce could they have got the will drawn  i tell you they did do it answered barry whose courage was now somewhat raised by the whiskey thats neither here nor there but they did it and when the old fool was dead they got this moylan made antys agent and then the hag of a mother comes up here before daylight and bribes the servant and carries her off down to her filthy den which she calls an inn and when i call to see my sister i get nothing but insolence and abuse  and when did this happen when did miss lynch leave the house  yesterday morning about four oclock  she went down of her own accord though  dl a bit the old hag came up here and filched her out of her bed  but she couldnt have taken your sister away unless she had wished to go  of course she wished it but a silly creature like her cant be let to do all she wishes she wishes to get a husband and doesnt care what sort of a one she gets but you dont suppose an old maidforty years old who has always been too stupid and foolish ever to be seen or spoken to should be allowed to throw away four hundred ayear on the first robber that tries to cheat her you dont mean to say there isnt a law to prevent that  i dont know how youll prevent it mr lynch shes her own mistress  what the dl do you mean to say theres nothing to prevent an idiot like that from marrying  if she was an idiot but i think youll find your sister has sense enough to marry whom she pleases  i tell you she is an idiot not raving mind but everybody knows she was never fit to manage anything  whod prove it  why i would divil a doubt of it i could prove that she never could all her life  ah my dear sir you couldnt do it nor could i advise you to trythat is unless there were plenty more who could swear positively that she was out of her mind would the servants swear that could you yourself now positively swear that she was out of her mind  whyshe never had any mind to be out of  unless you are very sure she is and for a considerable time back has been a confirmed lunatic youd be very wrongvery illadvised i mean mr lynch to try that game at all things would come out which you wouldnt like and your motives would bewould be seen through at once the attorney was on the point of saying but he stopped himself and finished by the words called in question  and im to sit here then and see that young blackguard kelly run off with what ought to be my own and my sister into the bargain im blessed if i do if you cant put me in the way of stopping it ill find those that can  youre getting too much in a hurry mr lynch is your sister at the inn now  to be sure she is  and she is engaged to this young man  she is  why then she might be married to him tomorrow for anything you know  she might if he was here but they tell me hes away in dublin  if they told you so today they told you wrong he came into dunmore from tuam on the same car with myself this very afternoon  what martin kelly then hell be off with her this night while were sitting here and barry jumped up as if to rush out and prevent the immediate consummation of his worst fears  stop a moment mr lynch said the more prudent and more sober lawyer if they were off you couldnt follow them and if you did follow and find them you couldnt prevent their being married if such were their wish and they had a priest ready to do it take my advice remain quiet where you are and lets talk the matter over as for taking out a commission de lunatico as we call it youll find you couldnt do it miss lynch may be a little weak or so in the upper story but shes not a lunatic and you couldnt make her so if you had half dunmore to back you because shed be brought before the commissioners herself and that you know would soon settle the question but you might still prevent the marriage for a time at any rateat least i think so and after that you must trust to the chapter of accidents  so help me thats all i want if i got her once up here again and was sure the thing was off for a month or so let me alone then for bringing her to reason  as daly watched his comrades reddening face and saw the malicious gleam of his eyes as he declared how easily hed manage the affair if poor anty was once more in the house his heart misgave him even though he was a sharp attorney at the idea of assisting such a cruel brute in his cruelty and for a moment he had determined to throw up the matter barry was so unprincipled and so wickedly malicious in his want of principle that he disgusted even daly but on second thoughts the lawyer remembered that if he didnt do the job another would and quieting his not very violent qualms of conscience with the idea that though employed by the brother he might also to a certain extent protect the sister he proceeded to give his advice as to the course which would be most likely to keep the property out of the hands of the kellys  he explained to barry that as anty had left her own home in company with martins mother and as she now was a guest at the widows it was unlikely that any immediate clandestine marriage should be resorted to that their most likely course would be to brazen the matter out and have the wedding solemnised without any secrecy and without any especial notice to him barry that on the next morning a legal notice should be prepared in tuam and served on the widow informing her that it was his intention to indict her for conspiracy in enticing away from her own home his sister anty for the purpose of obtaining possession of her property she being of weak mind and not able properly to manage her own affairs that a copy of this notice should also be sent to martin warning him that he would be included in the indictment if he took any proceedings with regard to miss lynch and that a further copy should if possible be put into the hands of miss lynch herself  you may be sure thatll frighten them continued daly and then you know when we see what sort of fight they make well be able to judge whether we ought to go on and prosecute or not i think the widowll be very shy of meddling when she finds youre in earnest and you see mr lynch he went on dropping his voice if you do go into court as i dont think you will youll go with clean hands as you ought to do nobody can say anything against you for trying to prevent your sister from marrying a man so much younger than herself and so much inferior in station and fortune you wont seem to gain anything by it and thats everything with a jury and then you know if it comes out that miss lynchs mind is rather touched its an additional reason why you should protect her from intriguing and interested schemers dont you see  barry did see or fancied he saw that he had now got the kellys in a dead fix and anty back into his own hands again and his selfconfidence having been fully roused by his potations he was tolerably happy and talked very loudly of the manner in which he would punish those lowbred huxters who had presumed to interfere with him in the management of his family  towards the latter end of the evening he became even more confidential and showed the cloven foot if possible more undisguisedly than he had hitherto done he spoke of the impossibility of allowing four hundred a year to be carried off from him and suggested to daly that his sister would soon drop offthat there would then be a nice thing left and that he daly should have the agency and if he pleased the use of dunmore house as for himself he had no idea of mewing himself up in such a hole as that but before he went hed take care to drive that villain moylan out of the place the cursed villany of those kellys to go and palm such a robber as that off on his sister by way of an agent  to all this daly paid but little attention for he saw that his host was drunk but when moylans name was mentioned he began to think that it might be as well either to include him in the threatened indictment or else which would be better still to buy him over to their side as they might probably learn from him what martins plans really were barry was however too tipsy to pay much attention to this or to understand any deeplaid plans so the two retired to their beds barry determined as he declared to the attorney in his drunken friendship to have it out of anty when he caught her and daly promising to go to tuam early in the morning have the notices prepared and served and come back in the evening to dine and sleep and have if possible an interview with mr moylan as he undressed he reflected that during his short professional career he had been thrown into the society of many unmitigated rogues of every description but that his new friend barry lynch though he might not equal them in energy of villany and courage to do serious evil beat them all hollow in selfishness and utter brutal want of feeling conscience and principle     x  dot blakes advice   in hour or two after martin kelly had left porto bello in the ballinasloe flyboat our other hero lord ballindine and his friend dot blake started from morrisons hotel with post horses for handicap lodge and as they travelled in blakes very comfortable barouche they reached their destination in time for a late dinner without either adventure or discomfort here they remained for some days fully occupied with the education of their horses the attention necessary to the engagements for which they were to run and with their bettingbooks  lord ballindines horse brien boru was destined to give the saxons a dressing at epsom and put no one knows how many thousands into his owners hands by winning the derby and arrangements had already been made for sending him over to john scott the english trainer at an expense which if the horse should by chance fail to be successful would be of very serious consequence to his lordship but lord ballindine had made up his mind or rather blake had made it up for him and the thing was to be done the risk was to be run and the preparationsthe sweats and the gallops the physicking feeding and coddling kept frank tolerably well employed though the whole process would have gone on quite as well had he been absent  it was not so however with dot blake the turf to him was not an expensive pleasure but a very serious business and one which to give him his due he well understood he himself regulated the work both of his horses and his men and saw that both did what was allotted to them he took very good care that he was never charged a guinea where a guinea was not necessary and that he got a guineas worth for every guinea he laid out in fact he trained his own horses and was thus able to assure himself that his interests were never made subservient to those of others who kept horses in the same stables dot was in his glory and in his element on the curragh and he was never quite happy anywhere else  this however was not the case with his companion for a couple of days the excitement attending brien boru was sufficient to fill lord ballindines mind but after that he could not help recurring to other things he was much in want of money and had been civilly told by his agents managing clerk before he left town that there was some difficulty in the way of his immediately getting the sum required this annoyed him for he could not carry on the game without money and then again he was unhappy to be so near fanny wyndham from day to day without seeing her he was truly and earnestly attached to her and miserable at the threat which had been all but made by her guardian that the match should be broken off  it was true that he had made up his mind not to go to grey abbey as long as he remained at handicap lodge and having made the resolution he thought he was wise in keeping it but still he continually felt that she must be aware that he was in the neighbourhood and could not but be hurt at his apparent indifference and then he knew that her guardian would make use of his present employmenthis sojourn at such a den of sporting characters as his friend blakes habitationand his continued absence from grey abbey though known to be in its vicinity as additional arguments for inducing his ward to declare the engagement at an end  these troubles annoyed him and though he daily stood by and saw brien boru go through his manoeuvres he was discontented and fidgety  he had been at handicap lodge about a fortnight and was beginning to feel anything but happy his horse was to go over in another week money was not plentiful with him and tradesmen were becoming obdurate and persevering his host blake was not a soothing or a comfortable friend under these circumstances he gave him a good deal of practical advice but he could not sympathise with him blake was a sharp hard sensible man who reduced everything to pounds shillings and pence lord ballindine was a man of feeling and for the time at least a man of pleasure and though they were or thought themselves friends they did not pull well together in fact they bored each other terribly  one morning lord ballindine was riding out from the trainingground when he met if not an old at any rate an intimate acquaintance named tierney mr or as he was commonly called mat tierney was a bachelor about sixty years of age who usually inhabited a lodge near the curragh and who kept a horse or two on the turf more for the sake of the standing which it gave him in the society he liked best than from any intense love of the sport he was a fat jolly fellow always laughing and usually in a good humour he was very fond of what he considered the world and the world at least that part of it which knew him returned the compliment  well my lord said he after a few minutes of gotup enthusiasm respecting brien boru i congratulate you sincerely  what about said lord ballindine  why i find youve got a firstrate horse and i hear youve got rid of a firstrate lady youre very lucky no doubt in both but i think fortune has stood to you most in the latter  lord ballindine was petrified he did not know what to reply he was aware that his engagement with miss wyndham was so public that tierney could allude to no other lady but he could not conceive how any one could have heard that his intended marriage was broken offat any rate how he could have heard it spoken of so publicly as to induce him to mention it in that sort of way to himself his first impulse was to be very indignant but he felt that no one would dream of quarrelling with mat tierney so he said as soon as he was able to collect his thoughts sufficiently  i was not aware of the second piece of luck mr tierney pray who is the lady  why miss wyndham said mat himself a little astonished at lord ballindines tone  im sure mr tierney said frank you would say nothing particularly in connection with a ladys name which you intended either to be impertinent or injurious were it not that i am quite certain of this i must own that what you have just said would appear to be both  my dear lord said the other surprised and grieved i beg ten thousand pardons if i have unintentionally said anything which you feel to be either but surely if i am not wrong in asking the match between you and miss wyndham is broken off  may i ask you mr tierney who told you so  certainlylord kilcullen and as he is miss wyndhams cousin and lord cashels son i could not but think the report authentic  this overset frank still more thoroughly lord kilcullen would never have spread the report publicly unless he had been authorised to do so by lord cashel frank and lord kilcullen had never been intimate and the former was aware that the other had always been averse to the proposed marriage but still he would never have openly declared that the marriage was broken off had he not had some authority for saying so  as you seem somewhat surprised continued mat seeing that lord ballindine remained silent and apparently at a loss for what he ought to say perhaps i ought to tell you that lord kilcullen mentioned it last night very publiclyat a dinnerparty as an absolute fact indeed from his manner i thought he wished it to be generally made known i presumed therefore that it had been mutually agreed between you that the event was not to come offthat the match was not to be run and with my peculiar views you know on the subject of matrimony i thought it a fair point for congratulation if lord kilcullen had misled me i heartily beg to apologise and at the same time by giving you my authority to show you that i could not intend anything impertinent if it suits you you are quite at liberty to tell lord kilcullen all i have told you and if you wish me to contradict the report which i must own i have spread i will do so  frank felt that he could not be angry with mat tierney he therefore thanked him for his open explanation and merely muttering something about private affairs not being worthy of public interest rode off towards handicap lodge  it appeared very plain to him that the grey abbey family must have discarded himthat fanny wyndham lord and lady cashel and the whole set must have made up their minds to drop him altogether otherwise one of the family would not have openly declared the match at an end and yet he was at a loss to conceive how they could have done sohow even lord cashel could have reconciled it to himself to do so without the commonplace courtesy of writing to him on the subject and then when he thought of her his own fanny as he had so often called her he was still more bewildered she with whom he had sat for so many sweet hours talking of the impossibility of their ever forgetting deserting or even slighting each other she who had been so entirely devoted to himso much more than engaged to himcould she have lent her name to such a heartless mode of breaking her faith  if i had merely proposed for her through her guardian thought frank to himselfif i had got lord cashel to make the engagement as many men do i should not be surprised but after all that has passed between usafter all her vows and all her and then lord ballindine struck his horse with his heel and made a cut at the air with his whip as he remembered certain passages more binding even than promises warmer even than vows which seemed to make him as miserable now as they had made him happy at the time of their occurrence i would not believe it he continued meditating if twenty kilcullens said it or if fifty mat tierneys swore to it and then he rode on towards the lodge in a state of mind for which i am quite unable to account if his disbelief in fanny wyndhams constancy was really as strong as he had declared it to be and as he rode many unusual thoughtsfor hitherto frank had not been a very deepthinking mancrowded his mind as to the baseness falsehood and iniquity of the human race especially of rich cautious old peers who had beautiful wards in their power  by the time he had reached the lodge he had determined that he must now do something and that as he was quite unable to come to any satisfactory conclusion on his own unassisted judgment he must consult blake who by the bye was nearly as sick of fanny wyndham as he would have been had he himself been the person engaged to marry her  as he rode round to the yard he saw his friend standing at the door of one of the stables with a cigar in his mouth  well frank how does brien go today not that hell ever be the thing till he gets to the other side of the water theyll never be able to bring a horse out as he should be on the curragh till theyve regular trained gallops the slightest frost in spring or sun in summer and the grounds so hard you might as well gallop your horse down the pavement of grafton street  confound the horse answered frank come here dot a minute i want to speak to you  what the dls the matterhes not lame is he  whowhatbrien boru not that i know of i wish the brute had never been foaled  and why so what crotchet have you got in your head now something wrong about fanny i suppose  why did you hear anything  nothing but what youve told me  ive just seen mat tierney and he told me that kilcullen had declared at a large dinnerparty yesterday that the match between me and his cousin was finally broken off  you wouldnt believe what mat tierney would say mat was only taking a rise out of you  not at all he was not only speaking seriously but he told me what im very sure was the truth as far as lord kilcullen was concerned i mean im sure kilcullen said it and in the most public manner he could and now the question is what had i better do  theres no doubt as to what youd better do the question is what youd rather do  but what had i better do call on kilcullen for an explanation  thats the last thing to think of no but declare what he reports to be the truth return miss wyndham the lock of hair you have in your desk and next your heart or wherever you keep it write her a pretty note and conclude by saying that the adriatics free to wed another thats what i should do  its very odd blake that you wont speak seriously to a man for a moment youve as much heart in you as one of your own horses i wish id never come to this cursed lodge of yours id be all right then  as for my heart frank if i have as much as my horses i ought to be contentedfor racehorses are usually considered to have a good deal as for my cursed lodge i can assure you i have endeavoured and if you will allow me i will still endeavour to make it as agreeable to you as i am able and as to my speaking seriously upon my word i never spoke more so you asked me what i thought you had better doand i began by telling you there would be a great difference between that and what youd rather do  but in heavens name why would you have me break off with miss wyndham when every one knows im engaged to her and when you know that i wish to marry her  firstly to prevent her breaking off with youthough i fear theres hardly time for that and secondly in consequenceas the newspapers say of incompatibility of temper  why you dont even know her  but i know you and i know what your joint income would be and i know that there would be great incompatibility between you as lord ballindine with a wife and familyand fifteen hundred a year or so but mind im only telling you what i think youd better do  well i shant do that if i was once settled down i could live as well on fifteen hundred a year as any country gentleman in ireland its only the interference of lord cashel that makes me determined not to pull in till i am married if he had let me have my own way i shouldnt by this time have had a horse in the world except one or two hunters or so down in the country  well frank if youre determined to get yourself married ill give you the best advice in my power as to the means of doing it isnt that what you want  i want to know what you think i ought to do just at this minute  with matrimony as the winningpost  you know i wish to marry fanny wyndham  and the sooner the betteris that it  of course shell be of age now in a few days replied lord ballindine  then i advise you to order a new blue coat and to buy a weddingring  confusion cried frank stamping his foot and turning away in a passion and then he took up his hat to rush out of the room in which the latter part of the conversation had taken place  stop a minute frank said blake and dont be in a passion what i said was only meant to show you how easy i think it is for you to marry miss wyndham if you choose  easy and every soul at grey abbey turned against me in consequence of my owning that brute of a horse ill go over there at once and ill show lord cashel that at any rate he shall not treat me like a child as for kilcullen if he interferes with me or my name in any way ill  youll whatthrash him  indeed id like nothing better  and then shoot himbe tried by your peersand perhaps hung is that it  oh thats nonsense i dont wish to fight any one but i am not going to be insulted  i dont think you are i dont think theres the least chance of kilcullen insulting you he has too much worldly wisdom but to come back to miss wyndham if you really mean to marry her and if as i believe she is really fond of you lord cashel and all the family cant prevent it she is probably angry that you have not been over there he is probably irate at your staying here and not unlikely has made use of her own anger to make her think that she has quarrelled with you and hence kilcullens report  and what shall i do now  nothing today but eat your dinner and drink your wine ride over tomorrow see lord cashel and tell himbut do it quite coolly if you canexactly what you have heard and how you have heard it and beg him to assure lord kilcullen that he is mistaken in his notion that the match is off and beg also that the report may not be repeated do this and do it as if you were lord cashels equal not as if you were his son or his servant if you are collected and steady with him for ten minutes youll soon find that he will become bothered and unsteady  thats very easy to say here but its not so easy to do there you dont know him as i do hes so sedate and so slow and so dullespecially sitting alone as he does of a morning in that large dingy uncomfortable dustylooking bookroom of his he measures his words like senna and salts and their tone is as disagreeable  then do you drop out yours like prussic acid and youll beat him at his own game those are all externals my dear fellow when a man knows he has nothing within his head to trust towhen he has neither sense nor genius he puts on a wig ties up his neck in a white choker sits in a big chair and frightens the world with his silence remember if you were not a baby he would not be a bugbear  and should i not ask to see fanny  by all means dont leave grey abbey without seeing and making your peace with miss wyndham thatll be easy with you because its your métier i own that with myself it would be the most difficult part of the mornings work but dont ask to see her as a favour when youve done with the lord and dont let your conference be very longwhen youve done with the lord tell him youll say a word to the lady and whatever may have been his predetermination youll find that if youre cool hell be bothered and he wont know how to refuse and if he doesnt prevent you im sure miss wyndham wont  and if he asks about these wretched horses of mine  dont let him talk more about your affairs than you can help but if he presses youand he wont if you play your game welltell him that youre quite aware your income wont allow you to keep up an establishment at the curragh after youre married  but about brien boru and the derby  brien boru you might as well talk to him about your washingbills dont go into particularsstick to generals hell never ask you those questions unless he sees you shiver and shake like a halfwhipped schoolboy  after a great deal of confabulation in which dot blake often repeated his opinion of lord ballindines folly in not rejoicing at an opportunity of breaking off the match it was determined that frank should ride over the next morning and do exactly what his friend proposed if however one might judge from his apparent dread of the interview with lord cashel there was but little chance of his conducting it with the coolness or assurance insisted on by dot the probability was that when the time did come he would as blake said shiver and shake like a halfwhipped schoolboy  and what will you do when youre married frank said blake for im beginning to think the symptoms are strong and youll hardly get out of it now  do why i suppose ill do much the same as othershave two children and live happy ever afterwards  i dare say youre right about the two children only you might say two dozen but as to the living happy thats more problematical what do you mean to eat and drink  eggspotatoes and baconbuttermilk and potheen 21 its odd if i cant get plenty of them in mayo if ive nothing better       footnote 21 pootheenillegal untaxed whiskey moonshine  i suppose you will frank but bacon wont go down well after venison and a course of claret is a bad preparative for potheen punch youre not the man to live with a family on a small income and what the dl youll do i dont know youll fortify kellys courtthatll be the first step  is it against the repealers  faith no youll join them of course but against the subsheriff and his officersan army much more likely to crown their enterprises with success  you seem to forget dot that after all im marrying a girl with quite as large a fortune as i had any right to expect  the limit to your expectations was only in your own modesty the less you had a rightin the common parlanceto expect the more you wanted and the more you ought to have looked for say that miss wyndhams fortune clears a thousand a year of your property you would never be able to get along on what youd have no ill tell you what youll do youll shut up kellys court raise the rents take a moderate house in london and lord cashel when his party are in will get you made a court stick of and youll lead just such a life as your grandfather if its not very glorious at any rate its a useful kind of life i hope miss wyndham will like it youll have to christen your children ernest and albert and that sort of thing thats the worst of it and youll never be let to sit down and thats a bore but youve strong legs it would never do for me i could never stand out a long tragedy in drury lane with my neck in a stiff white choker and my toes screwed into tight dress boots id sooner be a porter myself for he can go to bed when the days over  youre very witty dot but you know im the last man in ireland not excepting yourself to put up with that kind of thing whatever i may have to live on i shall live in my own country and on my own property  very well if you wont be a gold stick theres the other alternative fortify kellys court and prepare for the sheriffs officers of the two theres certainly more fun in it and you can go out with the harriers on a sunday afternoon and live like a raal okelly of the ould timesonly the punchll kill you in about ten years  go on dot go on you want to provoke me but you wont i wonder whether youd bear it as well if i told you youd die a brokendown blackleg without a friend or a shilling to bless you  i dont think i should because i should know that you were threatening me with a fate which my conduct and line of life would not warrant any one in expecting  upon my word then i think theres quite as much chance of that as there is of my getting shut up by bailiffs in kellys court and dying drunk ill bet you fifty pounds ive a better account at my bankers than you have in ten years  faith ill not take it itll be hard work getting fifty pounds out of you then in the meantime come and play a game of billiards before dinner  to this lord ballindine consented and they adjourned to the billiardroom but before they commenced playing blake declared that if the names of lord cashel or miss wyndham were mentioned again that evening he should retreat to his own room and spend the hours by himself so for the rest of that day lord ballindine was again driven back upon brien boru and the derby for conversation as dot was too close about his own stable to talk much of his own horses and their performances except when he was doing so with an eye to business     xi  the earl of cashel   about two oclock on the following morning lord ballindine set off for grey abbey on horseback dressed with something more than ordinary care and with a considerable palpitation about his heart he hardly knew himself what or whom he feared but he knew that he was afraid of something he had a cold sinking sensation within him and he felt absolutely certain that he should be signally defeated in his present mission he had plenty of what is usually called courage had his friend recommended him instantly to call out lord kilcullen and shoot him and afterwards any number of other young men who might express a thought in opposition to his claim on miss wyndhams hand he would have set about it with the greatest readiness and aptitude but he knew he could not baffle the appalling solemnity of lord cashel in his own study frank was not so very weak a man as he would appear to be when in the society of blake he unfortunately allowed blake to think for him in many things and he found a convenience in having some one to tell him what to do but he was in most respects a better and in some even a wiser man than his friend he often felt that the kind of life he was leadingcontracting debts which he could not pay and spending his time in pursuits which were not really congenial to him was unsatisfactory and discreditable and it was this very feeling and the inability to defend that which he knew to be wrong and foolish which made him so certain that he would not be able successfully to persist in his claim to miss wyndhams hand in opposition to the trite and wellweighed objections which he knew her guardian would put forward he consoled himself however with thinking that at any rate they could not prevent his seeing her and he was quite sanguine as to her forgiveness if he but got a fair opportunity of asking it and when that was obtained why should the care for any one fanny would be of age and her own mistress in a few days and all the solemn earls in england and ireland too could not then prevent her marrying whom and when she liked  he thought a great deal on all his friend had said to his future poverty but then his ideas and blakes were very different about life blakes idea of happiness was the concentrating of every thing into a focus for his own enjoyment whereas he frank had only had recourse to dissipation and extravagance because he had nothing to make home pleasant to him if he once had fanny wyndham installed as lady ballindine at kellys court he was sure he could do his duty as a country gentleman and live on his income be it what it might not only without grumbling but without wishing for anything more he was fond of his country his name and his countrymen he was fully convinced of his folly in buying racehorses and in allowing himself to be dragged on the turf he would sell brien boru and the other two irish chieftains for what they would fetch and show fanny and her guardian that he was in earnest in his intention of reforming blake might laugh at him if he liked but he would not stay to be laughed at he felt that handicap lodge was no place for him and besides why should he bear dots disagreeable sarcasms it was not the part of a real friend to say such cutting things as he continually did after all lord cashel would be a safer friend or at any rate adviser and instead of trying to defeat him by coolness or insolence he would at once tell him of all his intentions explain to him exactly how matters stood and prove his good resolutions by offering to take whatever steps the earl might recommend about the horses this final determination made him easier in this mind and as he entered the gates of grey abbey park he was tolerably comfortable trusting to his own good resolutions and the effect which he felt certain the expression of them must have on lord cashel  grey abbey is one of the largest but by no means one of the most picturesque demesnes in ireland it is situated in the county of kildare about two miles from the little town of kilcullen in a flat uninteresting and not very fertile country the park itself is extensive and tolerably well wooded but it wants water and undulation and is deficient of any object of attraction except that of size and not very magnificent timber i suppose years ago there was an abbey here or near the spot but there is now no vestige of it remaining in a corner of the demesne there are standing the remains of one of those strong square ugly castles which two centuries since were the real habitations of the landed proprietors of the country and many of which have been inhabited even to a much later date they now afford the strongest record of the apparently miserable state of life which even the favoured of the land then endured and of the numberless domestic comforts which years and skill have given us apt as we are to look back with fond regret to the happy bygone days of past periods  this old castle now used as a cowshed is the only record of antiquity at grey abbey and yet the ancient family of the greys have lived there for centuries the first of them who possessed property in ireland obtained in the reign of henry ii grants of immense tracts of land stretching through wicklow kildare and the queens and kings counties and although his descendants have been unable to retain through the various successive convulsions which have taken place in the interior of ireland since that time anything like an eighth of what the family once pretended to claim the earl of cashel their present representative has enough left to enable him to consider himself a very great man  the present mansion built on the site of that in which the family had lived till about seventy years since is like the grounds large commodious and uninteresting it is built of stone which appears as if it had been plastered over is three stories high and the windows are all of the same size and at regular intervals the body of the house looks like a huge square dutch old lady and the two wings might be taken for her two equally fat square dutch daughters inside the furniture is good strong and plain there are plenty of drawingrooms sittingrooms bedrooms and offices a small gallery of very indifferent paintings and a kitchen with an excellent kitchenrange and patent boilers of every shape  considering the nature of the attractions it is somewhat strange that lord cashel should have considered it necessary to make it generally known that the park might be seen any day between the hours of nine and six and the house on tuesdays and fridays between the hours of eleven and four yet such is the case and the strangeness of this proceeding on his part is a good deal diminished by the fact that persons either induced by lord cashels good nature or thinking that any big house must be worth seeing very frequently pay halfacrown to the housekeeper for the privilege of being dragged through every room in the mansion  there is a bed there in which the regent slept when in ireland and a room which was tenanted by lord normanby when lord lieutenant there is moreover a satin counterpane which was made by the lords aunt and a snuffbox which was given to the lords grandfather by frederick the great these are the lions of the place and the gratification experienced by those who see them is no doubt great but i doubt if it equals the annoyance and misery to which they are subjected in being obliged to pass one unopened doorthat of the private room of lady selina the only daughter of the earl at present unmarried  it contains only a bed and the usual instruments of a ladys toilet but lady selina does not choose to have it shown and it has become invested in the eyes of the visitors with no ordinary mystery many a petitionary whisper is addressed to the housekeeper on the subject but in vain and consequently the public too often leave grey abbey dissatisfied  as lord ballindine rode through the gates and up the long approach to the house he was so satisfied of the wisdom of his own final resolution and of the successful termination of his embassy under such circumstances that he felt relieved of the uncomfortable sensation of fear which had oppressed him and it was only when the sixfoot high powdered servant told him with a very solemn face that the earl was alone in the bookroomthe odious room he hated so muchthat he began again to feel a little misgiving however there was nothing left for him now so he gave up his horse to the groom and followed the soberfaced servant into the bookroom  lord cashel was a man about sixtythree with considerable external dignity of appearance though without any personal advantage either in face figure or manner he had been an earl with a large income for thirty years and in that time he had learned to look collected even when his ideas were confused to keep his eye steady and to make a few words go a long way he had never been intemperate and was therefore strong and hale for his yearshe had not done many glaringly foolish things and therefore had a character for wisdom and judgment he had run away with no mans wife and since his marriage had seduced no mans daughter he was therefore considered a moral man he was not so deeply in debt as to have his affairs known to every one and hence was thought prudent and as he lived in his own house with his own wife paid his servants and labourers their wages regularly and nodded in church for two hours every sunday he was thought a good man such were his virtues and by these negative qualitiesthis vis inertiæ he had acquired and maintained a considerable influence in the country  when lord ballindines name was announced he slowly rose and just touching the tip of franks fingers by way of shaking hands with him hoped he had the pleasure of seeing him well  the viscount hoped the same of the earland of the ladies this included the countess and lady selina as well as fanny and was therefore not a particular question but having hoped this and the earl remaining silent he got confused turned red hummed and hawed a little sat down and then endeavouring to drown his confusion in volubility began talking quickly about his anxiety to make final arrangements concerning matters which of course he had most deeply at heart and at last ran himself fairly aground from not knowing whether under the present circumstances he ought to speak of his affianced to her guardian as fanny or miss wyndham  when he had quite done and was dead silent and had paused sufficiently long to assure the earl that he was going to say nothing further just at present the great man commenced his answer  this is a painful subject my lordmost peculiarly painful at the present time but surely after all that has passedbut especially after what has not passedlord cashel thought this was a dead hityou cannot consider your engagement with miss wyndham to be still in force  good graciousand why not my lord i am ready to do anything her friendsin fact i came solely this morning to consult yourself aboutim sure fanny herself cant conceive the engagement to be broken off of course if miss wyndham wishes itbut i cant believei cant believeif its about the horses lord cashel upon my word im ready to sell them today  this was not very dignified in poor frank and to tell the truth he was completely bothered lord cashel looked so more than ordinarily glum had he been going to put on a black cap and pass sentence of death or disinherit his eldest son he could not have looked more stern or more important franks lack of dignity added to his and made him feel immeasurably superior to any little difficulty which another person might have felt in making the communication he was going to make he was really quite in a solemn good humour lord ballindines confusion was so flattering  i can assure you my lord miss wyndham calls for no such sacrifice nor do i there was a time when as her guardian i ventured to hintand i own i was taking a liberty a fruitless liberty in doing sothat i thought your remaining on the turf was hardly prudent but i can assure you with all kindly feelingwith no approach to animositythat i will not offend in a similar way again i hear by mere rumour that you have extended your operations to the other kingdom i hope i have not been the means of inducing you to do so but advice if not complied with often gives a bias in an opposite direction with regard to miss wyndham i must expressand i really had thought it was unnecessary to do so though it was certainly my intention as it was miss wyndhams wish that i should have written to you formally on the subjectbut your own conductexcuse me lord ballindineyour own evident indifference and continued i fear i must call it dissipationand your as i considered unfortunate selection of acquaintance combined with the necessary diminution of that attachment which i presume miss wyndham once felt for younecessary inasmuch as it was as far as i understand never of a sufficiently ardent nature to outlive the slightsindeed my lord i dont wish to offend you or hurt your feelingsbut i must say the slights which it encountered here the earl felt that his sentence was a little confused but the viscount looked more so and therefore not at all abashed by the want of a finish to his original proposition he continued glibly enough  in short in considering all the features of the case i thought the proposed marriage a most imprudent one and on questioning miss wyndham as to her feelings i was i must own gratified to learn that she agreed with me indeed she conceived that your conduct gave ample proof my lord of your readiness to be absolved from your engagement pardon me a moment my lordas i said before i still deemed it incumbent on me and on my ward that i as her guardian should give you an absolute and written explanation of her feelingsthat would have been done yesterday and this most unpleasant meeting would have been spared to both of us but for the unexpecteddid you hear of the occurrence which has happened in miss wyndhams family my lord  occurrence no lord cashel i did not hear of any especial occurrence  there had been a peculiarly solemn air about lord cashel during the whole of the interview which deepened into quite funereal gloom as he asked the last question but he was so uniformly solemn that this had not struck lord ballindine besides an appearance of solemnity agreed so well with lord cashels cast of features and tone of voice that a visage more lengthened and a speech somewhat slower than usual served only to show him off as so much the more clearly identified by his own characteristics thus a man who always wears a green coat does not become remarkable by a new green coat he is only so much the more than ever the man in the green coat  lord ballindine therefore answered the question without the appearance of that surprise which lord cashel expected he would feel if he had really not yet heard of the occurrence about to be related to him the earl therefore made up his mind as indeed he had nearly done before that frank knew well what was going to be told him though it suited his purpose to conceal his knowledge he could not however give his young brother nobleman the lie and he was therefore constrained to tell his tale as if to one to whom it was unknown he was determined however though he could not speak out plainly to let frank see that he was not deceived by his hypocrisy and that he lord cashel was well aware not only that the event about to be told had been known at handicap lodge but that the viscounts present visit to grey abbey had arisen out of that knowledge  lord ballindine up to this moment was perfectly ignorant of this event and it is only doing justice to him to say that had he heard of it it would at least have induced him to postpone his visit for some time lord cashel paused for a few moments looking at frank in a most diplomatic manner and then proceeded to unfold his budget  i am much surprised that you should not have heard of it the distressing news reached grey abbey yesterday and must have been well known in different circles in dublin yesterday morning considering the great intercourse between dublin and the curragh i wonder you can have been left so long in ignorance of a circumstance so likely to be widely discussed and which at one time might have so strongly affected your own interests lord cashel again paused and looked hard at frank he flattered himself that he was reading his thoughts but he looked as if he had detected a spot on the others collar and wanted to see whether it was ink or soot  lord ballindine was however confounded when the earl spoke of a circumstance so likely to be widely discussed mat tierneys conversation recurred to him and lord kilcullens public declaration that fanny wyndhams match was offit was certainly odd for lord cashel to call this an occurrence in miss wyndhams family but then he had a roundabout way of saying everything  i say continued the earl after a short pause that i cannot but be surprised that an event of so much importance of so painful a nature and doubtless already so publicly known should not before this have reached the ears of one to whom i presume miss wyndhams name was not always wholly indifferent but as you have not heard it my lord i will communicate it to you and again he paused as though expecting another assurance of lord ballindines ignorance  why my lord said frank i did hear a rumour which surprised me very much but i could not suppose it to be true to tell the truth it was very much in consequence of what i heard that i came to grey abbey today  it was now lord cashels turn to be confounded first to deny that he had heard anything about itand then immediately to own that he had heard it and had been induced to renew his visits to grey abbey in consequence just what he in his wisdom had suspected was the case but how could lord ballindine have the face to own it  i must however tell the reader the event of which frank was ignorant and which it appears lord cashel is determined not to communicate to him  fanny wyndhams father had held a governorship or some golden appointment in the golden days of india and consequently had died rich he left eighty thousand pounds to his son who was younger than fanny and twenty to his daughter his son had lately been put into the guards but he was not long spared to enjoy his sword and his uniform he died and his death had put his sister in possession of his money and lord cashel thought that though frank might slight twenty thousand pounds he would be too glad to be allowed to remain the accepted admirer of a hundred thousand  i thought you must have heard it my lord resumed the senior as soon as he had collected his shreds of dignity which franks open avowal had somewhat scattered i felt certain you must have heard it and you will i am sure perceive that this is no time for youexcuse me if i use a word which may appear harshit is no time for any one not intimately connected with miss wyndham by ties of family to intrude upon her sorrow  frank was completely bothered he thought that if she were so sorrowful if she grieved so deeply at the match being broken off that was just the reason why he should see her after all it was rather flattering to himself to hear of her sorrows dear fanny was she so grieved that she was forced to part from him  but lord cashel he said i am ready to do whatever you please ill take any steps youll advise but i really cannot see why im to be told that the engagement between me and miss wyndham is off without hearing any reason from herself ill make any sacrifice you please or she requires im sure she was attached to me and she cannot have overcome that affection so soon  i have already said that we requiremiss wyndham requiresno sacrifice from you the time for sacrifice is past and i do not think her affection was of such a nature as will long prey on her spirits  my affection for her is i can assure you  pray excuse mebut i think this is hardly the time either to talk of or to show your affection had it been proved to be of a lasting i fear i must say a sincere nature it would now have been most valued i will leave yourself to say whether this was the case  and so you mean to say lord cashel that i cannot see miss wyndham  assuredly lord ballindine and i must own that i hardly appreciate your delicacy in asking to do so at the present moment  there was something very hard in this the match was to be broken off without any notice to him and when he requested at any rate to hear this decision from the mouth of the only person competent to make it he was told that it was indelicate for him to wish to do so this put his back up  well my lord he said with some spirit miss wyndham is at present your ward and in your house and i am obliged to postpone the exercise of the right to which at least i am entitled of hearing her decision from her own mouth i cannot think that she expects i should be satisfied with such an answer as i have now received i shall write to her this evening and shall expect at any rate the courtesy of an answer from herself  my advice to my ward will be not to write to you at any rate for the present i presume my lord you cannot doubt my word that miss wyndham chooses to be released from an engagement which i must say your own conduct renders it highly inexpedient for her to keep  i dont doubt your word of course lord cashel but such being the case i think miss wyndham might at least tell me so herself  i should have thought lord ballindine that you would have felt that the sudden news of a dearly loved brothers death was more than sufficient to excuse miss wyndham from undergoing an interview which even under ordinary circumstances would be of very doubtful expediency  her brothers death good gracious is harry wyndham dead  frank was so truly surprisedso effectually startled by the news which he now for the first time heard that had his companion possessed any real knowledge of human nature he would at once have seen that his astonishment was not affected but he had none and therefore went on blundering in his own pompous manner  yes my lord he is dead i understood you to say that you had already heard it and unless my ears deceived me you explained that his demise was the immediate cause of your present visit i cannot however go so far as to say that i think you have exercised a sound discretion in the matter in expressing such an opinion however i am far from wishing to utter anything which may be irritating or offensive to your feelings  upon my word then i never heard a word about it till this moment poor harry and is fanny much cut up  miss wyndham is much afflicted  i wouldnt for worlds annoy her or press on her at such a moment pray tell her lord cashel how deeply i feel her sorrows pray tell her this with my kindestbest compliments  this termination was very coldbut so was lord cashels face his lordship had also risen from his chair and frank saw it was intended that the interview should end but he would now have been glad to stay he wanted to ask a hundred questionshow the poor lad had died whether he had been long illwhether it had been expected but he saw that he must go so he rose and putting out his hand which lord cashel just touched he said  good bye my lord i trust after a few months are gone by you may see reason to alter the opinion you have expressed respecting your ward should i not hear from you before then i shall again do myself the honour of calling at grey abbey but i will write to miss wyndham before i do so  lord cashel had the honour of wishing lord ballindine a very good morning and of bowing him to the door and so the interview ended     xii  fanny wyndham   when lord cashel had seen frank over the mat which lay outside his study door and that there was a six foot servitor to open any other door through which he might have to pass he returned to his seat and drawing his chair close to the fire began to speculate on fanny and her discarded lover  he was very well satisfied with himself and with his own judgment and firmness in the late conversation it was very evident that frank had heard of harry wyndhams death and of fannys great accession of wealth that he had immediately determined that the heiress was no longer to be neglected and that he ought to strike while the iron was hot hence his visit to grey abbey his pretended ignorance of the young mans death when he found he could not see miss wyndham was a ruse but an old bird like lord cashel was not to be caught with chaff and then how indelicate of him to come and press his suit immediately after news of so distressing a nature had reached miss wyndham how very impolitic thought lord cashel to show such a hurry to take possession of the fortunehow completely he had destroyed his own game and then other thoughts passed through his mind his ward had now one hundred thousand pounds clear which was certainly a great deal of ready money lord cashel had no younger sons but his heir lord kilcullen was an expensive man and owed he did not exactly know and was always afraid to ask how much he must marry soon or he would be sure to go to the devil he had been living with actresses and operadancers quite long enough for his own respectability and if he ever intended to be such a pattern to the country as his father it was now time for him to settle down and lord cashel bethought himself that if he could persuade his son to marry fanny wyndham and pay his debts with her fortunesurely he couldnt owe more than a hundred thousand poundshe would be able to give them a very handsome allowance to live on  to do lord cashel justice we must say that he had fully determined that it was his duty to break off the match between frank and his ward before he heard of the accident which had so enriched her and fanny herself feeling slighted and neglectedknowing how near to her her lover was and that nevertheless he never came to see herhearing his name constantly mentioned in connection merely with horses and jockeyshad been induced to express her acquiescence in her guardians views and to throw poor frank overboard in all this the earl had been actuated by no mercenary views as far as his own immediate family was concerned he had truly and justly thought that lord ballindine with his limited fortune and dissipated habits was a bad match for his ward and he had consequently done his best to break the engagement there could therefore he thought be nothing unfair in his taking advantage of the prudence which he had exercised on her behalf he did not know when he was persuading her to renounce lord ballindine that at that moment her young rich and only brother was lying at the point of death he had not done it for his own sake or lord kilcullens there could therefore be nothing unjust or ungenerous in their turning to their own account the two losses that of her lover and her brother which had fallen on miss wyndham at the same time if he as her guardian would have been wrong to allow lord ballindine to squander her twenty thousands he would be so much the more wrong to let him make ducks and drakes of five times as much in this manner he quieted his conscience as to his premeditated absorption of his wards fortune it was true that lord kilcullen was a heartless roué whereas lord ballindine was only a thoughtless rake but then lord kilcullen would be an earl and a peer of parliament and lord ballindine was only an irish viscount it was true that in spite of her present anger fanny dearly loved lord ballindine and was dearly loved by him and that lord kilcullen was not a man to love or be loved but then the kellys court rentswhat were they to the grey abbey rents not a twentieth part of them and above all lord kilcullens vices were filtered through the cleansing medium of his fathers partiality and lord ballindines faults were magnified by the cautious scruples of fannys guardian  the old man settled therefore in his own mind that fanny should be his dear daughter and the only difficulty he expected to encounter was with his hopeful son it did not occur to him that fanny might object or that she could be other than pleased with the arrangement he determined however to wait a little before the tidings of her future destiny should be conveyed to her although no time was to be lost in talking over the matter with lord kilcullen in the meantime it would be necessary for him to tell fanny of lord ballindines visit and the wily peer was glad to think that she could not but be further disgusted at the hurry which her former lover had shown to renew his protestations of affection as soon as the tidings of her wealth had reached him however he would say nothing on that head he would merely tell her that lord ballindine had called had asked to see her and had been informed of her determination to see him no more  he sat for a considerable time musing over the fire and strengthening his resolution and then he stalked and strutted into the drawingroom where the ladies were sitting to make his communication to miss wyndham  miss wyndham and her cousin lady selina grey the only unmarried daughter left on the earls hands were together lady selina was not in her première jeunesse 22 and in manner face and disposition was something like her father she was not therefore very charming but his faults were softened down in her and what was pretence in him was to a certain degree real in her she had a most exaggerated conception of her own station and dignity and of what was due to her and expected from her because her rank enabled her to walk out of a room before other women she fancied herself better than them and entitled to be thought better she was plain redhaired and in no ways attractive but she had refused the offer of a respectable country gentleman because he was only a country gentleman and then flattered herself that she owned the continuance of her maiden condition to her high station which made her a fit match only for the most exalted magnates of the land but she was true industrious and charitable she worked hard to bring her acquirements to that pitch which she considered necessary to render her fit for her position she truly loved her family and tried hard to love her neighbours in which she might have succeeded but for the immeasurable height from which she looked down on them she listened complacently to all those serious cautions against pride which her religion taught her and considered that she was obeying its warnings when she spoke condescendingly to those around her she thought that condescension was humility and that her selfexaltation was not pride but a proper feeling of her own and her familys dignity       footnote 22 première jeunessefrench prime of youth  fanny wyndham was a very different creature she too was proud but her pride was of another if not of a less innocent cast she was proud of her own position but it was as fanny wyndham not as lord cashels niece or anybodys daughter she had been brought out in the fashionable world and liked and was liked by it but she felt that she owed the character which three years had given her to herself and not to those around her she stood as high as lady selina though on very different grounds any undue familiarity would have been quite as impossible with one as with the other lady selina chilled intruders to a distance fanny wyndhams light burned with so warm a flame that butterflies were afraid to trust their wings within its reach she was neither so well read nor so thoughtful on what she did read as her friend but she could turn what she learned to more account for the benefit of others the one in fact could please and the other could not  fanny wyndham was above the usual height but she did not look tall for her figure was wellformed and round and her bust full she had darkbrown hair which was never curled but worn in plain braids fastened at the back of her head together with the long rich folds which were collected there under a simple comb her forehead was high and beautifully formed and when she spoke showed the animation of her character her eyes were full and round of a hazel colour bright and soft when she was pleased but full of pride and displeasure when her temper was ruffled or her dignity offended her nose was slightly retroussé 23 but not so much so as to give to her that pertness of which it is usually the index the line of her cheeks and chin was very lovely it was this which encouraged her to comb back that luxuriant hair and which gave the greatest charm to her face her mouth was large too large for a beauty and therefore she was not a regular beauty but were she talking to you and willing to please you you could hardly wish it to be less i cannot describe the shade of her complexion but it was rich and glowing and though she was not a brunette i believe that in painting her portrait an artist would have mixed more brown than other colours       footnote 23 retrousséfrench turnedup  at the time of which i am now speaking she was sitting or rather lying on a sofa with her face turned towards her cousin but her eyes fixed on vacancy as might have been expected she was thinking of her brother and his sudden death but other subjects crowded with that into her mind and another figure shared with him her thoughts she had been induced to give her guardian an unqualified permission to reject in her name any further intercourse with frank and though she had doubtless been induced to do so by the distressing consciousness that she had been slighted by him she had cheated herself into the belief that prudence had induced her to do so she felt that she was not fitted to be a poor mans wife and that lord ballindine was as ill suited for matrimonial poverty she had therefore induced herself to give him up maybe she was afraid that if she delayed doing so she might herself be given up now however the case was altered though she sincerely grieved for her brother she could not but recollect the difference which his death made in her own position she was now a great heiress and were she to marry lord ballindine if she did not make him a rich man she would at any rate free him from all embarrassment  besides could she give him up now now that she was rich he would first hear of her brothers death and her wealth and then would immediately be told that she had resolved to reject him could she bear that she should be subjected to the construction which would fairly be put upon her conduct if she acted in this manner and then again she felt that she loved him and she did love him more dearly than she was herself aware she began to repent of her easy submission to her guardians advice and to think how she could best unsay what she had already said she had lost her brother could she afford also to lose her lover she had had none she could really love but those two and the tears again came to her eyes and lady selina saw her for the twentieth time that morning turn her face to the back of the sofa and heard her sob  lady selina was sitting at one of the windows over her carpetwork frame she had talked a great deal of sound sense to fanny that morning about her brother and now prepared to talk some more preparatory to this she threw back her long red curls from her face and wiped her red nose for it was february  fanny you should occupy yourself indeed you should my dear its no use your attempting your embroidery for your mind would still wander to him that is no more you should read indeed you should do go on with gibbon ill fetch it for you only tell me where you were  i could not read selina i could not think about what i read more than about the work  but you should try fannythe very attempt would be work to your mind besides you would be doing your duty could all your tears bring him back to you can all your sorrow again restore him to his friends no and you have great consolation fanny in reflecting that your remembrance of your brother is mixed with no alloy he had not lived to be contaminated by the heartless vices of that portion of the world into which he would probably have been thrown he had not become dissipatedextravagantand sensual this should be a great consolation to you  it might be thought that lady selina was making sarcastic allusions to her own brother and to fannys lover but she meant nothing of the kind her remarks were intended to be sensible true and consolatory and they at any rate did no harm for fanny was thinking of something else before she had half finished her speech  they had both again been silent for a short time when the door opened and in came the earl his usual pomposity of demeanour was somewhat softened by a lachrymose air which in respect to his wards grief he put on as he turned the handle of the door and he walked somewhat more gently than usual into the room  well fanny how are you now he said as he crept up to her you shouldnt brood over these sad thoughts your poor brother has gone to a better world we shall always think of him as one who had felt no sorrow and been guilty of but few faults he died before he had wasted his fortune and health as he might have donethis will always be a consolation  it was singular how nearly alike were the platitudes of the daughter and the father the young man had not injured his name or character in the world and had left his money behind him and therefore his death was less grievous  fanny did not answer but she sat upright on the sofa as he came up to herand he then sat down beside her  perhaps im wrong fanny to speak to you on other subjects so soon after the sad event of which we heard last night but on the whole i think it better to do so it is good for you to rouse yourself to exert yourself to think of other things besides it will be a comfort to you to know that i have already done what i am sure you strongly wished to have executed at once  it was not necessary for the guardian to say anything further to induce his ward to listen she knew that he was going to speak about lord ballindine and she was all attention  i shall not trouble you fanny by speaking to you now i hope  no said fanny with her heart palpitating if its anything i ought to hear it will be no trouble to me  why my dear i do think you ought to know without loss of time that lord ballindine has been with me this morning  fanny blushed up to her hairnot with shame but with emotion as to what was coming next  i have had a long conversation with him continued the earl in the bookroom and i think i have convinced him that it is for your mutual happinesshe paused for he couldnt condescend to tell a lie but in his glib speechifying manner he was nearly falling into onemutual happiness was such an appropriate prudential phrase that he could not resist the temptation but he corrected himselfat least i think i have convinced him that it is impossible that he should any longer look upon miss wyndham as his future wife  lord cashel paused for some mark of approbation fanny saw that she was expected to speak and therefore asked whether lord ballindine was still in the house she listened tremulously for his answer for she felt that if her lover were to be rejected he had a right after what had passed between them to expect that she should in person express her resolution to him and yet if she had to see him now could she reject him could she tell him that all the vows that had been made between them were to be as nothing no she could only fall on his shoulder and weep in his arms but lord cashel had managed better than that  no fanny neither he nor i at the present moment could expect youcould reasonably expect you to subject yourself to anything so painful as an interview must now have been lord ballindine has left the housei hope for the last timeat least for many months  these words fell cold upon fannys ears did he leave anyany message for me  nothing of any moment nothing which it can avail to communicate to you he expressed his grief for your brothers death and desired i should tell you how grieved he was that you should be so afflicted  poor harry sobbed fanny for it was a relief to cry again though her tears were more for her lover than her brother poor harry they were very fond of each other im sure he must have been sorryim sure hed feel itand she paused and sobbed againhe had heard of harrys death then  when she said this she had in her mind none of the dirty suspicion that had actuated lord cashel but he guessed at her feelings by his own and answered accordingly  at first i understood him to say he had but then he seemed to wish to express that he had not my impression i own is that he must have heard of it the sad news must have reached him  fanny still did not understand the earl the idea of her lover coming after her money immediately on her obtaining possession of it never entered her mind she thought of her wealth as far as it might have affected him but did not dream of its altering his conduct towards her  and did he seem unhappy about it she continued i am sure it would make him very unhappy he could not have loved harry better if he had been his brother and then she blushed again through her tears as she remembered that she had intended that they should be brothers  lord cashel did not say anything more on this head he was fully convinced that lord ballindine only looked on the young mans death as a windfall which he might turn to his own advantage but he thought it would be a little too strong to say so outright just at present  it will be a comfort for you to know that this matter is now settled continued the earl and that no one can attach the slightest blame to you in the matter lord ballindine has shown himself so very imprudent so very unfit in every way for the honour you once intended him that no other line of conduct was open to you than that which you have wisely pursued  this treading on the fallen was too much for fanny i have no right either to speak or to think ill of him said she through her tears and if any one is illtreated in the matter it is he but did he not ask to see me  surely fanny you would not at the present moment have wished to see him  oh no it is a great relief under all the circumstances not having to do so but was he contented i should be glad that he were satisfiedthat he shouldnt think i had treated him harshly or rudely did he appear as if he wished to see me again  why he certainly did ask for a last interviewwhich anticipating your wishes i have refused  but was he satisfied did he appear to think that he had been badly treated  rejected lovers answered the earl with a stately smile seldom express much satisfaction with the terms of their rejection but i cannot say that lord ballindine testified any strong emotion he rose from the sofa as he said this and then intending to clinch the nail added as he went to the doorto tell the truth fanny i think lord ballindine is much more eager for an alliance with your fair self now than he was a few days back when he could never find a moments time to leave his horses and his friend mr blake either to see his intended wife or to pay lady cashel the usual courtesy of a morning visit he then opened the door and again closing it addedi think however fanny that what has now passed between us will secure you from any further annoyance from him  lord cashel in this last speech had greatly overshot his mark his object had been to make the separation between his ward and her lover permanent and hitherto he had successfully appealed to her pride and her judgment fanny had felt lord cashel to be right when he told her that she was neglected and that frank was dissipated and in debt she knew she should be unhappy as the wife of a poor nobleman and she felt that it would break her proud heart to be jilted herself she had therefore though unwillingly still entirely agreed with her guardian as to the expediency of breaking off the match and had lord cashel been judicious he might have confirmed her in this resolution but his last thunderbolt which had been intended to crush lord ballindine had completely recoiled upon himself fanny now instantly understood the allusion and raising her face which was again resting on her hands looked at him with an indignant glance through her tears  lord cashel however had left the room without observing the indignation expressed in fannys eyes but she was indignant she knew frank well enough to be sure that he had come to grey abbey that morning with no such base motives as those ascribed to him he might have heard of harrys death and come there to express his sorrow and offer that consolation which she felt she could accept from him sooner than from any living creatureor he might have been ignorant of it altogether but that he should come there to press his suit because her brother was deadimmediately after his deathwas not only impossible but the person who could say it was possible must be false and untrue to her her uncle could not have believed it himself he had basely pretended to believe it that he might widen the breach which he had made  fanny was alone in the drawingroomfor her cousin had left it as soon as her father began to talk about lord ballindine and she sat there glowering through her tears for a long time had lord ballindine been able to know all her thoughts at this moment he would have felt little doubt as to the ultimate success of his suit     xiii  father and son   lord cashel firmly believed when he left the room that he had shown great tact in discovering franks mercenary schemes and in laying them open before fanny and that she had firmly and finally made up her mind to have nothing more to do with him he had not long been reseated in his customary chair in the bookroom before he began to feel a certain degree of horror at the young lords baseness and to think how worthily he had executed his duty as a guardian in saving miss wyndham from so sordid a suitor from thinking of his duties as a guardian his mind not unnaturally recurred to those which were incumbent on him as a father and here nothing disturbed his serenity it is true that from an appreciation of the lustre which would reflect back upon himself from allowing his son to become a decidedly fashionable young man he had encouraged him in extravagance dissipation and heartless worldliness he had brought him up to be supercilious expensive unprincipled and useless but then he was gentlemanlike dignified and sought after and now the father reflected with satisfaction that if he could accomplish his wellconceived scheme he would pay his sons debts with his wards fortune and at the same time tie him down to some degree of propriety and decorum by a wife lord kilcullen when about to marry would be obliged to cashier his operadancers and their expensive crews and though he might not leave the turf altogether when married he would gradually be drawn out of turf society and would doubtless become a good steady family nobleman like his father why helord cashel himselfwise prudent and respectable as he wasexample as he knew himself to be to all peers english irish and scotchhad had his horses and his indiscretions when he was young and then he stroked the calves of his legs and smiled grimly for the memory of his juvenile vices was pleasant to him  lord cashel thought as he continued to reflect on the matter that lord ballindine was certainly a sordid schemer but that his son was a young man of whom he had just reason to be proud and who was worthy of a wife in the shape of a hundred thousand pounds and then he congratulated himself on being the most anxious of guardians and the best of fathers and with these comfortable reflections the worthy peer strutted off through his ample doors up his lofty stairs and away through his long corridors to dress for dinner you might have heard his boots creaking till he got inside his dressingroom but you must have owned that they did so with a most dignified cadence  it was pleasant enough certainly planning all these things but there would be some little trouble in executing them in the first place lord kilcullenthough a very good son on the whole as the father frequently remarked to himselfwas a little fond of having a will of his own and maybe might object to dispense with his dancinggirls and though there was unfortunately but little doubt that the money was indispensably necessary to him it was just possible that he might insist on having the cash without his cousin however the proposal must be made and as the operations necessary to perfect the marriage would cause some delay and the money would certainly be wanted as soon as possible no time was to be lost lord kilcullen was accordingly summoned to grey abbey and as he presumed his attendance was required for the purpose of talking over some method of raising the wind he obeyed the summonsi should rather have said of raising a storm for no gentle puff would serve to waft him through his present necessities  down he came to the great delight of his mother who thought him by far the finest young man of the day though he usually slighted snubbed and ridiculed herand of his sister who always hailed with dignified joy the return of the eldest scion of her proud family to the ancestral roof the earl was also glad to find that no previous engagement detained him that is that he so far sacrificed his own comfort as to leave tattersalls and the figuranti of the operahouse to come all the way to grey abbey in the county of kildare but though the earl was glad to see his son he was still a little consternated the business interview could not be postponed as it was not to be supposed that lord kilcullen would stay long at grey abbey during the london season and the father had yet hardly sufficiently crammed himself for the occasion besides the pressure from without must have been very strong to have produced so immediate a compliance with a behest not uttered in a very peremptory manner or generally speaking to a very obedient child  on the morning after his arrival the earl was a little uneasy in his chair during breakfast it was rather a sombre meal for fanny had by no means recovered her spirits nor did she appear to be in the way to do so the countess tried to chat a little to her son but he hardly answered her and lady selina though she was often profound was never amusing lord cashel made sundry attempts at general conversation but as often failed it was at last however over and the father requested the son to come with him into the bookroom  when the fire was poked and the chairs were drawn together over the rug there were no further preliminaries which could be decently introduced and the earl was therefore forced to commence  well kilcullen im glad youre come to grey abbey im afraid however we shant induce you to stay with us long so its as well perhaps to settle our business at once you would however greatly oblige your mother and im sure i need not add myself if you could make your arrangements so as to stay with us till after easter we could then return together  till after easter my lord i should be in the hue and cry before that time if i was so long absent from my accustomed haunts besides i should only put out your own arrangements or rather those of lady cashel there would probably be no room for me in the family coach  the family coach wont go lord kilcullen i am sorry to say that the state of my affairs at present renders it advisable that the family should remain at grey abbey this season i shall attend my parliamentary duties alone  this was intended as a hit the first at the prodigal son but kilcullen was too crafty to allow it to tell he merely bowed his head and opened his eyes to betoken his surprise at such a decision and remained quiet  indeed continued lord cashel i did not even intend to have gone myself but the unexpected death of harry wyndham renders it necessary i must put fannys affairs in a right train poor harrydid you see much of him during his illness  why noi cant say i did im not a very good hand at doctoring or nursing i saw him once since he got his commission glittering with his gold lace like a new weathercock on a town hall he hadnt time to polish the shine off  his death will make a great difference as far as fanny is concernedeh  indeed it will her fortune now is considerablea deuced pretty thing remembering that its all ready money and that she can touch it the moment shes of age shes entirely off with ballindine isnt she  oh entirely said the earl with considerable selfcomplacency that affair is entirely over  ive stated so everywhere publicly but i dare say shell give him her money nevertheless shes not the girl to give over a man if shes really fond of him  but my dear kilcullen she has authorised me to give him a final answer and i have done so after that you know it would be quite impossible for her toto  youll seeshell marry lord ballindine had harry lived it might have been different but now shes got all her brothers money shell think it a point of honour to marry her poor lover besides her staying this year in the country will be in his favour shell see no one hereand shell want something to think of i understand he has altogether thrown himself into blakes handsthe keenest fellow in ireland with as much mercy as a foxhound hes a positive fool is ballindine  im afraid he isim afraid he is and you may be sure im too fond of fannythat is i have too much regard for the trust reposed in me to allow her to throw herself away upon him  thats all very well but what can you do  why not allow him to see her and ive another plan in my head for her  ahbut the thing is to put the plan into her head id be sorry to hear of a fine girl like fanny wyndham breaking her heart in a halfruined barrack in connaught without money to pay a schoolmaster to teach her children to spell but ive too many troubles of my own to think of just at present to care much about hers and the son and heir got up and stood with his back to the fire and put his arms under his coatlaps upon my soul my lord i never was so hard up in my life  lord cashel now prepared himself for action the first shot was fired and he must go on with the battle  so i hear kilcullen and yet during the last four years youve had nearly double your allowance and before that i paid every farthing you owed within the last five years youve had nearly forty thousand pounds supposing youd had younger brothers lord kilcullensupposing that i had had six or eight sons instead of only one what would you have done how then would you have paid your debts  fate having exempted me and your lordship from so severe a curse i have never turned my mind to reflect what i might have done under such an infliction  or supposing i had chosen myself to indulge in those expensive habits which would have absorbed my income and left me unable to do more for you than many other noblemen in my position do for their sonsdo you ever reflect how impossible it would then have been for me to have helped you out of your difficulties  i feel as truly grateful for your selfdenial in this respect as i do in that of my nonbegotten brethren  lord cashel saw that he was laughed at and he looked angry but he did not want to quarrel with his son so he continued  jervis writes me word that it is absolutely necessary that thirty thousand pounds should be paid for you at once or that your remaining in londonor in fact in the country at all is quite out of the question  indeed my lord im afraid jervis is right  thirty thousand pounds are you aware what your income is  why hardly i know jervis takes care that i never see much of it  do you mean that you dont receive it  oh i do not at all doubt its accurate payment i mean to say that i dont often have the satisfaction of seeing much of it at the right side of my bankers book  thirty thousand pounds and will that sum set you completely free in the world  i am sorry to say it will notnor nearly  then lord kilcullen said the earl with most severe but still most courteous dignity may i trouble you to be good enough to tell me what at the present moment you do owe  im afraid i could not do so with any accuracy but it is more than double the sum you have named  do you mean that you have no schedule of your debtsno means of acquainting me with the amount how can you expect that i can assist you when you think it too much trouble to make yourself thoroughly acquainted with the state of your own affairs  a list could certainly be made out if i had any prospect of being able to settle the amount if your lordship can undertake to do so at once i will undertake to hand you a correct list of the sums due before i leave grey abbey i presume you would not require to know exactly to whom all the items were owing  this effrontery was too much and lord cashel was very near to losing his temper  upon my honour kilcullen youre cool very cool you come upon me to pay heaven knows how many thousandsmore money i know than im able to raise and you condescendingly tell me that you will trouble yourself so far as to let me know how much money i am to give youbut that i am not to know what is done with it no if i am to pay your debts again i will do it through jervis  pray remember replied lord kilcullen not at all disturbed from his equanimity that i have not proposed that you should pay my debts without knowing where the money went and also that i have not yet asked you to pay them at all  who then do you expect will pay them i can assure you i should be glad to be relieved from the honour  i merely said that i had not yet made any proposition respecting them of course i expect your assistance failing you i have no resource but the jews i should regret to put the property into their hands especially as hitherto i have not raised money on post obits 24       footnote 24 post obita loan that need not be repaid until                    the death of a specified individual usually                    someone from whom the borrower expected to inherit                    enough to repay the loan  at any rate im glad of that said the father willing to admit any excuse for returning to his good humour that would be ruin and i hope that anything short of that may bemay bemay be done something with  the expression was not dignified and it pained the earl to make it but it was expressive and he didnt wish at once to say that he had a proposal for paying off his sons debts but now kilcullen tell me fairly in round figures what do you think you oweas near as you can guess without going to pen and paper you know  well my lord if you will allow me i will make a proposition to you if you will hand over to mr jervis fifty thousand pounds for him to pay such claims as have already been made upon him as your agent and such other debts as i may have sent in to him and if you will give myself thirty thousand to pay such debts as i do not choose to have paid by an agent i will undertake to have everything settled  eighty thousand pounds in four years why kilcullen what have you done with itwhere has it gone you have five thousand ayear no house to keep up no property to support no tenants to satisfy no rates to payfive thousand ayear for your own personal expensesand in four years you have got eighty thousand in debt the property never can stand that you know it never can stand at that rate why kilcullen what have you done with it  mr crockford has a portion of it and john scott has some of it a great deal of it is scattered rather widelyso widely that it would be difficult now to trace it but my lord it has gone i wont deny that the greater portion of it has been lost at play or on the turf i trust i may in future be more fortunate and more cautious  i trust so i trust so indeed eighty thousand pounds and do you think i can raise such a sum as that at a weeks warning  indeed i have no doubt as to your being able to do so it may be another question whether you are willing  i am noti am not able said the libelled father as you know well enough the incumbrances on the property take more than a quarter of my income  there can nevertheless be no doubt of your being able to have the money and that at once if you chose to go into the market for it i have no doubt but that mr jervis could get it for you at once at five per cent  four thousand ayear gone for ever from the propertyand what security am i to have that the same sacrifice will not be again incurred after another lapse of four years  you can have no security my lord against my being in debt you can however have every security that you will not again pay my debts in your own resolution i trust however that i have some experience to prevent my again falling into so disagreeable a predicament i think i have heard your lordship say that you incurred some unnecessary expenses yourself in london before your marriage  i wish kilcullen that you had never exceeded your income more than i did mine but it is no use talking any further on this subject i cannot and i will noti cannot in justice either to myself or to you borrow this money for you nor if i could should i think it right to do so  then what the devils the use of talking about it so long said the dutiful son hastily jumping up from the chair in which he had again sat down did you bring me down to grey abbey merely to tell me that you knew of my difficulties and that you could do nothing to assist me  now dont put yourself into a passionpray dont said the father a little frightened by the sudden ebullition if youll sit down and listen to me ill tell you what i propose i did not send for you here without intending to point out to you some method of extricating yourself from your present pecuniary embarrassment and if you have any wish to give up your course ofi must say reckless profusion and commence that upright and distinguished career which i still hope to see you take you will i think own that my plan is both a safer and a more expedient one than that which you have proposed it is quite time for you now to abandon the expensive follies of youth andlord cashel was getting into a delightfully dignified tone and felt himself prepared for a good burst of commonplace eloquence but his son looked impatient and as he could not take such liberty with him as he could with lord ballindine he came to the point at once and ended abruptly by saying and get married  for the purpose of allowing my wife to pay my debts  why not exactly that but as of course you could not marry any woman but a woman with a large fortune that would follow as a matter of consequence  your lordship proposes the fortune not as the first object of my affection but merely as a corollary but perhaps it will be as well that you should finish your proposition before i make any remarks on the subject and lord kilcullen sat down with a wellfeigned look of listless indifference  well kilcullen i have latterly been thinking much about you and so has your poor mother she is very uneasy that you should stillstill be unmarried and jervis has written to me very strongly you see it is quite necessary that something should be doneor we shall both be ruined now if i did raise this sumand i really could not do iti dont think i could manage it just at present but even if i did it would only be encouraging you to go on just in the same way again now if you were to marry your whole course of life would be altered and you would become at the same time more respectable and more happy  that would depend a good deal upon circumstances i should think  oh i am sure you would you are just the same sort of fellow i was when at your age and i was much happier after i was married so i know it now you see your cousin has a hundred thousand pounds in fact something more than that  whatfanny poor ballindine so thats the way with him is it when i was contradicting the rumour of his marriage with fanny i little thought that i was to be his rival at any rate i shall have to shoot him first  you might at any rate confine yourself to sense lord kilcullen when i am taking so much pains to talk sensibly to you on a subject which i presume cannot but interest you  indeed my lord im all attention and i do intend to talk sensibly when i say that i think you are proposing to treat ballindine very ill the world will think well of your turning him adrift on the score of the match being an imprudent one but it wont speak so leniently of you if you expel him as soon as your ward becomes an heiress to make way for your own son  you know that im not thinking of doing so ive long seen that lord ballindine would not make a fitting husband for fannylong before harry died  and you think that i shall  indeed i do i think she will be lucky to get you  im flattered into silence pray go on  you will be an earla peerand a man of property what would she become if she married lord ballindine  oh you are quite right go on i wonder it never occurred to her before to set her cap at me  now do be serious i wonder how you can joke on such a subject with all your debts im sure i feel them heavy enough if you dont you see lord ballindine was refusedi may say he was refusedbefore we heard about that poor boys unfortunate death it was the very morning we heard of it three or four hours before the messenger came that fanny had expressed her resolution to declare it off and commissioned me to tell him so and therefore of course the two things cant have the remotest reference to each other  i see there are or have been two fanny wyndhamsseparate persons though both wards of your lordship lord ballindine was engaged to the girl who had a brother but he can have no possible concern with fanny wyndham the heiress who has no brother  how can you be so unfeelingbut you may pay your debts in your own way you wont ever listen to what i have to say i should have thought that as your father i might have considered myself entitled to more respect from you  indeed my lord im all respect and attention and i wont say one more word till youve finished  wellyou must see there can be no objection on the score of lord ballindine  oh none at all  and then where could fanny wish for a better match than yourself it would be a great thing for her and the match would be in all things soso respectable and just what it ought to be and your mother would be so delighted and so should i and  her fortune would so nicely pay all my debts  exactly of course i should take care to have your present incomefive thousand a yearsettled on her in the shape of jointure and im sure that would be treating her handsomely the interest of her fortune would not be more than that  and what should we live on  why of course i should continue your present allowance  and you think that that which i have found so insufficient for myself would be enough for both of us  you must make it enough kilcullenin order that there may be something left to enable you to keep up your title when i am gone  by this time lord kilcullen appeared to be as serious and nearly as solemn as his father and he sat for a considerable time musing till his father said well kilcullen will you take my advice  its impracticable my lord in the first place the money must be paid immediately and considerable delay must occur before i could even offer to miss wyndham and in the next place were i to do so i am sure she would refuse me  why there must be some delay of course but i suppose if i passed my word through jervis for so much of the debts as are immediate that a settlement might be made whereby they might stand over for twelve months with interest of course as to refusing you its not at all likely where would she look for a better offer  i dont know much of my cousin but i dont think shes exactly the girl to take a man because hes a good match for her  perhaps not but then you know you understand women so well and would have such opportunities you would be sure to make yourself agreeable to her with very little effort on your part  yes poor thingshe would be delivered over ready bound into the lions den and then the young man sat silent again for some time turning the matter over in his mind at last he said  well my lord i am a considerate and a dutiful son and i will agree to your proposition but i must saddle it with conditions i have no doubt that the sum which i suggested should be paid through your agent could be arranged to be paid in a year or eighteen months by your making yourself responsible for it and i would undertake to indemnify you but the thirty thousand pounds i must have at once i must return to london with the power of raising it there without delay this also i would repay you out of fannys fortune i would then undertake to use my best endeavours to effect a union with your ward but i most positively will not agree to thisnor have any hand in the matter unless i am put in immediate possession of the sum i have named and unless you will agree to double my income as soon as i am married  to both these propositions the earl at first refused to accede but his son was firm then lord cashel agreed to put him in immediate possession of the sum of money he required but would not hear of increasing his income they argued discussed and quarrelled over the matter for a long time till at last the anxious father in his passion told his son that he might go his own way and that he would take no further trouble to help so unconscionable a child lord kilcullen rejoined by threatening immediately to throw the whole of the property which was entailed on himself into the hands of the jews  long they argued and bargained till each was surprised at the obstinacy of the other they ended however by splitting the difference and it was agreed that lord cashel was at once to hand over thirty thousand pounds and to take his sons bond for the amount that the other debts were to stand over till fannys money was forthcoming and that the income of the newly married pair was to be seven thousand five hundred ayear  at least thought lord kilcullen to himself as he goodhumouredly shook hands with his father at the termination of the interviewi have not done so badly for those infernal dogs will be silenced and i shall get the money i could not have gone back without that i can go on with the marriage or not as i may choose hereafter it wont be a bad speculation however  to do lord cashel justice he did not intend cheating his son nor did he suspect his son of an intention to cheat him but the generation was deteriorating     xiv  the countess   it was delightful to see on what good terms the earl and his son met that evening at dinner the latter even went so far as to be decently civil to his mother and was quite attentive to fanny she however did not seem to appreciate the compliment it was now a fortnight since she had heard of her brothers death and during the whole of that time she had been silent unhappy and fretful not a word more had been said to her about lord ballindine nor had she as yet spoken about him to any one but she had been thinking about little else and had ascertainedat least so she thoughtthat she could never be happy unless she were reconciled to him  the more she brooded over the subject the more she felt convinced that such was the case she could not think how she had ever been induced to sanction by her name such an unwarrantable proceeding as the unceremonious dismissal of a man to whom her troth had been plighted merely because he had not called to see her as for his not writing she was aware that lord cashel had recommended that till she was of age they should not correspond as she thought the matter over in her own room long hour after hour she became angry with herself for having been talked into a feeling of anger for him what right had she to be angry because he kept horses she could not expect him to put himself into lord cashels leadingstrings indeed she thought she would have liked him less if he had done so and now to reject him just when circumstances put it in her power to enable her to free him from his embarrassments and live a manner becoming his station what must frank think of herfor he could not but suppose that her rejection had been caused by her unexpected inheritance  in the course of the fortnight she made up her mind that all lord cashel had said to lord ballindine should be unsaidbut who was to do it it would be a most unpleasant task to perform and one which she was aware her guardian would be most unwilling to undertake she fully resolved that she would do it herself if she could find no fitting ambassador to undertake the task though that would be a step to which she would fain not be driven at one time she absolutely thought of asking her cousin kilcullen about itthis was just before his leaving grey abbey he seemed so much more civil and kind than usual but then she knew so little of him and so little liked what she did know that scheme therefore was given up lady selina was so cold and prudentwould talk to her so much about propriety selfrespect and selfcontrol that she could not make a confidante of her no one could talk to selina on any subject more immediately interesting than a roman emperor or a pattern for worstedwork fanny felt that she would not be equal herself to going boldly to lord cashel and desiring him to inform lord ballindine that he had been mistaken in the view he had taken of his wards wishes nothat was impossible such a proceeding would probably bring on a fit of apoplexy  there was no one else to whom she could apply but her aunt lady cashel was a very goodnatured old woman who slept the greatest portion of her time and knitted through the rest of her existence she did not take a prominent part in any of the important doings of grey abbey and though lord cashel constantly referred to her for he thought it respectable to do so no one regarded her much fanny felt however that she would neither scold her ridicule her nor refuse to listen to lady cashel therefore at last she went for assistance  her ladyship always passed the morning after breakfast in a room adjoining her own bedroom in which she daily held deep debate with griffiths her factotum respecting household affairs knittingneedles and her own little ailments and cossetings griffiths luckily was a woman of much the same tastes as her ladyship only somewhat of a more active temperament and they were most stedfast friends it was such a comfort to lady cashel to have some one to whom she could twaddle  the morning after lord kilcullens departure fanny knocked at her door and was asked to come in the countess as usual was in her easy chair with the knittingapparatus in her lap and griffiths was seated at the table pulling about threads and keeping her ladyship awake by small talk  im afraid im disturbing you aunt said fanny but i wanted to speak to you for a minute or two good morning mrs griffiths  oh no you wont disturb me fanny i was a little busy this morning for i wanted to finish this side of theyou see what a deal ive doneand the countess lugged up a whole heap of miscellaneous worsted from a basket just under her armand i must finish it by ladyday 25 or i shant get the other done i dont know when but still ive plenty of time to attend to you       footnote 25 ladydayannunciation day march 25  then ill go down my lady and see about getting the syrup boiled said griffiths good morning miss wyndham  do but mind you come up again immediatelyill ring the bell when miss wyndham is going and pray dont leave me alone now  no my ladynot a moment and griffiths escaped to the syrup  fannys heart beat quick and hard as she sat down on the sofa opposite to her aunt it was impossible for any one to be afraid of lady cashel there was so very little about her that could inspire awe but then what she had to say was so very disagreeable to say if she had had to tell her tale out loud merely to the empty easy chair it would have been a dreadful undertaking  well fanny what can i do for you im sure you look very nice in your bombazine and its very nicely made up who was it made it for you  i got it down from dublin aunt from foleys  oh i remember so you told me griffiths has a niece makes those things up very well but then she lives at namptwich and one couldnt send to england for it i had such a quantity of mourning by me i didnt get any made up new else i think i must have sent for her  my dear aunt i am very unhappy about something and i want you to help me im afraid though it will give you a great deal of trouble  good gracious fannywhat is it is it about poor harry im sure i grieved about him more than i can tell  no aunt hes gone now and time is the only cure for that grief i know i must bear that without complaining but aunt i feeli think that is that ive used lord ballindine very ill  good gracious me my love i thought lord cashel had managed all thati thought that was all settled you know he would keep those horrid horses and all that kind of thing and what more could you do than just let lord cashel settle it  yes but auntyou see i had engaged myself to lord ballindine and i dont thinkin factoh aunt i did not wish to break my word to lord ballindine and i am very very sorry for what has been done and fanny was again in tears  but my dear fanny said the countess so far excited as to commence rising from her seatthe attempt however was abandoned when she felt the ill effects of the labour to which she was exposing herselfbut my dear fannywhat would you have its done now you know and really its for the best  oh but dear aunt i must get somebody to see him ive been thinking about it ever since he was here with my uncle i wouldnt let him think that i broke it all off merely becausebecause of poor harrys money and fanny sobbed away dreadfully  but you dont want to marry him said the naïve countess  now fanny did want to marry him though she hardly liked saying so even to lady cashel  you know i promised him i would said she and what will he think of mewhat must he think of me to throw him off so cruelly so harshly after all thats pastoh aunt i must see him again  i know something of human nature replied the aunt and if you do i tell you it will end in your being engaged to him again you know its off now come my dear dont think so much about it im sure lord cashel wouldnt do anything cruel or harsh  oh i must see him again whatever comes of it and then she paused for a considerable time during which the bewildered old lady was thinking what she could do to relieve her sensitive niece dear dear aunt i dont want to deceive you and fanny springing up knelt at her aunts feet and looked up into her face i do love himi always loved him and i cannot cannot quarrel with him and then she burst out crying vehemently hiding her face in the countesss lap  lady cashel was quite overwhelmed fanny was usually so much more collected than herself that her present prostration both of feeling and body was dreadful to see suppose she was to go into hystericsthere they would be alone and lady cashel felt that she had not strength to ring the bell  but my dear fanny oh dear oh dear this is very dreadfulbut fannyhes gone away now lift up your face fanny for you frighten me well im sure ill do anything for you perhaps he wouldnt mind coming back againhe always was very goodnatured im sure i always liked lord ballindine very muchonly he would have all those horses but im sure if you wish it i should be very glad to see him marry you only you know you must wait some time because of poor harry and im sure i dont know how youll manage with lord cashel  dear aunti want you to speak to lord cashel when i was angry because i thought frank didnt come here as he might have done i consented that my uncle should break off the match besides then you know we should have had so little between us but i didnt know then how well i loved him indeed indeed aunt i cannot bring my heart to quarrel with him and i am quite quite sure he would never wish to quarrel with me will you go to my uncletell him that ive changed my mind tell him that i was a foolish girl and did not know my mind but tell him i must be friends with frank again  well of course ill do what you wish meindeed i would do anything for you fanny as if you were one of my own but really i dont knowgood gracious what am i to say to him wouldnt it be better fanny if you were to go to him yourself  oh no aunt pray do you tell him first i couldnt go to him besides he would do anything for you you know i want you to go to himdo now dear auntand tell himnot from me but from yourselfhow very very much ithat is how very verybut you will know what to say only frank must must come back again  well fanny dear ill go to lord cashel or perhaps he wouldnt mind coming here ring the bell for me dear but im sure hell be very angry id just write a line and ask lord ballindine to come and dine here and let him settle it all himself only i dont think lord cashel would like it  griffiths answered the summons and was despatched to the bookroom to tell his lordship that her ladyship would be greatly obliged if he would step upstairs to her for a minute or two and as soon as griffiths was gone on her errand fanny fled to her own apartment leaving her aunt in a very bewildered and pitiable state of mind and there she waited with palpitating heart and weeping eyes the effects of the interview  she was dreadfully nervous for she felt certain that she would be summoned before her uncle hitherto she alone in all the house had held him in no kind of awe indeed her respect for her uncle had not been of the most exalted kind but now she felt she was afraid of him  she remained in her room much longer than she thought it would have taken her aunt to explain what she had to say at last however she heard footsteps in the corridor and griffiths knocked at the door her aunt would be obliged by her stepping into her room she tried not to look disconcerted and asked if lord cashel were still there she was told that he was and she felt that she had to muster up all her courage to encounter him  when she went into the room lady cashel was still in her easychair but the chair seemed to lend none of its easiness to its owner she was sitting upright with her hands on her two knees and she looked perplexed distressed and unhappy lord cashel was standing with his back to the fireplace and fanny had never seen his face look so black he really seemed for the time to have given over acting to have thrown aside his dignity and to be natural and in earnest  lady cashel began the conversation  oh fanny she said you must really overcome all this sensitiveness you really must ive spoken to your uncle and its quite impossible and very unwise and indeed it cant be done at all in fact lord ballindine isnt by any means the sort of person i supposed  fanny knit her brows a little at this and felt somewhat less humble than she did before she knew she should get indignant if her uncle abused her lover and that if she did her courage would rise in proportion her aunt continued  your uncles very kind about it and says he can of course forgive your feeling a little out of sorts just at present and im sure so can i and im sure id do anything to make you happy but as for making it all up with lord ballindine again indeed it cannot be thought of fanny and so your uncle will tell you  and then lord cashel opened his oracular mouth for the purpose of doing so  really fanny this is the most unaccountable thing i ever heard of but youd better sit down while i speak to you and fanny sat down on the sofa i think i understood you rightly when you desired me less than a month ago to inform lord ballindine that circumstancesthat is his own conductobliged you to decline the honour of his alliance did you not do so spontaneously and of your own accord  certainly uncle i agreed to take your advice though i did so most unwillingly  had i not your authority for desiring himi wont say to discontinue his visits for that he had long donebut to give up his pretensions to your hand did you not authorise me to do so  i believe i did but uncle  and i have done as you desired me and now fanny that i have done sonow that i have fully explained to him what you taught me to believe were your wishes on the subject will you tell mefor i really think your aunt must have misunderstood youwhat it is that you wish me to do  why uncle you pointed outand it was very true then that my fortune was not sufficient to enable lord ballindine to keep up his rank it is different now and i am very very sorry that it is so but it is different now and i feel that i ought not to reject lord ballindine because i am so much richer than i was when hewhen he proposed to me  then its merely a matter of feeling with you and not of affection if i understand you you are afraid that you should be thought to have treated lord ballindine badly  its not only that and then she paused for a few moments and added i thought i could have parted with him when you made me believe that i ought to do so but i find i cannot  you mean that you love him and the earl looked very black at his niece he intended to frighten her out of her resolution but she quietly answered  yes uncle i do  and you want me to tell him so after having banished him from my house  fannys eyes again shot fire at the word banished but she answered very quietly and even with a smile  no uncle but i want you to ask him here again i might tell him the rest myself  but fanny dear said the countess your uncle couldnt do it you know he told him to go away before besides i really dont think hed come hes so taken up with those horrid horses and that mr blake who is worse than any of em really fanny kilcullen says that he and mr blake are quite notorious  i think aunt lord kilcullen might be satisfied with looking after himself if it depended on him he never had a kind word to say for lord ballindine  but you know fanny continued the aunt he knows everybody and if he says lord ballindine is that sort of person why it must be so though im sure im very sorry to hear it  lord cashel saw that he could not trust any more to his wife that last hit about kilcullen had been very unfortunate so he determined to put an end to all fannys yearnings after her lover with a strong hand and said  if you mean fanny after what has passed that i should go to lord ballindine and give him to understand that he is again welcome to grey abbey i must at once tell you that it is absolutelyabsolutely impossible if i had no personal objection to the young man on any prudential score the very fact of my having already at your request desired his absence from my house would be sufficient to render it impossible i owe too much to my own dignity and am too anxious for your reputation to think of doing such a thing but when i also remember that lord ballindine is a reckless dissipated gambleri much fear with no fixed principle i should consider any step towards renewing the acquaintance between you a most wicked and unpardonable proceeding  when fanny heard her lover designated as a reckless gambler she lost all remaining feelings of fear at her uncles anger and standing up looked him full in the face through her tears  its not so my lord she said when he had finished he is not what you have said i know him too well to believe such things of him and i will not submit to hear him abused  oh fanny my dear said the frightened countess dont speak in that way surely your uncle means to act for your own happiness and dont you know lord ballindine has those horrid horses  if i dont mind his horses aunt no one else need but hes no gambler and hes not dissipatedim sure not half so much so as lord kilcullen  in that fanny youre mistaken said the earl but i dont wish to discuss the matter with you you must however fully understand this lord ballindine cannot be received under this roof if you regret him you must remember that his rejection was your own act i think you then acted most prudently and i trust it will not be long before you are of the same opinion yourself and lord cashel moved to the door as though he had accomplished his part in the interview  stop one moment uncle said fanny striving hard to be calm and hardly succeeding i did not ask my aunt to speak to you on this subject till i had turned it over and over in my mind and resolved that i would not make myself and another miserable for ever because i had been foolish enough not to know my mind you best know whether you can ask lord ballindine to grey abbey or not but i am determined if i cannot see him here that i will see him somewhere else and she turned towards the door and then thinking of her aunt she turned back and kissed her and immediately left the room  the countess looked up at her husband quite dumbfounded and he seemed rather distressed himself however he muttered something about her being a hotheaded simpleton and soon thinking better about it and then betook himself to his private retreat to hold sweet converse with his own thoughtshaving first rung the bell for griffiths to pick up the scattered threads of her mistresss knitting  lord cashel certainly did not like the look of things there was a determination in fannys eye as she made her parting speech which upset him rather and which threw considerable difficulties in the way of lord kilcullens wooing to be sure time would do a great deal but then there wasnt so much time to spare he had already taken steps to borrow the thirty thousand pounds and had indeed empowered his son to receive it he had also pledged himself for the other fifty and then after all that perverse fool of a girl would insist on being in love with that scapegrace lord ballindine this however might wear away and he would take very good care that she should hear of his misdoings it would be very odd if after all his plans were to be destroyed and his arrangements disconcerted by his own ward and nieceespecially when he designed so great a match for her  he could not however make himself quite comfortable though he had great confidence in his own diplomatic resources     xv  handicap lodge   lord ballindine left grey abbey and rode homewards towards handicap lodge in a melancholy and speculative mood his first thoughts were all of harry wyndham frank as the accepted suitor of his sister had known him well and intimately and had liked him much and the poor young fellow had been much attached to him he was greatly shocked to hear of his death it was not yet a month since he had seen him shining in all the newblown splendour of his cavalry regimentals and lord ballindine was unfeignedly grieved to think how short a time the lad had lived to enjoy them his thoughts then naturally turned to his own position and the declaration which lord cashel had made to him respecting himself could it be absolutely true that fanny had determined to give him up altogetherafter all her willing vows and assurances of unalterable affection could she be so cold as to content herself with sending him a formal message by her uncle that she did not wish to see him again frank argued with himself that it was impossible he was sure he knew her too well but still lord cashel would hardly tell him a downright lie and he had distinctly stated that the rejection came from miss wyndham herself  then he began to feel indignant and spurred his horse and rode a little faster and made a few resolutions as to upholding his own dignity he would run after neither lord cashel nor his niece he would not even ask her to change her mind since she had been able to bring herself to such a determination as that expressed to him but he would insist on seeing her she could not refuse that to him after what had passed between them and he would then tell her what he thought of her and leave her for ever but no he would do nothing to vex her as long as she was grieving for her brother poor harryshe loved him so dearly perhaps after all his sudden rejection was in some manner occasioned by this sad event and would be revoked as her sorrow grew less with time and then for the first time the idea shot across his mind of the wealth fanny must inherit by her brothers death  it certainly had a considerable effect on him for he breathed slow awhile and was some little time before he could entirely realise the conception that fanny was now the undoubted owner of a large fortune that is it thought he to himself at last that sordid earl considers that he can now be sure of a higher match for his niece and fanny has allowed herself to be persuaded out of her engagement she has allowed herself to be talked into the belief that it was her duty to give up a poor man like me and then he felt very angry again heavens said he to himselfis it possible she should be so servile and so mean fanny wyndham who cared so little for the prosy admonitions of her uncle a few months since can she have altered her disposition so completely can the possession of her brothers money have made so vile a change in her character could she be the same fanny who had so entirely belonged to him who had certainly loved him truly once perish her money he had sought her from affection alone he had truly and fondly loved her he had determined to cling to her in spite of the advice of his friends and then he found himself deserted and betrayed by her because circumstances had given her the probable power of making a better match  such were lord ballindines thoughts and he flattered himself with the reflection that he was a most cruelly used affectionate and disinterested lover he did not at the moment remember that it was fannys twenty thousand pounds which had first attracted his notice and that he had for a considerable time wavered before he made up his mind to part with himself at so low a price it was not to be expected that he should remember that just at present and he rode on considerably out of humour with all the world except himself  as he got near to handicap lodge however the genius of the masterspirit of that classic spot came upon him and he began to bethink himself that it would be somewhat foolish of him to give up the game just at present he reflected that a hundred thousand pounds would work a wondrous change and improvement at kellys courtand that if he was before prepared to marry fanny wyndham in opposition to the wishes of her guardian he should now be doubly determined to do so even though all grey abbey had resolved to the contrary the last idea in his mind as he got off his horse at his friends door was as to what dot blake would think and say of the tidings he brought home with him  it was dark when he reached handicap lodge and having first asked whether mr blake was in and heard that he was dressing for dinner he went to perform the same operation himself when he came down full of his budget and quite ready as usual to apply to dot for advice he was surprised and annoyed to find two other gentlemen in the room together with blake what a bore to have to make one of a dinnerparty of four and the long protracted rubber of shorts which would follow it when his mind was so full of other concerns however it was not to be avoided  the guests were the fat goodhumoured readywitted mat tierney and a little connaught member of parliament named morris who wore a wig played a very good rubber of whist and knew a good deal about selling hunters he was not very bright but he told one or two good stories of his own adventures in the world which he repeated oftener than was approved of by his intimate friends and he drank his wine plentifully and discreetlyfor if he didnt get a game of cards after consuming a certain quantum he invariably went to sleep  there was something in the manner in which the three greeted him on entering the room which showed him that they had been speaking of him and his affairs dot was the first to address him  well frank i hope i am to wish you joy i hope youve made a good mornings work of it  frank looked rather distressed before he could answer however mat tierney said  well ballindine upon my soul i congratulate you sincerely though of course youve seen nothing at grey abbey but tears and cambric handkerchiefs im very glad now that what kilcullen told me wasnt true he left dublin for london yesterday and i suppose he wont hear of his cousins death before he gets there  upon my honour lord ballindine said the horsedealing member you are a lucky fellow i believe old wyndham was a regular golden nabob and i suppose now youll touch the whole of his gatherings  dot and his guests had heard of harry wyndhams death and fannys accession of fortune but they had not heard that she had rejected her lover and that he had been all but turned out of her guardians house nor did he mean to tell them but he did not find himself pleasantly situated in having to hear their congratulations and listen to their jokes while he himself felt that the rumour which he had so emphatically denied to mat tierney only two days since had turned out to be true  not one of the party made the slightest reference to the poor brother from whom fannys new fortune had come except as the lucky means of conveying it to her there was no regret even pretended for his early death no sympathy expressed with fannys sorrow and there was moreover an evident conviction in the minds of all the three that frank of course looked on the accident as a piece of unalloyed good fortunea splendid windfall in his way unattended with any disagreeable concomitants this grated against his feelings and made him conscious that he was not yet heartless enough to be quite fit for the society in which he found himself  the party soon went into the diningroom and frank at first got a little ease for fanny wyndham seemed to be forgotten in the willing devotion which was paid to blakes soup the interest of the fish also seemed to be absorbing and though conversation became more general towards the latter courses still it was on general subjects as long as the servants were in the room but much to his annoyance his mistress again came on the tapis 26 together with the claret       footnote 26 a tapis was a small cloth or tapestry sometimes                    used to cover a table hence the expression on                    the tapis meant on the table or under                    consideration  you and kilcullen dont hit it off togethereh ballindine said mat  we never quarrelled answered frank we never however were very intimate  i wonder at that for youre both fond of the turf theres a large string of his at murphys now isnt there dot  too many i believe said blake if youve a mind to be a purchaser youll find him a very pleasant fellowespecially if you dont object to his own prices  faith ill not trouble him said mat ive two of them already and a couple on the turf and a couple for the saddle are quite enough to suit me but what the deuce made him say so publicly that your match was off ballindine he couldnt have heard of wyndhams death at the time or i should think he was after the money himself  i cannot tell he certainly had not my authority said frank  nor the ladys either i hope  you had better ask herself tierney and if she rejects me maybe shell take you  theres a speculation for you said blake you dont think yourself too old yet i hope to make your fortune by marriageand if you dont im sure miss wyndham cant  i tell you what dot i admire miss wyndham much and i admire a hundred thousand pounds more i dont know anything i admire more than a hundred thousand pounds except two but upon my word i wouldnt take the money and the lady together  well thats kind of him isnt it frank so youve a chance left yet  ah but you forget morris said tierney and theres yourself too if ballindine is not to be the lucky man i dont see why either of you should despair  oh as for me im the devil ive a tail only i dont wear it except on state occasions and ive horns and hoofs only people cant see them but i dont see why morris should not succeed hes the only one of the four that doesnt own a racehorse and thats much in his favour what do you say morris  id have no objection said the member except that i wouldnt like to stand in lord ballindines way  oh hes the soul of goodnature you wouldnt take it ill of him would you frank  not the least said frank sulkily for he didnt like the conversation and he didnt know how to put a stop to it  perhaps you wouldnt mind giving him a line of introduction to lord cashel said mat  but morris said blake im afraid your politics would go against you a repealer would never go down at grey abbey  morrisll never let his politics harm him said tierney repeals a very good thing the other side of the shannon or one might carry it as far as conciliation hall if one was hard pressed and near an election were you ever in conciliation hall yet morris  no mat but im going next thursday will you go with me  faith i will not but i think you should go you ought to do something for your country for youre a patriot i never was a public man  well when i can do any good for my country ill go there talking of that i saw oconnell in town yesterday and i never saw him looking so well the verdict hasnt disturbed him much i wonder what steps the government will take now they must be fairly bothered i dont think they dare imprison him  not dare said blakeand why not when they had courage to indict him you need not fear but what theyll dare to go on with a strong hand now they have a verdict  ill tell you what dot if they imprison the whole set said mat and keep them in prison for twelve months every catholic in ireland will be a repealer by the end of that time  and why shouldnt they all be repealers said morris it seems to me that its just as natural for us to be repealers as it is for you to be the contrary  i wont say they dont dare to put them in prison continued mat but i will say theyll be great fools to do it the government have so good an excuse for not doing so they have such an easy path out of the hobble there was just enough difference of opinion among the judgesjust enough irregularity in the trial such as the omissions of the names from the long panelto enable them to pardon the whole set with a good grace  if they did said blake the whole high tory party in this countrypeers and parsonswould be furious theyd lose one set of supporters and wouldnt gain another my opinion is theyll lock the whole party up in the stone jugfor some time at least  why said tierney their own party could not quarrel with them for not taking an advantage of a verdict as to the legality of which there is so much difference of opinion even among the judges i dont know much about these things myself but as far as i can understand they would have all been found guilty of high treason a few years back and probably have been hung or beheaded and if they could do that now the country would be all the quieter but they cant the people will have their own way and if they want the people to go easy they shouldnt put oconnell into prison rob them all of the glories of martyrdom and youd find youll cut their combs and stop their crowing  its not so easy to do that now mat said morris youll find that the country will stick to oconnell whether hes in prison or out of itbut peel will never dare to put him there they talk of the penitentiary but ill tell you what if they put him there the people of dublin wont leave one stone upon another theyd have it all down in a night  you forget morris how near richmond barracks are to the penitentiary  no i dont not that i think therell be any row of the kind for ill bet a hundred guineas theyre never put in prison at all  done said dot and his little book was output that down morris and ill initial it a hundred guineas even that oconnell is not in prison within twelve months of this time  very well that is that hes not put there and kept there for six months in consequence of the verdict just given at the state trials  no my boy thats not it i said nothing about being kept there six months theyre going to try for a writ of error or what the devil they call it before the peers but ill bet you a cool hundred he is put in prison before twelve months are over in consequence of the verdict if hes locked up there for one night i win will you take that  well i will said morris and they both went to work at their little books  i was in london said mat during the greater portion of the trialand its astonishing what unanimity of opinion there was at the club that the whole set would be acquitted i heard howard make bet at the reform club that the only man put in prison would be the attorneygeneral  he ought to have included the chief justice said morris by the bye mat is that howard the brother of the honourable and riverind augustus  upon my soul i dont know whose brother he is who is the riverind augustus  morris wants to tell a story mat said blake dont spoil him now  indeed i dont said the member i never told it to any one till i mentioned it to you the other day it only happened the other day but it is worth telling  out with it morris said mat it isnt very long is itbecause if it is well get dot to give us a little whiskey and hot water first im sick of the claret  just as you like mat and blake rang the bell and the hot water was brought  you know savarius oleary said morris anxious to tell his story eh tierney  what savy with the whiskers said tierney to be sure i do who doesnt know savy  you know him dont you lord ballindine morris was determined everybody should listen to him  oh yes i know him he comes from county mayohis propertys close to mine that is the patch of rocks and cabinswhich he has managed to mortgage three times over and each time for more than its valuewhich he still calls the oleary estate  well some time agothat is since london began to fill oleary was seen walking down regent street with a parson how the deuce hed ever got hold of the parson or the parson of him was never explained but phil mahon saw him and asked him who his friend in the white choker was is it my friend in black you mane says savy thin my frind was the honourable and the riverind augustus howard the dane howard the dane said mahon how the duce did any of the howards become danes ah bother said savy its not of thim danes he is its not the danes of shwaden i mane at all man but a rural dane of the church of england  mat tierney laughed heartily at this and even frank forgot that his dignity had been hurt and that he meant to be sulky and he laughed also the little member was delighted with his success and felt himself encouraged to persevere  ah savys a queer fellow if you knew him he continued turning to lord ballindine and upon my soul hes no fool oh if you knew him as well  didnt you hear ballindine say he was his next door neighbour in mayo said blake or rather next barrack neighbour for they dispense with doors in mayoeh frank and their houses are all cabins or barracks  why we certainly dont pretend to all the apuleian luxuries of handicap lodge but we are ignorant enough to think ourselves comfortable and swinish enough to enjoy our pitiable state  i beg ten thousand pardons my dear fellow i didnt mean to offend your nationality castlebar we must allow is a fine provincial citythough killalas the mayo city i believe and claremorris which is your own town i think is as all admit a gem of paradise only its a pity so many of the houses have been unroofed lately it adds perhaps to the picturesque effect but it must i should think take away from the comfort  not a house in claremorris belongs to me said lord ballindine again rather sulky or ever did to any of my family i would as soon own claremorris though as i would castleblakeney your own town is quite as shatteredlooking a place  thats quite truebut i have some hopes that castleblakeney will be blotted out of the face of creation before i come into possession  but i was saying about savy oleary again interposed morris did you ever hear what he did  but blake would not allow his guest the privilege of another story if you encourage morris said he we shall never get our whist and with that he rose from the table and walked away into the next room  they played high morris always played high if he could for he made money by whist tierney was not a gambler by profession but the men he lived among all played and he therefore got into the way of it and played the game well for he was obliged to do so in his own defence blake was an adept at every thing of the kind and though the cardtable was not the place where his light shone brightest still he was quite at home at it  as might be supposed lord ballindine did not fare well among the three he played with each of them one after the other and lost with them all blake to do him justice did not wish to see his friends money go into the little members pocket and once or twice proposed giving up but frank did not second the proposal and morris was inveterate the consequence was that before the table was broken up lord ballindine had lost a sum of money which he could very ill spare and went to bed in a very unenviable state of mind in spite of the brilliant prospects on which his friends congratulated him    xvi  brien boru   the next morning at breakfast when frank was alone with blake he explained to him how matters really stood at grey abbey he told him how impossible he had found it to insist on seeing miss wyndham so soon after her brothers death and how disgustingly disagreeable stiff and repulsive the earl had been and by degrees they got to talk of other things and among them franks present pecuniary miseries  there can be no doubt i suppose said dot when frank had consoled himself by anathematising the earl for ten minutes as to the fact of miss wyndhams inheriting her brothers fortune  faith i dont know i never thought about her fortune if youll believe me i never even remembered that her brothers death would in any way affect her in the way of money until after i left grey abbey  oh i can believe you capable of anything in the way of imprudence  ah but dot to think of that pompous foolwho sits and caws in that dingy bookroom of his with as much wise selfconfidence as an antiquated ravento think of him insinuating that i had come there looking for harry wyndhams money when as you know i was as ignorant of the poor fellows death as lord cashel was himself a week ago insolent blackguard i would never willingly speak another word to him or put my foot inside that infernal door of his if it were to get ten times all harry wyndhams fortune  then if i understand you you now mean to relinquish your claims to miss wyndhams hand  no i dont believe she ever sent the message her uncle gave me i dont see why im to give her up just because shes got this money  nor i frank to tell the truth especially considering how badly you want it yourself but i dont think quarrelling with the uncle is the surest way to get the niece  but man he quarrelled with me  it takes two people to quarrel if he quarrelled with you do you be the less willing to come to loggerheads with him  wouldnt it be the best plan dot to carry her off  she wouldnt go my boy rope ladders and postchaises are out of fashion  but if shes really fond of meand upon my honour i dont believe im flattering myself in thinking that she iswhy the deuce shouldnt she marry me malgré 27 lord cashel she must be her own mistress in a week or two by heavens i cannot stomach that fellows arrogant assumption of superiority       footnote 27 malgréfrench in spite of notwithstanding  it will be much more convenient for her to marry you bon gré 28 lord cashel whom you may pitch to the devil in any way you like best as soon as you have fanny wyndham at kellys court but till that happy time take my advice and submit to the cawing rooks and ravens are respectable birds just because they do look so wise its a great thing to look wise the doing so does an acknowledged fool like lord cashel very great credit       footnote 28 bon gréfrench with the consent of  but what ought i to do i cant go to the mans house when he told me expressly not to do so  oh yes you can not immediately but by and byin a month or six weeks ill tell you what i should do in your place and remember frank im quite in earnest now for its a very different thing playing a game for twenty thousand pounds which to you joined to a wife would have been a positive irreparable loss and starting for five or six times that sum which would give you an income on which you might manage to live  well thou sapient counsellorbut i tell you beforehand the chances are ten to one i shant follow your plan  do as you like about that you shant at any rate have me to blame i would in the first place assure myself that fanny inherited her brothers money  theres no doubt about that lord cashel said as much  make sure of it however a lawyerll do that for you with very little trouble then take your name off the turf at once its worth your while to do it now you may either do it by a bona fide sale of the horses or by running them in some other persons name then watch your opportunity call at grey abbey when the earl is not at home and manage to see some of the ladies if you cant do that if you cant effect an entrée write to miss wyndham dont be too lachrymose or supplicatory in your style but ask her to give you a plain answer personally or in her own handwriting  and if she declines the honour  if as you say and as i believe she loves or has loved you i dont think shell do so shell submit to a little parleying and then shell capitulate but it will be much better that you should see her if possible without writing at all  i dont like the idea of calling at grey abbey i wonder whether theyll go to london this season  if they do you can go after them the truth is simply this ballindine miss wyndham will follow her own fancy in the matter in spite of her guardian but if you make no further advances to her of course she can make none to you but i think the game is in your own hand you havent the head to play it or i should consider the stakes as good as won  but then about these horses dot i wish i could sell them out and out at once  youll find it very difficult to get anything like the value for a horse thats well up for the derby you see a purchaser must make up his mind to so much outlay theres the purchasemoney and expense of english training with so remote a chance of any speedy return  but you said youd advise me to sell them  thats if you can get a purchaseror else run them in another name you may run them in my name if you like it but scott must understand that ive nothing whatever to do with the expense  would you not buy them yourself blake  no i would not  why not  if i gave you anything like the value for them the bargain would not suit me and if i got them for what theyd be worth to me youd think and other people would say that id robbed you  then followed a lengthened and most intricate discourse on the affairs of the stable frank much wanted his friend to take his stud entirely off his hands but this dot resolutely refused to do in the course of conversation frank owned that the present state of his funds rendered it almost impracticable for him to incur the expense of sending his favourite brien boru to win laurels in england he had lost nearly three hundred pounds the previous evening which his account at his bankers did not enable him to pay his dublin agent had declined advancing him more money at present and his tradesmen were very importunate in fact he was in a scrape and dot must advise him how to extricate himself from it  ill tell you the truth ballindine said he as far as im concerned myself i never will lend money except where i see as a matter of business that it is a good speculation to do so i wouldnt do it for my father  who asked you said frank turning very red and looking very angry  you did not certainly but i thought you might and you would have been annoyed when i refused you now you have the power of being indignant instead however having said so much ill tell you what i think you should do and what i will do to relieve you as far as the horses are concerned do you go down to kellys court and remain there quiet for a time youll be able to borrow what money you absolutely want down there if the dublin fellows actually refuse but do with as little as you can the horses shall run in my name for twelve months if they win i will divide with you at the end of the year the amount won after deducting their expenses if they lose i will charge you with half the amount lost including the expenses should you not feel inclined at the end of the year to repay me this sum i will then keep the horses instead or sell them at dycers if you like it better and hand you the balance if there be any what do you say to this you will be released from all trouble annoyance and expense and the cattle will i trust be in good hands  that is to say that for one year you are to possess one half of whatever value the horses may be  exactly we shall be partners for one year  to make that fair said frank you ought to put into the concern three horses as good and as valuable as my three  yes and you ought to bring into the concern half the capital to be expended in their training and knowledge experience and skill in making use of them equal to mine no frank youre mistaken if you think that i can afford to give up my time merely for the purpose of making an arrangement to save you from trouble  upon my word dot answered the other youre about the coolest hand i ever met did i ask you for your precious time or anything else youre always afraid that youre going to be done now you might make a distinction between me and some of your other friends and remember that i am not in the habit of doing anybody  why i own i dont think it very likely that i or indeed anyone else should suffer much from you in that way for your sin is not too much sharpness  then why do you talk about what you can afford to do  because its necessary i made a proposal which you thought an unfair one you maynt believe me but it is a most positive fact that my only object in making that proposal was to benefit you you will find it difficult to get rid of your horses on any terms and yet with the very great stake before you in miss wyndhams fortune it would be foolish in you to think of keeping them and on this account i thought in what manner i could take them from you if they belong to my stables i shall consider myself bound to run them to the best advantage and  well wellfor heavens sake dont speechify about it  stop a moment frank and listen for i must make you understand i must make you see that i am not taking advantage of your position and trying to rob my own friend in my own house i dont care what most people say of me for in my career i must expect people to lie of me i must also take care of myself but i do wish you to know that though i could not disarrange my schemes for you i would not take you in  why dothow can you go on so i only thought i was taking a leaf out of your book by being careful to make the best bargain i could  well as i was sayingi would run the horses to the best advantageespecially brien for the derby by doing so my whole book would be upset i should have to bet all round againand very likely not be able to get the bets i want i could not do this without a very strong interest in the horse besides you remember that i should have to go over with him to england myself and that i should be obliged to be in england a great deal at a time when my own business would require me here  my dear fellow said frank youre going on as though it were necessary to defend yourself i never accused you of anything  never mind whether you did or no you understand me now if it will suit you you can take my offer but i should be glad to know at once  while this conversation was going on the two young men had left the house and sauntered out into blakes studyard here were his stables where he kept such horses as were not actually in the trainers handsand a large assortment of aged hunters celebrated timberjumpers brood mares thoroughbred fillies cocktailed colts and promising foals they were immediately joined by blakes stud groom who came on business intent to request a few words with his master which meant that lord ballindine was to retreat as it was full time for his friend to proceed to his regular days work blakes groom was a very different person in appearance from the sort of servant in the possession of which the fashionable owner of two or three horses usually rejoices he had no diminutive top boots no loose brown breeches buttoned low beneath the knee no elongated waistcoat with capacious pockets no dandy coat with remarkably short tail he was a very ugly man of about fifty named john bottom dressed somewhat like a seedy gentleman but he understood his business well and did it and was sufficiently wise to know that he served his own pocket best in the long run by being true to his master and by resisting the numerous tempting offers which were made to him by denizens of the turf to play foul with his masters horses he was therefore a treasure to blake and he knew it and valued himself accordingly  well john said his master i suppose i must desert lord ballindine again and obey your summons your few words will last nearly till dinner i suppose  why there is a few things to be sure ll be the better for being talked over a bit as his lordship knows well enough i wish wed as crack a nag in our stables as his lordship  maybe we may some day one down and another come on you know as the butcherboy said  at any rate your horses dont want bottom said frank  hehehe laughed john or rather tried to do so he had laughed at that joke a thousand times and in the best of humours he wasnt a merry man  well frank said blake the cock has crowed i must away i suppose youll ride down to igoes and see brien but think of what ive said and he added whisperingremember that i will do the best i can for the animals if you put them into my stables they shall be made second to nothing and shall only and always run to win  so blake and john bottom walked off to the box stables and home paddocks  frank ordered his horse and complied with his friends suggestion by riding down to igoes he was not in happy spirits as he went he felt afraid that his hopes with regard to fanny would be blighted and that if he persevered in his suit he would only be harassed annoyed and disappointed he did not see what steps he could take or how he could manage to see her it would be impossible for him to go to grey abbey after having been as he felt turned out by lord cashel other things troubled him also what should he now do with himself it was true that he could go down to his own house but everyone at kellys court expected him to bring with him a bride and a fortune and instead of that he would have to own that he had been jilted and would be reduced to the disagreeable necessity of borrowing money from his own tenants and then that awful subject moneytook possession of him what the deuce was he to do what a fool he had been to be seduced on to the turf by such a man as blake and then he expressed a wish to himself that blake had beena long way off before he ever saw him there he was steward of the curragh the owner of the best horse in ireland and absolutely without money to enable him to carry on the game till he could properly retreat from it  then he was a little unfair upon his friend he accused him of knowing his position and wishing to take advantage of it and by the time he had got to igoes his mind was certainly not in a very charitable mood towards poor dot he had nevertheless determined to accept his offer and to take a last look at the three milesians  the people about the stables always made a great fuss with lord ballindine partly because he was one of the stewards and partly because he was going to run a crack horse for the derby in england and though generally speaking he did not care much for personal complimentary respect he usually got chattered and flattered into good humour at igoes  well my lord said a sort of foreman or partner or managing man who usually presided over the yard i think well be apt to get justice to ireland on the downs this year that is theyll give us nothing but what we takes from em by hard fighting or running as the case may be  hows brien looking this morning grady  as fresh as a primrose my lord and as clear as crystal hes ready this moment to run through any set of three years old as could be put on the curragh anyway  im afraid youre putting him on too forward  too forrard is it my lord not a bit hes a hoss as naturally dont pick up flesh though he feeds free too hes this moment all wind and bottom though as one may say hes got no training hes niver been sthretched yet faith its thrue im telling you my lord  i know scott doesnt like getting horses early in the season that are too finetoo much drawn up he thinks they lose power by it and so they doits the distance that kills them at the derby its so hard to get a young horse to stay the distance  thats thrue shure enough my lord and there isnt a gentleman this side the wather anyway undherstands thim things betther than your lordship  well grady lets have a look at the young chieftain hes all right about the lungs anyway  and feet too my lord niver saw a set of claner feet with plates on and legs too if you were to canter him down the road i dont think hed feel it not that id like to thry though  why hes not yet had much to try them  faix he has my lord didnt he win the autumn produce stakes  the only thing he ever ran for  ah but i tell you as your lordship knows very wellno one bettherthat its a ticklish thing to bring a two year old to the post in anything like conditionwith any running in him at all and not hurt his legs  but i think hes all righteh grady  rightyour lordship knows hes right i wish he may be made righter at john scotts thats all but thats unpossible  of course grady you think he might be trained here as well as at the other side of the water  no i dont my lord quite different ive none of thim ideas at all and never had thank god i knows what we can do and i knows what they can dobreed a hoss in ireland train him in the north of england and run him in the south and hell do your work for you and win your money steady and shure  and why not run in the north too  theyre too cute my lord they like to pick up the crumbs themselvessmall blame to thim in that matther no a bright irish nag with lots of heart like brien boru is the hoss to stand on for the derby where all run fair and fair alike the best winsbut i wont say but hell be the betther for a little polishing at johnny scotts  besides grady no horse could run immediately after a sea voyage do you remember what a show we made of peter simple at kilrue  to be shure i does my lord besides theyve proper gallops there which we haventand theyve betther manes of measuring horseswhy they can measure a horse to half a pound and tell his rale pace on a twomile course to a couple of secondstake the sheets off larry and let his lordship run his hand over him hes as bright as a star isnt he  i think youre getting him too fine im sure scottll say so  dont mind him my lord hes not like one of those english cats with jist a dash of speed about em and nothing morebrutes that they put in training half a dozen times in as many months thim animals pick up a lot of loose flabby flesh in no time and loses it in less and in course av they gets a sweat too much theres nothin left in em not a hapoth briens a different guess sort of animal from that  were you going to have him out grady  why we was notthat is only just for walking exercise with his sheets on but a canter down the half mile slope and up again by the bushes wont go agin him  well saddle him then and let pat get up  yes my lord and brien was saddled by the two men together with much care and ceremony and pat was put upand now pat continued grady keep him well in hand down the slopedont let him out at all at all till you come to the turn when youre fairly round the corner just shake your reins the laste in life and when youre halfway up the rise when the lad begins to snort a bit let him just see the end of the switchjust raise it till it catches his eye and av he dont show that hes disposed for running im mistaken well step across to the bushes my lord and see him come round  lord ballindine and the managing man walked across to the bushes accordingly and pat did exactly as he was desired it was a pretty thing to see the beautiful young animal with his sleek brown coat shining like a ladys curls arching his neck and throwing down his head in his impatience to start he was the very picture of health and symmetry when he flung up his head youd think the blood was running from his nose his nostrils were so ruddy bright he cantered off in great impatience and fretted and fumed because the little fellow on his back would be the master and not let him have his playdown the slope and round the corner by the trees it was beautiful to watch him his motions were so easy so graceful at the turn he answered to the boys encouragement and mended his pace till again he felt the bridle and then as the jock barely moved his right arm he bounded up the rising ground past the spot where lord ballindine and the trainer were standing and shot away till he was beyond the place where he knew his gallop ordinarily ended as grady said he hadnt yet been stretched he had never yet tried his own pace and he had that look so beautiful in a horse when running of working at his ease and much within his power  hes a beautiful creature said lord ballindine as he mournfully reflected that he was about to give up to dot blake half the possession of his favourite and the whole of the nominal title it was such a pity he should be so hampered the mere éclat of possessing such a horse was so great a pleasure he is a fine creature said he and i am sure will do well  your lordship may say that hell go precious nigh to astonish the saxons i think i suppose the pickup at the derbyll be nigh four thousand this year  i suppose it willsomething like that  well i would like a nag out of our stables to do the trick on the downs and av we does it iver itll be now mr igoes standing a deal of cash on him i wonder is mr blake standing much on him my lord  youd be precious deep grady if you could find what hes doing in that way  thats thrue for you my lord but av he or your lordship wants to get more on nows the time ill lay twenty thousand pounds this moment that afther hes been a fortnight at johnny scotts the odds agin him wont be more than ten to one from that day till the morning he comes out on the downs  i dare say not  i wondher who your lordshipll put up  that must depend on scott and what sort of a string he has running hes nothing as yet high in the betting except hardicanute  nothing my lord and take my word for it that horse is ownly jist run up for the sake of the betting thats not his nathural position well pat you may take the saddle off will your lordship see the mare out today  not today grady lets see whats the day she runs  the fifteenth of may my lord im afraid mr watts patriot ll be too much for her thats av hell run kind but he dont do that always well good morning to your lordship  good morning grady and frank rode back towards handicap lodge  he had a great contest with himself on his road home he had hated the horses two days since when he was at grey abbey and had hated himself for having become their possessor and now he couldnt bear the thought of parting with them to be steward of the curraghto own the best horse of the yearand to win the derby were very pleasant things in themselves and for what was he going to give over all this glory pleasure and profit to another to please a girl who had rejected him even jilted him and to appease an old earl who had already turned him out of his house no he wouldnt do it by the time that he was half a mile from igoes stables he had determined that as the girl was gone it would be a pity to throw the horses after her he would finish this year on the turf and then if fanny wyndham was still her own mistress after christmas he would again ask her her mind if shes a girl of spirit he said to himselfand nobody knows better than i do that she is she wont like me the worse for having shown that im not to be led by the nose by a pompous old fool like lord cashel and he rode on fortifying himself in this resolution for the second half mile but what the deuce should he do about money there was only one more half mile before he was again at handicap lodgeguinnesss people had his titledeeds and he knew he had twelve hundred a year after paying the interest of the old incumbrances they hadnt advanced him much since he came of age certainly not above five thousand pounds and it surely was very hard he could not get five or six hundred pounds when he wanted it so much it was very hard that he shouldnt be able to do what he liked with his own like the duke of newcastle however the money must be had he must pay blake and tierney the balance of what they had won at whist and the horse couldnt go over the water till the wind was raised if he was driven very hard he might get something from martin kelly these unpleasant cogitations brought him over the third half mile and he rode through the gate of handicap lodge in a desperate state of indecision  ill tell you what ill do dot he said when he met his friend coming in from his mornings work and im deuced sorry to do it for i shall be giving you the best horse of his year and something tells me hell win the derby  i suppose something means old jack igoe or that blackguard grady said dot but as to his winning thats as it may be you know the chances are sixteen to one he wont  upon my honour i dont think they are  will you take twelve to one  ah youk now dot im not now wanting to bet on the horse with you i was only saying that ive a kind of inward conviction that he will win  my dear frank said the other if men selling horses could also sell their inward convictions with them what a lot of articles of that description there would be in the market but what were you going to say youd do  ill tell you what ill do ill agree to your terms providing youll pay half the expenses of the horses since the last race each of them ran you must see that would be only fair supposing the horses belonged to you equally with me ever since that time  it would be quite fair no doubt if i agreed to it it would be quite fair also if i agreed to give you five hundred pounds but i will do neither one nor the other  but look here dotbrien ran for the autumn produce stakes last october and won them since then he has done nothing to reimburse me for his expense nor yet has anything been taken out of him by running surely if you are to have half the profits you should at any rate pay half the expenses  thats very well put frank and if you and i stood upon equal ground with an arbiter between us by whose decision we were bound to abide and to whom the settlement of the question was entrusted your arguments would no doubt be successful but  well thats the fair way of looking at it  but as i was going to say thats not the case we are neither of us bound to take any ones decision and therefore any terms which either of us chooses to accept must be fair now i have told you my termsthe lowest price if you like to call it soat which i will give your horses the benefit of my experience and save you from their immediate pecuniary pressure and i will neither take any other terms nor will i press these on you  why blake id sooner deal with all the jews of israel  stop frank one word of abuse and ill wash my hands of the matter altogether  wash away then ill keep the horses though i have to sell my hunters and the plate at kellys court into the bargain  i was going to addonly your energys far too great to allow of a slow steady man like me finishing his sentencei was going to say that if youre pressed for money as you say and if it will be any accommodation i will let you have two hundred and fifty pounds at five per cent on the security of the horses that is that you will be charged with that amount and the interest in the final closing of the account at the end of the year before the horses are restored to you  had an uninterested observer been standing by he might have seen with half an eye that blakes coolness was put on and that his indifference to the bargain was assumed this offer of the loan was a second bid when he found the first was likely to be rejected it was made too at the time that he was positively declaring that he would make none but the first offer poor frankhe was utterly unable to cope with his friend at the weapons with which they were playing and he was consequently most egregiously plundered but it was in an affair of horseflesh and the sporting world when it learned the terms on which the horses were transferred from lord ballindines name to that of mr blake had not a word of censure to utter against the latter he was pronounced to be very wide awake and decidedly at the top of his profession and lord ballindine was spoken of for a week with considerable pity and contempt  when blake mentioned the loan frank got up and stood with his back to the fire then bit his lips and walked twice up and down the room with his hands in his pockets and then he paused looked out of the window and attempted to whistle then he threw himself into an armchair poked out both his legs as far as he could ran his fingers through his hair and set to work hard to make up his mind but it was no good in about five minutes he found he could not do it so he took out his purse and extracting halfacrown threw it up to the ceiling saying  well dothead or harp if youre right you have them  harp cried dot  they both examined the coin theyre yours said frank with much solemnity and now youve got the best horseyes i believe the very best horse alive for nothing  only half of him frank  well said frank its done now i suppose  oh of course it is said dot ill draw out the agreement and give you a cheque for the money tonight  and so he did and frank wrote a letter to igoe authorizing him to hand over the horses to mr blakes groom stating that he had sold themfor so ran his agreement with dotand desiring that his bill for training c might be forthwith forwarded to kellys court poor frank he was ashamed to go to take a last look at his dear favourites and tell his own trainer that he had sold his own horses  the next morning saw him with his servant on the ballinasloe coach travelling towards kellys court and also saw brien boru granuell and finn mgoul led across the downs from igoes stables to handicap lodge  the handsome sheets hoods and rollers in which they had hitherto appeared and on which the initial b was alone conspicuous were carefully folded up and they were henceforth seen in plainer but as serviceable apparel labelled w b  will you give fourteen to one against brien boru said viscount avoca to lord tathenham corner about ten days after this at tattersalls  i will said lord tathenham  in hundreds said the sharp irishman  very well said lord tathenham and the bet was booked  you didnt know i suppose said the successful viscount that dot blake has bought brien boru  and who the devils dot blake said lord tathenham  oh youll know before mays over said the viscount     xvii  martin kellys courtship   it will be remembered that the tuam attorney daly dined with barry lynch at dunmore house on the same evening that martin kelly reached home after his dublin excursion and that on that occasion a good deal of interesting conversation took place after dinner barry however was hardly amenable to reason at that social hour and it was not till the following morning that he became thoroughly convinced that it would be perfectly impossible for him to make his sister out a lunatic to the satisfaction of the chancellor  he then agreed to abandon the idea and in lieu of it to indict or at any rate to threaten to indict the widow kelly and her son for a conspiracy and an attempt to inveigle his sister anty into a disgraceful marriage with the object of swindling her out of her property  ill see moylan mr lynch said daly and if i can talk him over i think we might succeed in frightening the whole set of them so far as to prevent the marriage moylan must know that if your sister was to marry young kelly thered be an end to his agency but we must promise him something mr lynch  yes i suppose we must pay him before we get anything out of him  no not beforebut he must understand that he will get something if he makes himself useful you must let me explain to him that if the marriage is prevented you will make no objection to his continuing to act as miss lynchs agent and i might hint the possibility of his receiving the rents on the whole property  hint what you like daly but dont tie me down to the infernal ruffian i suppose we can throw him overboard afterwards cant we  why not altogether mr lynch if i make him a definite promise i shall expect you to keep to it  confound himbut tell me daly what is it hes to doand what is it were to do  why mr lynch its more than probable i think that this plan of martin kellys marrying your sisther may have been talked over between the ould woman moylan and the young man and if so thats something like a conspiracy if i could worm that out of him i think id manage to frighten them  and what the deuce had i better do you see there was a bit of a row between us that is anty got frightened when i spoke to her of this rascal and then she left the house couldnt you make her understand that shed be all right if shed come to the house again  while barry lynch had been sleeping off the effects of the punch daly had been inquiring into the circumstances under which anty had left the house and he had pretty nearly learned the truth he knew therefore how much belief to give to his clients representation  i dont think said he that your sister will be likely to come back at present she will probably find herself quieter and easier at the inn you see she has been used to a quiet life  but if she remains there she can marry that young ruffian any moment she takes it into her head to do so theres always some rogue of a priest ready to do a job of that sort  exactly so mr lynch of course your sister can marry whom she pleases and when she pleases and neither you nor any one else can prevent her but still  then what the devils the use of my paying you to come here and tell me that  thats your affair i didnt come without being sent for but i was going to tell you that though we cant prevent her from marrying if she pleases we may make her afraid to do so you had better write her a kind affectionate note regretting what has taken place between you and promising to give her no molestation of any kind if she will return to her own houseand keep a copy of this letter then i will see moylan and if i can do anything with him it will be necessary that you should also see him you could come over to tuam and meet him in my office and then i will try and force an entrance into the widows castle and if possible see your sister and humbug the ould woman into a belief that she has laid herself open to criminal indictment we might even go so far as to have notices served on them but if they snap their fingers at us we can do nothing further my advice in that case would be that you should make the best terms in your power with martin kelly  and let the whole thing go id soonerwhy daly i believe youre as bad as blake youre afraid of these huxtering thieves  if you go on in that way mr lynch youll get no professional gentleman to act with you i give you my best advice it you dont like it you neednt follow it but you wont get a solicitor in connaught to do better for you than what im proposing  confusion muttered barry and he struck the hot turf in the grate a desperate blow with the tongs which he had in his hands and sent the sparks and bits of fire flying about the hearth  the truth is you see your sisters in her full senses theres the divil a doubt of that the moneys her own and she can marry whom she pleases all that we can do is to try and make the kellys think they have got into a scrape  but this letterwhat on earth am i to say to her  ill just put down what i would say were i you and if you like you can copy it daly then wrote the following letter      my dear anty     before taking other steps which could not fail of being very    disagreeable to you and to others i wish to point out to you how    injudiciously you are acting in leaving your own house and to try    to induce you to do that which will be most beneficial to yourself    and most conducive to your happiness and respectability if you    will return to dunmore house i most solemnly promise to leave you    unmolested i much regret that my violence on thursday should have    annoyed you but i can assure you it was attributable merely to my    anxiety on your account nothing however shall induce me to repeat    it but you must be aware that a little inn is not a fit place for    you to be stopping at and i am obliged to tell you that i have    conclusive evidence of a conspiracy having been formed by the    family with whom you are staying to get possession of your money    and that this conspiracy was entered into very shortly after the    contents of my fathers will had been made public i must have    this fact proved at the assizes and the disreputable parties to it    punished unless you will consent at any rate for a time to put    yourself under the protection of your brother     in the meantime pray believe me dear anty in spite of    appearances     your affectionate brother     barry lynch   it was then agreed that this letter should be copied and signed by barry and delivered by terry on the following morning which was sunday daly then returned to tuam with no warm admiration for his client  in the meantime the excitement at the inn arising from antys arrival and martins return was gradually subsiding these two important events both happening on the same day sadly upset the domestic economy of mrs kellys establishment sally had indulged in tea almost to stupefaction and katties elfin locks became more than ordinarily disordered on the following morning however things seemed to fall a little more into their places the widow was as usual behind her counter and if her girls did not give her as much assistance as she desired of them and as much as was usual with them they were perhaps excusable for they could not well leave their new guest alone on the day after her coming to them  martin went out early to toneroe doubtless the necessary labours of the incipient spring required him at the farm but i believe that if his motives were analysed he hardly felt himself up to a têteàtête with his mistress before he had enjoyed a cool days consideration of the extraordinary circumstances which had brought her into the inn as his mothers guest he moreover wished to have a little undisturbed conversation with meg and to learn from her how anty might be inclined towards him just at present so martin spent his morning among his lambs and his ploughs and was walking home towards dusk tired enough when he met barry lynch on horseback that hero having come out as usual for his solitary ride to indulge in useless dreams of the happy times he would have were his sister only removed from her tribulations in this world though martin had never been on friendly terms with his more ambitious neighbour there had never up to this time been any quarrel between them and he therefore just muttered good morning mr lynch as he passed him on the road  barry said nothing and did not appear to see him as he passed but some idea struck him as soon as he had passed and he pulled in his horse and hallooed out kellyand as martin stopped he added come here a momenti want to speak to you  well mr barry what is it said the other returning lynch paused and evidently did not know whether to speak or let it alone at last he said never mindill get somebody else to say what i was going to say but youd better look sharp what youre about my lad or youll find yourself in a scrape that you dont dream of  and is that all you called me back for said martin  thats all i mean to say to you at present  well then mr lynch i must say youre very good and im shure i will look sharp enough but to my thinking dyou know you want looking afther yourself a precious dale more than i do and then he turned to proceed homewards but said as he was goinghave you any message for your sisther mr lynch  by my young man ill make you pay for what youre doing answered barry  i know youll be glad to hear shes pretty well shes coming round from the thratement she got the other night though by all accounts its a wondher shes alive this moment to tell of it  barry did not attempt any further reply but rode on sorry enough that he had commenced the conversation martin got home in time for a snug tea with anty and his sisters and succeeded in prevailing on the three to take each a glass of punch and before anty went to bed he began to find himself more at his ease with her and able to call her by her christian name without any disagreeable emotion he certainly had a most able coadjutor in meg she made room on the sofa for him between herself and his mistress and then contrived that the room should be barely sufficient so that anty was rather closely hemmed up in one corner moreover she made anty give her opinion as to martins looks after his metropolitan excursion and tried hard to make martin pay some compliments to antys appearance but in this she failed although she gave him numerous opportunities  however they passed the evening very comfortablyquite sufficiently so to make anty feel that the kindly humble friendship of the inn was infinitely preferable to the miserable grandeur of dunmore house and it is probable that all the lovemaking in the world would not have operated so strongly in martins favour as this feeling meg however was not satisfied for as soon as she had seen jane and anty into the bedroom she returned to her brother and lectured him as to his lukewarm manifestations of affection  martin said she returning into the little sittingroom and carefully shutting the door after her youre the biggest bosthoon of a gandher i ever see to be losing your opportunities with anty this way i blieve its waiting you are for herself to come forward to you do you think a young woman dont expect something more from a lover than jist for you to sit by her and go on all as one as though she was one of your own sisthers av once she gets out of this before the priest has made one of the two of you mind i tell you itll be all up with you i wondher martin you havent got more pluck in you  oh bother meg youre thinking of nothing but kissing and slobbheringantys not the same as you and jane and doesnt be all agog for such nonsense  i tell you martin antys a woman and take my word for it what another girl likes wont come amiss to her besides why dont you spake to her  spakewhy what would you have me spake  well martin youre a fool have you or have you not made up your mind to marry anty  to be shure i will av shell have me  and do you expect her to have you without asking  shure you know didnt i ask her often enough  ah but you must do more than jist ask her that way shell never make up her mind to go before the priest unless you say something sthronger to her jist tell her plump out youre ready and willing and get the thing done before lent whats to hindher youshure you know she added in a whisper youll not get sich a fortune as antys in your way every day spake out man and dont be afraid of her take my word she wont like you a bit the worse for a few kisses  martin promised to comply with his sisters advice and to sound anty touching their marriage on the following morning after mass  on the sunday morning at breakfast the widow proposed to anty that she should go to mass with herself and her daughters but anty trembled so violently at the idea of showing herself in public after her escape from dunmore house that the widow did not press her to do so although afterwards she expressed her disapprobation of antys conduct to her own girls  i dont see what she has to be afeard of said she in going to get mass from her own clergyman in her own chapel she dont think i suppose that barry lynchd dare come in there to pull her out before the blessed altar glory be to god  ah but mother you know she has been so frighted  frighted indeed shell get over these tantrums i hope before sunday next or i know where ill wish her again  so anty was left at home and the rest of the family went to mass when the women returned meg manoeuvred greatly and in fine successfully that no one should enter the little parlour to interrupt the wooing she intended should take place there she had no difficulty with jane for she told her what her plans were and though her less energetic sister did not quite agree in the wisdom of her designs and pronounced an opinion that it would be better to let things settle down a bit still she did not presume to run counter to megs views but meg had some work to dispose of her mother it would not have answered at all as meg had very well learned herself to caution her mother not to interrupt martin in his lovemaking for the widow had no charity for such follies she certainly expected her daughters to get married and wished them to be well and speedily settled but she watched anything like a flirtation on their part as closely as a cat does a mouse if any young man were in the house shed listen to the fall of his footsteps with the utmost care and when she had reason to fear that there was anything like a lengthened têteàtête upstairs she would steal on the pair if possible unawares and interrupt without the least reserve any billing and cooing which might be going on sending the delinquent daughter to her work and giving a glower at the swain which she expected might be sufficient to deter him from similar offences for some little time  the girls consequently were taught to be on the alertto steal about on tiptoe to elude their mothers watchful ear to have recourse to a thousand little methods of deceiving her and to baffle her with her own weapons the mother if she suspected that any prohibited frolic was likely to be carried on at a late hour would tell her daughters that she was going to bed and would shut herself up for a couple of hours in her bedroom and then steal out eavesdropping peeping through keyholes and listening at doorhandles and the daughters knowing their mothers practice would not come forth till the listening and peeping had been completed and till they had ascertained by some infallible means that the old woman was between the sheets  each party knew the tricks of the other and yet taking it all in all the widow got on very well with her children and everybody said what a good mother she had been she was accustomed to use deceit and was therefore not disgusted by it in others whether the system of domestic manners which i have described is one likely to induce to sound restraint and good morals is a question which i will leave to be discussed by writers on educational points  however meg managed it she did contrive that her mother should not go near the little parlour this sunday morning and anty was left alone to receive her lovers visit i regret to say that he was long in paying it he loitered about the chapel gates before he came home and seemed more than usually willing to talk to anyone about anything at last however just as meg was getting furious he entered the inn  why martin you born ideotav she aint waiting for you this hour and more  thim thats long waited for is always welcome when they do come replied martin  well afther all ive done for you are you going in nowcause av you dont ill go and tell her not to be tasing herself about you ill neither be art or part in any such schaming  schaming is it meg faith itd be a clever fellowd beat you at that and without waiting for his sisters sharp reply he walked into the little room where anty was sitting  so anty you wouldnt come to mass he began  maybe ill go next sunday said she  its a long time since you missed mass before im thinking  not since the sunday afther fathers death  its little you were thinking then how soon youd be stopping down here with us at the inn  thats thrue for you martin god knows  at this point of the conversation martin stuck fast he did not know rosalinds recipe 29 for the difficulty a man feels when he finds himself gravelled for conversation with his mistress so he merely scratched his head and thought hard to find what hed say next i doubt whether the conviction which was then strong on his mind that meg was listening at the keyhole to every word that passed at all assisted him in the operation at last some muse came to his aid and he made out another sentence       footnote 29 rosalinds recipein as you like it act iii                    sc ii rosalind disguised as a young man                    instructs orlando to practice his wooing on her  it was very odd my finding you down here all ready before me wasnt it  deed it was your mother was a very good woman to me that morning anyhow  and tell me now anty do you like the inn  deed i dobut its quare like  how quare  why having meg and jane here i wasnt ever used to anyone to talk to only just the servants  youll have plenty always to talk to noweh anty and martin tried a sweet look at his lady love  im shure i dont know av im only left quiet thats what i most care about  but anty tell meyou dont want always to be what you call quiet  oh but i dowhy not  but you dont mane anty that you wouldnt like to have some kind of work to dosome occupation like  why i wouldnt like to be idle but a person neednt be idle because theyre quiet  and thats thrue anty and martin broke down again  thered be a great crowd in chapel i suppose said anty  there was a great crowd  and what was father geoghegan preaching about  well then i didnt mind to tell the truth anty i came out most as soon as the preaching began only i know he told the boys to pray that the liberathor might be got out of his throubles and so they shouldnot that theres much to throuble him as far as the verdicts concerned  isnt there then i thought they made him out guilty  so they did the false ruffians but what harum ll that do they darent touch a hair of his head  politics however are not a favourable introduction to lovemaking so martin felt and again gave up the subject in the hopes that he might find something better what a fool the man is thought meg to herself at the doorif i had a lover went on like that wouldnt i pull his ears  martin got upwalked across the roomlooked out of the little windowfelt very much ashamed of himself and returning sat himself down on the sofa  anty he said at last blushing nearly brown as he spoke were you thinking of what i was spaking to you about before i went to dublin  anty blushed also now about what she said  why just about you and me making a match of it come anty dear whats the good of losing time ive been thinking of little else and after whats been between us you must have thought the matther over too though you do let on to be so innocent come anty now that you and mothers so thick there can be nothing against it  but indeed there is martin a great dale against itthough im sure its good of you to be thinking of me theres so much against it i think we had betther be of one mind and give it over at once  and whats to hinder us marrying anty av yourself is plazed av you and i and mother are plazed sorrow a one that i know of has a word to say in the matther  but barry dont like it  and afther all are you going to wait for what barry likes you didnt wait for what was plazing to barry lynch when you came down here nor yet did mother when she went up and fetched you down at five in the morning dreading hed murdher you outright and it was thrue for her for he would av he was let the brute and are you going to wait for what he likes  whatever hes done hes my brother and theres only the two of us  but its not that antydont you know its not that isnt it because youre afraid of him because he threatened and frightened you and what on arth could he do to harum you av you was the wife ofof a man whod anyway not let barry lynch or anyone else come between you and your comfort and aise  but you dont know how wretched ive been since he spoke to me aboutabout getting myself married you dont know what ive suffered and ive a feeling that good would never come of it  and afther all are you going to tell me now that i may jist go my own way is that to be your answer and all im to get from you  dont be angry with me martin im maning to do everything for the best  maningwhats the good of maning anyways anty let me have an answer for ill not be making a fool of myself any longer somehow all the boys here every sowl in dunmore has it that you and i is to be marriedand now afther promising me as you did  oh i never promised martin  it was all one as a promiseand now im to be thrown overboard and whybecause barry lynch got dhrunk and frightened you av id seen the ruffian striking you i think id ve been near putting it beyond him to strike another woman iver again  glory be to god that you wasnt near him that night said anty crossing herself it was bad enough but av the two of you should ever be set fighting along of me it would kill me outright  but whos talking of fighting anty dear and martin drew a little nearer to herwhos talking of fighting i never wish to spake another word to barry the longest day that ever comes av hell get out of my way ill go bail hell not find me in his  but he wouldnt get out of your way nor get out of mine av you and i got married hed be in our way and wed be in his and nothing could iver come of it but sorrow and misery and maybe bloodshed  thems all a womans fears av you an i were once spliced by the priest god bless him barry wouldnt trouble dunmore long afther  thats another rason too why should i be dhriving him out of his own house you know hes a right to the house as well as i  whos talking of dhriving him out faith hed be welcome to stay there long enough for me hed go fast enough without dhriving though you cant say the counthry wouldnt have a good riddhance of him but never mind that anty it wasnt about barry one way or the other i was thinking when i first asked you to have me nor it wasnt about myself altogether as i could let you know though in course im not saying but that myselfs as dear to myself as another an why not but to tell the blessed truth i was thinking av you too and that youd be happier and asier let alone betther an more respecthable as an honest mans wife as id make you than being mewed up there in dread of your life never daring to open your mouth to a christian for fear of your own brother who niver did nor niver will lift a hand to sarve you though he wasnt backward to lift it to sthrike you woman and sisther though you were come anty darlin he added after a pause during which he managed to get his arm behind her back though he couldnt be said to have it fairly round her waistget quit of all these quandaries and say at once like an honest girl youll do what im askingand what no living man can hindher you from or say against itor else jist fairly say you wont and ill have done with it  anty sat silent for she didnt like to say she wouldnt and she thought of her brothers threats and was afraid to say she would martin advanced a little in his proceedings however and now succeeded in getting his arm round her waistand having done so he wasnt slow in letting her feel its pressure she made an attempt with her hand to disengage herselfcertainly not a successful and probably not a very energetic attempt when the widows step was heard on the stairs martin retreated from his position on the sofa and meg from hers outside the door and mrs kelly entered the room with barrys letter in her hand meg following to ascertain the cause of the unfortunate interruption     xviii  an attorneys office in connaught   anty heres a letter for ye began the widow terrys brought it down from the house and says its from misther barry i blieve he was in the right not to bring it hisself  a letther for me mrs kelly what can he be writing about i dont just know whether i ought to open it or no and anty trembled as she turned the epistle over and over again in her hands  what for would you not open it the letther cant hurt you girl whatever the writher might do  thus encouraged anty broke the seal and made herself acquainted with the contents of the letter which daly had dictated but she then found that her difficulties had only just commenced was she to send an answer and if so what answer and if she sent none what notice ought she to take of it the matter was one evidently too weighty to be settled by her own judgment so she handed the letter to be read first by the widow and then by martin and lastly by the two girls who by this time were both in the room  well the dethermined impudence of that blackguard exclaimed mrs kelly conspiracyav that dont bang banagher what does the man mean by conspiracy eh martin  faith you must ask himself that mother and then its ten to one he cant tell you  i suppose said meg he wants to say that were all schaming to rob anty of her moneyonly he darent for the life of him spake it out straight forrard  or maybe suggested jane he wants to bring something agen us like this affair of oconnellsonly hell find down here that he ant got dublin soft goods to deal wid  then followed a consultation as to the proper steps to be taken in the matter  the widow advised that father geoghegan should be sent for to indite such a reply as a christian illused woman should send to so base a letter meg who was very hot on the subject and who had read of some such proceeding in a novel was for putting up in a blank envelope the letter itself and returning it to barry by the hands of jack the ostler at the same time she declared that no surrender should be her motto jane was of opinion that miss anastasia lynchs compliments to mr barry lynch and she didnt find herself strong enough to move to dunmore house at present would answer all purposes and be on the whole the safest course while martin pronounced that if anty would be led by him shed just pitch the letter behind the fire an take no notice of it good bad or indifferent  none of these plans pleased anty for as she remarked after all barry was her brother and blood was thickher than wather so after much consultation pen ink and paper were procured and the following letter was concocted between them all the soft bits having been great stumblingblocks in which however antys quiet perseverance carried the point in opposition to the wishes of all the kellys the words put in brackets were those peculiarly objected to      dunmore inn february 1844     dear barry     i am very sorry i cant come back to the house at any rate just    at present i am not very sthrong in health and there are kind    female friends about me here which you know there couldnt be up at    the house   anty herself in the original draft inserted ladies but the widows good sense repudiated the term and insisted on the word females jane suggested that females did not sound quite respectful alone and martin thought that anty might call them female friends which was consequently done      besides there are reasons why im quieter here till things are a    little more settled i will forgive and forget all that happened    up at the house between us   why you cant forget it said meg oh i could av he was kind to me id forget it all in a week av he was kind to me answered anty      and i will do nothing particular without first letting you know   they were all loud against this paragraph but they could not carry their point      i must tell you dear barry that you are very much mistaken about    the people of this house they are dear kind friends to me and    wherever i am i must love them to the last day of my lifebut    indeed i am and hope you believe so     your affectionate sister     anastasia lynch   when the last paragraph was read over antys shoulder meg declared she was a dear dear creature jane gave her a big kiss and began crying even the widow put the corner of her apron to her eye and martin trying to look manly and unconcerned declared that he was quite shure they all loved her and theyd be brutes and bastes av they didnt  the letter as given above was finally decided on written sealed and despatched by jack who was desired to be very particular to deliver it at the front door with miss lynchs love which was accordingly done all the care however which had been bestowed on it did not make it palatable to barry who was alone when he received it and merely muttered as he read it confound her lowminded slut friends indeed what business has she with friends except such as i pleaseif id the choosing of her friends theyd be a strait waistcoat and the madhouse doctor good heaven that half my propertyno but twothirds of itshould belong to herthe stupid stiffnecked robber  these last pleasant epithets had reference to his respected progenitor  on the same evening after tea martin endeavoured to make a little further advance with anty for he felt that he had been interrupted just as she was coming round but her nerves were again disordered and he soon found that if he pressed her now he should only get a decided negative which he might find it very difficult to induce her to revoke  antys letter was sent off early on the monday morningat least as early as barry now ever managed to do anythingto the attorney at tuam with strong injunctions that no time was to be lost in taking further steps and with a request that daly would again come out to dunmore this however he did not at present think it expedient to do so he wrote to barry begging him to come into tuam on the wednesday to meet moylan whom he daly would if possible contrive to see on the intervening day  obstinate puppy said barry to himselfif hed had the least pluck in life hed have broken the will or at least made the girl out a lunatic but a connaught lawyer hasnt half the wit or courage now that he used to have however he wrote a note to daly agreeing to his proposal and promising to be in tuam at two oclock on the wednesday  on the following day daly saw moylan and had a long conversation with him the old man held out for a long time expressing much indignation at being supposed capable of joining in any underhand agreement for transferring miss lynchs property to his relatives the kellys and declaring that he would make public to every one in dunmore and tuam the base manner in which barry lynch was treating his sister indeed moylan kept to his story so long and so firmly that the young attorney was nearly giving him up but at last he found his weak side  well mr moylan he said then i can only say your own conduct is very disinterestedand i might even go so far as to say that you appear to me foolishly indifferent to your own concerns heres the agency of the whole property going abegging the rents i believe are about a thousand ayear you might be recaving them all by jist a word of your mouth and that only telling the blessed truth and here youre going to put the whole thing into the hands of young kelly throwing up even the half of the business you have got  who says im afther doing any sich thing mr daly  why martin kelly says so didnt as many as four or five persons hear him say down at dunmore that divil a one of the tenantsd iver pay a haporth 30 of the november rents to anyone only jist to himself there was father geoghegan heard him an doctor ned blake       footnote 30 haporthhalfpennys worth  maybe hell find his mistake mr daly  maybe he will mr moylan maybe well put the whole affair into the courts and have a regular recaver over the property under the chancellor people though theyre ever so respectable in their wayand i dont mane to say a word against the kellys mr moylan for they were always friends of minebut people cant be allowed to make a dead set at a property like this and have it all their own way like the bull in the chinashop i know there has been an agreement made and that in the eye of the law is a conspiracy i positively know that an agreement has been made to induce miss lynch to become martin kellys wife and i know the parties to it too and i also know that an active young fellow like him wouldnt be paying an agent to get in his rents and i thought if mr lynch was willing to appoint you his agent as well as his sisters it might be worth your while to lend us a hand to settle this affair without forcing us to stick people into a witnessbox whom neither i nor mr lynch  but what the dl can i  jist hear me out mr moylan you see if they once knewthe kellys i manethat you wouldnt lend a hand to this piece of iniquity  which piece of iniquity mr dalyfor im entirely bothered  ah now mr moylan none of your fun this piece of iniquity of theirs i say for i can call it no less if they once knew that you wouldnt help em theyd be obliged to drop it all the matterd never have to go into court at all and youd jist step into the agency fair and aisy and into the bargain youd do nothing but an honest mans work  the old man broke down and consented to go agin the kellys as he somewhat ambiguously styled his apostasy provided the agency was absolutely promised to him and he went away with the understanding that he was to come on the following day and meet mr lynch  at two oclock punctual to the time of his appointment moylan was there and was kept waiting an hour in dalys little parlour at the end of this time barry came in having invigorated his courage and spirits with a couple of glasses of brandy daly had been for some time on the lookout for him for he wished to say a few words to him in private and give him his cue before he took him into the room where moylan was sitting this could not well be done in the office for it was crowded it would i think astonish a london attorney in respectable practice to see the manner in which his brethren towards the west of ireland get through their work dalys office was open to all the world the front door of the house of which he rented the ground floor was never closed except at night nor was the door of the office which opened immediately into the hail  during the hour that moylan was waiting in the parlour daly was sitting with his hat on upon a high stool with his feet resting on a small counter which ran across the room smoking a pipe a boy about seventeen years of age dalys clerk was filling up numbers of those abominable formulas of legal persecution in which attorneys deal and was plying his trade as steadily as though no february blasts were blowing in on him through the open door no sounds of loud and boisterous conversation were rattling in his ears the dashing manager of one of the branch banks in the town was sitting close to the little stove and raking out the turf ashes with the office rule while describing a drinkingbout that had taken place on the previous sunday at blakes of blakemount he had a cigar in his mouth and was searching for a piece of wellkindled turf wherewith to light it a little fat oily shopkeeper in the town who called himself a woollen merchant was standing with the raised leaf of the counter in his hand roaring with laughter at the managers story two frieze coated farmers outside the counter were stretching across it and whispering very audibly to daly some details of litigation which did not appear very much to interest him and a couple of idle blackguards were leaning against the wall ready to obey any behest of the attorneys which might enable them to earn a sixpence without labour and listening with all their ears to the different interesting topics of conversation which might be broached in the inner office  heres the very man im waiting for at last said daly when from his position on the stool he saw through the two open doors the bloated red face of barry lynch approaching and giving an impulse to his body by a shove against the wall behind him he raised himself on to the counter and assisting himself by a pull at the collar of the frieze coat of the farmer who was in the middle of his story jumped to the ground and met his client at the front door  i beg your pardon mr lynch said he as soon as he had shaken hands with him but will you just step up to my room a minute for i want to spake to you and he took him up into his bedroom for he hadnt a second sittingroom youll excuse my bringing you up here for the office was full you see and moylans in the parlour  the dl he is he came round then did he eh daly  oh ive had a terrible hard game to play with him id no idea hed be so tough a customer or make such a good fight but i think ive managed him  there was a regular plan then eh daly just as i said it was a regular planned scheme among them  wait a moment and youll know all about it at least as much as i know myself and to tell the truth thats devilish little but if we manage to break off the match and get your sister clane out of the inn there you must give moylan your agency at any rate for two or three years  you havent promised that  but i have though we can do nothing without it it was only when i hinted that that the old sinner came round  but what the deuce is it hes to do for us after all  hes to allow us to put him forward as a bugbear to frighten the kellys with thats all and if we can manage that thats enough but come down now i only wanted to warn you that if you think the agency is too high a price to pay for the mans services whatever they may be you must make up your mind to dispense with them  well answered barry as he followed the attorney downstairs i cant understand what youre about but i suppose you must be right and they went into the little parlour where moylan was sitting  moylan and barry lynch had only met once since the former had been entrusted to receive antys rents on which occasion moylan had been grossly insulted by her brother barry remembering the meeting felt very awkward at the idea of entering into amicable conversation with him and crept in at the door like a whipped dog moylan was too old to feel any such compunctions and consequently made what he intended to be taken as a very complaisant bow to his future patron he was an illmade ugly stumpy man about fifty with a blotched face straggling sandy hair and grey shaggy whiskers he wore a long brown great coat buttoned up to his chin and this was the only article of wearing apparel visible upon him in his hands he twirled a shining new fourandfourpenny hat  as soon as their mutual salutations were over daly commenced his business  there is no doubt in the world mr lynch said he addressing barry that a most unfair attempt has been made by this family to get possession of your sisters propertya most shameful attempt which the law will no doubt recognise as a misdemeanour but i think we shall be able to stop their game without any law at all which will save us the annoyance of putting mr moylan here and other respectable witnesses on the table mr moylan says that very soon afther your fathers will was made known  now mr dalyshure i niver said a word in life at all about the will said moylan interrupting him  no you did not i mane very soon afther you got the agency  divil a word i said about the agency either  well well some time agohe says that some time ago he and martin kelly were talking over your sisters affairs i believe the widow was there too  ah now mr dalywhyd you be putting them words into my mouth sorrow a word of the kind i iver utthered at all  what the deuce was it you did say then  faix i dont know that i said much at all  didnt you say mr moylan that martin kelly was talking to you about marrying anty some six weeks ago  maybe i did he was spaking about it  and if you were in the chair now before a jury wouldnt you swear that there was a schame among them to get anty lynch married to martin kelly come mr moylan thats all we want to know if you cant say as much as that for us now just that we may let the kellys know what sort of evidence we could bring against them if they push us we must only have you and others summoned and see what youll have to say then  oh id say the truth mr dalydivil a lessand id do as much as that now but i thought mr lynch was wanting to say something about the property  not a word then ive to say about it said barry except that i wont let that robber young kelly walk off with it as long as theres law in the land  mr moylan probably meant about the agency observed daly  barry looked considerably puzzled and turned to the attorney for assistance he manes continued daly that he and the kellys are good friends and it wouldnt be any convenience to him just to say anything that wouldnt be pleasing to them unless we could make him independent of themisnt that about the long and the short of it mr moylan  indepindent of the kellys is it mr dalyfaix thin im teetotally indepindent of them this minute and mane to continue so glory be to god oh im not afeard to tell the thruth agin ere a kelly in galway or roscommonand av that was all i dont see why i need have come here this day when im called upon in the rigular way and has a rigular question put me before the jury either at sessions or sizes youll find ill not be bothered for an answer and av thats all i blieve i may be goingand he made a movement towards the door  just as you please mr moylan said daly and you may be sure that youll not be long without an opportunity of showing how free you are with your answers but as a friend i tell you youll be wrong to lave this room till youve had a little more talk with mr lynch and myself i believe i mentioned to you mr lynch was looking out for someone to act as agent over his portion of the dunmore property  barry looked as black as thunder but he said nothing  you war mr daly av i could accommodate mr lynch im shure id be happy to undhertake the business  i believe mr lynch said daly turning to the other i may go so far as to promise mr moylan the agency of the whole property provided miss lynch is induced to quit the house of the kellys of course mr moylan you can see that as long as miss lynch is in a position of unfortunate hostility to her brother the same agent could not act for both but i think my client is inclined to put his property under your management providing his sister returns to her own home i believe im stating your wishes mr lynch  manage it your own way said barry for i dont see what youre doing if this man can do anything for me why i suppose i must pay him for it and if so your plans as good a way of paying him as another  the attorney raised his hat with his hand and scratched his head he was afraid that moylan would have again gone off in a pet at lynchs brutality but the old man sat quite quiet he wouldnt have much minded what was said to him as long as he secured the agency  you see mr moylan continued daly you can have the agency five per cent upon the rents is what my client  no dalyfive per centim shot if i do exclaimed barry  im gething twentyfive pounds per annum from miss anty for her half and i wouldnt think of collecting the other for less declared moylan  and then a long battle followed on this point which it required all dalys tact and perseverance to adjust the old man was pertinacious and many whispers had to be made into barrys ear before the matter could be settled it was however at last agreed that notice was to be served on the kellys of barry lynchs determination to indict them for a conspiracy that daly was to see the widow martin and if possible anty and tell them all that moylan was prepared to prove that such a conspiracy had been formedcare was also to be taken that copies of the notices so served should be placed in antys hands moylan in the meantime agreed to keep out of the way and undertook should he be unfortunate enough to encounter any of the family of the kellys to brave the matter out by declaring that av he war brought before the judge and jury he couldnt do more than tell the blessed thruth and why not in reward for this he was to be appointed agent over the entire property the moment that miss lynch left the inn at which time he was to receive a document signed by barry undertaking to retain him in the agency for four years certain or else to pay him a hundred pounds when it was taken from him  these terms having been mutually agreed to and barry having with many oaths declared that he was a most shamefully illused man the three separated moylan skulked off to one of his haunts in the town barry went to the bank to endeavour to get a bill discounted 30 and daly returned to his office to prepare the notices for the unfortunate widow and her son       footnote 30 bill discounteda common way for young men to                    borrow money in nineteenth century britain was to                    sign a promissory note an iou often called a                    bill to repay the loan at a specified time the                    lender gave the borrower less than the face value                    of the note that is he discounted the note                    the difference being the interest sometimes these                    notes were cosigned by a third party who became                    responsible for repaying the loan if the borrower                    defaulted this is one of the major themes in                    trollopes later book framley parsonage trollope                    himself was quite familiar with methods of                    borrowing having gotten into debt in his youth     xix  mr daly visits the dunmore inn   daly let no grass grow under his feet for early on the following morning he hired a car and proceeded to dunmore with the notices in his pocket his feelings were not very comfortable on his journey for he knew that he was going on a bad errand and he was not naturally either a heartless or an unscrupulous man considering that he was a provincial attorney but he was young in business and poor and he could not afford to give up a client he endeavoured to persuade himself that it certainly was a wrong thing for martin kelly to marry such a woman as anty lynch and that barry had some show of justice on his side but he could not succeed he knew that martin was a frank honourable fellow and that a marriage with him would be the very thing most likely to make anty happy and he was certain moreover that however anxious martin might naturally be to secure the fortune he would take no illegal or even unfair steps to do so he felt that his client was a ruffian of the deepest die that his sole object was to rob his sister and that he had no case which it would be possible even to bring before a jury his intention now was merely to work upon the timidity and ignorance of anty and the other females and to frighten them with a bugbear in the shape of a criminal indictment and daly felt that the work he was about was very very dirty work two or three times on the road he had all but made up his mind to tear the letters he had in his pocket and to drive at once to dunmore house and tell barry lynch that he would do nothing further in the case and he would have done so had he not reflected that he had gone so far with moylan that he could not recede without leaving it in the old rogues power to make the whole matter public  as he drove down the street of dunmore he endeavoured to quiet his conscience by reflecting that he might still do much to guard anty from the ill effects of her brothers rapacity and that at any rate he would not see her property taken from her though she might be frightened out of her matrimonial speculation  he wanted to see the widow martin and anty and if possible to see them at first separately and fortune so far favoured him that as he got off the car he saw our hero standing at the inn door  ah mr daly said he coming up to the car and shaking hands with the attorney for daly put out his hand to himhow are you againi suppose youre going up to the house they say youre barrys right hand man now were you coming into the inn  why i will step in just this minute but ive a word i want to spake to you first  to me said martin  yes to you martin kelly isnt that quare and then he gave directions to the driver to put up the horse and bring the car round again in an hours time d you remember my telling you the day we came into dunmore on the car together that i was going up to the house  faith i do well its not so long since  and do you mind my telling you i didnt know from adam what it was for that barry lynch was sending for me  and i remember that too  and that i tould you that when i did know i shouldnt tell you  begad you did mr daly thim very words  why then martin i tould you what wasnt thrue for im come all the way from tuam this minute to tell you all about it  martin turned very red for he rightly conceived that when an attorney came all the way from tuam to talk to him the tidings were not likely to be agreeable  and is it about barry lynchs business  it is  then its schames theres divil a doubt of that  it is schames as you say martin said daly slapping him on the shoulderfine schamesno less than a wife with four hundred ayear wouldnt that be a fine schame  deed it would mr daly av the wife and the fortune were honestly come by  and isnt it a hundred pities that i must come and upset such a pretty schame as that but for all that its thrue im sorry for you martin but you must give up anty lynch  give her up is it faith i havent got her to give up worse luck  nor never will martin and thats worse luck again  well mr daly av thats all youve come to say you might have saved yourself carhire miss lynch is nothing to me mind how should she be but av she war neither barry lynchwhos as big a rogue as there is from this to hisself and back againnor you who i take it aint rogue enough to do barrys work wouldnt put me off it  well martin thank ee for the compliment but now you know what ive come about and theres no joke in it of course i dont want you to tell me anything of your plans but as mr lynchs lawyer i must tell you so much as this of histhat if his sister doesnt lave the inn and honestly assure him that shell give up her intention of marrying you hes determined to take proceedings he then fumbled in his pocket and bringing out the two notices handed to martin the one addressed to him read that and itll give you an idea what were afther and when i tell you that moylan owns and will swear to it too that he was present when all the plans were made youll see that were not going to sea without wind in our sails  wellim shot av i know the laist in the world what all this is about said martin as he stood in the street reading over the legallyworded letterconspiracywell thatll do mr daly go onenticing away from her homethats good when the blackguard nearly knocked the life out of her and mother brought her down here from downright charity and to prevent murdherwake intellectswell mr daly i didnt expect this kind of thing from you begorra i thought you were above thiswake intellects faith theyre a dale too sthrong and too goodand too wide awake too for barry to get the betther of her that way not that im in the laist in life surprised at anything hed do but i thought that you mr daly wouldnt put your hands to such work as that  daly felt the rebuke and felt it strongly too but now that he was embarked in the business he must put the best face he could upon it still it was a moment or two before he could answer the young farmer  why he saidwhy did you put your hands to such a dirty job as this martinyou were doing well and not in wantand how could you let anyone persuade you to go and sell yourself to an ugly ould maid for a few hundred pounds dont you know that if you were married to her this minute youd have a lawsuit thatd go near to ruin you before you could get possession of the property  av im in want of legal advice mr daly which thank god im not nor likely to bebut av i war its not from barry lynchs attorney id be looking for it  id be sorry to see you in want of it martin but if you mane to keep out of the worst kind of law youd better have done with anty lynch id a dale sooner be drawing up a marriage settlement between you and some pretty girl with five or six hundred pound fortune than id be exposing to the counthry such a mane trick as this youre now afther of seducing a poor halfwitted ould maid like anty lynch into a disgraceful marriage  look here mr daly said the other youve hired yourself out to barry lynch and you must do his work i suppose whether its dirthy or clane and you know yourself as well as i can tell you which its likely to be  thats my concern lave that to me youve quite enough to do to mind yourself  but av hes nothing betther for you to do than to send you here ballyragging and calling folks out of their name he must have a sight more money to spare than i give him credit for and you must be a dale worse off than your neighbours thought you to do it for him  thatll do said mr daly knocking at the door of the inn only remember mr kelly youve now received notice of the steps which my client feels himself called upon to take  martin turned to go away but then reflecting that it would be as well not to leave the women by themselves in the power of the enemy he also waited at the door till it was opened by katty  is miss lynch within asked daly  go round to the shop katty said martin and tell mother to come to the door theres a gentleman wanting her  it was miss lynch i asked for said daly still looking to the girl for an answer  do as i bid you you born ideot and dont stand gaping there shouted martin to the girl who immediately ran off towards the shop  i might as well warn you mr kelly that if miss lynch is denied to me the fact of her being so denied will be a very sthrong proof against you and your family in fact it amounts to an illegal detention of her person in the eye of the law daly said this in a very low voice almost a whisper  faith the law must have quare eyes av it makes anything wrong with a young lady being asked the question whether or no she wishes to see an attorney at eleven in the morning  an attorney whispered meg to jane and anty at the top of the stairs  heaven and arth said poor anty shaking and shiveringwhats going to be the matter now  its young daly said jane stretching forward and peeping clown the stairs i can see the curl of his whiskers  by this time the news had reached mrs kelly in the shop that a sthrange gentleman war axing for miss anty but that she warnt to be shown to him on no account so the widow dropped her tobacco knife flung off her dirty apron and having summoned jane and meg to attend to the mercantile affairs of the establishmentturned into the inn and met mr daly and her son still standing at the bottom of the stairs  the widow curtsied ceremoniously and wished mr daly good morning and he was equally civil in his salutation  mr dalys going to have us all before the assizes mother well never get off without the treadmill any way its well av the whole kit of us dont have to go over the wather at the queens expense  the lord be good to us said the widow crossing herself whats the matter mr daly  your sons joking maam i was only asking to see miss lynch on business  step upstairs mother into the big parlour and dont lets be standing talking here where all the world can hear us  and wilcome for me im shuresaid the widow stroking down the front of her dress with the palms of her hands as she walked upstairsand wilcome too for me im very shure ive said or done nothing as i wish to consail mr daly will you be plazed to take a chair and the widow sat down herself on a chair in the middle of the room with her hands folded over each other in her lap as if she was preparing to answer questions from that time to a very late hour in the evening  and now mr dalyav youve anything to say to a poor widdy like me im ready  my chief object in calling mrs kelly was to see miss lynch would you oblige me by letting miss lynch know that im waiting to see her on business  maybe its a message from her brother mr daly said mrs kelly  you had better go in to miss lynch mother said martin and ask her av its pleasing to her to see mr daly she can see him in course av she likes  i dont see what good ll come of her seeing him rejoined the widow with great respect to you mr daly and not maning to say a word agin you i dont see how anty lynch ll be the betther for seeing ere an attorney in the counthry  i dont want to frighten you maam said daly but i can assure you you will put yourself in a very awkward position if you refuse to allow me to see miss lynch  ah mother said martin dont have a word to say in the matther at all one way or the other just tell anty mr daly wishes to see herlet her come or not just as she chooses whats she afeard of that she shouldnt hear what anyone has to say to her  the widow seemed to be in great doubt and perplexity and continued whispering with martin for some time during which daly remained standing with his back to the fire at length martin said av youve got another of them notices to give my mother mr daly why dont you do it  why to tell you the thruth answered the attorney i dont want to throuble your mother unless its absolutely necessary and although i have the notice ready in my pocket if i could see miss lynch i might be spared the disagreeable job of serving it on her  the holy virgin save us said the widow an what notice is it at all youre going to serve on a poor lone woman like me  be said by me mother and fetch anty in here mr daly wont expect i suppose but what you should stay and hear what it is he has to say  both you and your mother are welcome to hear all that i have to say to the lady said daly for he felt that it would be impossible for him to see anty alone  the widow unwillingly got up to fetch her guest when she got to the door she turned round and said and is there a notice as you calls it to be sarved on miss lynch  not a line mrs kelly not a line on my honour i only want her to hear a few words that im commissioned by her brother to say to her  and youre not going to give her any papernor nothing of that sort at all  not a word mrs kelly  ah mother said martin mr daly couldnt hurt her av he war wishing and hes not go and bring her in  the widow went out and in a few minutes returned bringing anty with her trembling from head to foot the poor young woman had not exactly heard what had passed between the attorney and the mother and her son but she knew very well that his visit had reference to her and that it was in some way connected with her brother she had therefore been in a great state of alarm since meg and jane had left her alone when mrs kelly came into the little room where she was sitting and told her that mr daly had come to dunmore on purpose to see her her first impulse was to declare that she wouldnt go to him and had she done so the widow would not have pressed her but she hesitated for she didnt like to refuse to do anything which her friend asked her and when mrs kelly said martin says as how the man cant hurt you anty so youd betther jist hear what it is he has to say she felt that she had no loophole of escape and got up to comply  but mind anty whispered the cautious widow as her hand was on the parlour door becase this daly is wanting to speak to you thats no rason you should be wanting to spake to him so if youll be said by me youll jist hould your tongue and let him say on  fully determined to comply with this prudent advice anty followed the old woman and curtseying at daly without looking at him sat herself down in the middle of the old sofa with her hands crossed before her  anty said martin making great haste to speak before daly could commence and then checking himself as he remembered that he shouldnt have ventured on the familiarity of calling her by her christian name in dalys presencemiss lynch i maneas mr daly here has come all the way from tuam on purpose to spake to you it wouldnt perhaps be manners in you to let him go back without hearing him but remember whatever your brother says or whatever mr daly says for himand its allone youre still your own mistress free to act and to spake to come and to go and that neither the one nor the other can hurt you or mother or me nor anybody belonging to us  god knows said daly i want to have no hand in hurting any of you but to tell the truth martin it would be well for miss lynch to have a better adviser than you or she may get herself and what shell think more of shell get her friendsmaning you mrs kelly and your familyinto a heap of throubles  oh god forbid thin exclaimed anty  niver mind us mr daly said the widow the kellys was always able to hould their own thanks be to glory  well ive said my say mr daly said martin and now do you say yourn as for throubles weve all enough of thim but your own must have been bad when you undhertook this sort of job for barry lynch  mind yourself martin as i told you before and youll about have enough to domiss lynch ive been instructed by your brother to draw up an indictment against mrs kelly and mr kelly charging them with conspiracy to get possession of your fortune  a what shouted the widow jumping up from her chairto rob anty lynch of her fortune id have

indeed  if youll let me finish what i have to say mrs kelly i think youll find it betther for the whole of us said daly  go on thin and be quick with it but dont talk to dacent people about robbers any more robbers indeed theyre not far to fitch and black robbers too glory be to god  your brother miss lynch is determined to bring this matter before a jury at the assizes for the sake of protecting you and your property  protecthing anty lynchis it barry the holy virgin defind her from sich prothection a broken head the first moment the dhrink makes his heart sthrong enough to sthrike her  ah mother youre a fool exclaimed martin why cant you let the man go onaint he paid for saying it well mr daly begorra i pity you to have such things on your tongue but go on go on and finish it  your brother conceives this to be his duty continued daly rather bothered by the manner in which he had to make his communication and it is a duty which he is determined to go through with  duty said the widow with a twist of her nose and giving almost a whistle through her lips in a manner which very plainly declared the contempt she felt for barrys ideas of duty  with this object continued daly i have already handed to martin kelly a notice of what your brother means to do and i have another notice prepared in my pocket for his mother the next step will be to swear the informations before a magistrate and get the committals made out mrs kelly and her son will then have to give bail for their appearance at the assizes  and so we can said the widow betther bail than eer a lynch or dalynot but what the dalys is respictablebetther bail any way than eer a lynch in galway could show either for sessions or sizes by night or by day winter or summer  ah mother you dont understhand hes maning that were to be tried in the dock for staling antys money  faix but thatd be a good joke isnt anty to the fore herself to say whos robbed her take an ould womans advice mr daly and go back to tuam it aint so asy to put salt on the tail of a dunmore bird  and so i will mrs kelly said daly but you must let me finish what i have to tell miss lynchthis will be a proceeding most disagreeable to your brothers feelings  failings indeed muttered the widow faix i blieve his chief failing at presents for sthrong dhrink  but he must go on with it unless you at once lave the inn return to your own home and give him your promise that you will never marry martin kelly  anty blushed deep crimson over her whole face at the mention of her contemplated marriage and to tell the truth so did martin  here is the notice said daly taking the paper out of his pocket and the matter now rests with yourself if youll only tell me that youll be guided by your brother on this subject ill burn the notice at once and ill undertake to say that as far as your property is concerned your brother will not in the least interfere with you in the management of it  and good rason why mr daly said the widowjist becase he cant  well miss lynch am i to tell your brother that you are willing to oblige him in this matter  whatever effect dalys threats may have had on the widow and her son they told strongly upon anty for she sat now the picture of misery and indecision at last she said oh lord defend me what am i to do mrs kelly  do said martin why what should you dobut just wish mr daly good morning and stay where you are snug and comfortable  av you war to lave this anty and go up to dunmore house afther all thats been said and done id say barry was right and that ballinasloe asylum was the fitting place for you said the widow  the blessed virgin guide and prothect me said anty for i want her guidance this minute oh that the walls of a convent was round me this minutei wouldnt know what throuble was  and you neednt know anything about throuble said martin who didnt quite like his mistresss allusion to a convent you dont suppose theres a word of thruth in all this long story of mr dalyshe knowsand ill say it out to his facehe knows barry dont dare carry on with sich a schame he knows hes only come here to frighten you out of this that barry may have his will on you again  and god forgive him his errand here this day said the widow for it was a very bad one  if you will allow me to offer you my advice miss lynch said daly you will put yourself at any rate for a time under your brothers protection  she wont do no sich thing said the widow what to be locked into the parlour aginand be nigh murdhered holy father  oh no said anty at last shuddering in horror at the remembrance of the last night she passed in dunmore house i cannot go back to live with him but ill do anything else av hell only lave me and my kind kind friends in pace and quiet  indeed and you wont anty said the widow youll do nothing for him your frindsthats av you mane the kellysis very able to take care of themselves  if your brother miss lynch will lave dunmore house altogether and let you have it to yourself will you go and live there and give him the promise not to marry martin kelly  indeed an she wont said the widow shell give no promise of the kind promise indeed what for should she promise barry lynch whom she will marry or whom she wont  raily mrs kelly i think you might let miss lynch answer for herself  i wouldnt for all the world thin go to live at dunmore house said anty  and you are determined to stay in this inn here  in course she isthats till shes a snug house of her own said the widow  ah mother said martin what for will you be talking  and youre determined repeated daly to stay here  i am faltered anty  then i have nothing further to do than to hand you this mrs kellyand he offered the notice to the widow but she refused to touch it and he consequently put it down on the table but it is my duty to tell you miss lynch that the gentry of this counthry before whom you will have to appear will express very great indignation at your conduct in persevering in placing poor people like the kellys in so dreadful a predicament by your wilful and disgraceful obstinacy  poor anty burst into tears she had been for some time past trying to restrain herself but dalys last speech and the horrible idea of the gentry of the country browbeating and frowning at her completely upset her and she hid her face on the arm of the sofa and sobbed aloud  poor people like the kellys shouted the widow now for the first time really angry with dalynot so poor mr daly as to do dirthy work for anyone i wish i could say as much this day for your mothers son poor people indeed i suppose now you wouldnt call barry lynch one of your poor people but in my mind hes the poorest crature living this day in county galway av youve done now mr daly youve my lave to be walking and the less you let the poor kellys see of you from this time out the betther  when antys sobs commenced martin had gone over to her to comfort her ah anty dear he whispered to her shure youd not be minding what such a fellow as hed be saying to youshure hes jist paid for all thishes only sent here by barry to thry and frighten youbut it was of no avail daly had succeeded at any rate in making her miserable and it was past the power of martins eloquence to undo what the attorney had done  well mr daly he said turning round sharply i suppose you have done here now and the sooner you turn your back on this place the bettheran you may take this along with you av you think youve frightened my mother or me youre very much mistaken  yes said daly i have done now and i am sorry my business has been so unpleasant your mother martin had betther not disregard that notice good morning miss lynch good morning mrs kelly good morning martin and daly took up his hat and left the room  good morning to you mr daly said martin as ive said before im sorry to see youve taken to this line of business  as soon as the attorney was gone both martin and his mother attempted to console and reassure poor anty but they did not find the task an easy one oh mrs kelly she said as soon as she was able to say anything im sorry i iver come here i am im sorry i iver set my foot in the house  dont say so anty dear said the widow whatd you be sorry forant it the best place for you  oh but to think that id bring all these throubles on you betther be up there and bear it all than bring you and yours into law and sorrow and expense only i couldnt find the words in my throat to say it id ve tould the man that id ve gone back at once i wish i hadindeed mrs kelly i wish i had  why anty said martin you ant fool enough to believe what dalys been saying shure all hes afther is to frighthen you out of this never fear barry cant hurt us a halfporth though no doubt hes willing enough av he had the way  i wish i was in a convent this moment said anty oh i wish id done as father asked me long since av the walls of a convent was around me id niver know what throubles was  no more you shant now said martin whos to hurt you come anty look up theres nothing in all this to vex you  but neither son nor mother were able to soothe the poor young woman the very presence of an attorney was awful to her and all the jargon which daly had used of juries judges trials and notices had sounded terribly in her ears the very names of such things were to her terrible realities and she couldnt bring herself to believe that her brother would threaten to make use of such horrible engines of persecution without having the power to bring them into action then visions of the lunatic asylum into which he had declared that he would throw her flitted across her and made her whole body shiver and shake and again she remembered the horrid glare of his eye the hot breath and the frightful form of his visage on the night when he almost told her that he would murder her  poor anty had at no time high or enduring spirits but such as she had were now completely quelled a dreadful feeling of coming evila foreboding of misery such as will sometimes overwhelm stronger minds than antys seemed to stifle her and she continued sobbing till she fell into hysterics when meg and jane were summoned to her assistance they sat with her for above an hour doing all that kindness and affection could suggest but after a time anty told them that she had a cold sick feeling within herself that she felt weak and ill and that shed sooner go to bed to bed they accordingly took her and sally brought her tea and katty lighted a fire in her room and jane read to her an edifying article from the lives of the saints and meg argued with her as to the folly of being frightened but it was all of no avail before night anty was really ill  the next morning the widow was obliged to own to herself that such was the case in the afternoon doctor colligan was called in and it was many many weeks before anty recovered from the effects of the attorneys visit    xx  very liberal   when the widow left the parlour after having placed her guest in the charge of her daughters she summoned her son to follow her down stairs and was very careful not to leave behind her the notice which daly had placed on the table as soon as she found herself behind the shutter of her little desk which stood in the shopwindow she commenced very eagerly spelling it over the purport of the notice was to inform her that barry lynch intended immediately to apply to the magistrates to commit her and her son for conspiring together to inveigle anty into a marriage and that the fact of their having done so would be proved by mr moylan who was prepared to swear that he had been present when the plan had been arranged between them the reader is aware that whatever show of truth there might be for this accusation as far as martin and moylan himself were concerned the widow at any rate was innocent and he can conceive the good ladys indignation at the idea of her own connection moylan having been seduced over to the enemy though she had put on a bold front against daly and though she did not quite believe that barry was in earnest in taking proceedings against her still her heart failed her as she read the legal technicalities of the papers she held in her hand and turned to her son for counsel in considerable tribulation  but there must be something in it i tell you said she though barry lynch and that limb o the divil young daly d stick at nothin in the way of lies and desait theyd niver go to say all this about moylan unless hed agree to do their bidding  thats like enough mother i dare say moylan has been talked overbought over rather for hes not one of them asd do mischief for nothin  and does the ould robber mane to say that i as i live i niver as much as mentioned antys name to moylan except jist about the agency  im shure you didnt mother  and what is it then he has to say agin us  jist lies thats av he were called on to say anything but he niver will be this is all one of barrys schames to frighten you and get anty turned out of the inn  thin master barry doesnt know the widdy kelly i can tell him that for when i puts my hand to a thing i mane to pull through wid it but tell meall thisll be costing money wont it attorneys dont bring thim sort of things about for nothing and she gave a most contemptuous twist to the notice  oh barry must pay for that  i doubt that martin hes not fond of paying the mane dirthy blackguard i tell you what you shouldnt iver have let daly inside the house hell make us pay for the writing o thim as shure as my names mary kelly av he hadnt got into the house he couldntve done a halfporth  i tell you mother it wouldnt have done not to let him see anty theyd have said wed got her shut up here and wouldnt let any one come nigh her  well martin youll see well have to pay for it this comes of meddling with other folks i wonder how i was iver fool enough to have fitched her down heregood couldnt come of daling with such people as barry lynch  but you wouldnt have left her up there to be murdhered  shes nothin to me and i dont know as shes iver like to be  maybe not  but tell me martinwas there anything said between you and moylan about anty before she come down here  how anything said mother  why was there any schaming betwixt you  schamingwhen i want to schame ill not go shares with sich a fellow as moylan  ah but was there anything passed about anty and you getting married come now martin im in all this throuble along of you and you shouldnt lave me in the dark was you talking to moylan about anty and her fortune  why thin ill jist tell you the whole thruth as i tould it all before to mister frankthat is lord ballindine up in dublin and as i wouldnt mind telling it this minute to barry or daly or any one else in the three counties when moylan got the agency he come out to me at toneroe and afther talking a bit about anty and her fortune he let on as how it would be a bright spec for me to marry her and i wont deny that it was he as first put it into my head well thin he had schames of his own about keeping the agency and getting a nice thing out of the property himself for putting anty in my way but i tould him downright i didnt know anything about that and that av iver i did anything in the matter it would be all fair and above board and that was all the conspiracy i and moylan had  and enough too martin said the widow youll find its quite enough to get us into throuble and why wouldnt you tell me what was going on between you  there was nothing going on between us  i say there wasand to go and invaigle me into your schames without knowing a word about itit was a murdhering shame of youand av i do have to pay for it ill never forgive you  thats right mother quarrel with me about it do it was i made you bring anty down here wasnt it when i was up in dublin all the time  but to go and put yourself in the power of sich a fellow as moylan i didnt think you were so soft  ah bother mother whos put themselves in the power of moylan  ill moyle him and spoil him too the false blackguard to turn agin the familythem as has made him i wondher what hes to get for swearing agin usand then after a pause she added in a most pathetic voice oh martin to think of being dragged away to galway before the whole counthry to be made a conspirather of i that always paid my way before and behind though only a poor widdy whos to mind the shop i wondherim shure megs not able and therell be maryll be jist nigh her time and wont be able to come martin youve been and ruined me with your plots and your marriages what did you want with a wife i wondher and you so well offand mrs kelly began wiping her eyes for she was affected to tears at the prospect of her coming misery  av you take it so to heart mother youd betther give anty a hint to be out of this you heard daly tell her that was all barry wanted  martin knew his mother tolerably well or he would not have made this proposition he understood what the real extent of her sorrow was and how much of her lamentation he was to attribute to her laudable wish to appear a martyr to the wishes and pleasures of her children  turn her out replied she no niver and i didnt think id ve heard you asking me to  i didnt ask you motheronly anythingd be betther than downright ruin  i wouldnt demane myself to barry so much as to wish her out of this now shes here but it was along of you she came here and av ive to pay for all this lawyer work you oughtnt to see me at a loss im shure i dont know where your sisthers is to look for a pound or two when im gone av things goes on this way and again the widow whimpered  dont let that throuble you mother av theres anything to pay i wont let it come upon you any way but i tell you therell be nothing more about it  mrs kelly was somewhat quieted by her sons guarantee and muttering that she couldnt afford to be wasting her mornings in that way diligently commenced weighing out innumerable threehalfporths of brown sugar and martin went about his own business  daly left the inn after his interview with anty and the kellys in anything but a pleasant frame of mind in the first place he knew that he had been signally unsuccessful and that his want of success had been mainly attributable to his having failed to see anty alone and in the next place he felt more than ever disgusted with his client he began to reflect for the first time that he might and probably would irretrievably injure his character by undertaking as martin truly called it such a very low line of business that if the matter were persevered in every one in connaught would be sure to hear of antys persecution and that his own name would be so mixed up with lynchs in the transaction as to leave him no means of escaping the ignominy which was so justly due to his employer beyond these selfish motives of wishing to withdraw from the business he really pitied anty and felt a great repugnance at being the means of adding to her troubles and he was aware of the scandalous shame of subjecting her again to the illtreatment of such a wretch as her brother by threatening proceedings which he knew could never be taken  as he got on the car to return to tuam he determined that whatever plan he might settle on adopting he would have nothing further to do with prosecuting or persecuting either anty or the kellys ill give him the best advice i can about it said daly to himself and if he dont like it he may do the other thing i wouldnt carry on with this game for all hes worth and that i believe is not much he had intended to go direct to dunmore house from the kellys and to have seen barry but he would have had to stop for dinner if he had done so and though generally speaking not very squeamish in his society he did not wish to enjoy another afterdinner têteàtête with himits better to get him over to tuam thought he and try and make him see rason when hes sober nothings too hot or too bad for him when hes mad dhrunk afther dinner  accordingly lynch was again summoned to tuam and held a second council in the attorneys little parlour daly commenced by telling him that his sister had seen him and had positively refused to leave the inn and that the widow and her son had both listened to the threats of a prosecution unmoved and undismayed barry indulged in his usual volubility of expletives expressed his fixed intention of exterminating the kellys declared with many asseverations his conviction that his sister was a lunatic swore by everything under in and above the earth that he would have her shut up in the lunatic asylum in ballinasloe in the teeth of the lord chancellor and all the other lawyers in ireland cursed the shades of his father deeply and copiously assured daly that he was only prevented from recovering his own property by the weakness and ignorance of his legal advisers and ended by asking the attorneys advice as to his future conduct  what the dl then am i to do with the confounded ideot said he  if youll take my advice youll do nothing  what and let her marry and have that young blackguard brought up to dunmore under my very nose  im very much afraid mr lynch if you wish to be quit of martin kelly it is you must lave dunmore you may be shure he wont  oh as for that ive nothing to tie me to dunmore i hate the place i never meant to live there if i only saw my sister properly taken care of and that it was put out of her power to throw herself away i should leave it at once  between you and me mr lynch she will be taken care of and as for throwing herself away she must judge of that herself take my word for it the best thing for you to do is to come to terms with martin kelly and to sell out your property in dunmore youll make much better terms before marriage than you would afther it stands to rason  barry was half standing and half sitting on the small parlour table and there he remained for a few minutes meditating on dalys most unpleasant proposal it was a hard pill for him to swallow and he couldnt get it down without some convulsive grimaces he bit his under lip till the blood came through it and at last said  why youve taken this thing up daly as if you were to be paid by the kellys instead of by me i cant understand it confound me if i can  daly turned very red at the insinuation he was within an ace of seizing lynch by the collar and expelling him in a summary way from his premises a feat which he was able to perform and willing also for he was sick of his client but he thought of it a second time and restrained himself  mr lynch he said after a moment or two thats the second time youve made an observation of that kind to me and ill tell you what if your business was the best in the county instead of being as bad a case as was ever put into a lawyers hands i wouldnt stand it from you if you think you can let out your passion against me as you do against your own people youll find your mistake out very soon so youd betther mind what youre saying  why what the devil did i say said lynch half abashed  ill not repeat itand you hadnt betther either and now do you choose to hear my professional advice and behave to me as you ought and shall do or will you go out of this and look out for another attorney to tell you the truth id jist as lieve youd take your business to some one else  barrys brow grew very black and he looked at daly as though he would much like to insult him again if he dared but he did not dare he had no one else to look to for advice or support he had utterly estranged from him his fathers lawyer and though he suspected that daly was not true to him he felt that he could not break with him he was obliged therefore to swallow his wrath though it choked him and to mutter something in the shape of an apology  it was a mutter daly heard something about its being only a joke and not expecting to be taken up so d sharp and accepting these sounds as an amende honorable 32 again renewed his functions as attorney       footnote 32 amende honorablefrench apology  will you authorise me to see martin kelly and to treat with him youll find it the cheapest thing you can do and more than that itll be what nobody can blame you for  how treat with himi owe him nothingi dont see what ive got to treat with him about am i to offer him half the property on condition hell consent to marry my sister is that what you mean  no thats not what i mean but itll come to much the same thing in the end in the first place you must withdraw all opposition to miss lynchs marriage indeed you must give it your direct sanction and in the next place you must make an amicable arrangement with martin about the division of the property  whatcoolly give him all he has the impudence to askthrow up the game altogether and pitch the whole stakes into his lapwhy daly you  well mr lynch finish your speech said daly looking him full in the face  barry had been on the point of again accusing the attorney of playing false to him but he paused in time he caught dalys eye and did not dare to finish the sentence which he had begun  i cant understand you i mean said he i cant understand what youre after but go on maybe youre right but i cant see for the life of me what am i to get by such a plan as that  barry was now cowed and frightened he had no drambottle by him to reassure him and he became comparatively speaking calm and subdued indeed before the interview was over he fell into a pitiably lachrymose tone and claimed sympathy for the many hardships he had to undergo through the illtreatment of his family  ill try and explain to you mr lynch what youll get by it as far as i can understand your father left about eight hundred ayear between the twothats you and your sisther and then theres the house and furniture nothing on earth can keep her out of her property or prevent her from marrying whom she plases martin kelly who is an honest fellow though sharp enough has set his eye on her and before many weeks youll find hell make her his wife undher these circumstances wouldnt he be the best tenant you could find for dunmore youre not fond of the place and will be still less so when hes your brotherinlaw lave it altogether mr lynch give him a laise of the whole concern and if youll do that now at once take my word for it youll get more out of dunmore than iver you will by staying here and fighting the matther out  but about the debts daly  why i suppose the fact is the debts are all your own eh  wellsuppose they are  exactly so personal debts of your own why when youve made some final arrangement about the property you must make some other arrangement with your creditors but thats quite a separate affair you dont expect martin kelly to pay your debts i suppose  but i might get a sum of money for the goodwill mightnt i  i dont think martins able to put a large sum down ill tell you what i think you might ask and what i think he would give to get your goodwill and consent to the match and to prevent any further difficulty i think hed become your tenant for the whole of your share at a rent of fivehundred a year and maybe hed give you three hundred pounds for the furniture and stock and things about the place if so you should give him a laise of three lives  there was a good deal in this proposition that was pleasing to barrys mind five hundred ayear without any trouble in collecting it the power of living abroad in the unrestrained indulgence of hotels and billiard rooms the probable chance of being able to retain his income and bilk his creditors the prospect of shaking off from himself the consequences of a connection with the kellys and being for ever rid of dunmore encumbrances these things all opened before his eyes a vista of future idle uncontrolled enjoyment just suited to his taste and strongly tempted him at once to close with dalys offer but still he could hardly bring himself to consent to be vanquished by his own sister it was wormwood to him to think that after all she should be left to the undisturbed enjoyment of her fathers legacy he had been browbeaten by the widow insulted by young kelly cowed and silenced by the attorney whom he had intended to patronise and convert into a creature of his own he could however have borne and put up with all this if he could only have got his will of his sister but to give up to her who had been his slave all his lifeto own at last that he had no power over her whom he had always looked upon as so abject so mean a thing to give in of his own accord to the robbery which had been committed on him by his own father and to do this while he felt convinced as he still did that a sufficiently unscrupulous attorney could save him from such cruel disgrace and loss was a trial to which he could hardly bring himself to submit crushed and tamed as he was  he still sat on the edge of the parlour table and there he remained mute balancing the pros and cons of dalys plan daly waited a minute or two for his answer and finding that he said nothing left him alone for a time to make up his mind telling him that he would return in about a quarter of an hour barry never moved from his position it was an important question he had to settle and so he felt it for he gave up to the subject his undivided attention since his boyhood he had looked forward to a life of ease pleasure and licence and had longed for his fathers death that he might enjoy it it seemed now within his reach for his means though reduced would still be sufficient for sensual gratification but idle unprincipled brutal castaway wretch as barry was he still felt the degradation of inaction when he had such stimulating motives to energy as unsatisfied rapacity and hatred for his sister ignorant as he was of the meaning of the word right he tried to persuade himself that it would be wrong in him to yield  could he only pluck up sufficient courage to speak his mind to daly and frighten him into compliance with his wishes he still felt that he might be successfulthat he might by some legal tactics at any rate obtain for himself the management of his sisters property but this he could not do he felt that daly was his master and though he still thought that he might have triumphed had he come sufficiently prepared that is with a considerable quantum of spirits inside him he knew himself well enough to be aware that he could do nothing without this assistance and alas he could not obtain it there he had great reliance in the efficacy of whiskey he would trust much to a large dose of port wine but with brandy he considered himself invincible  he sat biting his lip trying to think trying to make up his mind trying to gain sufficient selfcomposure to finish his interview with daly with some appearance of resolution and selfconfidence but it was in vain when the attorney returned his face still plainly showed that he was utterly unresolved utterly unable to resolve on anything  well mr lynch said daly will you let me spake to kelly about this or would you rather sleep on the matther  barry gave a long sighwouldnt he give six hundred daly hed still have two hundred clear and think what thatd be for a fellow like him  you must ask him for it yourself then ill not propose to him any such thing upon my soul hell be a great fool to give the five hundred because hes no occasion to meddle with you in the matther at all at all but still i think he may give it but as for asking for moreat any rate i wont do it you can do what you like yourself  and am i to sell the furniture and everythinghorses cattle and everything about the placefor three hundred pounds  not unless you like it you aint mr lynch but ill tell you thisif you can do so and do do so itll be the best bargain you ever mademind onehalf of it all belongs to your sisther  barry muttered an oath through his ground teeth he would have liked to scratch the ashes of his father from their restingplace and wreak his vengeance on them whenever this degrading fact was named to him  but i want the money daly said he i couldnt get afloat unless i had more than that i couldnt pay your bill you know unless i got a higher figure down than that come daly you must do something for me you must do something you know to earn the fees and he tried to look facetious by giving a wretched ghastly grin  my bill wont be a long one mr lynch and you may be shure im trying to make it as short as i can and as for earning it whatever you may think i can assure you i shall never have got money harder ive now given you my best advice if your minds not yet made up perhaps youll have the goodness to let me hear from you when it is and daly walked from the fire towards the door and placed his hand upon the handle of it  this was a hint which barry couldnt misunderstand well ill write to you he said and passed through the door he felt however that it was useless to attempt to trust himself to his own judgment and he turned back as daly passed into his officedaly he said step out one minute i wont keep you a second the attorney unwillingly lifted up the counter and came out to him manage it your own way said he do whatever you think best but you must see that ive been badly usedinfernally cruelly treated and you ought to do the best you can for me here am i giving away as i may say my own property to a young shopkeeper and upon my soul you ought to make him pay something for it upon my soul you ought for its only fair  ive tould you mr lynch what ill propose to martin kelly if you dont think the terms fair you can propose any others yourself or youre at liberty to employ any other agent you please  barry sighed again but he yielded he felt brokenhearted and unhappy and he longed to quit a country so distasteful to him and relatives and neighbours so ungrateful he longed in his heart for the sweet easy haunts of boulogne which he had never known but of which he had heard many a glowing description from congenial spirits whom he knew he had heard enough of the ways and means of many a leading star in that elysium to be aware that with five hundred ayear unembarrassed and punctually paid he might shine as a prince indeed he would go at once to that happy foreign shore where the memory of no father would follow him where the presence of no sister would degrade and irritate him where billiardtables were rife and brandy cheap where virtue was easy and restraint unnecessary where no duties would harass him no tenants upbraid him no duns persecute him there carefully guarding himself against the schemes of those less fortunate followers of pleasure among whom he would be thrown in his social hours he would convert every shilling of his income to some purpose of selfenjoyment and live a life of luxurious abandonment and he need not be altogether idle he reflected within himself afterwards as he was riding home he felt that he was possessed of sufficient energy and talent to make himself perfectly master of a pack of cards to be a proficient over a billiardtable and even to get the upper hand of a box of dice with such pursuits left to him he might yet live to be talked of feared and wealthy and barrys utmost ambition would have carried him no further  as i said before he yielded to the attorney and commissioned him fully to treat with martin kelly in the manner proposed by himself martin was to give him five hundred ayear for his share of the property and three hundred pounds for the furniture c and barry was to give his sister his written and unconditional assent to her marriage was to sign any document which might be necessary as to her settlement and was then to leave dunmore for ever daly made him write an authority for making such a proposal by which he bound himself to the terms should they be acceded to by the other party  but you must bear in mind added daly as his client for the second time turned from the door that i dont guarantee that martin kelly will accept these terms its very likely he may be sharp enough to know that he can manage as well without you as he can with you youll remember that mr lynch  i willi will daly but look hereif he bites freelyand i think he will and if you find you could get as much as a thousand out of him or even eight hundred you shall have one hundred clear for yourself  this was barrys last piece of diplomacy for that day daly vouchsafed him no answer but returned into his office and barry mounted his horse and returned home not altogether illpleased with his prospects but still regretting that he should have gone about so serious a piece of business so utterly unprepared  these regrets rose stronger when his afterdinner courage returned to him as he sate solitary over his fire i should have had him here said he to himself and not gone to that confounded cold hole of his after all theres no place for a cock to fight on like his own dunghill and theres nothing able to carry a fellow well through a tough bit of jobation 33 with a lawyer like a stiff tumbler of brandy punch itd have been worth a couple of hundred to me to have had him out hereimpertinent puppy well devil a halfpenny ill pay him this thought was consolatory and he began again to think of boulogne       footnote 33 jobationa tedious session scolding     xxi  lord ballindine at home   two days after the last recorded interview between lord ballindine and his friend dot blake the former found himself once more sitting down to dinner with his mother and sisters the honourable mrs okelly and the honourable misses okelly at least such were the titular dignities conferred on them in county mayo though i believe strictly speaking the young ladies had no claim to the appellation  mrs okelly was a very small woman with no particularly developed character and perhaps of no very general utility she was fond of her daughters and more than fond of her son partly because he was so tall and so handsome and partly because he was the lord the head of the family and the owner of the house she was on the whole a goodnatured person though perhaps her temper was a little soured by her husband having very unfairly died before he had given her a right to call herself lady ballindine she was naturally shy and reserved and the seclusion of okellys court did not tend to make her less so but she felt that the position and rank of her son required her to be dignified and consequently when in society she somewhat ridiculously aggravated her natural timidity with an assumed rigidity of demeanour she was however a good woman striving with small means to do the best for her family prudent and selfdenying and very diligent in looking after the house servants  her two daughters had been at the instance of their grandfather the courtier christened augusta and sophia after the two princesses of that name and were now called guss and sophy they were both pretty goodnatured girlsone with dark brown and the other light brown hair they both played the harp badly sung tolerably danced well and were very fond of nice young men they both thought kellys court rather dull but then they had known nothing better since they had grown up and there were some tolerably nice people not very far off whom they occasionally saw there were the dillons of ballyhaunis who had three thousand ayear and spent six they were really a delightful familythree daughters and four sons all unmarried and up to anything the sons all hunted shot danced and did everything that they ought to doat least in the eyes of young ladies though some of their more coldly prudent acquaintances expressed an opinion that it would be as well if the three younger would think of doing something for themselves but they looked so manly and handsome when they breakfasted at kellys court on a hunt morning with their bright tops red coats and huntingcaps that guss and sophy and a great many others thought it would be a shame to interrupt them in their career and then ballyhaunis was only eight miles from kellys court though they were irish miles it is true and the road was not patronised by the grand jury but the distance was only eight miles and there were always beds for them when they went to dinner at peter dillons then there were the blakes of castletown to be sure they could give no parties for they were both unmarried but they were none the worse for that and they had plenty of horses and went out everywhere and the blakes of morristown they also were very nice people only unfortunately old blake was always on his keeping and couldnt show himself out of doors except on sundays for fear of the bailiffs and the browns of mount dillon and the browns of castle brown and general bourke of creamstown all these families lived within fifteen or sixteen miles of kellys court and prevented the okellys from feeling themselves quite isolated from the social world their nearest neighbours however were the armstrongs and of them they saw a great deal  the reverend joseph armstrong was rector of ballindine and mrs okelly was his parishioner and the only protestant one he had and as mr armstrong did not like to see his church quite deserted and as mrs okelly was as she flattered herself a very fervent protestant they were all in all to each other  ballindine was not a good living and mr armstrong had a very large family he was therefore a poor man his children were helpless uneducated and improvident his wife was nearly worn out with the labours of bringing them forth and afterwards catering for them and a great portion of his own life was taken up in a hard battle with tradesmen and tithepayers creditors and debtors yet in spite of the insufficiency of his two hundred ayear to meet all or half his wants mr armstrong was not an unhappy man at any moment of social enjoyment he forgot all his cares and poverty and was always the first to laugh and the last to cease to do so he never refused an invitation to dinner and if he did not entertain many in his own house it was his fortune and not his heart that prevented him from doing so he could hardly be called a good clergyman and yet his remissness was not so much his own fault as that of circumstances how could a protestant rector be a good parish clergyman with but one old lady and her daughters for the exercise of his clerical energies and talents he constantly lauded the zeal of st paul for proselytism but as he himself once observed even st paul had never had to deal with the obstinacy of an irish roman catholic he often regretted the want of work and grieved that his profession as far as he saw and had been instructed required nothing of him but a short service on every sunday morning and the celebration of the eucharist four times ayear but such were the facts and the idleness which this want of work engendered and the habits which his poverty induced had given him a character as a clergyman very different from that which the high feelings and strict principles which animated him at his ordination would have seemed to ensure he was in fact a loose slovenly man somewhat too fond of his tumbler of punch a little lax perhaps as to clerical discipline but very staunch as to doctrine he possessed no industry or energy of any kind but he was goodnatured and charitable lived on friendly terms with all his neighbours and was intimate with every one that dwelt within ten miles of him priest and parson lord and commoner  such was the neighbourhood of kellys court and among such lord ballindine had now made up his mind to remain a while till circumstances should decide what further steps he should take with regard to fanny wyndham there were a few hunting days left in the season which he intended to enjoy and then he must manage to make shift to lull the time with shooting fishing farming and nursing his horses and dogs  his mother and sisters had heard nothing of the rumour of the quarrel between frank and fanny which mat tierney had so openly alluded to at handicap lodge and he was rather put out by their eager questions on the subject nothing was said about it till the servant withdrew after dinner but the three ladies were too anxious for information to delay their curiosity any longer  well frank said the elder sister who was sitting over the fire close to his left elbowhe had a bottle of claret at his rightwell frank do tell us something about fanny wyndham we are so longing to hear and you never will write you know  everybody says its a brilliant match said the mother they say here shes forty thousand pounds im sure i hope she has frank  but when is it to be said sophy shes of age now isnt she and i thought you were only waiting for that im sure we shall like her come frank do tell uswhen are we to see lady ballindine  frank looked rather serious and embarrassed but did not immediately make any reply  you havent quarrelled have you frank said the mother  the match isnt offis it said guss  miss wyndham has just lost her only brother said he he died quite suddenly in london about ten days since she was very much attached to him  good gracious how shocking said sophy  im sorry said guss  why frank said their mother now excited into absolute animation his fortune was more than double hers wasnt itwholl have it now  it was mother five times as much as hers i believe  gracious powers and who has it now why dont you tell me frank  his sister fanny  heavens and earthi hope youre not going to let her quarrel with you are you has there been anything between you have there been any words between you and lord cashel why dont you tell me frank when you know how anxious i am  if you must know all about it i have not had any words as you call them with fanny wyndham but i have with her guardian he thinks a hundred and twenty thousand pounds much too great a fortune for a connaught viscount however i dont think so it will be for time to show what fanny thinks meanwhile the less said about it the better remember that girls will you  oh we willwe wont say a word about it but shell never change her mind because of her money will she  thats what would make me love a man twice the more said guss or at any rate show it twice the stronger  frank said the anxious mother for heavens sake dont let anything stand between you and lord cashel think what a thing it is youd lose why itd pay all the debts and leave the property worth twice what it ever was before if lord cashel thinks you ought to give up the hounds do it at once frank anything rather than quarrel with him you could get them again you know when alls settled  ive given up quite as much as i intend for lord cashel  now frank dont be a fool or youll repent it all your life what does it signify how much you give up to such a man as lord cashel you dont think do you that he objects to our being at kellys court because im sure we wouldnt stay a moment if we thought that  mother i wouldnt part with a cur dog out of the place to please lord cashel but if i were to do everything on earth at his beck and will it would make no difference he will never let me marry fanny wyndham if he can help it but thank god i dont believe he can  i hope noti hope not youll never see half such a fortune again  well mother say nothing about it one way or the other to anybody and as you now know how the matter stands its no good any of us talking more about it till ive settled what i mean to do myself  i shall hate her said sophy if her getting all her brothers money changes her but im sure it wont and so the conversation ended  lord ballindine had not rested in his paternal halls the second night before he had commenced making arrangements for a hunt breakfast by way of letting all his friends know that he was again among them and so missives in guss and sophys handwriting were sent round by a barelegged little boy to all the mounts towns and castles belonging to the dillons blakes bourkes and browns of the neighbourhood to tell them that the dogs would draw the kellys court covers at eleven oclock on the following tuesday morning and that the preparatory breakfast would be on the table at ten this was welcome news to the whole neighbourhood it was only on the sunday evening that the sportsmen got the intimation and very busy most of them were on the following monday to see that their nags and breeches were all rightfit to work and fit to be seen the four dillons of ballyhaunis gave out to their grooms a large assortment of pipeclay and puttypowder bingham blake of castletown ordered a new set of girths to his hunting saddle and his brother jerry who was in no slight degree proud of his legs but whose nether trappings were rather the worse from the constant work of a heavy season went so far as to go forth very early on the monday morning to excite the ballinrobe tailor to undertake the almost impossible task of completing him a pair of doeskin by the tuesday morning the work was done and the breeches home at castletown by eightthough the doeskin had to be purchased in tuam and an assistant artist taken away from his mothers wake to sit up all night over the seams but then the tailor owed a small trifle of arrear of rent for his potatogarden and his landlord was jerry blakes cousingerman 34 theres nothing carries one further than a good connexion thought both jerry and the tailor when the job was finished       footnote 34 cousingermanfirst cousin  among the other invitations sent was one to martin kellynot exactly worded like the others for though lord ballindine was perhaps more anxious to see him than anyone else martin had not yet got quite so high in the ladder of life as to be asked to breakfast at kellys court but the fact that frank for a moment thought of asking him showed that he was looking upwards in the worlds estimation frank wrote him a note himself saying that the hounds would throw off at kellys court at eleven that if he would ride over he would be sure to see a good hunt and that he lord ballindine had a few words to say to him on business just while the dogs were being put into the cover martin as usual had a good horse which he was disposed to sell if as he said he got its value and wrote to say he would wait on lord ballindine at eleven the truth was frank wanted to borrow money from him  another note was sent to the glebe requesting the rector to come to breakfast and to look at the hounds being thrown off the modest style of the invitation was considered as due to mr armstrongs clerical position but was hardly rendered necessary by his habits for though the parson attended such meetings in an old suit of rusty black and rode an equally rustylooking pony he was always to be seen at the end of the day among those who were left around the dogs  on the tuesday morning there was a good deal of bustle at kellys court all the boys about the place were collected in front of the house to walk the gentlemens horses about while the riders were at breakfast and earn a sixpence or a fourpenny bit and among them sitting idly on the big steppingstone placed near the door was jack the fool who for the day seemed to have deserted the service of barry lynch  and now the redcoats flocked up to the door and it was laughable to see the knowledge of character displayed by the gossoons in the selection of their customers one or two who were known to be bad pays were allowed to dismount without molestation of any kind and could not even part with their steeds till they had come to an absolute bargain as to the amount of gratuity to be given lambert brown was one of these unfortunate charactersa younger brother who had a little and but a very little money and who was determined to keep that he was a miserable hangeron at his brothers house without profession or prospects greedy stingy and disagreeable endowed with a squint and long lank lightcoloured hair he was a bad horseman always craning and shirking in the field boasting and lying after dinner nevertheless he was invited and endured because he was one of the browns of mount dillon cousin to the browns of castle brown nephew to mrs dillon the members wife and third cousin of lord ballaghaderrin  he dismounted in the gravel circle before the door and looked round for someone to take his horse but none of the urchins would come to him at last he caught hold of a little ragged boy whom he knew from his own side of the country and who had come all the way there eight long irish miles on the chance of earning sixpence and seeing a hunt  here patsy come here you born little divil and he laid hold of the arm of the brat who was trying to escape from himcome and hold my horse for meand ill not forget you  shure yer honer mr lambert i cant thin for im afther engaging myself this blessed minute to mr larry dillon only hes jist trotted round to the stables to spake a word to mick keogh  dont be lying you little blackguard hould the horse and dont stir out of that  shure how can i mr lambert when ive been and guv my word to mr larry and the little fellow put his hands behind him that he might not be forced to take hold of the reins  dont talk to me you young imp but take the horse ill not forget you when i come out whats the matter with you you fool dye think id tell you a lie about it  patsy evidently thought he would for though he took the horse almost upon compulsion he whimpered as he did so and said  shure mr lambert would you go and rob a poor boy of his chancesi comed all the way from ballyglass this blessed morning to arn a tizzy and av i doesnt get it from you this turn ill but lambert brown had gone into the house and on his return after breakfast he fully justified the lads suspicion for he again promised him that he wouldnt forget him and that hed see him some day at mr dillons  well lambert brown said the boy as that worthy gentleman rode off its youre the raal blackguardand its well all the counthry knows you sorrow be your bed this night its little the poorll grieve for you when youre stretched or the rich either for the matther of that  very different was the reception bingham blake got as he drove up with his tandem and taxcart halfadozen had kept themselves idle each in the hope of being the lucky individual to come in for binghams shilling  och mr bingham shure im first roared one fellow  but the first as he styled himself was soon knocked down under the wheels of the cart by the others  mr blake thinmr blake darlintdoesnt ye remimber the promise you guv me  mr jerry mr jerry avickthis was addressed to the brotherspake a word for me do yer honour shure it was i come all the way from teddy mahonys with the breeches this morning god bless em and the fine legs as is in em  but they were all balked for blake had his servant there  get out you blackguards said he raising his tandem whip as if to strike them get out you robbers are you going to take the cart and horses clean away from me that marell settle some of ye if you make so free with her shes not a bit too chary of her hind feet get out of that i tell you and he lightly struck with the point of his whip the boy who had lambert browns horse  ah mr bingham said the boy pretending to rub the part very hard you owe me one for that anyhow and its you are the good mark for it god bless you  faix said another one blow from your honour is worth two promises from lambert brown any way  there was a great laugh at this among the ragged crew for lambert brown was still standing on the doorsteps when he heard this sally however he walked in and the different redcoats and topboots were not long in crowding after him  lord ballindine received them in the same costume and very glad they all seemed to see him again when an irish gentleman is popular in his neighbourhood nothing can exceed the real devotion paid to him and when that gentleman is a master of hounds and does not require a subscription he is more than ever so  welcome back ballindinebetter late than never but why did you stay away so long said general bourke an old gentleman with long thin flowing grey hairs waving beneath his broadbrimmed felt huntinghat youre not getting so fond of the turf i hope as to be giving up the field for it give me the sport where i can ride my own horse myself not where i must pay a young rascal for doing it for me and robbing me into the bargain most likely  quite right general said frank so you see ive given up the curragh and come down to the dogs again  yes but youve waited too long man the dogs have nearly done their work for this year im sorry for it the last day of the season is the worst day in the year to me im ill for a week after it  well general please the pigs well be in great tune next october ive as fine a set of puppies to enter as there is in ireland let alone connaught you must come down and tell me what you think of them  next octobers all very well for you young fellows but im seventyeight i always make up my mind that ill never turn out another season and itll be true for me this year im hunting over sixty years ballindine in these three counties i ought to have had enough of it by this time youll say  ill bet you ten pounds said bingham blake that you hunt after eighty  done with you bingham said the general and the bet was booked  general bourke was an old soldier who told the truth in saying that he had hunted over the same ground sixty years ago but he had not been at it ever since for he had in the meantime seen a great deal of hard active service and obtained high military reputation but he had again taken kindly to the national sport of his country on returning to his own estate at the close of the peninsular war and had ever since attended the meets twice a week through every winter with fewer exceptions than any other member of the hunt he always wore topbootsof the ancient cut with deep painted tops and square toes drawn tight up over the calf of his leg a pair of most capacious darkcoloured leather breeches the origin of which was unknown to any other present member of the hunt and a red frock coat very much soiled by weather water and wear the general was a rich man and therefore always had a horse to suit him on the present occasion he was riding a strong brown beast called parsimony that would climb over anything and creep down the gable end of a house if he were required to do so he was got by oeconomy those who know county mayo know the breed well  they were now all crowded into the large diningroom at kellys court about fiveandtwenty redcoats and mr armstrongs rusty black in spite of his shabby appearance however and the fact that the greater number of those around him were roman catholics he seemed to be very popular with the lot and his opinion on the important subject of its being a scenting morning was asked with as much confidence in his judgment as though the foxes of the country were peculiarly subject to episcopalian jurisdiction  well then peter said he the winds in the right quarter mick says theres a strong dogfox in the long bit of gorse behind the firs if he breaks from that he must run towards ballintubber and when youre once over the meering 5 into roscommon theres not an acre of tilled land unless a herds garden between that andthe deuce knows where allfurther than most of youll like to ride i take it       footnote 35 meeringa wellmarked boundary such as a ditch or                    fence between farms fields bogs etc  how farll you go yourself armstrong faith i believe its few of the crack nagsll beat the old black pony at a long day  is it i said the parson innocently as soon as ive heard the dogs give tongue and seen them well on their game ill go home ive land ploughing and i must look after that but as i was saying if the fox breaks well away from the gorse youll have the best run youve seen this season but if he dodges back into the plantation youll have enough to do to make him break at all and when he does hell go away towards ballyhaunis through as cross a country as ever a horse put a shoe into  and having uttered this scientific prediction which was listened to with the greatest deference by peter dillon the rev joseph armstrong turned his attention to the ham and tea  the three ladies were all smiles to meet their guests mrs okelly dressed in a piece of satin turk came forward to shake hands with the general but sophy and guss kept their positions beneath the coffeepot and teaurn at each end of the long table being very properly of opinion that it was the duty of the younger part of the community to come forward and make their overtures to them bingham blake the cynosure on whom the eyes of the beauty of county mayo were most generally placed soon found his seat beside guss rather to sophys mortification but sophy was goodnatured and when peter dillon placed himself at her right hand she was quite happy though peters father was still alive and binghams had been dead this many a year and castletown much in want of a mistress  now miss okelly said bingham do let me manage the coffeepot the creamjug and sugartongs will be quite enough for your energies  indeed and i wont mr blake youre a great deal too awkward and a great deal too hungry the last huntmorning you breakfasted here you threw the coffeegrouts into the sugarbasin when i let you help me  to think of your remembering thatbut im improved since then ive been taking lessons with my old aunt at castlebar  you dont mean youve really been staying with lady sarah  oh but i have though i was there three days made tea every night washed the poodle every morning and clearstarched her sunday pelerine with my own hands on saturday evening  oh what a useful animal what a husband youll make when youre a little more improved  shant i as youre so fond of accomplishments perhaps youll take me yourself byandby  why as youre so useful maybe i may  well lambert said lord ballindine across the table to the stingy gentleman with the squint are you going to ride hard today  ill go bail im not much behind my lord said lambert if the dogs go ill follow  ill bet you a crown lambert said his cousin young brown of mount brown the dogs kill and you dont see them do it  oh that may be and yet i maynt be much behind  ill bet youre not in the next field to them  maybe youll not be within ten fields yourself  come lambert ill tell you whatwell ride together and ill bet you a crown i pound you before youre over three leaps  ah now take it easy with yourself said lambert there are others ride better than you  but no one better than yourself is that it eh  well jerry how do the new articles fit said nicholas dillon  pretty well thank you theyd be a deal more comfortable though if youd pay for them  did you hear miss okelly what jerry blake did yesterday said nicholas dillon aloud across the table  indeed i did not said gussbut i hope for the sake of the blakes in general he didnt do anything much amiss  ill tell you then continued nicholas a portion of his ould huntingdressill not specify what you knowbut a portion which hed been wearing since the last election were too shabby to show well he couldnt catch a hedge tailor far or near only poor lame andy oulahan who was burying his wife rest her sowl the very moment jerry got a howld of him well jerry was wild that the tailors were so scarce so he laid his hands on andy dragged him away from the corpse and all the illigant enthertainment of the funeral and never let him out of sight till hed put on the last button  oh mr blake said guss you did not take the man away from his dead wife  indeed i did not miss okelly andyd no such good chance his wifes to the fore this day worse luck for him it was only his mother he was burying  but you didnt take him away from his mothers funeral  oh i did it according to law you know i got bingham to give me a warrant first before i let the policeman lay a hand on him  now general youve really made no breakfast at all said the hospitable hostess do let guss give you a hot cup of coffee  not a drop more mrs okelly ive done more than well but if youll allow me ill just take a crust of bread in my pocket  and what would you do that foryoull be coming back to lunch you know  is it lunch mrs okelly pray dont think of troubling yourself to have lunch on the table maybe well be a deal nearer creamstown than kellys court at lunch time but its quite time we were off as for bingham blake from the look of him hes going to stay here with your daughter augusta all the morning  i believe then hed much sooner be with the dogs general than losing his time with her  are you going to move at all ballindine said the impatient old sportsman do you know what time it isitll be twelve oclock before you have the dogs in the cover  very good time too general men must eat you know and the fox wont stir till we move him but come gentlemen you seem to be dropping your knives and forks suppose we get into our saddles  and again the redcoats sallied out bingham gave guss a tender squeeze which she all but returned as she bade him take care and not go and kill himself peter dillon stayed to have a few last words with sophy and to impress upon her his sister noras message that she and her sister were to be sure to come over on friday to ballyhaunis and spend the night there  we will if were let tell nora said sophy but now franks at home we must mind him you know  make him bring you over therell be a bed for him the old house is big enough heaven knows  indeed it is well ill do my best but tell nora to be sure and get the fiddler from hollymount its so stupid for her to be sitting there at the piano while were dancing  ill manage that only do you bring frank to dance with her and another tender squeeze was givenand peter hurried out to the horses  and now they were all gone but the parson mrs okelly said he mrs armstrong wants a favour from you poor minnys very bad with her throat she didnt get a wink of sleep last night  dear mepoor thing can i send her anything  if you could let them have a little black currant jelly mrs armstrong would be so thankful she has so much to think of and is so weak herself poor thing she hasnt time to make those things  indeed i will mr armstrong ill send it down this morning and a little calfs foot jelly wont hurt her it is in the house and mrs armstrong mightnt be able to get the feet you know give them my love and if i can get out at all tomorrow ill go and see them  and so the parson having completed his domestic embassy for the benefit of his sick little girl followed the others keen for the hunt and the three ladies were left alone to see the plate and china put away     xxii  the hunt   though the majority of those who were in the habit of hunting with the kellys court hounds had been at the breakfast there were still a considerable number of horsemen waiting on the lawn in front of the house when frank and his friends sallied forth the dogs were collected round the huntsman behaving themselves for the most part with admirable propriety an occasional yelp from a young hound would now and then prove that the whipper 36 had his eye on them and would not allow rambling but the old dogs sat demurely on their haunches waiting the wellknown signal for action there they sat as grave as so many senators with their large heads raised their heavy lips hanging from each side of their jaws and their deep strong chests expanded so as to show fully their bone muscle and breeding       footnote 36 whipperan officer of the hunt whose duty was to                    help the hunstman control the hounds  among the men who had arrived on the lawn during breakfast were two who certainly had not come together and who had not spoken since they had been there they were martin kelly and barry lynch martin was dressed just as usual except that he had on a pair of spurs but barry was armed capapie 37 some time before his fathers death he had supplied himself with all the fashionable requisites for the fieldnot because he was fond of hunting for he was notbut in order to prove himself as much a gentleman as other people he had been out twice this year but had felt very miserable for no one spoke to him and he had gone home on both occasions early in the day but he had now made up his mind that he would show himself to his old schoolfellow in his new character as an independent country gentleman and what was more he was determined that lord ballindine should not cut him       footnote 37 capapiefrom head to foot  he very soon had an opportunity for effecting his purpose for the moment that frank got on his horse he unintentionally rode close up to him  how dye do my lordi hope i see your lordship well said barry with a clumsy attempt at ease and familiarity im glad to find your lordship in the field before the seasons over  good morning mr lynch said frank and was turning away from him when remembering that he must have come from dunmore he asked did you see martin kelly anywhere  cant say i did my lord said barry and he turned away completely silenced and out of countenance  martin had been talking to the huntsman and criticizing the hounds he knew every dogs name character and capabilities and also every horse in lord ballindines stable and was consequently held in great respect by mick keogh and his crew  and now the business began mick said the lord well take them down to the young plantation and bring them back through the firs and so into the gorse if the lads lying there we must hit him that way  thats thrue for yer honer my lord and he started off with his obedient family  youre wrong ballindine said the parson for youll drive him up into the big plantation and youll be all day before you make him break and ten to one theyll chop him in the cover  would you put them into the gorse at once then  take em gently through the firs maybe hes lying outand down into the gorse and then if hes there he must go away and into a tiptop country toomiles upon miles of pastureright away to ballintubber  thats thrue too my lord let his rivirence alone for understandhing a fox said mick with a wink  the parsons behests were obeyed the hounds followed mick into the plantation and were followed by two or three of the more eager of the party who did not object to receiving wet boughs in their faces or who delighted in riding for half an hour with their heads bowed close down over their saddlebows the rest remained with the whipper outside  stay a moment here martin said lord ballindine they cant get away without our seeing them and i want to speak a few words to you  and i want particularly to spake to your lordship said martin and theres no fear of the fox i never knew a fox lie in those firs yet  nor i either but you see the parson would have his way i suppose if the priest were out and he told you to run the dogs through the gooseberrybushes youd do it  im blessed if i would my lord every man to his trade not but what mr armstrong knows pretty well what hes about  well but martin ill tell you what i want of you i want a little money without bothering those fellows up in dublin and i believe you could let me have it at any rate you and your mother together those fellows at guinnesss are stiff about it and i want three hundred pounds without absolutely telling them that they must give it me id give you my bill for the amount at twelve months and allow you six per cent but then i want it immediately can you let me have it  why my lord said martin after pausing awhile and looking very contemplative during the time i certainly have the money that is i and mother together but  oh if youve any doubt about itor if it puts you out dont do it  divil a doubt on arth my lord but ill tell you i was just going to ask your lordships advice about laying out the same sum in another way and i dont think i could raise twice that much  very well martin if youve anything better to do with your money im sure id be sorry to take it from you  thats jist it my lord i dont think i can do bettherbut i want your advice about it  my advice whether you ought to lend me three hundred pounds or not why martin youre a fool i wouldnt ask you to lend it me if i thought you oughtnt to lend it  ohim certain sure of that my lord but theres an offer made me that id like to have your lordships mind about its not much to my liking though and i think itll be betther for me to be giving you the money and then martin told his landlord the offer which had been made to him by daly on the part of barry lynch you see my lord he concluded by saying itd be a great thing to be shut of barry entirely out of the counthry and to have poor antys mind at ase about it should she iver live to get betther but thin i dont like to have dailings with the divil or any one so much of his colour as barry lynch  this is a very grave matter martin and takes some little time to think about to tell the truth i forgot your matrimonial speculation when i asked for the money though i want the cash i think you should keep it in your power to close with barry no youd better keep the money by you  after all the ould woman could let me have it on the security of the house you know av i did take up with the offer so any way your lordship neednt be balked about the cash  but is miss lynch so very ill martin  deed and she is mr frank very bad intirely doctor colligan was with her three times yestherday  and does barry take any notice of her now shes ill  why not yet he didnt but then we kept it from him as much as we could till it got dangerous like mother manes to send colligan to him today av he thinks shes not betther  if she were to die martin thered be an end of it all wouldnt there  oh in course there would my lordand then he added with a sigh id be sorry shed die for somehow im very fond of her quare as itll seem to you id be very sorry she should die  of course you would martin and it doesnt seem queer at all  oh i wasnt thinking about the money then my lord i was only thinking of anty herself you dont know what a good young woman she isits anything but herself shes thinking of always  did she make any will  deed she didnt my lord nor wont its my mind  ah but she should after all that you and your motherve gone through itd be a thousand pities that wretch barry got all the property again  hes wilcome to it for the kellys av anty dies but av she lives he shall niver rob a penny from her oh my lord we wouldnt put sich a thing as a will into her head and she so bad for all the money the ould man their father iver had but hark my lordthats gaylass i know the note well and shes as true as gould theres the fox there just inside the gorse as the parson saidand away they both trotted to the bottom of the plantation from whence the cheering sound of the dogs voices came sharp sweet and mellow  yes the parson was as right as if he had been let into the foxs confidence overnight and had betrayed it in the morning gaylass was hardly in the gorse before she discovered the doomed brutes vicinity and told of it to the whole canine confraternity away from his hidingplace he went towards the open country but immediately returned into the covert for he saw a lot of boys before him who had assembled with the object of looking at the hunt but with the very probable effect of spoiling it for as much as a fox hates a dog he fears the human race more and will run from an urchin with a stick into the jaws of his much more fatal enemy  as long as them blackguards is there a hollowing and a screeching divil a fox in all irelandd go out of this said mick to his master  ah boys said frank riding up if you want to see a hunt will you keep back  begorra we will yer honer said one  faixwe wouldnt be afther spiling your honers divarsion my lord on no account said another  well be out o this althogether now this blessed minute said a third but still there they remained each loudly endeavouring to banish the others  at last however the fox saw a fair course before him and away he went and with very little start for the dogs followed him out of the covert almost with a view  and now the men settled themselves to the work and began to strive for the pride of place at least the younger portion of them for in every field there are two classes of men those who go out to get the greatest possible quantity of riding and those whose object is to get the least those who go to work their nags and those who go to spare them the former think that the excellence of the hunt depends on the horses the latter on the dogs the former go to act and the latter to see and it is very generally the case that the least active part of the community know the most about the sport  they the less active part above alluded to know every highroad and byeroad they consult the wind and calculate that a fox wont run with his nose against it they remember this stream and this bog and avoid them they are often at the top of eminences and only descend when they see which way the dogs are going they take short cuts and lay themselves out for narrow lanes they dislike galloping and eschew leaping and yet when a hardriding man is bringing up his two hundred guinea hunter a minute or two late for the finish covered with foam trembling with his exertion not a breath left in himhell probably find one of these steady fellows there before him mounted on a brokendown screw but as cool and as fresh as when he was brought out of the stable and what is perhaps still more amazing at the end of the day when the hunt is canvassed after dinner our dashing friend who is in great doubt whether his thoroughbred steeplechaser will ever recover his days work and who has been personally administering warm mashes and bandages before he would venture to take his own boots off finds he does not know half as much about the hunt or can tell half as correctly where the game went as our quietgoing friend whose hack will probably go out on the following morning under the car with the mistress and children such a one was parson armstrong and when lord ballindine and most of the others went away after the hounds he coolly turned round in a different direction crept through a broken wall into a peasants garden and over a dunghill by the cabin door into a road and then trotted along as demurely and leisurely as though he were going to bury an old woman in the next parish  frank was generally speaking as goodnatured a man as is often met but even he got excited and irritable when hunting his own pack all masters of hounds do some one was always too forward another too near the dogs a third interfering with the servants and a fourth making too much noise  confound it peter he said when they had gone over a field or two and the dogs missed the scent for a moment i thought at any rate you knew better than to cross the dogs that way  who crossed the dogs said the otherwhat nonsense youre talking why i wasnt out of the potatofield till they were nearly all at the next wall  well it may be nonsense continued frank but when i see a man riding right through the hounds and they hunting i call that crossing them  hoicks tallyhollowed some onetheres graceful has it againwell done granger faith frank thats a good dog if hes not first hes always second  now gentlemen steady for heavens sake do let the dogs settle to their work before youre atop of them upon my soul nicholas brown its ridiculous to see you  itd be a good thing if he were half as much in a hurry to get to heaven said bingham blake  thankee said nicholas go to heaven yourself im well enough where i am  and now they were off again in the next field the whole pack caught a view of the fox just as he was stealing out and after him they went with their noses well above the ground their voices loud and clear and in one bevy  away they went the game was strong the scent was good the ground was soft but not too soft and a magnificent hunt they had but there were some misfortunes shortly after getting away barry lynch wishing in his ignorance to lead and show himself off and not knowing howscurrying along among the dogs and bothered at every leap had given great offence to lord ballindine but not wishing to speak severely to a man whom he would not under any circumstances address in a friendly way he talked at him and endeavoured to bring him to order by blowing up others in his hearing but this was thrown away on barry and he continued his career in a most disgusting manner scrambling through gaps together with the dogs crossing other men without the slightest reserve annoying every one and evidently pluming himself on his performance franks brow was getting blacker and blacker jerry blake and young brown were greatly amusing themselves at the exhibition and every now and then gave him a word or two of encouragement praising his mare telling how well he got over that last fence and bidding him mind and keep well forward this was all new to barry and he really began to feel himself in his elementif it hadnt been for those abominable walls he would have enjoyed himself but this was too good to last and before very long he made a faux pas which brought down on him in a torrent the bottledup wrath of the viscount  they had been galloping across a large unbroken sheepwalk which exactly suited barrys taste and he had got well forward towards the hounds frank was behind expostulating with jerry blake and the others for encouraging him when the dogs came to a small stone wall about two feet and a half high in this there was a broken gap through which many of them crept barry also saw this happy escape from the grand difficulty of jumping and ignorant that if he rode the gap at all he should let the hounds go first made for it right among them in spite of franks voice now raised loudly to caution him the horse the man rode knew his business better than himself and tried to spare the dogs which were under his feet but in getting out he made a slight spring and came down on the haunches of a favourite young hound called goneaway he broke the leg close to the socket and the poor beast most loudly told his complaint  this was too much to be borne and frank rode up red with passion and a lot of others including the whipper soon followed  he has killed the dog said he did you ever see such a clumsy ignorant fool mr lynch if youd do me the honour to stay away another day and amuse yourself in any other way i should be much obliged  it wasnt my fault then said barry  do you mean to give me the lie sir replied frank  the dog got under the horses feet how was i to help it  there was a universal titter at this which made barry wish himself at home again with his brandybottle  ah sir said frank youre as fit to ride a hunt as you are to do anything else which gentlemen usually do may i trouble you to make yourself scarce your horse i see cant carry you much farther and if youll take my advice youll go home before youre ridden over yourself well martin is the bone broken  martin had got off his horse and was kneeling down beside the poor hurt brute indeed it is my lord in two places youd better let tony kill him he has an awful sprain in the back as well hell niver put a foot to the ground again  by heavens thats too bad isnt it bingham he was out and out the finest puppy we entered last year  what can you expect said bingham when such fellows as that come into a field hes as much business here as a cow in a drawingroom  but what can we doone cant turn him off the land if he chooses to come he must  why yes said bingham if he will come he must but then if he insists on doing so he may be horsewhipped he may be ridden over he may be kicked and he may be told that hes a low vulgar paltry scoundrel and if he repeats his visits thats the treatment hell probably receive  barry was close to both the speakers and of course heard and was intended to hear every word that was said he contented himself however with muttering certain inaudible defiances and was seen and heard of no more that day  the hunt was continued and the fox was killed but frank and those with him saw but little more of it however as soon as directions were given for the death of poor goneaway they went on and received a very satisfactory account of the proceedings from those who had seen the finish as usual the parson was among the number and he gave them a most detailed history not only of the foxs proceedings during the day but also of all the reasons which actuated the animal in every different turn he took  i declare armstrong said peter dillon i think you were a fox yourself once do you remember anything about it  what a run he would give said jerry the best pack that was ever kennelled wouldnt have a chance with him  who was that old chap said nicholas dillon showing off his classical learning who said that dead animals always became something elsemaybe its only in the course of nature for a dead fox to become a live parson  exactly youve hit it said armstrong and in the same way the moment the breath is out of a goose it becomes an idle squireen 38 and generally speaking a younger brother       footnote 38 squireendiminutive of squire a minor irish                    gentleman given to putting on airs or imitating                    the manners and haughtiness of men of greater                    wealth  put that in your pipe and smoke it nick said jerry and take care how you meddle with the church again  who saw anything of lambert brown said another i left him bogged below there at gurtnascreenagh and all he could do the old grey horse wouldnt move a leg to get out for him  oh hes there still said nicholas he was trying to follow me and i took him there on purpose its not deep and hell do no hurt hell keep as well there as anywhere else  nonsense dillon said the generalyoull make his brother really angry if you go on that way if the mans a fool leave him in his folly but dont be playing tricks on him youll only get yourself into a quarrel with the family  and how shall we manage about the money my lord said martin as he drew near the point at which he would separate from the rest to ride towards dunmore ive been thinking about it and theres no doubt about having it for you on friday av thatll suit  that brotherinlaw of yours is a most unmitigated blackguard isnt he martin said frank who was thinking more about poor goneaway than the money  he isnt no brotherinlaw of mine yet and probably niver will be for im afeard poor antyll go but av he iver is hell soon take himself out of the counthry and be no more throuble to your lordship or any of us  but to think of his riding right atop of the poor brute and then saying that the dog got under his horses feet why hes a fool as well as a knave was he ever out before  well then i believe he was twice this year though i didnt see him myself  then i hope thisll be the last time three times is quite enough for such a fellow as that  i dont think hell be apt to show again afther what you and mr bingham said to him well shure mr bingham was very hard on him  serve him right nothings too bad for him  oh thats thrue for you my lord i dont pity him one bit but about the money and this job of my own av it wasnt asking too much itd be a great thing av your lordshipd see daly  it was then settled that lord ballindine should ride over to dunmore on the following friday and if circumstances seemed to render it advisable that he and martin should go on together to the attorney at tuam     xxiii  doctor colligan   doctor colligan the galen of dunmore though a practitioner of most unprepossessing appearance and demeanour was neither ignorant nor careless though for many years he had courted the public in vain his neighbours had at last learned to know and appreciate him and at the time of antys illness the inhabitants of three parishes trusted their corporeal ailments to his care with comfort to themselves and profit to him nevertheless there were many things about doctor colligan not calculated to inspire either respect or confidence he always seemed a little afraid of his patient and very much afraid of his patients friends he was always dreading the appearance at dunmore of one of those young rivals who had lately established themselves at tuam on one side and hollymount on the other and to prevent so fatal a circumstance was continually trying to be civil and obliging to his customers he would not put on a blister or order a black dose without consulting with the lady of the house and asking permission of the patient and consequently had always an air of doubt and indecision then he was excessively dirty in his person and practice he carried a considerable territory beneath his nails smelt equally strongly of the laboratory and the stable would wipe his hands on the patients sheets and wherever he went left horrid marks of his whereabouts he was very fond of good eating and much drinking and would neglect the best customer that ever was sick when tempted by the fascination of a game of loo he was certainly a bad familyman for though he worked hard for the support of his wife and children he was little among them paid them no attention and felt no scruple in assuring mrs c that he had been obliged to remain up all night with that dreadful mrs jones whose children were always so tedious or that mr blake was so bad after his accident that he could not leave him for a moment when to tell the truth the doctor had passed the night with the cards in his hands and a tumbler of punch beside him  he was a tall thickset heavy man with short black curly hair was a little bald at the top of his head and looked always as though he had shaved himself the day before yesterday and had not washed since his face was goodnatured but heavy and unintellectual he was ignorant of everything but his profession and the odds on the cardtable or the racecourse but to give him his due on these subjects he was not ignorant and this was now so generally known that in dangerous cases doctor colligan had been sent for many many miles  this was the man who attended poor anty in her illness and he did as much for her as could be done but it was a bad case and doctor colligan thought it would be fatal she had intermittent fever and was occasionally delirious but it was her great debility between the attacks which he considered so dangerous  on the morning after the hunt he told martin that he greatly feared she would go off from exhaustion in a few days and that it would be wise to let barry know the state in which his sister was there was a consultation on the subject between the two and martins mother in which it was agreed that the doctor should go up to dunmore house and tell barry exactly the state of affairs  and good news itll be for him said mrs kelly the best he heard since the ould man died av he had his will of her shed niver rise from the bed where shes stretched but glory be to god theres a providence over all and maybe shell live yet to give him the goby  how you talk mother said martin and whats the use whatever he wishes wont harum her and maybe now shes dying his heartll be softened to her any way dont let him have to say she died here without his hearing a word how bad she was  maybe hed be afther saying we murdhered her for her money said the widow with a shudder  he can hardly complain of that when hell be getting all the money himself but however its much betther all ways that doctor colligan should see him  you know mrs kelly said the doctor as a matter of course hell be asking to see his sister  you wouldnt have him come in here to her would youfaix doctor colligan itll be her death out right at once av he does  itd not be nathural to refuse to let him see her said the doctor and i dont think it would do any harm but ill be guided by you mrs kelly in what i say to him  besides said martin i know anty would wish to see him he is her brother and theres only the two of em  between you be it said the widow i tell you i dont like it you neither of you know barry lynch as well as i do hed smother her av it come into his head  ah mother nonsense now hould your tongue you dont know what youre saying  well didnt he try to do as bad before  it wouldnt do i tell you continued martin not to let him see her that is av anty wishes it  it ended in the widow being sent into antys room to ask her whether she had any message to send to her brother the poor girl knew how ill she was and expected her death and when the widow told her that doctor colligan was going to call on her brother she said that she hoped she should see barry once more before all was over  mother said martin as soon as the doctors back was turned youll get yourself in a scrape av you go on saying such things as that about folk before strangers  is it about barry  yes about barry how do you know colligan wont be repating all them things to him  let him and wilcome shure wouldnt i say as much to barry lynch himself what do i care for the blagguardonly this i wish id niver heard his name or seen his foot over the sill of the door im sorry i iver heard the name of the lynches in dunmore  youre not regretting the throuble anty is to you mother  regretting i dont know what you mane by regretting i dont know is it regretting to be slaving as much and more for her than i would for my own and no chance of getting as much as thanks for it  youll be rewarded hereafther mother shure wont it all go for charity  im not so shure of that said the widow it was your schaming to get her money brought her here and like a poor wake woman as i was i fell into it and now weve all the throuble and the expinse and the time lost and afther all barryll be getting everything when shes gone youll see martin well have the wake and the funeral and the docthor and all on usmind my words else och musha musha whatll i do at all faix forty pounds wont clear what this turn is like to come to an all from your dirthy undherhand schaming ways  in truth the widow was perplexed in her inmost soul about anty torn and tortured by doubts and anxieties her real love of anty and true charity was in state of battle with her parsimony and then avarice was strong within her and utter uncontrolled hatred of barry still stronger but opposed to these was dread of some unforeseen evilsome tremendous law proceedings she had a halfformed idea that she was doing what she had no right to do and that she might some day be walked off to galway assizes then again she had an absurd pride about it which often made her declare that shed never be beat by such a scum of the arth as barry lynch and that shed fight it out with him if it cost her a hundred pounds though no one understood what the battle was which she was to fight  just before antys illness had become so serious daly called and had succeeded in reconciling both martin and the widow to himself but he had not quite made them agree to his proposal the widow indeed was much averse to it she wouldnt deal with such a greek as barry even in the acceptance of a boon when she found him willing to compromise she became more than ever averse to any friendly terms but now the whole ground was slipping from under her feet anty was dying she would have had her trouble for nothing and that hated barry would gain his point and the whole of his sisters property in triumph  twenty times the idea of a will had come into her mind and how comfortable it would be if anty would leave her property or at any rate a portion of it to martin but though the thoughts of such a delightful arrangement kept her in a continual whirlwind of anxiety she never hinted at the subject to anty as she said to herself a kelly wouldnt demane herself to ask a brass penny from a lynch she didnt even speak to her daughters about it though the continual twitter she was in made them aware that there was some unusual burthen on her mind  it was not only to the kellys that the idea occurred that anty in her illness might make a will the thoughts of such a catastrophe had robbed barry of half the pleasure which the rumours of his sisters dangerous position had given him he had not received any direct intimation of antys state but had heard through the servants that she was illvery illdangerouslynot expected as the country people call it and each fresh rumour gave him new hopes and new life he now spurned all idea of connexion with martin he would trample on the kellys for thinking of such a thing he would show daly when in the plenitude of his wealth and power how he despised the lukewarmness and timidity of his councils these and other delightful visions were floating through his imagination when all of a sudden like a blow like a thunderbolt the idea of a will fell as it were upon him with a ton weight his heart sunk low within him he became white and his jaw dropped after all there were victory and triumph plunder and wealth his wealth in the very hands of his enemies of course the kellys would force her to make a will if she didnt do it of her own accord if not theyd forge one there was some comfort in that thought he could at any rate contest the will and swear that it was a forgery  he swallowed a dram and went off almost weeping to daly  oh mr daly poor antys dying did you hear mr dalyshes all but gone yes daly had been sorry to hear that miss lynch was very ill what shall i do continued barry if they say that shes left a will  go and hear it read or if you dont like to do that yourself stay away and let me hear it  but theyll forge one theyll make out what they please and when shes dying theyll make her put her name to it or theyll only just put the pen in her hand when shes not knowing what shes doing theyd do anything now daly to get the money theyve been fighting for so hard  its my belief answered the attorney that the kellys not only wont do anything dishonest but that they wont even take any unfair advantage of you but at any rate you can do nothing you must wait patiently you at any rate can take no steps till shes dead  but couldnt she make a will in my favour i know shed do it if i asked herif i asked her nownow shes going off you know im sure shed do it dont you think she would  youre safer i think to let it alone said daly who could hardly control the ineffable disgust he felt  i dont know that continued barry shes weak and ll do what shes asked besides theyll make her do it fancy if when shes gone i find i have to share everything with those people and he struck his forehead and pushed the hair off his perspiring face as he literally shook with despair i must see her daly im quite sure shell make a will if i beg her they cant hinder me seeing my own only dying sister can they daly and when im once there ill sit with her and watch till its all over im sure now shes ill id do anything for her  daly said nothing though barry paused for him to reply only about the form continued he i wouldnt know what to put by heavens daly you must come with me you can be up at the house and i can have you down at a minutes warning daly utterly declined but barry continued to press him but you must daly i tell you i know im right i know her so wellshell do it at once for the sakefor the sake ofyou know she is my own sister and all thatand she thinks so much of that kind of thing ill tell you what daly upon my honour and soul and he repeated the words in a most solemn tone if youll draw the will and she signs it so that i come in for the whole thingand i know she will ill make over fiftyay seventy pounds a year for you for ever and ever i will as i live  the interview ended by the attorney turning barry lynch into the street and assuring him that if he ever came into his office again on any business whatsoever he would unscrupulously kick him out so ended also the connexion between the two for daly never got a farthing for his labour indeed after all that had taken place he thought it as well not to trouble his cidevant client with a bill barry went home and of course got drunk  when doctor colligan called on lynch he found that he was not at home he was at that very moment at tuam with the attorney the doctor repeated his visit later in the afternoon but barry had still not returned and he therefore left word that he would call early after breakfast the following morning he did so and after waiting half an hour in the diningroom barry only half awake and half dressed and still half drunk came down to him  the doctor with a long face delivered his message and explained to him the state in which his sister was lying assured him that everything in the power of medicine had been and should be done that nevertheless he feared the chance of recovery was remote and ended by informing him that miss lynch was aware of her danger and had expressed a wish to see him before it might be too late could he make it convenient to come over just nowin half an houror say an hoursaid the doctor looking at the red face and unfinished toilet of the distressed brother  barry at first scarcely knew what reply to give on his return from tuam he had determined that he would at any rate make his way into his sisters room and as he thought to himself see what would come of it in his afterdinner courage he had further determined that he would treat the widow and her family with a very high hand if they dared to make objection to his seeing his sister but now when the friendly overture came from anty herself and was brought by one of the kelly faction he felt himself a little confounded as though he rather dreaded the interview and would wish to put it off for a day or two  oh yescertainly doctor colligan to be surethat istell me doctor is she really so bad  indeed mr lynch she is very weak  but doctor you dont think there is any chancei mean there isnt any danger is there that shed go off at once  why no i dont think there is indeed i have no doubt she will hold out a fortnight yet  then perhaps doctor id better put it off till tomorrow ill tell you why theres a person i wish  why mr lynch today would be better the fevers periodical you see and will be on her again tomorrow  i beg your pardon doctor colligan said barry of a sudden remembering to be civilbut youll take a glass of wine  not a drop thank ye of anything  oh but you will and barry rang the bell and had the wine brought and you expect shell have another attack tomorrow  thats a matter of course mr lynch the feverll come on her again tomorrow every attack leaves her weaker and weaker and we fear shell go off before it leaves her altogether  poor thing said barry contemplatively  we had her head shaved said the doctor  did you indeed answered barry she was my favourite sister doctor colliganthat is i had no other  i believe not said doctor colligan looking sympathetic  take another glass of wine doctornow do and he poured out another bumper  thankee mr lynch thankee not a drop more and youll be over in an hour then id better go and tell her that she may be prepared you know and the doctor returned to the sick room of his patient  barry remained standing in the parlour looking at the glasses and the decanter as though he were speculating on the manner in which they had been fabricated she may recover after all thought he to himself shes as strong as a horsei know her better than they do i know shell recover and then what shall i do stand to the offer daly made to kelly i suppose and then he sat down close to the table with his elbow on it and his chin resting on his hand and there he remained full of thought to tell the truth barry lynch had never thought more intensely than he did during those ten minutes at last he jumped up suddenly as though surprised at what had been passing within himself he looked hastily at the door and at the window as though to see that he had not been watched and then went upstairs to dress himself preparatory to his visit to the inn    xxiv  anty lynchs bedside scene the first   anty had borne her illness with that patience and endurance which were so particularly inherent in her nature she had never complained and had received the untiring attentions and care of her two young friends with a warmth of affection and gratitude which astonished them accustomed as they had been in every little illness to give and receive that tender care with which sickness is treated in affectionate families when ill they felt they had a right to be petulant and to complain to exact and to be attended to they had been used to it from each other and thought it an incidental part of the business but anty had hitherto had no one to nurse her and she looked on meg and jane as kind ministering angels emulous as they were to relieve her wants and ease her sufferings  her thin face had become thinner and was very pale her head had been shaved close and there was nothing between the broad white border of her nightcap and her clammy brow and wan cheek but illness was more becoming to anty than health it gave her a melancholy and beautiful expression of resignation which under ordinary circumstances was wanting to her features though not to her character her eyes were brighter than they usually were and her complexion was clear colourless and transparent i do not mean to say that anty in her illness was beautiful but she was no longer plain and even to the young kellys whose feelings and sympathies cannot be supposed to have been of the highest order she became an object of the most intense interest and the warmest affection  well doctor she said as doctor colligan crept into her room after the termination of his embassy to barry will he come  oh of course he will why wouldnt he and you wishing it hell be here in an hour miss lynch he wasnt just ready to come over with me  im glad of that said anty who felt that she had to collect her thoughts before she saw him and then after a moment she added cant i take my medicine now doctor  just before he comes youd better have it i think one of the girls will step up and give it you when hes below hell want to speak a word or so to mrs kelly before he comes up  spake to me docthor said the widow alarmed whatll he be spaking to me about faix i had spaking enough with him last time he was here  youd better just see him mrs kelly whispered the doctor youll find him quiet enough now just take him fair and asy keep him downstairs a moment while jane gives her the medicine shed better take it just before he goes to her and dont let him stay long whatever you do ill be back before the evenings over not that i think that shell want me to see her but ill just drop in  are you going doctor said anty as he stepped up to the bed he told her he was youve told mrs kelly havent you that im to see barry alone  why i didnt say so said the doctor looking at the widow but i suppose therell be no harmeh mrs kelly  you must let me see him alone dear mrs kelly  if doctor colligan thinks you ought anty dear i wouldnt stay in the room myself for worlds  but you wont keep him here long miss lyncheh and you wont excite yourselfindeed you mustnt youll allow them fifteen minutes mrs kelly not more and then youll come up and with these cautions the doctor withdrew  i wish he was come and gone said the widow to her elder daughter well av id known all what was to follow id niver have got out of my warm bed to go and fetch anty lynch down here that cowld morning well ill be wise another time live and larn they say and its thrue too  but mother you aint wishing poor anty wasnt here  indeed but i do everything to give and nothin to getthats not the way i have managed to live but its not that altogether neither im not begrudging anty anything for herself but that id be dhriven to let that blagguard of a brother of hers into the house and that as a frind like is what i didnt think id ever have put upon me  barry made his appearance about an hour after the time at which they had begun to expect him and as soon as meg saw him one of them flew upstairs to tell anty and give her her tonic barry had made himself quite a dandy to do honour to the occasion of paying probably a parting visit to his sister whom he had driven out of her own house to die at the inn he had on his new blue frockcoat and a buff waistcoat with gilt buttons over which his watchchain was gracefully arranged his pantaloons were strapped clown very tightly over his polished boots a shining new silk hat was on one side of his head and in his hand he was dangling an ebony cane in spite however of all these gaudy trappings he could not muster up an easy air and as he knocked he had that look proverbially attributed to dogs who are going to be hung  sally opened the door for him and the widow who had come out from the shop made him a low courtesy in the passage  ohahyesmrs kelly i believe said barry  yes mr lynch thats my name glory be to god  my sister miss lynch is still staying here i believe  why drat it man wasnt dr colligan with you less than an hour ago telling you you must come here av you wanted to see her  youll oblige me by sending up the servant to tell miss lynch im here  walk up here a minute and ill do that errand for you myselfwell continued she muttering to herself for him to ax av she war staying here as though he didnt know it there niver was his ditto for desait maneness and divilry  a minute or two after the widow had left him barry found himself by his sisters bedside but never had he found himself in a position for which he was less fitted or which was less easy to him he assumed however a long and solemn face and crawling up to the bedside told his sister in a whining voice that he was very glad to see her  sit down barry sit down said anty stretching out her thin pale hand and taking hold of her brothers  barry did as he was told and sat down im so glad to see you barry said she im so very glad to see you once more and then after a pause and itll be the last time barry for im dying  barry told her he didnt think she was for he didnt know when hed seen her looking better  yes i am barry doctor colligan has said as much and i should know it well enough myself even if hed never said a word were friends now are we noteverythings forgiven and forgotten isnt it barry  anty had still hold of her brothers hand and seemed desirous to keep it he sat on the edge of his chair with his knees tucked in against the bed the very picture of discomfort both of body and mind  oh of course it is anty said he forgive and forget that was always my motto im sure i never bore any maliceindeed i never was so sorry as when you went away and  ah barry said anty it was better i went then maybe its all better as it is when the priest has been with me and given me comfort i wont fear to die but there are other things barry i want to spake to you about  if theres anything i can do im sure id do it if theres anything at all you wish donewould you like to come up to the house again  oh no barry not for worlds  why perhaps just at present you are too weak to move only wouldnt it be more comfortable for you to be in your own house these people here are all very well i dare say but they must be a great bother to you ehso interested you know in everything they do  ah barry you dont know them  barry remembered that he would be on the wrong tack to abuse the kellys im sure theyre very nice people said he indeed i always thought so and said sobut theyre not like your own flesh and blood are they antyand why shouldnt you come up and be  no barry said she ill not do that as theyre so very very kind as to let me stay here ill remain tilltill god takes me to himself but theyre not my flesh and bloodand she turned round and looked affectionately in the face of her brotherthere are only the two of us left now and soon very soon youll be all alone barry felt very uncomfortable and wished the interview was over he tried to say something but failed and anty went onwhen that time comes will you remember what i say to you nowwhen youre all alone barry when theres nothing left to trouble you or put you outwill you think then of the last time you ever saw your sister and  oh anty sure ill be seeing you again  no barry never again this is the last time we shall ever meet and think how much we ought to be to each other weve neither of us father or mother husband or wifewhen im gone youll be alone will you think of me thenand will you remember remember every daywhat i say to you now  indeed i will anty ill do anything everything youd have me is there anything youd wish me to give to any person  barry she continued no good ever came of my fathers willbarry almost jumped off his chair as he heard his sisters words so much did they startle him but he said nothingthe money has done me no good but the loss of it has blackened your heart and turned your blood to gall against me yes barryyesdont speak now let me go onthe old man brought you up to look for it and alas he taught you to look for nothing else it has not been your fault and im not blaming youim not maning to blame you my own brother for you are my ownand she turned round in the bed and shed tears upon his hand and kissed itbut gold and land will never make you happyno not all the gold of england nor all the land the old kings ever had could make you happy av the heart was bad within you youll have it all now barry or mostly all youll have what you think the old man wronged you of youll have it with no one to provide for but yourself with no one to trouble you no one to thwart you but oh barry av its in your heart that that can make you happytheres nothing before you but miseryand deathand hell barry shook like a child in the clutches of its masteryes barry misery and death and all the tortures of the damned its to save you from this my own brother to try and turn your heart from that foul love of money that your sister is now speaking to you from her graveoh barry try and cure it learn to give to others and youll enjoy what you have yourselflearn to love others and then youll know what it is to be loved yourself try try to soften that hard heart marry at once barry at once before youre older and worse to cure and youll have children and love them and when you feel as feel you must that the money is clinging round your soul fling it from you and think of the last words your sister said to you  the sweat was now running down the cheeks of the wretched man for the mixed rebuke and prayer of his sister had come home to him and touched him but it was neither with pity with remorse nor penitence no in that foul heart there was no room even for remorse but he trembled with fear as he listened to her words and falling on his knees swore to her that he would do just as she would have him  if i could but think continued she that you would remember what i am saying  oh i will anty i willindeed indeed i will  if i could believe so barryid die happy and in comfort for i love you better than anything on earth and again she pressed his hot red handbut oh brother i feel for youyou never kneel before the altar of godyouve no priest to move the weight of sin from your souland how heavy that must be do you remember barry its but a week or two ago and you threatened to kill me for the sake of our fathers money you wanted to put me in a madhouse you tried to make me mad with fear and cruelty me your sister and i never harmed or crossed you god is now doing what you threatened a kind good god is now taking me to himself and you will get what you so longed for without more sin on your conscience but itll never bless you av youve still the same wishes in your heart the same love of goldthe same hatred of a fellowcreature  oh anty sobbed out barry who was now absolutely in tears i was drunk that night i was indeed or id never have said or done what i did  and how often are you so barryisnt it so with you every night thats another thing for my sake for your own sakefor gods sake give up the dhrink its killing you from day to day and hour to hour i see it in your eyes and smell it in your breath and hear it in your voice its that that makes your heart so blackits that that gives you over body and soul to the devil i would not have said a word about that night to hurt you now and dear barry i wouldnt have said such words as these to you at all but that i shall never speak to you again and oh i pray that youll remember them youre idle now alwaysdont continue so earn your money and it will be a blessing to you and to others but in idleness and drunkenness and wickedness it will only lead you quicker to the devil  barry reiterated his promises he would take the pledge he would work at the farm he would marry and have a family he would not care the least for money he would pay his debts he would go to church or chapel if anty liked it better at any rate hed say his prayers he would remember every word she had said to the last day of his life he promised everything or anything as though his future existence depended on his appeasing his dying sister but during the whole time his chief wish his longing desire was to finish the interview and get out of that horrid room he felt that he was mastered and cowed by the creature whom he had so despised and he could not account for the feeling why did he not dare to answer her she had told him he would have her money she had said it would come to him as a matter of course and it was not the dread of losing that which prevented his saying a word in his own defence no she had really frightened him she had made him really feel that he was a low wretched wicked creature and he longed to escape from her that he might recover his composure  i have but little more to say to you barry she continued and that little is about the property you will have it all but a small sum of money  here anty was interrupted by a knock at the door and the entrance of the widow she came to say that the quarter of an hour allowed by the doctor had been long exceeded and that really mr barry ought to take his leave as so much talking would be bad for anty  this was quite a godsend for barry who was only anxious to be off but anty begged for a respite  one five minutes longer dear mrs kelly said she and i shall have done only five minutesim much stronger now and really it wont hurt me  well thenmind only five minutes said the widow and again left them alone  you dont know barryyou can never know how good that woman has been to me indeed all of themand all for nothing theyve asked nothing of me and now that they know im dying im sure they expect nothing from me she has enough but i wish to leave something to martin and the girls and a slight pale blush covered her wan cheeks and forehead as she mentioned martins name i will leave him five hundred pounds and them the same between them it will be nothing to you barry out of the whole but see and pay it at once will you and she looked kindly into his face  he promised vehemently that he would and told her not to bother herself about a will they should have the money as certainly as if twenty wills were made to give barry his due at that moment he meant to be as good as his word anty however told him that she would make a will that she would send for a lawyer and have the matter properly settled  and now she said dear barry may god almighty bless youmay he guide you and preserve you and may he above all take from you that horrid love of the worlds gold and wealth good bye and she raised herself up in her bedgood bye for the last time my own dear brother and try to remember what ive said to you this day kiss me before you go barry  barry leaned over the bed and kissed her and then crept out of the room and down the stairs with the tears streaming down his red cheeks and skulked across the street to his own house with his hat slouched over his face and his handkerchief held across his mouth     xxv  anty lynchs bedside scene the second   anty was a good deal exhausted by her interview with her brother but towards evening she rallied a little and told jane who was sitting with her that she wanted to say one word in private to martin jane was rather surprised for though martin was in the habit of going into the room every morning to see the invalid anty had never before asked for him however she went for martin and found him  martin said she anty wants to see you alone in private  me said martin turning a little red do you know what its about  she didnt say a word only she wanted to see you alone but im thinking its something about her brother he was with her a long long time this morning and went away more like a dead man than a live one but come dont keep her waiting and whatever you do dont stay long every word she spakes is killing her  martin followed his sister into the sickroom and gently taking antys offered hand asked her in a whisper what he could do for her jane went out and to do her justice sat herself down at a distance from the door though she was in a painful state of curiosity as to what was being said within  youre all too good to me martin said anty youll spoil me between you minding every word i say so quick  martin assured her again in a whisper that anything and everything they could do for her was only a pleasure  dont mind whispering said anty spake out your voice wont hurt me i love to hear your voices theyre all so kind and good but martin ive business you must do for me and that at once for i feel within me that ill soon be gone from this  we hope not anty but its all with god nowisnt it no one knows that betther than yourself  oh yes i do know that and i feel it is his pleasure that it should be so and i dont fear to die a few weeks back the thoughts of death when they came upon me nearly killed me but that feelings all gone now  martin did not know what answer to make he again told her he hoped she would soon get better it is a difficult task to talk properly to a dying person about death and martin felt that he was quite incompetent to do so  but she continued after a little theres still much that i want to dothat i ought to do in the first place i must make my will  martin was again puzzled this was another subject on which he felt himself equally unwilling to speak he could not advise her not to make one and he certainly would not advise her to do so  your will antytheres time enough for that youll be sthronger you know in a day or two doctor colligan says soand then well talk about it  i hope there is time enough martin but there isnt more than enough its not much that ill have to say  were you spaking to barry about it this morning  oh i was i told him what id do hell have the property now mostly all as one as av the ould man had left it to him it would have been betther so eh martin anty never doubted her lovers disinterestedness at this moment she suspected him of no dirty longing after her money and she did him only justice when he came into her room he had no thoughts of inheriting anything from her had he been sure that by asking he could have induced her to make a will in his favour he would not have done so but still his heart sunk a little within him when he heard her declare that she was going to leave everything back to her brother it was however only for a moment he remembered his honest determination firmly and resolutely to protect their joint property against any of her brothers attempts should he ever marry her but in no degree to strive or even hanker after it unless it became his own in a fair straightforward manner  well anty i think youre right said he but wouldnt it all go to barry nathurally without your bothering yourself about a will and you so wake  in course it would at laist i suppose so but martin and she smiled faintly as she looked up into his face i want the two dear dear girls and i want yourself to have some little thing to remember me by and your dear kind mothershe doesnt want money but if i ask her to take a few of the silver things in the house im sure shell keep them for my sake oh martin i do love you all so veryso very much and the warm tears streamed down her cheeks  martins eyes were affected too he made a desperate struggle to repress the weakness but he could not succeed and was obliged to own it by rubbing his eyes with the sleeve of his coat and im shure anty said he we all love you any one must love you who knew you and then he paused he was trying to say something of his own true personal regard for her but he hardly knew how to express it we all love you as though you were one of ourselvesand so you areits all the sameat any rate it is to me  and i would have been one of you had i lived i can talk to you more about it now martin than i ever could before because i know i feel i am dying  but you mustnt talk anty it wakens you and youve had too much talking already this day  it does me good martin and i must say what i have to say to you i maynt be able again had it plazed god i should have lived i would have prayed for nothing higher or betther than to be one of such a family as yourselves had i beenhad i beenand now anty blushed again and she also found a difficulty in expressing herself but she soon got over it and continued had i been permitted to marry you martin i think i would have been a good wife to you i am very very sure i would have been an affectionate one  im shure you wouldim shure you would anty god send you may still av you war only once well again theres nothing now to hindher us  you forget barry anty said with a shudder but it doesnt matther talking of that nowmartin was on the point of telling her that barry had agreed under certain conditions to their marriage but on second thoughts he felt it would be useless to do so and anty continued  i would have done all i could martin i would have loved you fondly and truly i would have liked what you liked and av i could i wouldve made your home quiet and happy your mother should have been my mother and your sisthers my sisthers  so they are now antyso they are now my own own antythey love you as much as though they were  god almighty bless them for their goodness and you too martin i cannot tell you i niver could tell you how ive valued your honest thrue love for i know you have loved me honestly and thruly but ive always been afraid to spake to you ive sometimes thought you must despise me ive been so wake and cowardly  despise you antyhow could i despise you when ive always loved you  but now martin about poor barryfor he is poor ive sometimes thought as ive been lying here the long long hours awake that feeling to you as i do i ought to be laving you what the ould man left to me  id be sorry you did anty ill not be saying but what i thought of that when i first looked for you but it was never to take it from you but to share it with you and make you happy with it  i know it martin i always knew it and felt it  and now av its gods will that you should go from us id rather barry had the money than us weve enough the lord be praised and i wouldnt for worlds it should be said that it war for that we brought you among us nor for all county galway would i lave it to barry to say that when you were here sick and wake and dying we put a pen into your hand to make you sign a will to rob him of what should by rights be his  thats it dear martin it wouldnt bless you if you had it it can bless no one who looks to it alone for a blessing it wouldnt make you happyit would make you miserable av people said you had that which you ought not to have besides i love my poor brother he is my brother my only real relation weve lived all our lives together and though he isnt what he should be the fault is not all his own i should not sleep in my grave av i died with his curse upon me as i should av he found when i am gone that id willed the property all away ive told him hed have it allnearly all and ive begged him prayed to him from my dying bed to mend his ways to try and be something betther in the world than what i fear hes like to be i think he minded what i said when he was here for deathbed words have a solemn sound to the most worldly but when im gone hell be all alone therell be no one to look afther him nobody loves himno one even likes him no one will live with him but those who mane to rob him and he will be robbed and plundered and desaved when he thinks hes robbing and desaving others anty paused more for breath than for a reply but martin felt that he must say something  indeed anty i fear hell hardly come to good he dhrinks too much by all accounts besides hes idle and the honest feeling isnt in him  its thrue dear martin its too thrue will you do me a great great favour martinand she rose up a little and turned her moist clear eye full upon himwill you show your thrue love to your poor anty by a rale lasting kindness but one thatll be giving you much much throuble and pain afther im dead and gonelong long after im in my cold grave will you do that for me martin  indeed i will anty said martin rather astonished but with a look of solemn assurance anything that i can do i will you neednt dread my not remembering but i fear it isnt much that i can do for you  will you always think and spake of barrywill you always act to him and by him and for him not as a man whom you know and dislike but as my brotheryour own antys only brotherwhatever he does will you thry to make him do betther whatever troubles hes in will you lend him your hand come what come may to him will you be his frind he has no frind now when im gone will you be a frind to him  martin was much confounded he wont let me be his frind he said he looks down on us and despises us he thinks himself too high to be befrinded by us besides of all dunmore he hates us most  he wont when he finds you havent got the property from him but frindship doesnt depend on lettingrale frindship doesnt i dont want you to be dhrinking and ating and going about with him god forbidyoure too good for that but when you find he wants a frind come forward and thry and make him do something for himself you cant but come together youll be the executhor in the will wont you martin and then hell meet you about the property he cant help it and you must meet then as frinds and keep that up if he insults you forgive it or my sake if hes fractious and annoying put up with it for my sake for my sake thry to make him like you and thry to make others like him martin felt that this would be impossible but he didnt say sono one respects him now but all respect you i see it in peoples eyes and manners without hearing what they say av you spake well of himat any rate kindly of him people wont turn themselves so against him will you do all this for my sake  martin solemnly promised that as far as he could he would do so that at any rate as far as himself was concerned he would never quarrel with him  youll have very very much to forgive continued anty but then its so sweet to forgive and hes had no fond mother like you he has not been taught any duties any virtues as you have he has only been taught that money is the thing to love and that he should worship nothing but that martin for my sake will you look on him as a brothera wicked bad castaway brother but still as a brother to be forgiven and if possible redeemed  as i hope for glory in heaven i will said martin but i think hell go far from this i think hell quit dunmore  maybe he will perhaps its betther he should but hell lave his name behind him dont be too hard on that and dont let others and even av he does go itll not be long before hell want a frind and i dont know anywhere he can go that hes likely to find one wherever he may go or whatever he may do you wont forget he was my brother will you martin you wont forget he was your own antys only brother  martin again gave her his solemn word that he would to the best of his ability act as a friend and brother to barry  and now about the will martin again endeavoured to dissuade her from thinking about a will just at present  ah but my hearts set upon it she said i shouldnt be happy unless i did it and im sure you dont want to make me unhappy now you must get me some lawyer here martin im afraid youre not lawyer enough for that yourself  indeed im not anty its a trade i know little about  well you must get me a lawyer not tomorrow for i know i shant be well enough but i hope i shall next day and you may tell him just what to put in it ive no secrets from you and she told him exactly what she had before told her brother thatll not hurt him she continued and id like to think you and the dear girls should accept something from me  martin then agreed to go to daly he was on good terms with them all now since making the last offer to them respecting the property besides as martin said he knew no other lawyer and as the will was so decidedly in barrys favour who was so proper to make it as barrys own lawyer  goodbye now martin said anty we shall be desperately scolded for talking so long but it was on my mind to say it all and im betther now its all over  good night dear anty said martin ill be seeing you tomorrow  every day i hope martin till its all over god bless you god bless you alland you above all you dont know martinat laist you didnt know all along how well how thruly ive loved you good night and martin left the room as barry had done in tears but he had no feeling within him of which he had cause to be ashamed he was ashamed and tried to hide his face for he was not accustomed to be seen with the tears running down his cheeks but still he had within him a strong sensation of gratified pride as he reflected that he was the object of the warmest affection to so sweet a creature as anty lynch  well martinwhat was it she wanted said his mother as she met him at the bottom of the stairs  i couldnt tell you now mother said he but av there was iver an angel on arth its anty lynch and saying so he pushed open the door and escaped into the street  i wondher what shes been about now said the widow speculating to herselfwell av she does lave it away from barry who can say but what she has a right to do as she likes with her ownand whos done the most for her id like to knowand pleasant prospects of her sons enjoying an independence flitted before her minds eye but thin she continued talking to herself i wouldnt have it said in dunmore that a kelly demaned hisself to rob a lynch not for twice all sim lynch ever had wellwell see but no good ll ever come of meddling with them people jane jane she called out at the top of her voice are you niver coming down and letting me out of thisbad manners to you  jane answered in the same voice from the parlour upstairs shure mother aint i getting anty her tay  drat anty and her taywell shure im railly bothered now wid them lyncheswell glory be to god theres an end to everythingnot that im wishing her anywhere but where she is shes welcome for mary kelly     xxvi  loves ambassador   two days after the hunt in which poor goneaway was killed by barrys horse ballindine received the following letter from his friend dot blake      limmers hotel 27th march 1844     dear frank     i and brien and bottom crossed over last friday night and thanks    to the god of storms were allowed to get quietly through it the    young chieftain didnt like being boxed on the quay a bit too well    the rattling of the chains upset him and the fellows there are    so infernally noisy and awkward that i wonder he was ever got on    board its difficult to make an irishman handy but its the very    devil to make him quiet there were four at his head and three at    his tail two at the wheel turning and one up aloft hallooing    like a demon in the air and when master brien showed a little    aversion to this comic performance they were going to drag him into    the box bon gré mal gré till bottom interposed and saved the men    and the horse from destroying each other     we got safe to middleham on saturday night the greatest part of the    way by rail scott has a splendid string of horses these english    fellows do their work in tiptop style only they think more of    spending money than they do of making it i waited to see him out on    monday when hed got a trot and he was as bright as though hed    never left the curragh scott says hes a little too fine but you    know of course he must find some fault to give igoe his due he    could not be in better condition and scott was obliged to own that    considering where he came from he was very well i came on here    on tuesday and have taken thirteen wherever i could get it and    thought the money safe i have got a good deal on and wont budge    till i do it at six to one and im sure ill bring him to that i    think hell rise quickly as he wants so little training and as his    qualities must be at once known now hes in scotts stables so if    you mean to put any more on you had better do it at once     so much for the stables i left the other two at home but have one    of my own string here as maybe ill pick up a match and now i    wish to let you know a report that i heard this morningat least    a secret which bids fair to become a report it is said that    kilcullen is to marry f w and that he has already paid    heaven only knows how many thousand pounds of debt with her money    that the old earl has arranged it all and that the beautiful    heiress has reluctantly agreed to be made a viscountess im very    far from saying that i believe this but it may suit you to know    that i heard the arrangement mentioned before two other persons one    of whom was morrisstrange enough this as he was one of the set    at handicap lodge when you told them that the match with yourself    was still on i have no doubt the plan would suit father and son    you best know how far the lady may have been likely to accede at    any rate my dear frank if youll take my advice youll not sit    quiet till she does marry some one you cant expect shell wear the    willow for you very long if you do nothing yourself write to her    by post and write to the earl by the same post saying you have    done so tell her in the sweetest way you can that you cannot live    without seeing her and getting your congé 39 if congé it is    to be from her own dear lips and tell him in as few words as you    please that you mean to do yourself the honour of knocking at his    door on such and such a dayand do it          footnote 39 congéfrench dismissal notice to quit     by the bye kilcullen certainly returns to ireland immediately    theres been the devils own smash among him and the jews he has    certainly been dividing money among them but not near enough by    all accounts to satisfy the half of them for the sake of your    reputation if not of your pocket dont let him walk off with the    hundred and thirty thousand pounds they say its not a penny less     very faithfully yours     w blake     shall i do anything for you here about brien i think i might still    get you eleven to one but let me hear at once   as frank read the first portion of this epistle his affection for his poor dear favourite nag returned in full force and he felt all the pangs of remorse for having parted with him but when he came to the latter part to lord kilcullens name and the initials by which his own fanny was designated he forgot all about horse and owner became totally regardless of thirteen eleven and six to one and read on hastily to the end read it all againthen closed the letter and put it in his pocket and remained for a considerable time in silent contemplation trying to make up his mind what he would do  nobody was with him as he opened his postbag which he took from the messenger as the boy was coming up to the house he therefore read his letter alone on the lawn and he continued pacing up and down before the house with a most perturbed air for half an hour  kilcullen going to marry fanny wyndham so that was the cause of lord cashels singular behaviourhis incivility and refusal to allow frank to see his ward what to have arranged it all in twentyfour hours thought frank to himself to have made over his wards money to his son before her brother from whom she inherited it was in his grave to determine at once to reject an accepted suitor for the sake of closing on the poor girls moneyand without the slightest regard for her happiness without a thought for her welfare and then such lies said the viscount aloud striking his heel into the grass in his angry impetuosity such base cruel liesto say that she had authorised him when he couldnt have dared to make such a proposal to her and her brother but two days dead well i took him for a stiffnecked pompous fool but i never thought him such an avaricious knave and fanny toocould fanny have agreed so soon to give her hand to another she could not have transferred her heart his own dear fond fanny a short time ago they had been all in all to each other and now so completely estranged as they were however dot was right up to this time fanny might be quite true to him indeed there was not ground even for doubting her for it was evident that no reliance was to be placed in lord cashels asseverations but still he could not expect that she should continue to consider herself engaged if she remained totally neglected by her lover he must do something and that at once but there was very great difficulty in deciding what that something was to be it was easy enough for dot to say first write and then go if he were to write what security was there that his letter would be allowed to reach fanny and if he went how much less chance was there that he would be allowed to see her and then again to be turned out of the house again informed by that pompous scheming earl that his visits there were not desired or worse still not to be admitted to be driven from the door by a footman who would well know for what he came no come what come might he would never again go to grey abbey at least not unless he was specially and courteously invited thither by the owner and then it should only be to marry his ward and take her from the odious place never to return again  the impudent impostor continued frank to himself to pretend to suspect me when he was himself hatching his dirty mercenary heartless schemes  but still the same question recurredwhat was to be done venting his wrath on lord cashel would not get him out of the difficulty going was out of the question writing was of little use could he not send somebody else some one who could not be refused admittance to fanny and who might at any rate learn what her wishes and feelings were he did not like making love by deputy but still in his present dilemma he could think of nothing better but whom was he to send bingham blake was a man of character and would not make a fool of himself but he was too young he would not be able to make his way to fanny noa young unmarried man would not domat tierneyhe was afraid of no one and always cool and collected but then mat was in london besides he was a sort of friend of kilcullens general bourke no one could refuse an entrée to his venerable grey hairs and polished manner besides his standing in the world was so good so unexceptionable but then the chances were he would not go on such an errand he was too old to be asked to take such a troublesome service and besides if asked it was very probable he would say that he considered lord cashel entitled to his wards obedience the rectorthe rev joseph armstrong he must be the man there was at any rate respectability in his profession and he had sufficient worldly tact not easily to be thrust aside from his object the difficulty would be whether he had a coat sufficiently decent to appear in at grey abbey  after mature consideration he made up his mind that the parson should be his ambassador he would sooner have confided in bingham blake but an unmarried man would not do no the parson must be the man frank was unfortunately but little disposed to act in any case without advice and in his anxiety to consult some one as to consulting the parson returned into the house to make a clear breast of it to his mother he found her in the breakfastroom with the two girls and the three were holding council deep  oh heres frank said sophy wed better tell him all about it at onceand hell tell us which shed like best  we didnt mean to tell you said guss but i and sophy are going to work two sofas for the drawingroomin berlin wool you know theyll be very handsomeeverybody has them now you know they have a splendid pair at ballyhaunis which nora and her cousin worked  but we want to know what pattern would suit fannys taste said sophy  well you cant know that said frank rather pettishly so youd better please yourselves  oh but you must know what she likes continued guss im for this and she displayed a pattern showing forth two gorgeous macawseach with plumage of the brightest colours the colours are so bright and the feathers will work in so well  i dont like anything in worstedwork but flowers said sophy nora dillon says she saw two most beautiful wreaths at that shop in grafton street both hanging from bars you know and that would be so much prettier im sure fanny would like flowers best wouldnt she now frankmamma thinks the common crossbar patterns are nicer for furniture  indeed i do my dear said mrs okelly and you see them much more common now in wellfurnished drawingrooms but still id much sooner have them just what fanny would like best surely frank you must have heard her speak about worstedwork  all this completely disconcerted frank and made him very much out of love with his own plan of consulting his mother he gave the trio some not very encouraging answer as to their goodnatured intentions towards his drawingroom and again left them alone well theres nothing for it but to send the parson i dont think hell make a fool of himself but then i know hell look so shabby however here goes and he mounted his nag and rode off to ballindine glebe  the glebehouse was about a couple of miles from kellys court and it was about halfpast four when lord ballindine got there he knocked at the door which was wide open though it was yet only the last day of march and was told by a remarkably slatternly maidservant that her master was jist afther dinner that he was stepped out but was about the place and could be fetched in at oncetand would his honour walk in and so lord ballindine was shown into the rectory drawingroom on one side of the passage alias hall while the attendant of all work went to announce his arrival in the rectory diningroom on the other side here mrs armstrong was sitting among her numerous progeny securing the débris of the dinner from their rapacious paws and endeavouring to make two very unruly boys consume the portions of fat which had been supplied to them with as they loudly declared an unfairly insufficient quantum of lean as the girl was goodnatured enough to leave both doors wide open frank had the full advantage of the conversation  now greg said the mother if you leave your meat that way ill have it put by for you and you shall have nothing but potatoes till its ate  why mother its nothing but tallow look here you gave me all the outside part  ill tell your dada and see what hell say if you call the meat tallow and youre just as bad joe worse if anythinggracious me heres waste well ill lock it up for you and you shall both of you eat it tomorrow before you have a bit of anything else  then followed a desperate fit of coughing  my poor minny said the mother youre just as bad as ever why would you go out on the wet grassis there none of the black currant jam left  no mother coughed minny not a bit  greg ate it all peached sarah an elder sister i told him not but he would  greg ill have you flogged and you never shall come from school again whats that youre saying mary  theres a jintleman in the drawingroom as is axing afther masther  gentlemanwhat gentleman asked the lady  sorrow a know i know maam said mary who was a new importationonly hes a dark sightly jintleman as come on a horse  and did you send for the master  i did maam i was out in the yard and bad patsy go look for him  its nicholas dillon ill bet twopence said greg jumping up to rush into the other room hes come about the black colt i know  stay where you are greg and dont go in there with your dirty face and fingers and after speculating a little longer the lady went into the drawingroom herself though to tell the truth her own face and fingers were hardly in a state suitable for receiving company  mrs armstrong marched into the drawingroom with something of a stately air to meet the strange gentleman and there she found her old friend lord ballindine whoever called at the rectory and at whatever hour the visit might be made poor mrs armstrong was sure to apologise for the confusion in which she was found she had always just got rid of a servant and could not get another that suited her or there was some other commonplace reason for her being discovered en déshabille 40 however she managed to talk to frank for a minute or two with tolerable volubility till her eyes happening to dwell on her own hands which were certainly not as white as a ladys should be she became a little uncomfortable and embarrassedtried to hide them in her draperythen remembered that she had on her morning slippers which were rather the worse for wear and feeling too much ashamed of her tout ensemble to remain hurried out of the room saying that she would go and see where armstrong could possibly have got himself to she did not appear again to lord ballindine       footnote 40 en déshabillefrench partly or scantily dressed  poor mrs armstrongthough she looked so little like one she had been brought up as a lady carefully and delicately and her lot was the more miserable for she knew how lamentable were her present deficiencies when she married a poor curate having herself only a few hundred pounds fortune she had made up her mind to a life of comparative poverty but she had meant even in her poverty to be decent respectable and ladylike weak health nine children an improvident husband and an income so lamentably illsuited to her wants had however been too much for her and she had degenerated into a slatternly idle scold  in a short time the parson came in from his farm rusty and muddyrusty from his clerical dress muddy from his farming occupations and lord ballindine went into the business of his embassy he remembered however how plainly he had heard the threats about the uneaten fat and not wishing the household to hear all he had to say respecting fanny wyndham he took the parson out into the road before the house and walking up and down unfolded his proposal  mr armstrong expressed extreme surprise at the nature of the mission on which he was to be sent secondly at the necessity of such a mission at all and thirdly lastly and chiefly at the enormous amount of the heiresss fortune to lose which he declared would be an unpardonable sin on lord ballindines part he seemed to be not at all surprised that lord cashel should wish to secure so much money in his own family nor did he at all participate in the unmeasured reprobation with which frank loaded the worthy earls name one hundred and thirty thousand pounds would justify anything and he thought of his nine poor children his poor wife his poor home his poor two hundred ayear and his poor self he calculated that so very rich a lady would most probably have some interest in the church which she could not but exercise in his favour if he were instrumental in getting her married and he determined to go then the difficult question as to the wardrobe occurred to him besides he had no money for the road those however were minor evils to be got over and he expressed himself willing to undertake the embassy  but my dear ballindine what is it im to do said he of course you know id do anything for you as of course i oughtanything that ought to be done but what is it exactly you wish me to say  you see armstrong that pettifogging schemer told me he didnt wish me to come to his house again and i wouldnt even for fanny wyndham force myself into any mans house he would not let me see her when i was there and i could not press it because her brother was only just dead so im obliged to take her refusal second hand now i dont believe she ever sent the message he gave me i think he has made her believe that im deserting and illtreating her and in this way she may be piqued and tormented into marrying kilcullen  i see it now upon my word then lord cashel knows how to play his cards but if i go to grey abbey i cant see her without seeing him  of course notbut im coming to that you see i have no reason to doubt fannys love she has assured me of it a thousand times i wouldnt say so to you even as it looks like boasting only its so necessary you should know how the land lies besides everybody knew it all the world knew we were engaged  oh boastingits no boasting at all it would be very little good my going to grey abbey if she had not told you so  well i think that if you were to see lord cashel and tell him in your own quiet way who you are that you are rector of ballindine and my especial friend and that you had come all the way from county mayo especially to see miss wyndham that you might hear from herself whatever message she had to send to meif you were to do this i dont think he would dare to prevent you from seeing her  if he did of course i would put it to him that you who were so long received as miss wyndhams accepted swain were at least entitled to so much consideration at her hands and that i must demand so much on your behalf wouldnt that be it eh  exactly i see you understand it as if youd been at it all your life only dont call me her swain  well ill think of another wordher beau  for heavens sake nothats ten times worse  well her lover  thats at any rate english but say her accepted husbandthatll be true and plain if you do that i think you will manage to see her and then  well thenfor thatll be the difficult part  oh when you see her one simple word will do fanny wyndham loves plain dealing merely tell her that lord ballindine has not changed his mind and that he wishes to know from herself by the mouth of a friend whom he can trust whether she has changed hers if she tells you that she has i would not follow her farther though she were twice as rich as croesus im not hunting her for her money but i am determined that lord cashel shall not make us both miserable by forcing her into a marriage with his roué of a son  well ballindine ill go but mind you must not blame me if i fail ill do the best i can for you  of course i wont when will you be able to start  why i suppose theres no immediate hurry said the parson remembering that the new suit of clothes must be procured  oh but there is kilcullen will be there at once and considering how long it is since i saw fannythree months i believeno time should be lost  how long is her brother dead  oh a monthor very near it  well ill go monday fortnight thatll do wont it  it was at last agreed that the parson was to start for grey abbey on the monday week following that he was to mention to no one where he was going that he was to tell his wife that he was going on business he was not allowed to talk aboutshe would be a very meek woman if she rested satisfied with thatand that he was to present himself at grey abbey on the following wednesday  and now said the parson with some little hesitation my difficulty commences we country rectors are never rich but when weve nine children ballindine its rare to find us with money in our pockets you must advance me a little cash for the emergencies of the road  my dear fellow of course the expense must be my own ill send you down a note between this and then i havent enough about me now or stayill give you a cheque and he turned into the house and wrote him a cheque for twenty pounds  thatll get the coat into the bargain thought the rector as he rather uncomfortably shuffled the bit of paper into his pocket he had still a gentlemans dislike to be paid for his services but then necessityhow stern she is he literally could not have gone without it     xxvii  mr lynchs last resource   on the following morning lord ballindine as he had appointed to do drove over to dunmore to settle with martin about the money and if necessary to go with him to the attorneys office in tuam martin had as yet given daly no answer respecting barry lynchs last proposal and though poor antys health made it hardly necessary that any answer should be given still lord ballindine had promised to see the attorney if martin thought it necessary  the family were all in great confusion that morning for anty was very badworse than she had ever been she was in a paroxysm of fever was raving in delirium and in such a state that martin and his sister were occasionally obliged to hold her in bed sally the old servant had been in the room for a considerable time during the morning standing at the foot of the bed with a big teapot in her hand and begging in a whining voice from time to time that miss anty god bless her might get a dhrink of tay but as she had been of no other service and as the widow thought it as well that she should not hear what anty said in her raving she had been desired to go downstairs and was sitting over the fire she had fixed the big teapot among the embers and held a slopbowl of tea in her lap discoursing to nelly who with her hair somewhat more than ordinarily dishevelled in token of grief for antys illness was seated on a low stool nursing a candlestick  well nelly said the prophetic sally boding evil in her angerfor considering how long she had been in the family she had thought herself entitled to hear antys ravings mind i tell you good wont come of this the virgin prothect us from all harumit niver war lucky to have sthrangers dying in the house  but shure miss antys no stranger  faix thin her words must be sthrange enough when the likes o me wouldnt be let hear em not but what i did hear as how could i help it therell be no good come of it whos to be axed to the wake id like to know  axed to the wake is it why shure wont there be rashions of ating and lashings of dhrinking the misthress isnt the woman to spare and sich a frind as miss anty dead in the house let em ax whom they like  youre a fool nellyax whom they likethats asy said is they to ax barry lynch or is they to let it alone and put the sisther into the sod without a word said to him about it god be betwixt us and all eviland she took a long pull at the slopbowl and as the liquid flowed down her throat she gradually threw back her head till the top of her mop cap was flattened against the side of the wide fireplace and the bowl was turned bottom upwards so that the halfmelted brown sugar might trickle into her mouth she then gave a long sigh and repeated that difficult questionwho is they to ax to the wake  it was too much for nelly to answer she reechoed the sigh and more closely embraced the candlestick  besides nelly wholl have the money when shes goneand shes nigh that already the blessed virgin guide and prothect her wholl get all her money  why wont mr martin sure ant they as good as man and wifeall as one  thats it theyll be fighting and tearing and tatthering about that money the two young men will youll see therell be lawyering an magisthrates workan factionsan fighthins at fairs an thin as in course the lynches cant hould their own agin the kellys therell be undherhand blows an blood an murdheryoull see else  glory be to god involuntarily prayed nelly at the thoughts suggested by sallys powerful eloquence  there will i tell ye continued sally again draining the teapot into the bowl sorrow a lie im telling you and then in a low whisper across the fire didnt i see jist now miss anty ketch a hould of misther martin as though shed niver let him go agin and bid him for dear mercys sake have a care of barry lynchshure i knowed what that meant and thin didnt he thry and do for herself with his own hands didnt biddy say shed swear she heard him say hed do itand av he wouldnt boggle about his own sisther its little hed mind what hed do to an out an out inemy like misther martin  warnt that a knock at the halldoor sally  run and see girl maybe its the docthor back again only mostly he dont mind knocking much  nelly went to the door and opened it to lord ballindine who had left his gig in charge of his servant he asked for martin who in a short time joined him in the parlour  this is a dangerous place for your lordship now said he the fever is so bad in the house thank god nobody seems to have taken it yet but theres no knowing  is she still so bad martin  worse than iver a dale worse i dont think itll last long now another bout such as this last ll about finish it but i wont keep your lordship ive managed about the moneyand the necessary writing was gone through and the cash was handed to lord ballindine  youve given over all thoughts then about lynchs offereh martini suppose youve done with all that now  quite done with it my lord and done with fortunehunting too ive seen enough this last time back to cure me altogetherat laist i hope so  she doesnt mean to make any will then  why she wishes to make one but i doubt whether shell ever be able and then martin gave his landlord an account of all that anty had said about her will her wishes as to the property her desire to leave something to him martin and his sisters and last he repeated the strong injunctions which anty had given him respecting her poor brother and her assurance so full of affection that had she lived she would have done her best to make him happy as her husband  lord ballindine was greatly affected he warmly shook hands with martin told him how highly he thought of his conduct and begged him to take care that anty had the gratification of making her will as she had desired to do the fact lord ballindine said of your being named in the will as her executor will give you more control over barry than anything else could do he then proposed at once to go himself to tuam and explain to daly what it was miss lynch wished him to do this lord ballindine did and the next day the will was completed  for a week or ten days anty remained in much the same condition after each attack of fever it was expected that she would perish from weakness and exhaustion but she still held on and then the fever abated and doctor colligan thought that it was possible she might recover she was however so dreadfully emaciated and worn out there was so little vitality left in her that he would not encourage more than the faintest hope anty herself was too weak either to hope or fearand the women of the family who from continual attendance knew how very near to death she was would hardly allow themselves to think that she could recover  there were two persons however who from the moment of her amendment felt an inward sure conviction of her convalescence they were martin and barry to the former this feeling was of course one of unalloyed delight he went over to kellys court and spoke there of his betrothed as though she were already sitting up and eating mutton chops was congratulated by the young ladies on his approaching nuptials and sauntered round the kellys court shrubberies with frank talking over his future prospects asking advice about this and that and propounding the pros and cons on that difficult question whether he would live at dunmore or build a house at toneroe for himself and anty with barry however the feeling was very different he was again going to have his property wrenched from him he was again to suffer the pangs he had endured when first he learned the purport of his fathers will after clutching the fruit for which he had striven as even he himself felt so basely it was again to be torn from him so cruelly  he had been horribly anxious for a termination to antys sufferings horribly impatient to feel himself possessor of the whole from day to day and sometimes two or three times a day he had seen dr colligan and inquired how things were going on he had especially enjoined that worthy man to come up after his morning call at the inn and get a glass of sherry at dunmore house and the doctor had very generally done so for some time barry endeavoured to throw the veil of brotherly regard over the true source of his anxiety but the veil was much too thin to hide what it hardly covered and barry as he got intimate with the doctor all but withdrew it altogether when barry would say well doctor how is she today and then remark in answer to the doctors statement that she was very badwell i suppose it cant last much longer but its very tedious isnt it poor thing it was plain enough that the brother was not longing for the sisters recovery and then he would go a little further and remark that if the poor thing was to go it would be better for all she went at once and expressed an opinion that he was rather illtreated by being kept so very long in suspense  doctor colligan ought to have been shocked at this and so he was at first to a certain extent but he was not a man of a very high tone of feeling he had so often heard of heirs to estates longing for the death of the proprietors of them he had so often seen relatives callous and indifferent at the loss of those who ought to have been dear to them it seemed so natural to him that barry should want the estate that he gradually got accustomed to his impatient inquiries and listened to and answered them without disgust he fell too into a kind of intimacy with barry he liked his daily glass or three or four glasses of sherry and besides it was a good thing for him to stand well in a professional point of view with a man who had the best house in the village and who would soon have eight hundred ayear  if barry showed his impatience and discontent as long as the daily bulletins told him that anty was still alive though dying it may easily be imagined that he did not hide his displeasure when he first heard that she was alive and better his brow grew very black his cheeks flushed the drops of sweat stood on his forehead and he said speaking through his closed teeth d it doctor you dont mean to tell me shes recovering now  i dont say mr lynch whether she is or no but its certain the fever has left her shes very weak very weak indeed i never knew a person to be alive and have less life in em but the fever has left her and there certainly is hope  hope said barrywhy you told me she couldnt live  i dont say she will mr lynch but i say she may of course we must do what we can for her and the doctor took his sherry and went his way  how horrible then was the state of barrys mind for a time he was absolutely stupified with despair he stood fixed on the spot where the doctor had left him realising bringing home to himself the tidings which he had heard his sister to rise again as though it were from the dead to push him off his stool was he to fall again into that horrid low abyss in which even the tuam attorney had scorned him in which he had even invited that odious huxters son to marry his sister and live in his house what was he again to be reduced to poverty to want to despair by her whom he so hated could nothing be donesomething must be doneshe should not be could not be allowed to leave that bed of sickness alive there must be an end of her he muttered through his teeth or shell drive me mad and then he thought how easily he might have smothered her as she lay there clasping his hand with no one but themselves in the room and as the thought crossed his brain his eyes nearly started from his head the sweat ran down his face he clutched the money in his trousers pocket till the coin left an impression on his flesh and he gnashed his teeth till his jaws ached with his own violence but then in that sickroom he had been afraid of her he could not have touched her then for the wealth of the bank of englandbut now  the devil sat within him and revelled with full dominion over his soul there was then no feeling left akin to humanity to give him one chance of escape there was no glimmer of pity no shadow of remorse no sparkle of love even though of a degraded kind no hesitation in the will for crime which might yet by gods grace lead to its eschewal all there was black foul and deadly ready for the devils deadliest work murder crouched there ready to spring yet afraidcowardly but too thirsty alter blood to heed its own fears theftlow pilfering pettifogging theft avarice lust and impotent scalding hatred controlled by these the black blood rushed quick to and from his heart filling him with sensual desires below the passions of a brute but denying him one feeling or one appetite for aught that was good or even human  again the next morning the doctor was questioned with intense anxiety was she goingwas she droopinghad yesterdays horrid doubts raised only a false alarm it was utterly beyond barrys power to make any attempt at concealment even of the most shallow kind well doctor is she dying yet was the brutal question he put  she is if anything rather stronger answered the doctor shuddering involuntarily at the open expression of barrys atrocious wish and yet taking his glass of wine  the devil she is muttered barry throwing himself into an armchair he sat there some little time and the doctor also sat down said nothing but continued sipping his wine  in the name of mercy what must i do said barry speaking more to himself than to the other  why youve enough mr lynch without hers you can do well enough without it  enough would you think you had enough if you were robbed of more than half of all you have half indeed he shoutedi may say all at once i dont believe theres a man in ireland would bear it nor will i  again there was a silence but still somehow colligan seemed to stay longer than usual every now and then barry would for a moment look full in his face and almost instantly drop his eyes again he was trying to mature future plans bringing into shape thoughts which had occurred to him in a wild way at different times proposing to himself schemes with which his brain had been long loaded but which he had never resolved onwhich he had never made palpable and definite one thing he found sure and certain on one point he was able to become determined he could not do it alone he must have an assistant he must buy some ones aid and again he looked at colligan and again his eyes fell there was no encouragement there but there was no discouragement why did he stay there so long why did he so slowly sip that third glass of wine was he waiting to be asked was he ready willing to be bought there must be something in his thoughtshe must have some reason for sitting there so long and so silent without speaking a word or taking his eyes off the fire  barry had all but made up his mind to ask the aid he wanted but he felt that he was not prepared to do sothat he should soon quiver and shake that he could not then carry it through he felt that he wanted spirit to undertake his own part in the business much less to inspire another with the will to assist him in it at last he rose abruptly from his chair and said  will you dine with me today colliganim so down in the mouth so deucedly hipped it will be a charity  well said colligan i dont care if i do i must go down to your sister in the evening and i shall be near her here  yes of course youll be near her here as you say come at six then by the bye couldnt you go to anty first so that we wont be disturbed over our punch  i must see her the last thingabout nine but i can look up again afterwards for a minute or so i dont stay long with her now its better not  well then youll be here at six  yes six sharp and at last the doctor got up and went away  it was odd that doctor colligan should have sat thus long it showed a great want of character and of good feeling in him he should never have become intimate or even have put up with a man expressing such wishes as those which so often fell from barrys lips but he was entirely innocent of the thoughts which barry attributed to him it had never even occurred to him that barry bad as he was would wish to murder his sister no bad heedless sensual as doctor colligan might be barry was a thousand fathoms deeper in iniquity than he  as soon as he had left the room the other uttered a long deep sigh it was a great relief to him to be alone he could now collect his thoughts mature his plans and finally determine he took his usual remedy in his difficulties a glass of brandy and going out into the garden walked up and down the gravel walk almost unconsciously for above an hour  yes he would do it he would not be a coward the thing had been done a thousand times before hadnt he heard of it over and over again besides colligans manner was an assurance to him that he would not boggle at such a job but then of course he must be paidand barry began to calculate how much he must offer for the service and when the service should be performed how he might avoid the fulfilment of his portion of the bargain  he went in and ordered the dinner filled the spirit decanters opened a couple of bottles of wine and then walked out again in giving his orders and doing the various little things with which he had to keep himself employed everybody and everything seemed strange to him he hardly knew what he was about and felt almost as though he were in a dream he had quite made up his mind as to what he would do his resolution was fixed to carry it through butstill there was the buthow was he to open it to doctor colligan he walked up and down the gravel path for a long time thinking of this or rather trying to think of it for his thoughts would fly away to all manner of other subjects and he continually found himself harping upon some trifle connected with anty but wholly irrespective of her death some little thing that she had done for him or ought to have done something she had said a long time ago and which he had never thought of till now something she had worn and which at the time he did not even know that he had observed and as often as he found his mind thus wandering he would start off at a quicker pace and again endeavour to lay out a line of conduct for the evening  at last however he came to the conclusion that it would be better to trust to the chapter of chances there was one thing or rather two things he could certainly do he could make the doctor half drunk before he opened on the subject and he would take care to be in the same state himself so he walked in and sat still before the fire for the two long remaining hours which intervened before the clock struck six  it was about noon when the doctor left him and during those six long solitary hours no one feeling of remorse had entered his breast he had often doubted hesitated as to the practicability of his present plan but not once had he made the faintest effort to overcome the wish to have the deed done there was not one moment in which he would not most willingly have had his sisters blood upon his hands upon his brain upon his soul could he have willed and accomplished her death without making himself liable to the penalties of the law  at length doctor colligan came and barry made a great effort to appear unconcerned and in good humour  and how is she now doctor he said as they sat down to table  is it antywhy you know i didnt mean to see her since i was here this morning till nine oclock  oh true so you were saying i forgot well will you take a glass of wineand barry filled his own glass quite full  he drank his wine at dinner like a glutton who had only a short time allowed him and wished during that time to swallow as much as possible and he tried to hurry his companion in the same manner but the doctor didnt choose to have wine forced down his throat he wished to enjoy himself and remonstrated against barrys violent hospitality  at last dinner was over the things were taken away they both drew their chairs over the fire and began the business of the eveningthe making and consumption of punch barry had determined to begin upon the subject which lay so near his heart at eight oclock he had thought it better to fix an exact hour and had calculated that the whole matter might be completed before colligan went over to the inn he kept continually looking at his watch and gulping down his drink and thinking over and over again how he would begin the conversation  youre very comfortable here lynch said the doctor stretching his long legs before the fire and putting his dirty boots upon the fender  yes indeed said barry not knowing what the other was saying  all you wants a wife and youd have as warm a house as there is in galway youll be marrying soon i suppose  well i wouldnt wonder if i did you dont take your punch theres brandy there if you like it better than whiskey  this is very good thank youcouldnt be better you havent much land in your own hands have you  why noi dont think i have whats that youre sayinglandno not much if theres a thing i hate its farming  well upon my word youre wrong i dont see what else a gentleman has to do in the country i wish to goodness i could give up the gallipots 41 and farm a few acres of my own land theres nothing i wish so much as to get a bit of land indeed ive been looking out for it but its so difficult to get       footnote 41 gallipotsa gallipot was a small ceramic vessel                    used by apothecaries to hold medicines the term                    was also used colloquially to refer to apothecaries                    themselves and even physicians trollope so uses                    the term in later chapters  up to this barry had hardly listened to what the doctor had been saying but now he was all attention so that is to be his price thought he to himself hell cost me dear but i suppose he must have it  barry looked at his watch it was near eight oclock but he seemed to feel that all he had drank had had no effect on him it had not given him the usual pluck it had not given him the feeling of reckless assurance which he mistook for courage and capacity  if youve a mind to be a tenant of mine colligan ill keep a look out for you the lands crowded now but theres a lot of them cottier 42 devils i mean to send to the right about they do the estate no good and i hate the sight of them but you know how the propertys placed and while antys in this wretched state of course i can do nothing       footnote 42 cottieran irish tenant renting land directly from                    the owner with the price determined by bidding  will you bear it in mind though lynch when a bit of land does fall into your hands i should be glad to be your tenant im quite in earnest and should take it as a great favour  ill not forget it and then he remained silent for a minute what an opportunity this was for him to lose colligan so evidently wished to be bribedso clearly showed what the price was which was to purchase him but still he could not ask the fatal question  again he sat silent for a while till he looked at his watch and found it was a quarter past eight never fear he said referring to the farm you shall have it and it shall not be the worst land on the estate that ill give you you may be sure for upon my soul i have a great regard for you i have indeed  the doctor thanked him for his good opinion  oh im not blarneying you upon my soul im not thats not the way with me at all and when you know me better youll say soand you may be sure you shall have the farm by michaelmas and then in a voice which he tried to make as unconcerned as possible he continued by the bye colligan when do you think this affair of antys will be over its the devil and all for a man not to know when hell be his own master  oh you mustnt calculate on your sisters property at all now said the other in an altered voice i tell you its very probable she may recover  this again silenced barry and he let the time go by till the doctor took up his hat to go down to his patient  youll not be long i suppose said barry  well its getting late said colligan and i dont think ill be coming back tonight  oh but you will indeed you must you promised you would you know and i want to hear how she goes on  well ill just come up but i wont stay for i promised mrs colligan to be home early this was always the doctors excuse when he wished to get away he never allowed his domestic promises to draw him home when there was anything to induce him to stay abroad but to tell the truth he was getting rather sick of his companion the doctor took his hat and went to his patient  hell not be above ten minutes or at any rate a quarter of an hour thought barry and then i must do it how he sucked it all in about the farmthats the trap certainly and he stood leaning with his back against the mantelpiece and his coatlaps hanging over his arm waiting for and yet fearing the moment of the doctors return it seemed an age since he went barry looked at his watch almost every minute it was twenty minutes past nine fiveandtwentythirtyfortythree quarters of an hourby heaven said he the man is not coming he is going to desert meand i shall be ruined why the deuce didnt i speak out when the man was here  at last his ear caught the sound of the doctors heavy foot on the gravel outside the door and immediately afterwards the door bell was rung barry hastily poured out a glass of raw spirits and swallowed it he then threw himself into his chair and doctor colligan again entered the room  what a time youve been colligan why i thought you werent coming all night now terry some hot water and mind you look sharp about it well hows anty tonight  weak very weak but mending i think the disease wont kill her now the only thing is whether the cure will  well doctor you cant expect me to be very anxious about it unfortunately we had never any reason to be proud of anty and it would be humbug in me to pretend that i wish she should recover to rob me of what you know ive every right to consider my own terry brought the hot water in and left the room  well i cant say you do appear very anxious about it ill just swallow one dandy of punch and then ill get home im later now than i meant to be  nonsense man the idea of your being in a hurry when everybody knows that a doctor can never tell how long he may be kept in a sickroom but come now tell the truth put yourself in my condition and do you mean to say youd be very anxious that anty should recoverwould you like your own sister to rise from her deathbed to rob you of everything you have for by heaven it is robberynothing less shes so stiffnecked that theres no making any arrangement with her ive tried everything fair means and foul and nothingll do but she must go and marry that low young kellyso immeasurably beneath her you know and of course only scheming for her money put yourself in my place i say and tell me fairly what your own wishes would be  i was always fond of my brothers and sisters answered the doctor and we couldnt well rob each other for none of us had a penny to lose  thats a different thing but just supposing you were exactly in my shoes at this moment do you mean to tell me that youd be glad she should get wellthat youd be glad she should be able to deprive you of your property disgrace your family drive you from your own home and make your life miserable for ever after  upon my soul i cant say but good night now youre getting excited and ive finished my drop of punch  ah nonsense man sit down ive something in earnest i want to say to you and barry got up and prevented the doctor from leaving the room colligan had gone so far as to put on his hat and great coat and now sat down again without taking them off  you and i colligan are men of the world and too wide awake for all the old womans nonsense people talk what can i or what could you in my place care for a halfcracked old maid like anty whos better dead than alive for her own sake and everybodys else unless it is some scheming ruffian like young kelly there who wants to make money by her  im not asking you to care for her only if those are your ideas its as well not to talk about them for appearance sake  appearance sake theres nothing makes me so sick as for two men like you and me who know whats what to be talking about appearance sake like two confounded parsons whose business it is to humbug everybody and themselves into the bargain ill tell you what had my fatherbad luck to him for an old roguenot made such a will as he did id ve treated anty as well as any parson of em all would treat an old maid of a sister but im not going to have her put over my head this way come doctor confound all humbug i say it openly to youto please me anty must never come out of that bed alive  as if your wishes could make any difference if it is to be so shell die poor creature without your saying so much about it but maybe and its very likely too shell be alive and strong after the two of us are under the sod  well if it must be so it must but what i wanted to say to you is this while you were away i was thinking about what you said of the farmof being a tenant of mine you know  we can talk about that another time said the doctor who began to feel an excessive wish to be out of the house  theres no time like the present when ive got it in my mind and if youll wait i can settle it all for you tonight i was telling you that i hate farming and so i do there are thirty or fiveandthirty acres of land about the house and lying round to the back of the town you shall take them off my hands and welcome  this was too good an offer to be resisted and colligan said he would take the land with many thanks if the rent any way suited him  well not quarrel about that you may be sure colligan continued barry and as i said fifty acres at firstit was fifty acres i think you were saying you wished forill not baulk you and go back from my own word  what you have yourself round the house ll be enough only im thinking the rent ll be too high  it shall not it shall be low enough and as i was saying you shall have the remainder at the same price immediately after michaelmas as soon as ever those devils are ejected  well said colligan who was now really interested whats the figure  barry had been looking steadfastly at the fire during the whole conversation up to this playing with the poker and knocking the coals about he was longing to look into the others face but he did not dare now however was his time it was now or never he took one furtive glance at the doctor and saw that he was really anxious on the subjectthat his attention was fixed  the figure said he the figure should not trouble you if you had no one but me to deal with but therell be anty confound her putting her fist into this and every other plan of mine  id better deal with the agent im thinking said colligan so good night  youll find youd a deal better be dealing with me youll never find an easier fellow to deal with or one wholl put a better thing in your way  colligan again sat down he couldnt quite make barry out he suspected he was planning some iniquity but he couldnt tell what and he remained silent looking full into the others face till he should go on barry winced under the look and hesitated but at last he screwed himself up to the point and said  one word between two friends is as good as a thousand if anty dies of this bout you shall have the fifty acres with a lease for perpetuity at sixpence an acre come thats not a high figure i think  what said colligan apparently not understanding him a lease for perpetuity at how much an acre  sixpencea pennya peppercornjust anything you please but its all on antys dying while shes alive i can do nothing for the best friend i have  by the almighty above us said the doctor almost in a whisper i believe the wretched man means me to murder herhis own sister  murderwho talked or said a word of murder said barry with a hoarse and croaking voiceisnt she dying as she isand isnt she better dead than alive its only just not taking so much trouble to keep the life in her youre so exceeding clever you knowand he made a ghastly attempt at smiling with any other doctor shed have been dead long since leave her to herself a little and the farms your own and im sure therell ve been nothing at all like murder between us  by heavens he doesand colligan rose quickly from his seat he means to have her murdered and thinks to make me do the deed why you vile thieving murdering reptile and as he spoke the doctor seized him by the throat and shook him violently in his strong graspwho told you i was a fit person for such a plan who told you to come to me for such a deed who told you i would sell my soul for your paltry landand he continued grasping barrys throat till he was black in the face and nearly choked merciful heaven that i should have sat here and listened to such a scheme take care of yourself said he and he threw him violently backwards over the chairsif youre to be found in connaught tomorrow or in ireland the next day ill hang youand so saying he hurried out of the room and went home  well thought he on his road i have heard of such men as that before and i believe that when i was young i read of such but i never expected to meet so black a villain what had i better doif i go and swear an information before a magistrate therell be nothing but my word and his besides he said nothing that the law could take hold of and yet i oughtnt to let it pass at any rate ill sleep on it and so he did but it was not for a long time for the recollection of barrys hideous proposal kept him awake  barry lay sprawling among the chairs till the sound of the hall door closing told him that his guest had gone when he slowly picked himself up and sat down upon the sofa colligans last words were ringing in his earif youre found in ireland the next day ill hang youhang himand had he really given any one the power to speak to him in such language as that after all what had he saidhe had not even whispered a word of murder he had only made an offer of what he would do if anty should die besides no one but themselves had heard even that and then his thoughts went off to another train whod have thought he said to himself the man was such a fool he meant it at first as well as i did myself im sure he did hed never have caught as he did about the farm else only he got afraidthe confounded fool as for hanging ill let him know its just as easy for me to tell a story i suppose as it is for him and then barry too dragged himself up to bed and cursed himself to sleep his waking thoughts however were miserable enough     xxviii  fanny wyndham rebels   we will now return to grey abbey lord cashel and that unhappy lovesick heiress his ward fanny wyndham affairs there had taken no turn to give increased comfort either to the earl or to his niece during the month which succeeded the news of young harry wyndhams death  the former still adhered with fixed pertinacity of purpose to the matrimonial arrangement which he had made with his son circumstances indeed rendered it even much more necessary in the earls eyes than it had appeared to be when he first contemplated this scheme for releasing himself from his sons pecuniary difficulties he had as the reader will remember advanced a very large sum of money to lord kilcullen to be repaid out of fanny wyndhams fortune this money lord kilcullen had certainly appropriated in the manner intended by his father but it had anything but the effect of quieting the creditors the payments were sufficiently large to make the whole hungry crew hear that his lordship was paying his debts but not at all sufficient to satisfy their craving indeed nearly the whole went in liquidation of turf engagements and gambling debts the jews moneylenders and tradesmen merely heard that money was going from lord kilcullens pocket but with all their exertions they got very little of it themselves  consequently claims of all kindsbills duns remonstrances and threats poured in not only upon the son but also upon the father the latter it is true was not in his own person liable for one penny of them nor could he well on his own score be said to be an embarrassed man but he was not the less uneasy he had determined if possible to extricate his son once more and as a preliminary step had himself already raised a large sum of money which it would much trouble him to pay and he moreover as he frequently said to lord kilcullen would not and could not pay another penny for the same purpose until he saw a tolerably sure prospect of being repaid out of his wards fortune  he was therefore painfully anxious on the subject anxious not only that the matter should be arranged but that it should be done at once it was plain that lord kilcullen could not remain in london for he would be arrested the same thing would happen at grey abbey if he were to remain there long without settling his affairs and if he were once to escape his creditors by going abroad there would be no such thing as getting him back again lord cashel saw no good reason why there should be any delay harry wyndham was dead above a month and fanny was evidently grieving more for the loss of her lover than that of her brother she naturally felt alone in the worldand as lord cashel thought one young viscount would be just as good as another the advantages too were much in favour of his son he would one day be an earl and possess grey abbey so great an accession of grandeur dignity and rank could not but be as the earl considered very delightful to a sensible girl like his ward the marriage of course neednt be much hurried four or five months time would do for that he was only anxious that they should be engagedthat lord kilcullen should be absolutely acceptedlord ballindine finally rejected  the earl certainly felt some scruples of conscience at the sacrifice he was making of his ward and stronger still respecting his wards fortune but he appeased them with the reflection that if his son were a gambler a roué and a scamp lord ballindine was probably just as bad and that if the latter were to spend all fannys money there would be no chance of redemption whereas he could at any rate settle on his wife a jointure which would be a full compensation for the loss of her fortune should she outlive her husband and fatherinlaw besides he looked on lord kilcullens faults as a father is generally inclined to look on those of a son whom he had not entirely given upwhom he is still striving to redeem he called his iniquitous vices follieshis licentiousness love of pleasurehis unprincipled expenditure and extravagance a want of the knowledge of what money was and his worst sin of all because the one least likely to be abandoned his positive unyielding damning selfishness he called fashionthe fashion of the young men of the day  poor lord cashel he wished to be honest to his ward and yet to save his son and his own pocket at the same time at her expense he wished to be in his own estimation highminded honourable and disinterested and yet he could not resist the temptation to be generous to his own flesh and blood at the expense of another the contest within him made him miserable but the devil and mammon were too strong for him particularly coming as they did half hidden beneath the gloss of parental affection there was little of the roman about the earl and he could not condemn his own son so he fumed and fretted and twisted himself about in the easy chair in his dingy bookroom and passed long hours in trying to persuade himself that it was for fannys advantage that he was going to make her lady kilcullen  he might have saved himself all his anxiety fanny wyndham had much too strong a mindmuch too marked a character of her own to be made lady anything by lord anybody lord cashel might possibly prevent her from marrying frank especially as she had been weak enough through illfounded pique and anger to lend him her name for dismissing him but neither he nor anyone else could make her accept one man while she loved another and while that other was unmarried  since the interview between fanny and her uncle and aunt which has been recorded she had been nearly as uncomfortable as lord cashel and she had to a certain extent made the whole household as much so as herself not that there was anything of the killjoy character in fannys composition but that the natural disposition of grey abbey and all belonging to it was to be dull solemn slow and respectable fanny alone had ever given any life to the place or made the house tolerable and her secession to the ranks of the sombre crew was therefore the more remarked if fanny moped all grey abbey might figuratively be said to hang down its head lady cashel was in every sense of the words continually wrapped up in wools and worsteds the earl was always equally ponderous and the specific gravity of lady selina could not be calculated it was beyond the power of figures even in algebraic denominations to describe her moral weight  and now fanny did mope and grey abbey was triste 43 indeed griffiths in my ladys boudoir rolled and unrolled those huge white bundles of mysterious fleecy hosiery with more than usually slow and unbroken perseverance my lady herself bewailed the fermentation among the jampots with a voice that did more than whine it was almost funereal as my lord went from breakfastroom to bookroom from bookroom to dressingroom and from dressingroom to diningroom his footsteps creaked with a sound more deadly than that of a deathwatch the bookroom itself had caught a darker gloom the backs of the books seemed to have lost their gilding and the mahogany furniture its french polish there like a god lord cashel sate alone throned amid clouds of awful dulness ruling the world of nothingness around by the silent solemnity of his inertia       footnote 43 tristefrench sad mournful dull dreary  lady selina was always useful but with a solid slow activity a dignified intensity of heavy perseverance which made her perhaps more intolerable than her father she was like some old coaches which we remembervery sure very respectable but so tedious so monotonous so heavy in their motion that a man with a spark of mercury in his composition would prefer any danger from a faster vehicle to their horrid weary murderous slow security lady selina from day to day performed her duties in a most uncompromising manner she knew what was due to her position and from it and exacted and performed accordingly with a stiff steady propriety which made her an awful if not a hateful creature one of her daily duties and one for the performance of which she had unfortunately ample opportunity was the consolation of fanny under her troubles poor fanny how great an aggravation was this to her other miseries for a considerable time lady selma had known nothing of the true cause of fannys gloom for though the two cousins were good friends as far as lady selina was capable of admitting so human a frailty as friendship still fanny could not bring herself to make a confidante of her her kind stupid unpretending old aunt was a much better person to talk to even though she did arch her eyebrows and shake her head when lord ballindines name was mentioned and assure her niece that though she had always liked him herself he could not be good for much because lord kilcullen had said so but fanny could not well dissemble she was tormented by lady selinas condolements and recommendations of gibbon her encomiums on industry and anathemas against idleness she was so often reminded that weeping would not bring back her brother nor inactive reflection make his fate less certain that at last she made her monitor understand that it was about lord ballindines fate that she was anxious and that it was his coming back which might be effected by weepingor other measures  lady selina was shocked by such feminine girlish weakness such want of dignity and character such forgetfulness as she said to fanny of what was due to her own position lady selina was herself unmarried and not likely to marry and why had she maintained her virgin state and foregone the blessings of love and matrimony because as she often said to herself and occasionally said to fanny she would not step down from the lofty pedestal on which it had pleased fortune and birth to place her  she learned however by degrees to forgive though she couldnt approve fannys weakness she remembered that it was a very different thing to be an earls niece and an earls daughter and that the same conduct could not be expected from fanny wyndham and lady selina grey  the two were sitting together in one of the grey abbey drawingrooms about the middle of april fanny had that morning again been talking to her guardian on the subject nearest to her heart and had nearly distracted him by begging him to take steps to make frank understand that a renewal of his visits at grey abbey would not be ill received lord cashel at first tried to frighten her out of her project by silence frowns and looks but not finding himself successful he commenced a long oration in which he broke down or rather which he had to cut up into sundry short speeches in which he endeavoured to make it appear that lord ballindines expulsion had originated with fanny herself and that banished or not banished the less fanny had to do with him the better his ward however declared in rather a tempestuous manner that if she could not see him at grey abbey she would see him elsewhere and his lordship was obliged to capitulate by promising that if frank were unmarried in twelve months time and fanny should then still be of the same mind he would consent to the match and use his influence to bring it about this by no means satisfied fanny but it was all that the earl would say and she had now to consider whether she would accept those terms or act for herself had she had any idea what steps she could with propriety take in opposition to the earl she would have withdrawn herself and her fortune from his house and hands without any scruples of conscience but what was she to do she couldnt write to her lover and ask him to come back to herwhither could she go she couldnt well set up house for herself  lady selina was bending over her writingdesk and penning most decorous notes with a precision of calligraphy which it was painful to witness she was writing orders to dublin tradesmen and each order might have been printed in the complete letterwriter as a specimen of the manner in which young ladies should address such correspondents fanny had a volume of french poetry in her hand but had it been greek prose it would have given her equal occupation and amusement it had been in her hands halfanhour and she had not read a line  fanny said lady selina raising up her thin red spiral tresses from her desk and speaking in a firm decided tone as if well assured of the importance of the question she was going to put dont you want some things from elliss  from where selina said fanny slightly starting  from elliss repeated lady selina  oh the man in grafton streetno thank you and fanny returned to her thoughts  surely you do fanny said her ladyship im sure you want black crape you were saying so on friday last  was iyes i think i do itll do another time selina never mind now  you had better have it in the parcel he will send tomorrow if youll give me the pattern and tell me how much you want ill write for it  thank you selina youre very kind but i wont mind it today  how very foolish of you fanny you know you want it and then youll be annoyed about it youd better let me order it with the other things  very well dear order it then for me  how much will you want you must send the pattern too you know  indeed selina i dont care about having it at all i can do very well without it so dont mind troubling yourself  how very ridiculous fanny you know you want black crapeand you must get it from elliss lady selina paused for a reply and then added in a voice of sorrowful rebuke its to save yourself the trouble of sending jane for the pattern  well selina perhaps it is dont bother me about it now theres a dear ill be more myself byandby but indeed indeed im neither well nor happy now  not well fanny what ails you  oh nothing ails me that is nothing in the doctors way i didnt mean i was ill  you said you werent well and people usually mean by that that they are ill  but i didnt mean it said fanny becoming almost irritated i only meant and she paused and did not finish her sentence  lady selina wiped her pen in her scarlet embroidered penwiper closed the lid of her patent inkstand folded a piece of blottingpaper over the note she was writing pushed back the ruddy ringlets from her contemplative forehead gave a slight sigh and turned herself towards her cousin with the purpose of commencing a vigorous lecture and crossexamination by which she hoped to exorcise the spirit of lamentation from fannys breast and restore her to a healthful activity in the performance of this worlds duties fanny felt what was coming she could not fly so she closed her book and her eyes and prepared herself for endurance  fanny said lady selina in a voice which was intended to be both severe and sorrowful you are giving way to very foolish feelings in a very foolish way you are preparing great unhappiness for yourself and allowing your mind to waste itself in uncontrolled sorrow in a mannerin a manner which cannot but be ruinously injurious my dear fanny why dont you do somethingwhy dont you occupy yourself youve given up your work youve given up your music youve given up everything in the shape of reading how long fanny will you go on in this sad manner lady selina paused but as fanny did not immediately reply she continued her speech ive begged you to go on with your reading because nothing but mental employment will restore your mind to its proper tone im sure ive brought you the second volume of gibbon twenty times but i dont believe youve read a chapter this month back how long will you allow yourself to go on in this sad manner  not long selina as you say im sad enough  but is it becoming in you fanny to grieve in this way for a man whom you yourself rejected because he was unworthy of you  selina ive told you before that such was not the case i believe him to be perfectly worthy of me and of any one much my superior too  but you did reject him fanny you bade papa tell him to discontinue his visitsdidnt you  fanny felt that her cousin was taking an unfair advantage in throwing thus in her teeth her own momentary folly in having been partly persuaded partly piqued into quarrelling with her lover and she resented it as such if i did she said somewhat angrily it does not make my grief any lighter to know that i brought it on myself  no fanny but it should show you that the loss for which you grieve is past recovery sorrow for which there is no cure should cease to be grieved for at any rate openly if lord ballindine were to die you would not allow his death to doom you to perpetual sighs and perpetual inactivity no youd then know that grief was hopeless and youd recover  but lord ballindine is not dead said fanny  ah thats just the point continued her ladyship he should be dead to you to you he should now be just the same as though he were in his grave you loved him some time since and accepted him but you found your love misplacedunreturned or at any rate coldly returned though you loved him you passed a deliberate judgment on him and wisely rejected him having done so his name should not be on your lips his form and figure should be forgotten no thoughts of him should sully your mind no love for him should be permitted to rest in your heart it should be rooted out whatever the exertion may cost you  selina i believe you have no heart yourself  perhaps as much as yourself fanny ive heard of some people who were said to be all heart i flatter myself i am not one of them i trust i have some mind to regulate my heart and some conscience to prevent my sacrificing my duties for the sake of my heart  if you knew said fanny the meaning of what love was youd know that it cannot be given up in a moment as you suppose rooted out as you choose to call it but to tell you the truth selina i dont choose to root it out i gave my word to frank not twelve months since and that with the consent of every one belonging to me i owned that i loved him and solemnly assured him i would always do so i cannot and i ought not and i will not break my word you would think of nothing but what you call your own dignity i will not give up my own happiness and i firmly believe his too for anything so empty  dont be angry with me fanny said lady selina my regard for your dignity arises only from my affection for you i should be sorry to see you lessen yourself in the eyes of those around you you must remember that you cannot act as another girl might whose position was less exalted miss ojoscelyn might cry for her lost lover till she got him back again or got another and no one would be the wiser and she would not be the worse but you cannot do that rank and station are in themselves benefits but they require more rigid conduct much more control over the feelings than is necessary in a humbler position you should always remember fanny that much is expected from those to whom much is given  and im to be miserable all my life because im not a parsons daughter like miss ojoscelyn  god forbid fanny if youd employ your time engage your mind and cease to think of lord ballindine youd soon cease to be miserable yes though you might never again feel the happiness of loving you might still be far from miserable  but i cant cease to think of him selinai wont even try  then fanny i truly pity you  no selina its i that pity you said fanny roused to energy as different thoughts crowded to her mind you who think more of your position as an earls daughteran aristocrat than of your nature as a woman thank heaven im not a queen to be driven to have other feelings than those of my sex i do love lord ballindine and if i had the power to cease to do so this moment id sooner drown myself than exercise it  then why were you weak enough to reject him  because i was a weak wretched foolish girl i said it in a moment of passion and my uncle acted on it at once without giving me one minute for reflectionwithout allowing me one short hour to look into my own heart and find how i was deceiving myself in thinking that i ought to part from him i told lord cashel in the morning that i would give him up and before i had time to think of what i had said he had been here and had been turned out of the house oh selina it was very very cruel in your father to take me at my word so shortly and fanny hid her face in her handkerchief and burst into tears  thats unfair fanny it couldnt be cruel in him to do for you that which he would have done for his own daughter he thought and thinks that lord ballindine would not make you happy  why should he think sohed no business to think so sobbed fanny through her tears  who could have a business to think for you if not your guardian  why didnt he think so then before he encouraged me to receive him it was because frank wouldnt do just what he was bid it was because he wouldnt become stiff and solemn and grave likelike fanny was going to make a comparison that would not have been flattering either to lady selina or to her father but she did not quite forget herself and stopped short without expressing the likeness had he spoken against him at first i would have obeyed but i will not destroy myself now for his prejudices and fanny buried her face among the pillows of the sofa and sobbed aloud  lady selina walked over to the sofa and stood at the head of it bending over her cousin she wished to say something to soothe and comfort her but did not know how there was nothing soothing or comforting in her nature nothing soft in her voice her manner was repulsive and almost unfeeling and yet she was not unfeeling she loved fanny as warmly as she was capable of loving she would have made almost any personal sacrifice to save her cousin from grief she would were it possible have borne her sorrows herself but she could not unbend she could not sit down by fannys side and taking her hand say soft and soothing things she could not make her grief easier by expressing hope for the future or consolation for the past she would have felt that she was compromising truth by giving hope and dignity by uttering consolation for the loss of that which she considered better lost than retained lady selinas only recipe was endurance and occupation and at any rate she practised what she preached she was never idle and she never complained  as she saw fannys grief and heard her sobs she at first thought that in mercy she should now give up the subject of the conversation but then she reflected that such mercy might be the greatest cruelty and that the truest kindness would be to prove to fanny the hopelessness of her passion  but fanny she said when the others tears were a little subsided its no use either saying or thinking impossibilities what are you to do you surely will not willingly continue to indulge a hopeless passion  selina youll drive me mad if you go on let me have my own way  but fanny if your own ways a bad way surely you wont refuse to listen to reason you must know that what i say is only from my affection i want you to look before you i want you to summon courage to look forward and then im sure your common sense will tell you that lord ballindine can never be anything to you  look here selina and fanny rose and wiped her eyes and somewhat composed her ruffled hair which she shook back from her face and forehead as she endeavoured to repress the palpitation which had followed her tears i have looked forward and i have determined what i mean to do it was your father who brought me to this by forcing me into a childish quarrel with the man i love i have implored him almost on my knees to invite lord ballindine again to grey abbey he has refused to do so at any rate for twelve months  and has he consented to ask him at the end of twelve months asked selina much astonished and to tell the truth considerably shocked at this instance of what she considered her fathers weakness  he might as well have said twelve years replied fanny how can i how can any one suppose that he should remain single for my sake for twelve months after being repelled without a cause or without a word of explanation without even seeing meturned out of the house and insulted in every way no whatever he might do i will not wait twelve months ill ask lord cashel once again and then fanny paused for a moment to consider in what words she would finish her declaration  well fanny said selina waiting with eager expectation for fannys final declaration for she expected to hear her say that she would drown herself or lock herself up for ever or do something equally absurd  then continued fannyand a deep blush covered her face as she spoke i will write to lord ballindine and tell him that i am still his own if he chooses to take me  oh fanny do not say such a horrid thing write to a man and beg him to accept you no fanny i know you too well at any rate to believe that youll do that  indeed indeed i will  then youll disgrace yourself for ever oh fanny though my heart were breaking though i knew i were dying for very love id sooner have it break id sooner die at once than disgrace my sex by becoming a suppliant to a man  disgrace selinaand am i not now disgraced have i not given him my solemn word have i not pledged myself to him as his wife have i not sworn to him a hundred times that my heart was all his own have i not suffered those caresses which would have been disgraceful had i not looked on myself as almost already his bride and is it no disgrace after that to break my wordto throw him aside like a glove that wouldnt fitto treat him as a servant that wouldnt suit meto send him a contemptuous message to be goneand so to forget him that i might lay myself out for the addresses and admiration of another could any conduct be worse than thatany disgrace deeper oh selina i shudder as i think of it could i ever bring my lips to own affection for another without being overwhelmed with shame and disgrace and then that the world should say that i had accepted and rejoiced in his love when i was poor and rejected it with scorn when i was rich no i would soonerten thousand times sooner my uncle should do it for me but if he will not write to frank i will and though my hand will shake and my face will be flushed as i do so i shall never think that i have disgraced myself  and if fannyif after that he refuses you  fanny was still standing and she remained so for a moment or two meditating her reply and then she answered  should he do so then i have the alternative which you say you would prefer then i will endeavour to look forward to a broken heart and death without a complaint and without tears then selina and she tried to smile through the tears which were again running down her cheeks ill come to you and endeavour to borrow your stoic endurance and patient industry and as she said so she walked to the door and escaped before lady selina had time to reply     xxix  the countess of cashel in trouble   after considerable negotiation between the father and the son the time was fixed for lord kilcullens arrival at grey abbey the earl tried much to accelerate it and the viscount was equally anxious to stave off the evil day but at last it was arranged that on the 3rd of april he was to make his appearance and that he should commence his wooing as soon as possible after that day  when this was absolutely fixed lord cashel paid a visit to his countess in her boudoir to inform her of the circumstance and prepare her for the expected guest he did not however say a word of the purport of his sons visit he had at one time thought of telling the old lady all about it and bespeaking her influence with fanny for the furtherance of his plan but on reconsideration he reflected that his wife was not the person to be trusted with any intrigue so he merely told her that lord kilcullen would be at grey abbey in five days that he would probably remain at home a long time that as he was giving up his london vices and extravagances and going to reside at grey abbey he wished that the house should be made as pleasant for him as possible that a set of friends relatives and acquaintances should be asked to come and stay there and in short that lord kilcullen having been a truly prodigal son should have a fatted calf prepared for his arrival  all this flurried and rejoiced terrified and excited my lady exceedingly in the first place it was so truly delightful that her son should turn good and proper and careful and decorous just at the right time of life so exactly the thing that ought to happen of course young noblemen were extravagant and wicked and lascivious habitual breakers of the commandments and selfidolators it was their nature in lady cashels thoughts on the education of young men these evils were ranked with the measles and hooping cough it was well that they should be gone through and be done with early in life she had a kind of hazy idea that an operadancer and a gambling club were indispensable in fitting a young aristocrat for his future career and i doubt whether she would not have agreed to the expediency of inoculating a son of hers with these ailments in a mild degreevaccinating him as it were with dissipation in order that he might not catch the disease late in life in a violent and fatal form she had not therefore made herself unhappy about her son for a few years after his first entrance on a life in london but latterly she had begun to be a little uneasy tidings of the great amount of his debts reached even her ears and moreover it was nearly time that he should reform and settle down during the last twelve months she had remarked fully twelve times to griffiths that she wondered when kilcullen would marryand she had even twice asked her husband whether he didnt think that such a circumstance would be advantageous she was therefore much rejoiced to hear that her son was coming to live at home but then why was it so sudden it was quite proper that the house should be made a little gay for his reception that he shouldnt be expected to spend his evenings with no other society than that of his father and mother his sister and his cousin but how was she to get the house ready for the people and the people ready for the house at so very short a noticewhat trouble also it would be to herneither she nor griffiths would know another moments rest besidesand the thought nearly drove her into hystericswhere was she to get a new cook  however she promised her husband to do her best she received from him a list of people to be invited and merely stipulating that she shouldnt be required to ask any one except the parson of the parish under a week undertook to make the place as bearable as possible to so fastidious and distinguished a person as her own son  her first confidante was of course griffiths and with her assistance the wool and the worsted and the knittingneedles the unfinished vallances and interminable yards of fringe were put up and rolled out of the way and it was then agreed that a council should be held to which her ladyship proposed to invite lady selina and fanny griffiths however advanced an opinion that the latter was at present too lackadaisical to be of any use in such a matter and strengthened her argument by asserting that miss wyndham had of late been quite mumchance 44 lady cashel was at first rather inclined to insist on her niece being called to the council but griffithss eloquence was too strong and her judgment too undoubted so fanny was left undisturbed and lady selina alone summoned to join the aged female senators of grey abbey       footnote 44 mumchancesilent and idle  selina said her ladyship as soon as her daughter was seated on the sofa opposite to her mothers easy chair while griffiths having shut the door had according to custom sat herself down on her own softbottomed chair on the further side of the little table that always stood at the countesss right hand selina what do you think your father tells me  lady selina couldnt think and declined guessing for as she remarked guessing was a loss of time and she never guessed right  adolphus is coming home on tuesday  adolphus why its not a month since he was here  and hes not coming only for a visit hes coming to stay here from what your father says i suppose hell stay here the greater part of the summer  what stay at grey abbey all may and june said lady selina evidently discrediting so unlikely a story and thinking it all but impossible that her brother should immure himself at grey abbey during the london season  its true my lady said griffiths oracularly as if her word were necessary to place the countesss statement beyond doubt  yes continued lady cashel and he has given up all his establishment in londonhis horses and clubs and the opera and all that hell go into parliament i dare say now for the county at any rate hes coming to live at home here for the summer  and has he sold all his horses asked lady selina  if hes not done it hes doing it said the countess i declare im delighted with him it shows such proper feeling i always knew he would i was sure that when the time came for doing it adolphus would not forget what was due to himself and to his family  if what you say is true mamma hes going to be married  thats just what i was thinking my lady said griffiths when her ladyship first told me all about ithow his lordship was coming down to live regular and decorous among his own people and that he was turning his back upon his pleasures and iniquities thinks i to myself therell be wedding favours coming soon to grey abbey  if it is so selina your father didnt say anything to me about it said the countess somewhat additionally flustered by the importance of the last suggestion and if hed even guessed such a thing im sure hed have mentioned it  it mightnt be quite fixed you know mamma but if adolphus is doing as you say you may be sure hes either engaged or thinking of becoming so  well my dear im sure i wish it may be so only i own id like to know because it makes a difference as to the people hed like to meet you know im sure nothing would delight me so much as to receive adolphuss wife of course shed always be welcome to lie in hereindeed itd be the fittest place but we should be dreadfully put about eh griffiths  why we should my lady but to my mind this would be the only most proper place for my lords heir to be born in if the mother and child couldnt have the best of minding here where could they  of course griffiths and we wouldnt mind the trouble on such an occasion i think the south room would be the best because of the dressingroom being such a good size and neither of the fireplaces smoking you know  well i dont doubt but it would my lady only the blue room is nearer to your ladyship here and in course your ladyship would choose to be in and out  and visions of caudle cups cradles and monthly nurses floated over lady cashels brain and gave her a kind of dreamy feel that the world was going to begin again with her  but mamma is adolphus really to be here on tuesday said lady selina recalling the two old women from their attendance on the unborn to the necessities of the present generation  indeed he is my dear and thats what i sent for you for your papa wishes to have a good deal of company here to meet your brother and indeed its only reasonable for of course this place would be very dull for him if there was nobody here but ourselvesand hes always used to see so many people but the worst is its all to be done at once and you know therell be so much to be got through before well be ready for a house full of companythings to be got from dublin and the people to be asked and then selina and her ladyship almost wept as the latter came to her great final difficultywhat are we to do about a cookrichardsll never do griffiths says she wont even do for ourselves as it is  indeed she wont my lady it was only impudence in her coming to such a place at allshed never be able to send a dinner up for eighteen or twenty  what are we to do griffiths what can have become of all the cooksim sure there used to be cooks enough when i was first married  well my lady i think they must be all gone to england those that are any good but i dont know whats come to the servants altogether as your ladyship says theyre quite altered for the worse since we were young  but mamma said lady selina youre not going to ask people here just immediately are you  directly my dear your papa wishes it done at once were to have a dinnerparty this day weekthatll be thursday and well get as many of the people as we can to stay afterwards and well get the ojoscelyns to come on wednesday just to make the table look not quite so bare and i want you to write the notes at once therell be a great many things to be got from dublin too  its very soon after poor harry wyndhams death to be receiving company said lady selina solemnly really mamma i dont think it will be treating fanny well to be asking all these people so soon the ojoscelyns or the fitzgeralds are all very welljust our own near neighbours but dont you think mamma its rather too soon to be asking a housefull of strange people  well my love i was thinking so and i mentioned it to your father but he said that poor harry had been dead a month nowand thats true you knowand that people dont think so much now about those kind of things as they used to and thats true too i believe  indeed you may say that my lady interposed griffiths i remember when bombazines used to be worn three full months for an uncle or cousin and now theyre hardly ever worn at all for the like except in cases where the brother or sister of him or her as is dead may be stopping in the house and then only for a month and they were always worn the full six months for a brother or sister and sometimes the twelve months round your aunt lady charlotte my lady wore hers the full twelve months when your uncle lord frederick was shot by sir patrick odonnel and now they very seldom never i may say wear them the six monthsindeed i think mourning is going out altogether and im very sorry for it for its a very decent proper sort of thing at least such was always my humble opinion my lady  well but what i was saying is continued the countess that what would be thought strange a few years ago isnt thought at all so now and though im sure selina i wouldnt like to do anything that looked unkind to fanny i really dont see how we can help it as your father makes such a point of it  i cant say i think its right mamma for i dont but if you and papa do of course ive nothing further to say  well my love i dont know that i do exactly think its right and im sure its not my wish to be having people especially when i dont know where on earth to turn for a cook but what can we do my dear adolphus wouldnt stay the third night here im sure if there was nobody to amuse him and you wouldnt have him turned out of the house would you  i have him turned out mamma god forbid id sooner he should be here than anywhere for here he must be out of harms way but still i think that if he comes to a house of mourning he might for a short time submit to put up with its decent tranquillity  selina said the mother pettishly i really thought youd help me when ive so much to trouble and vex meand not make any fresh difficulties how can i help itif your father says the people are to come i cant say i wont let them in i hope you wont make fanny think im doing it from disrespect to her im sure i wouldnt have a soul here for a twelvemonth on my own account  im sure miss wyndham wont think any such thing my lady said griffiths will she lady selinaindeed i dont think shell matter it one pin  indeed selina i dont think she will said the countess and then she half whispered to her daughter poor fanny its not about her brother shes grieving its that horrid man ballindine she sent him away and now she wants to have him back i really think a little company will be the best thing to bring her to herself again there was a little degree of humbug in this whisper for her ladyship meant her daughter to understand that she wouldnt speak aloud about fannys loveaffair before griffiths and yet she had spent many a half hour talking to her factotum on that very subject indeed what subject was there of any interest to lady cashel on which she did not talk to griffiths  well mamma said lady selina dutifully ill not say another word about it only let me know what you want me to do and ill do it who is it you mean to ask  why first of all theres the fitzgeralds your father thinks that lord and lady george would come for a week or so and you know the girls have been long talking of coming to grey abbeythese two years i believe and more  the girls will come i dare say mamma though i dont exactly think theyre the sort of people who will amuse adolphus but i dont think lord george or lady george will sleep away from home we can ask them however mountains is only five miles from here and im sure theyll go back after dinner  well my dear if they will they must and i cant help it only i must say itll be very illnatured of them im sure its a long time since they were asked to stay here  as you say mamma at any rate we can ask them and who comes next  why your father has put down the swinburn people next though im sure i dont know how they are to come so far  why mamma the colonel is a martyr to the gout  yes my lady said griffiths and mrs ellison is worse again with rheumatics there would be nothing to do the whole time but nurse the two of them  never mind griffiths youll not have to nurse them so you neednt be so illnatured  me illnatured my lady im sure i begs pardon but i didnt mean nothing illnatured besides mrs ellison was always a very nice lady to me and im sure id be happy to nurse her if she wanted it only that as in duty bound ive your ladyship to look to first and so couldnt spare time very well for nursing any one  of course you couldnt griffiths but selina at any rate you must ask the ellisons your papa thinks a great deal about the colonelhe has so much influence in the county and adolphus will very likely stand now your papa and the colonel were members together for the county more than forty years since  well mamma ill write mrs ellison shall i say for a week or ten days  say for ten days or a fortnight and then perhaps theyll stay a week then theres the bishop of maryborough and mrs moore im sure adolphus will be glad to meet the bishop for it was he that christened him  very well mamma ill write to mrs moore i suppose the bishop is in dublin at present  yes my dear i believe so there cant be anything to prevent their coming  only that hes the managing man on the education board and hes giving up his time very much to that at present i dare say hell come but he wont stay long  well selina if he wont i cant help it and im sure now i think about the cook i dont see how were to expect anybody to stay what am i to do griffiths about that horrid woman  ill tell you what i was thinking my lady only i dont know whether your ladyship would like it either and if you didnt you could easily get rid of him when all these people are gone  get rid of who  i was going to say my ladyif your ladyship would consent to have a man cook for a time just to try  then i never will griffiths thered be no peace in the house with him  well your ladyship knows best in course only if you thought well of trying it of course you neednt keep the man and i know theres murray in dublin that was cook so many years to old lord galway i know hes to be heard of at the hotel in grafton street  i cant bear the thoughts of a man cook griffiths id sooner have three women cooks and im sure ones enough to plague anybody  but nones worse my lady said griffiths  you neednt tell me that i wonder selina if i were to write to my sister whether she could send me over anything that would answer  what from london my lady answered griffithsyoud find a london woman cook sent over in that way twice worse than any man shed be all airs and graces if your ladyship thought well of thinking about murray richards would do very well under him shes a decent poor creature poor womanonly she certainly is not a cook thatd suit for such a house as this and it was only impudence her thinking to attempt it  but mamma said lady selina do let me know to whom i am to write and then you and griffiths can settle about the cook afterwards the time is so very short that i ought not to lose a post  the poor countess threw herself back in her easy chair the picture of despair oh how much preferable were rolls of worsted and yards of netting to the toils and turmoil of preparing for and entertaining company she was already nearly overcome by the former she didnt dare to look forward to the miseries of the latter she already began to feel the ill effects of her sons reformation and to wish that it had been postponed just for a month or two till she was a little more settled  well mamma said lady selina as undisturbed and calm as ever and as resolved to do her duty without flinching shall we go on  the countess groaned and sighedtheres the list there selina which your father put down in pencil you know the people as well as i do just ask them all  but mamma im not to ask them all to stay herei suppose some are only to come to dinnerthe ojoscelyns and the parchments  ask the ojoscelyns for wednesday and thursday the girls might as well stay and sleep here but whats the good of writing to themcant you drive over to the parsonage and settle it all thereyou do nothing but make difficulties selina and my heads racking  lady selina sate silent for a short time conning the list and endeavouring to see her way through the labyrinth of difficulties which was before her without further trouble to her mother while the countess leaned back with her eyes closed and her hands placed on the arms of her chair as though she were endeavouring to get some repose after the labour she had gone through her daughter however again disturbed her  mamma she said trying by the solemnity of her tone to impress her mother with the absolute necessity she was under of again appealing to her upon the subject what are we to do about young men  about young men my dear  yes mamma therell be a housefull of young ladiestheres the fitzgeraldsand lady louisa prattand miss ellisonand the three ojoscelynsand not a single young man except mr ojoscelyns curate  well my dear im sure mr hills a very nice young man  so he is mamma a very good young man but he wont do to amuse such a quantity of girls if there were only one or two hed do very well besides im sure adolphus wont like it  why wont he talk to the young ladiesim sure he was always fond of ladies society  i tell you mamma it wont do therell be the bishop and two other clergymen and old colonel ellison who has always got the gout and lord george if he comesand im sure he wont if you want to make a pleasant party for adolphus you must get some young men besides you cant ask all those girls and have nobody to dance with them or talk to them  im sure my dear i dont know what youre to do i dont know any young men except mr hill and theres that young mr grundy who lives in dublin i promised his aunt to be civil to him cant you ask him down  he was here before mamma and i dont think he liked it im sure we didnt he didnt speak a word the whole day he was here hes not at all the person to suit adolphus  then my dear you must go to your papa and ask him its quite clear i cant make young men i remember years ago there always used to be too many of them and i dont know where theyre all gone to at any rate when they do come therell be nothing for them to eat and lady cashel again fell back upon her deficiencies in the kitchen establishment  lady selina saw that nothing more could be obtained from her mother no further intelligence as regarded the embryo party the whole burden was to lie on her shoulders and very heavy she felt it as far as concerned herself she had no particular wish for one kind of guest more than another it was not for herself that she wanted young men she knew that at any rate there were none within reach whom she could condescend to notice save as her fathers guests there could be no one there whose presence could be to her of any interest the gouty colonel and the worthy bishop would be as agreeable to her as any other men that would now be likely to visit grey abbey but lady selina felt a real desire that others in the house might be happy while there she was no flirt herself nor had she ever been it was not in her nature to be so but though she herself might be contented to twaddle with old men she knew that other girls would not yet it was not that she herself had no inward wish for that admiration which is desired by nearly every woman or that she thought a married state was an unenviable one no she could have loved and loved truly and could have devoted herself most scrupulously to the duties of a wife but she had vainly and foolishly built up for herself a pedestal and there she had placed herself nor would she come down to stand on common earth though apollo had enticed her unless he came with the coronet of a peer upon his brow  she left her mothers boudoir went down into the drawingroom and there she wrote her notes of invitation and her orders to the tradesmen and then she went to her father and consulted him on the difficult subject of young men she suggested the newbridge barracks where the dragoons were and the curragh where perhaps some stray denizen of pleasure might be found neither too bad for grey abbey nor too good to be acceptable to lord kilcullen and at last it was decided that a certain captain cokely and mat tierney should be asked they were both acquaintances of adolphus and though mat was not a young man he was not very old and was usually very gay  so that matter was settled and the invitations were sent off the countess overcame her difficulty by consenting that murray the man cook should be hired for a given time with the distinct understanding that he was to take himself off with the rest of the guests and so great was her ladyships sense of the importance of the negotiation that she absolutely despatched griffiths to dublin to arrange it though thereby she was left two whole days in solitary misery at grey abbey and had to go to bed and get up she really hardly knew how with such assistance as lady selinas maid could give her  when these things were all arranged selina told her cousin that adolphus was coming home and that a house full of company had been asked to meet him she was afraid that fanny would be annoyed and offended at being forced to go into company so soon after her brothers death but such was not the case she felt herself that her poor brother was not the cause of the grief that was near her heart and she would not pretend what she didnt really feel  you were quite right selina she said smiling about the things you said yesterday i should want from dublin now i shall want them and as i wouldnt accept of your goodnatured offer i must take the trouble of writing myself  if you like it fanny ill write for you said selina  oh no im not quite so idle as thatand she also began her preparations for the expected festivities little did either of them think that she fanny wyndham was the sole cause of all the trouble which the household and neighbourhood were to undergothe fatigue of the countess griffithss journey the arrival of the dread man cook richardss indignation at being made subordinate to such authority the bishops desertion of the education board the colonels dangerous and precipitate consumption of colchicum the quarrel between lord and lady george as to staying or not staying the new dresses of the miss ojoscelyns which their worthy father could so ill afford and above all the confusion misery rage and astonishment which attended lord kilcullens unexpected retreat from london in the middle of the summer and all in vain  how proud and satisfied lord ballindine might have been had he been able to see all this and could he have known how futile was every effort lord cashel could make to drive from fanny wyndhams heart the love she felt for him  the invitations however were generally speaking accepted the bishop and his wife would be most happy the colonel would come if the gout would possibly allow lady george wrote a note to say they would be very happy to stay a few days and lord george wrote another soon after to say he was sorry but that they must return the same evening the ojoscelyns would be delighted mat tierney would be very proud captain cokely would do himself the honour and last but not least mr murray would preside below stairsfor a serious consideration  what a pity so much trouble should have been taken they might all have stayed at home for fanny wyndham will never become lady kilcullen     xxx  lord kilcullen obeys his father   on the appointed day or rather on the night of the appointed day lord kilcullen reached grey abbey for it was about eleven oclock when his travellingphaëton rattled up to the door he had been expected to dinner at seven and the first attempts of murray in the kitchens of grey abbey had been kept waiting for him till halfpast eight but in vain at that hour the earl black with illhumour ordered dinner and remarked that he considered it criminal in any man to make an appointment who was not sufficiently attached to veracity to keep it  the evening was passed in moody silence the countess was disappointed for she always contrived to persuade herself that she was very anxious to see her son lady selina was really vexed and began to have her doubts as to her brothers coming at all what was to be done if it turned out that all the company had been invited for nothing as to fanny though very indifferent to the subject of her cousins coming she was not at all in a state of mind to dissipate the sullenness which prevailed the ladies went to bed early the countess grumbling at her lot in not being allowed to see her son and her daughter and niece marching off with their respective candlesticks in solemn silence the earl retired to his bookroom soon afterwards but he had not yet sat down when the quick rattle of the wheels was heard upon the gravel before the house  lord cashel walked out into the hall prepared to meet his son in a befitting manner that is with a dignified austerity that could not fail to convey a rebuke even to his hardened heart but he was balked in his purpose for he found that lord kilcullen was not alone mat tierney had come down with him kilcullen had met his friend in dublin and on learning that he also was bound for grey abbey on the day but one following had persuaded him to accelerate his visit had waited for him and brought him down in his own carriage the truth was that lord kilcullen had thought that the shades of grey abbey would be too much for him without some genial spirit to enlighten them he was delighted to find that mat tierney was to be there and was rejoiced to be able to convey him with him as a sort of protection from his fathers eloquence for the first two days of the visit  lord kilcullen your mother and i began the father intent on at once commenting on the iniquity of the late arrival when he saw the figure of a very stout gentleman amply wrapped up in travelling habiliments follow his son into the inner hall  tierney my lord said the son was good enough to come down with me i found that he intended to be here tomorrow and i told him you and my mother would be delighted to see him today instead  the earl shook mr tierneys hand and told him how very welcome he was at all times and especially at presentunexpected pleasures were always the most agreeable and then the earl bustled about and ordered supper and wine and fussed about the bedrooms and performed the necessary rites of hospitality and then went to bed without having made one solemn speech to his son so far lord kilcullen had been successful in his manoeuvre and he trusted that by making judicious use of mat tierney he might be able to stave off the evil hour for at any rate a couple of days  but he was mistaken lord cashel was now too much in earnest to be put off his purpose he had been made too painfully aware that his sons position was desperate and that he must at once be saved by a desperate effort or given over to utter ruin and to tell the truth so heavy were the new debts of which he heard from day to day so insurmountable seemed the difficulties that he all but repented that he had not left him to his fate the attempt however must again be made he was there in the house and could not be turned out but lord cashel determined that at any rate no time should be lost  the two new arrivals made their appearance the next morning greatly to lady cashels delight she was perfectly satisfied with her sons apology and delighted to find that at any rate one of her expected guests would not fail her in her need the breakfast went over pleasantly enough and kilcullen was asking mat to accompany him into the stables to see what novelties they should find there when lord cashel spoiled the arrangement by saying  could you spare me halfanhour in the bookroom first kilcullen  this request of course could not be refused and the father and son walked off leaving mat tierney to the charity of the ladies  there was much less of flippant overbearing impudence now about lord kilcullen much less of arrogance and insult from the son towards the father than there had been in the previous interview which has been recorded he seemed to be somewhat in dread to be cowed and ill at ease he tried however to assume his usual manner and followed his father into the bookroom with an affected air of indifference which very ill concealed his real feelings  kilcullen began the earl i was very sorry to see tierney with you last night it would have been much better that we should have been alone together at any rate for one morning i suppose you are aware that there is a great deal to be talked over between us  i suppose there is said the son but i couldnt well help bringing the man when he told me he was coming here  he didnt ask you to bring him i supposebut we will not talk about that will you do me the favour to inform me what your present plans are  my present plans my lord indeed ive no plansits a long time since i had a plan of my own i am however prepared to acquiesce entirely in any which you may propose i have come quite prepared to throw at miss wyndhams feet myself and my fortune  and do you expect her to accept you  you said she would my lord so i have taken that for granted i at any rate will ask her if she refuses me your lordship will perhaps be able to persuade her to a measure so evidently beneficial to all parties  the persuading must be with yourself but if you suppose you can carry her with a high hand without giving yourself the trouble to try to please her you are very much mistaken if you think shell accept you merely because you ask her you might save yourself the trouble and as well return to london at once  just as you please my lord but i thought i came in obedience to your express wishes  so you did but to tell you the truthyour manner in coming is very different from what i would wish it to be your  did you want me to crawl here on my hands and knees  i wanted you to come kilcullen with some sense of what you owe to those who are endeavouring to rescue you from ruin with some feeling of at any rate sorrow for the mad extravagance of your past career instead of that you come gay reckless and unconcerned as ever you pick up the first jovial companion you meet and with him disturb the house at a most unseasonable hour you are totally regardless of the appointments you make and plainly show that as you come here solely for your own pleasure you consider it needless to consult my wishes or my comfort are you aware that you kept your mother and myself two hours waiting for dinner yesterday  the pathos with which lord cashel terminated his speechand it was one the thrilling effect of which he intended to be overwhelmingalmost restored lord kilcullen to his accustomed effrontery  my lord he said i did not consider myself of sufficient importance to have delayed your dinner ten minutes  i have always endeavoured kilcullen to show the same respect to you in my house which my father showed to me in his but you do not allow me the opportunity but let that pass we have more important things to speak of when last we were here together why did you not tell me the whole truth  what truth my lord  about your debts kilcullen why did you conceal from me their full amount why at any rate did you take pains to make me think them so much less than they really are  conceal my lordthat is hardly fair considering that i told you expressly i could not give you any idea what was the amount i owed i concealed nothing if you deceived yourself the fault was not mine  you could not but have known that the claims against you were much larger than i supposed them to bedouble i suppose good heavenwhy in ten years more at this rate you would more than consume the fee simple of the whole property what can i say to you kilcullen to make you look on your own conduct in the proper light  i think you have said enough for the purpose you have told me to marry and i have consented to do so  do you think kilcullen you have spent the last eight years in a way which it can please a father to contemplate do you think i can look back on your conduct with satisfaction or content and yet you have no regret to express for the pastno promises to make for the future i fear it is all in vain i fear that what i am doing what i am striving to do is now all in vain i fear it is hopeless to attempt to recall you from the horrid reckless wicked mode of life you have adopted the sombre mantle of expostulatory eloquence had now descended on the earl and he continued turning full upon his victim and raising and lowering his voice with monotonous proprietyi fear it is to no good purpose that i am subjecting your mother and myself to privation restraint and inconvenience that i am straining every nerve to place you again in a position of respectability a position suitable to my fortune and your own rank i am endeavouring to retrieve the desperate extravagancethei must saythough i do not wish to hurt your feelings yet i must say disgraceful ruin of your past career and how do you help me what regret do you show what promises of amendment do you afford you drive up to my halldoor at midnight with your boon companion you disturb the whole household at most unseasonable hours and subject my family to the same disreputable irregularity in which you have yourself so long indulged can such doings kilcullen give me any hopes for the future can  my lordi am extremely sorry for the dinner what can i say more and as for mat tierney he is your own guest or her ladyshipsnot mine it is my misfortune to have come in the same carriage with him but that is the extent of my offence  well kilcullen if you think your conduct has always been such as it ought to be it is of little use for me to bring up arguments to the contrary  i dont think so my lord what can i say more i have done those things which i ought not to have done were i to confess my transgressions for the hour together i could not say more except that i have left undone the things which i ought to have done or do you want me to beat my breast and tear my hair  i want you lord kilcullen to show some sense of decencysome filial respect  well my lord here i am prepared to marry a wife of your own choosing and to set about the business this morning if you please i thought you would have called that decent filial and respectable  the earl could hardly gainsay this but still he could not bring himself to give over so soon the unusual pleasure of blowing up his only son it was so long since lord kilcullen had been regularly in his power and it might never occur again so he returned from consideration of the future to a further retrospect on the past  you certainly have played your cards most foolishly you have thrown away your moneyrather i should say my money in a manner which nothing can excuse or palliate you might have made the turf a source of gratifying amusement your income was amply sufficient to enable you to do so but you have possessed so little selfcontrol so little judgment so little discrimination that you have allowed yourself to be plundered by every blackleg and robbed by everyeverybody in short who chose to rob you the same thing has been the case in all your other amusements and pursuits  well my lord i confess it all isnt that enough  enough kilcullen said the earl in a voice of horrified astonishment how enoughhow can anything be enough after such a courseso wild so mad so ruinous  for heavens sake my lord finish the list of my iniquities or youll make me feel that i am utterly unfit to become my cousins husband  i fear you areindeed i fear you are are the horses disposed of yet kilcullen  indeed they are not my lord nor can i dispose of them there is more owing for them than they are worth you may say they belong to the trainer now  is the establishment in curzon street broken up  to tell the truth not exactly but ive no thoughts of returning there im still under rent for the house  the crossexamination was continued for a considerable timetill the earl had literally nothing more to say and lord kilcullen was so irritated that he told his father he would not stand it any longer then they went into money affairs and the earl spoke despondingly about ten thousands and twenty thousands and the viscount somewhat flippantly of fifty thousands and sixty thousands and this was continued till the earl felt that his son was too deep in the mire to be pulled out and the son thought that deep as he was there it would be better to remain and wallow in it than undergo so disagreeable a process as that to which his father subjected him in extricating him from it it was settled however that mr jervis lord cashels agent should receive full authority to deal summarily in all matters respecting the horses and their trainers the house in curzon street and its inhabitants and all other appendages and sources of expense which lord kilcullen had left behind him and that he kilcullen should at once commence his siege upon his cousins fortune and on this point the son bargained that as it would be essentially necessary that his spirits should be light and easy he was not during the operation to be subjected to any of his fathers bookroom conversations for this he stipulated as an absolute sine quâ non in the negotiation and the clause was at last agreed to though not without much difficulty  both father and son seemed to think that the offer should be made at once lord cashel really feared that his son would be arrested at grey abbey and he was determined to pay nothing further for him unless he felt secure of fannys fortune and whatever were lord kilcullens hopes and fears as to his future lot he was determined not to remain long in suspense as far as his projected marriage was concerned he was determined to do his best to accomplish it for he would have done anything to get the command of ready money if he was not successful at any rate he need not remain in the purgatory of grey abbey the queens bench would be preferable to that he was not however very doubtful he felt but little confidence in the constancy of any womans affection and a great deal in his own powers of fascination he had always been successful in his appeals to ladies hearts and did not doubt of being so now when the object of his adoration must as he thought be so dreadfully in want of some excitement something to interest her any fool might have her now thought he and she cant have any violent objection to being lady kilcullen for the present and lady cashel in due time he felt however something like remorse at the arrangement to which he was a party it was not that he was about to make a beautiful creature his own cousin miserable for life by uniting her to a spendthrift a roué and a gamblersuch was the natural lot of women in the higher ranks of lifebut he felt that he was robbing her of her money he would have thought it to be no disgrace to carry her off had another person been her guardian she would then have had fair play and it would be the guardians fault if her fortune were not secure but she had no friend now to protect her it was her guardian himself who was betraying her to ruin  however the money must be had and lord kilcullen was not long in quieting his conscience  tierney said kilcullen meeting his friend after his escape from the bookroom you are not troubled with a father now i believedo you recollect whether you ever had one  well i cant say i remember just at present said mat but i believe i had a sort of one once  im a more dutiful son than you said the other i never can forget mine i have no doubt an alligator on the banks of the nile is a fearful creaturea shark when ones bathing or a jungle tiger when ones out shooting ought im sure to be avoided but no creature yet created however hungry or however savage can equal in ferocity a governor who has to shell out his cash ive no wish for a têteàtête with any bloodyminded monster but id sooner meet a starved hyena singlehanded in the desert than be shut up for another hour with my lord cashel in that room of his on the righthand side of the hall if you hear of my having beat a retreat from grey abbey without giving you or any one else warning of my intention you will know that i have lacked courage to comply with a second summons to those gloomy realms if i receive another invite such as that i got this morning i am off  lady cashels guests came on the day appointed the carriages were driven up one after another in quick succession about an hour before dinnertime and as her ladyships mind became easy on the score of disappointments it was somewhat troubled as to the multitude of people to be fed and entertained murray had not yet forgiven the injury inflicted on him when the family dinner was kept waiting for lord kilcullen and richards was still pouting at her own degraded position the countess had spent the morning pretending to make arrangements which were in fact all settled by griffiths and when she commenced the operation of dressing herself she declared she was so utterly exhausted by what she had gone through during the last week as to be entirely unfit to entertain her company poor dear lady cashel was she so ignorant of her own nature as to suppose it possible that she should ever entertain anybody  however a glass of wine and some mysterious drops and a little paint a good deal of coaxing the sight of her diamonds and of a large pucecoloured turban somewhat revivified her and she was in her drawingroom in due time supported by lady selina and fanny ready to receive her visitors as soon as they should descend from their respective rooms  lady cashel had already welcomed lord george and shaken hands with the bishop and was now deep in turnips and tenpound freeholders with the gouty colonel who had hobbled into the room on a pair of crutches and was accommodated with two easy chairs in a cornerone for himself and the other for his feet  now my dear lady george said the countess you must not think of returning to mountains tonight indeed we made sure of you and lord george for a week  my dear lady cashel its impossible indeed we wished it of all things and tried it every way but we couldnt manage it lord george has so much to do theres the sessions tomorrow at dunlavin and he has promised to meet sir glenmalure aubrey about a road or a river or a bridgei forget which it is and they must attend to those things you know or the tenants couldnt get their corn to market but you dont know how sorry we are and such a charming set you have got here  well i know its no use pressing you but i cant tell you how vexed i am for i counted on you above all and adolphus will be so sorry you know lord kilcullens come home lady george  yes i was very glad to hear we were to meet him  oh yes hes come to stay here some time i believe hes got quite fond of grey abbey lately he and his father get on so well together its quite a delight to me  oh it must be im sure said lady george and the countess sidled off to the bishops fat wife  well this is very kind of you and the bishop to come at so short a notice indeed i hardly dared expect it i know he has so much to do in dublin with those horrid boards and things  he is busy there to be sure lady cashel but he couldnt deny himself the pleasure of coming to grey abbey he thinks so very much of the earl indeed hed contrive to be able to come here when he couldnt think of going anywhere else  im sure lord cashel feels how kind he is and so do i and so does adolphus lord kilcullen will be delighted to meet you and the bishop  the bishops wife assured the countess that nothing on earth at the present moment would give the bishop so much pleasure as meeting lord kilcullen  you know the bishop christened him dont you said lady cashel  no did he though said the bishops wife how very interesting  isnt it and adolphus longs to meet him hes so fond of everything thats highminded and talented adolphus is a little sarcastic perhapsi dont mind saying so to you but thats only to inferior sort of peoplenot talented you know some people are stupid and adolphus cant bear that  indeed they are my lady i was dining last week at mrs prijeans in merrion square you know mrs prijean  i think i met her at carton four years ago  well she is very heavy what do you think lady cashel she  adolphus cant bear people of that sort but hell be delighted with the bishop its so delightful his having christened him adolphus means to live a good deal here now indeed he and his father have so much in common that they cant get on very well apart and i really hope he and the bishopll see a good deal of each other and the countess left the bishops wife and sat herself down by old mrs ellison  my dear mrs ellison i am so delighted to see you once again at grey abbey its such ages since you were here  indeed it is lady cashel a very long time but the poor colonel suffers so much its rarely hes fit to be moved and indeed im not much better myself i was not able to move my left shoulder from a week before christmasday till a few days since  you dont say so rheumatism i suppose  oh yesall rheumatism no one knows what i suffer  and what do you use for it  oh theres nothing any use i know the very nature of rheumatism now ive had it so longand it minds nothing at all theres no preventing it and no curing it its like a bad husband lady cashel the best way is to put up with it  and how is the dear colonel mrs ellison  why he was just able to come here and that was all but he was dying to see lord cashel he thinks the ministersll be shaken about this business of oconnells and if so that therell be a general election and then whatll they do about the county  im sure lord cashel wanted to see the colonel on that very subject so does adolphuslord kilcullen you know i never meddle with those things but i really think adolphus is thinking of going into parliament you know hes living here at present his fathers views and his own are so exactly the same on all those sort of things that its quite delightful hes taking a deal of interest about the county lately is adolphus and about grey abbey too hes just the same his father used to be and that kind of thing is so pleasant isnt it mrs ellison  mrs ellison said it was and at the same moment groaned for her shoulder gave her a twinge  the subject of these eulogiums in the meantime did not make his appearance till immediately before dinner was announced and certainly did not evince very strongly the delight which his mother had assured her friends he would feel at meeting them for he paid but very little attention to any one but mat tierney and his cousin fanny he shook hands with all the old gentlemen bowed to all the old ladies and nodded at the young ones but if he really felt that strong desire which his mother had imputed to him of opening his heart to the bishop and the colonel respecting things temporal and spiritual he certainly very successfully suppressed his anxiety  he had during the last two or three days applied himself to the task of ingratiating himself with fanny he well knew how to suit himself to different characters and to make himself agreeable when he pleased and fanny though she had never much admired her dissipated cousin certainly found his conversation a relief after the usual oppressive tedium of grey abbey society  he had not begun by making love to her or expressing admiration or by doing or saying anything which could at all lead her to suspect his purpose or put her on her guard he had certainly been much more attentive to her much more intimate with her than he usually had been in his flying visits to grey abbey but then he was now making his first appearance as a reformed rake and besides he was her first cousin and she therefore felt no inclination to repel his advances  he was obliged in performance of a domestic duty to walk out to dinner with one of lady georges daughters but he contrived to sit next to fannyand much to his fathers satisfaction talked to her during the whole ceremony  and where have you hidden yourself all the morning fanny said he that nobody has seen anything of you since breakfast  whither have you taken yourself all the day rather that you had not a moment to come and look after us the miss ojoscelyns have been expecting you to ride with them walk with them talk with them and play la grace with them they didnt give up the sticks till it was quite dark in the hope of you and mr tierney making your appearance  well fanny dont tell my mother and ill tell you the truth promise now  oh im no telltale  well then and he whispered into her eari was running away from the miss ojoscelyns  but that wont do at all dont you know they were asked here for your especial edification and amusement  oh i know they were so were the bishop and the colonel and lord george and their respective wives and mr hill my dear mamma asked them all here for my amusement but you know one man may lead a horse to watera hundred cant make him drink i cannot cannot drink of the miss ojoscelyns and the bishop of maryborough  for shame adolphus you ought at any rate to do something to amuse them  amuse them my dear fanny who ever heard of amusing a bishop but its very easy to find fault what have you done yourself for their amusement  i didnt run away from them though had i done so there would have been more excuse for me than for you  so there would fanny said kilcullen feeling that she had alluded to her brothers death and im very very sorry all these people are here to bore you at such a time and doubly sorry that they should have been asked on my account they mistake me greatly here they know that ive thought grey abbey dull and have avoided it and now that ive determined to get over the feeling because i think it right to do so they make it ten times more unbearable than ever for my gratification its like giving a child physic mixed in sugar the sugars sure to be the nastiest part of the dose indeed i have no dislike to grey abbey at present though i own i have no taste for the sugar in which my kind mother has tried to conceal its proper flavour  well make the best of it theyll all be gone in ten days  ten days are they to stay ten days will you tell me fanny what was the object in asking mat tierney to meet such a party  to help you to amuse the young ladies  gracious heavens does lady cashel really expect mat tierney to play la grace with the miss ojoscelynswell the time will come to an end i suppose but in truth im more sorry for you than for any one it was very illjudged their getting such a crowd to bore you at such a time and lord kilcullen contrived to give his voice a tone of tender solicitude  kilcullen said the earl across the table you dont hear the bishop his lordship is asking you to drink wine with him  i shall be most proud of the honour said the son and bobbed his head at the bishop across the table  fanny was on the point of saying something respecting her brother to lord kilcullen which would have created a kind of confidence between them but the bishops glass of wine broke it off and from that time lord kilcullen was forced by his father into a general conversation with his guests  in the evening there was music and singing the miss ojoscelyns and miss fitzgeralds and mr hill performed even mat tierney condescended to amuse the company by singing the coronation first begging the bishop to excuse the peculiar allusions to the clargy contained in one of the verses and then fanny was asked to sing she had again become silent dull and unhappy was brooding over her miseries and disappointments and she declined lord kilcullen was behind her chair and when they pressed her he whispered to her dont sing for them fanny its a shame that they should tease you at such a time i wonder how my mother can have been so thoughtless  fanny persisted in declining to singand lord kilcullen again sat down beside her dont trouble yourself about them fanny said he theyre just fit to sing to each other its very good work for them  i should think it very good work as you call it for myself too another time only im hardly in singing humour at present and therefore obliged to you for your assistance and protection  your most devoted knight as long as this fearful invasion lastsyour amadis de gaulyour bertrand du guesclin 45 and no paladin of old ever attempted to defend a damsel from more formidable foes       footnote 45 amadis     du guesclinmediaeval heroes amadis                    de gaul was the title hero of a 14th century                    romantic novel probably first written in spanish                    which was popular throughout europe bertrand du                    guesclin was a historical figure a fourteenth                    century french soldier and marshall of france  indeed adolphus i dont think them so formidable many of them are my own friends  is mrs ellison your own friendor mrs moore  not exactly those two in particular  who then is it miss judith ojoscelyn or is the reverend mr hill one of those to whom you give that sweetest of all names  yes to both of them it was only this morning i had a long têteàtête  what with mr hill  no not with mr hill though it wouldnt be the first even with him but with judith ojoscelyn i lent her a pattern for worsted work  and does that make her your friend do you give your friendship so easily  you forget that ive known her for years  well now ive not ive seen her about three times in my life and spoken two words to her perhaps twice and yet ill describe her character to you and if you can say that the description is incorrect i will permit you to call her your friend  well lets hear the character  it wouldnt be kind in me though to laugh at your friend  oh shes not so especially and particularly my friend that you need mind that  then youll promise not to be angry  oh no i wont be angry  well then she has two passions they are for worsted and hymnbooks she has a moral objection to waltzing theoretically she disapproves of flirtations she encourages correspondence between young ladies always crosses her letters and never finished one for the last ten years without expressing entire resignation to the will of godas if she couldnt be resigned without so often saying so she speaks to her confidential friends of young men as a very worthless insignificant race of beings she is however prepared to take the very first that may be unfortunate enough to come in her way she has no ideas of her own but is quick enough at borrowing those of other people she considers herself a profound theologian dotes on a converted papist and looks on a puseyite 46 as something one shade blacker than the devil now isnt that sufficiently like for a portrait       footnote 46 puseyitea follower of edward pusey 18001882                    one of three scholars at oxford who started a                    movement critical of the church of england one                    of the three john henry newman converted to                    catholicism and pusey and his followers were                    accused of advocating catholic practices  its the portrait of a set i fear rather than an individual i dont know that its particularly like miss ojoscelyn except as to the worsted and hymnbooks  what not as to the waltzing resignation and worthless young men come are they not exactly her traits does she waltz  no she does not  and havent you heard her express a moral objection to it  well i believe i have  did you ever get a letter from her or see a letter of hers  i dont remember yes i did once a long time ago  and wasnt she very resigned in it  well i declare i believe she was and its very proper too people ought to be resigned  oh of course and now doesnt she love a convert and hate a puseyite  all irish clergymans daughters do that  well fanny you cant say but that it was a good portrait and after that will you pretend to say you call miss ojoscelyn your friend  not my very friend of friends but as friends go shes as good as most others  and who is the friend of friends fanny  come youre not my father confessor im not to tell you all if i told you that youd make another portrait  im sure i couldnt draw a disparaging picture of anybody you would really call your friend but indeed i pity you living among so many such people there can be nobody here who understands you  oh im not very unintelligible  much more so than miss ojoscelyn i shouldnt wish to have to draw your portrait  pray dont if it were frightful i should think you uncivil and if you made it handsome i should know you were flattering besides you dont know enough of me to tell me my character  i think i do but ill study it a little more before i put it on the canvass some likenesses are very hard to catch  fanny felt when she went to bed that she had spent a pleasanter evening than she usually did and that it was a much less nuisance to talk to her cousin adolphus than to either his father mother or sister and as she sat before her fire while her maid was brushing her hair she began to think that she had mistaken his character and that he couldnt be the hard sensual selfish man for which she had taken him her ideas naturally fell back to frank and her love her difficulties and sorrows and before she went to sleep she had almost taught herself to think that she might make lord kilcullen the means of bringing lord ballindine back to grey abbey  she had to be sure been told that her cousin had spoken ill of frank that it was he who had been foremost in decrying lord ballindines folly and extravagance but she had never heard him do so she had only heard of it through lord cashel and she quite ceased to believe anything her guardian might say respecting her discarded lover at any rate she would try some step she was determined to take about lord ballindine and if her cousin refused to act like a cousin and a friend she would only be exactly where she was before     xxxi  the two friends   the next three days passed slowly and tediously for most of the guests assembled at grey abbey captain cokely and a mr battersby came over from newbridge barracks but they did not add much to the general enjoyment of the party though their arrival was hailed with delight by some of the young ladies at any rate they made the rooms look less forlorn in the evenings and made it worth the girls while to put on their best bibs and tuckers  but whats the use of it at all said matilda fitzgerald to little letty ojoscelyn when she had spent threequarters of an hour in adjusting her curls and setting her flounces properly on the evening before the arrival of the two cavalry officers not a soul to look at us but a crusty old colonel a musty old bishop and a fusty old beau  whos the old beau said letty  why that mr tierney i cant conceive how lady cashel can have asked us to meet such a set and matilda descended pouting and out of humour  but on the next day she went through her work much more willingly if not more carefully  that captain cokelys a very nice fellow said matilda the best of that newbridge set out and out  well now i really think hes not so nice as mr battersby said letty im sure hes not so goodlooking  oh battersbys only a boy after all letty i dont know whether i like officers so much better than other menand she twisted her neck round to get a look at her back in the pierglass and gave her dress a little pull just above her bustle  im sure i do said letty theyve so much more to say for themselves and theyre so much smarter  why yes they are smarter said matilda and theres nothing on earth so dowdy as an old black coat but then officers are always going away you no sooner get to know one or two of a set and to feel that one of them is really a darling fellow but there they are offto jamaica china hounslow barracks or somewhere and then its all to do over again  well i do wish they wouldnt move them about quite so much  but lets go down i think ill do now wont i and they descended to begin the evening campaign  wasnt miss wyndham engaged to some one said old mrs ellison to mrs moore im sure some one told me so  oh yes she was said mrs moore the affair was settled and everything arranged but the man was very poor and a gamblerlord ballindine he has the name of a property down in mayo somewhere but when she got all her brothers money lord cashel thought it a pity to sacrifice itso he got her out of the scrape a very good thing for the poor girl for they say hes a desperate scamp  well i declare i think said mrs ellison shell not have far to look for another  what you think theres something between her and lord kilcullen said mrs moore  it looks like it at any rate dont it said mrs ellison  well i really think it does said mrs moore im sure id be very glad of it i know he wants money desperately and it would be such a capital thing for the earl  at any rate the lady does not look a bit unwilling said mrs ellison i suppose shes fond of rakish young men you say lord ballindine was of that set and im sure lord kilcullens the samehe has the reputation at any rate they say he and his father never speak except just in public to avoid the show of the thing  and the two old ladies set to work to a good dish of scandal  miss wyndhams an exceedingly fine girl said captain cokely to mat tierney as they were playing a game of piquet in the little drawingroom  yes said mat and shes a hundred thousand exceedingly fine charms too independently of her fine face  so i hear said cokely but i only believe half of what i hear about those things  she has more than that i know it  has she though faith do you know i think kilcullen has a mind to keep it in the family hes very soft on her and shes just as sweet to him i shouldnt be surprised if he were to marry now and turn steady  not at all there are two reasons against it in the first place hes too much dipped for even fannys fortune to be any good to him and secondly shes engaged  what to ballindine said cokely  exactly so said mat  ah my dear fellow thats all off long since i heard kilcullen say so myself ill back kilcullen to marry her against ballindine for a hundred pounds  done said mat and the bet was booked  the same evening tierney wrote to dot blake and said in a postscript i know you care for ballindine so do i but i dont write to him if he really wants to secure his turtledove he should see that she doesnt get bagged in his absence kilcullen is here and i tell you hes a keen sportsman they say its quite up with him in london and i should be sorry she were sacrificed she seems a nice girl  lord kilcullen had ample opportunities of forwarding his intimacy with fanny and he did not neglect them to give him his due he played his cards as well as his father could wish him he first of all overcame the dislike with which she was prepared to regard him he then interested her about himself and before he had been a week at grey abbey she felt that she had a sort of cousinly affection for him he got her to talk with a degree of interest about himself and when he could do that there was no wonder that tierney should have fears for his friends interests not that there was any real occasion for them fanny wyndham was not the girl to be talked out of or into a real passion by anyone  now tell me the truth fanny said kilcullen as they were sitting over the fire together in the library one dark afternoon before they went to dress for dinner hadnt you been taught to look on me as a kind of ogrea monster of iniquity who spoke nothing but oaths and did nothing but sin  not exactly that but i wont say i thought you were exactly just what you ought to be  but didnt you think i was exactly what i ought not to have been didnt you imagine now that i habitually sat up all night gambling and drinking buckets of champagne and brandyandwater and that i lay in bed all day devising iniquity in my dreams come now tell the truth and shame the devil if i am the devil i know people have made me out to be  why really adolphus i never calculated how your days and nights were spent but if i am to tell the truth i fear some of them might have been passed to better advantage  which of us fanny mightnt with truth say the same of ourselves  of course none of us said fanny dont think im judging you you asked me the questionand i suppose you wanted an answer  i did i wanted a true onefor though you may never have given yourself much trouble to form an opinion about me i am anxious that you should do so now i dont want to trouble you with what is done and past i dont want to make it appear that i have not been thoughtless and imprudentwicked and iniquitous if you are fond of strong terms neither do i want to trouble you with confessing all my improprieties that i may regularly receive absolution but i do wish you to believe that i have done nothing which should exclude me from your future good opinion from your friendship and esteem  i am not of an unforgiving temperament even had you done anything for me to forgive but i am not aware that you have  no nothing for you to forgive in the light of an offence to yourself but much perhaps to prevent your being willing to regard me as a personal friend were not only first cousins fanny but are placed more closely together than cousins usually are you have neither father nor mother now also you have no brother and he took her hands in his own as he said so who should be a brother to you if i am not who at any rate should you look on as a friend if not on me nobody could be better i believe than selina but she is stiff and coldunlike you in everything i should be so happy if i could be the friendthe friend of friends you spoke of the other evening if i could fill the place which must be empty near your heart i can never be this to you if you believe that anything in my past life has been really disgraceful it is for this reason that i want to know what you truly think of me i wont deny that i am anxious you should think well of mewell at any rate for the present and the future and charitably as regards the past  fanny had been taken much by surprise by the turn her cousin had given to the conversation and was so much affected that before he had finished she was in tears she had taken her hand out of his to put her handkerchief to her eyes and as she did not immediately answer he continued  i shall probably be much here for some time to comesuch at least are my present plans and i hope that while i am we shall become friends not such friends fanny as you and judith ojoscelynfriends only of circumstance who have neither tastes habits or feelings in commonfriends whose friendship consists in living in the same parish and meeting each other once or twice a week but friends in realityfriends in confidencefriends in mutual dependencefriends in lovefriends dear fanny as cousins situated as we are should be to each other  fannys heart was very full for she felt how much how desperately she wanted such a friend as kilcullen described how delightful it would be to have such a friend and to find him in her own cousin the whole family hitherto were so cold to herso uncongenial the earl she absolutely disliked she loved her aunt but it was only because she was her auntshe couldnt like her and though she loved lady selina and to a degree admired her it was like loving a marble figure there was more true feeling in what kilcullen had now said to her than in all that had fallen from the whole family for the four years she had lived at grey abbey and she could not therefore but close on the offer of his affection  shall we be such friends then said he or after all am i too bad have i too much of the taint of the wicked world to be the friend of so pure a creature as you  oh no adolphus im sure i never thought so said she i never judged you and indeed i am not disposed to do so now im too much in want of kindness to reject yourseven were i disposed to do so which i am not  then fanny we are to be friendstrue loving trusting friends  oh yes said fanny i am really truly grateful for your affection and kindness i know how precious they are and i will value them accordingly  again lord kilcullen took her hand and pressed it in his and then he kissed it and told her she was his own dear cousin fanny and then recommended her to go and dress which she did he sat himself down for a quarter of an hour ruminating and then also went off to dress but during that quarter of an hour very different ideas passed through his mind than such as those who knew him best would have given him credit for  in the first place he thought that he really began to feel an affection for his cousin fanny and to speculate whether it were absolutely within the verge of possibility that he should marry herretrieve his circumstancestreat her well and live happily for the rest of his life as a respectable nobleman  for two or three minutes the illusion remained till it was banished by retrospection it was certainly possible that he should marry her it was his full intention to do so but as to retrieving his circumstances and treating her wellthe first was absolutely impossiblethe other nearly so and as to his living happily at grey abbey as a family man he yawned as he felt how impossible it would be that he should spend a month in such a way let alone a life but then fanny wyndham was so beautiful so lively so affectionate so exactly what a cousin and a wife ought to be he could not bear to think that all his protestations of friendship and love had been hypocritical that he could only look upon her as a gudgeon and himself as a bigger fish determined to swallow her yet such must be his views regarding her he departed to dress absolutely troubled in his conscience  and what were fannys thoughts about her cousin she was much surprised and gratified but at the same time somewhat flustered and overwhelmed by the warmth and novelty of his affection however she never for a moment doubted his truth towards her or had the slightest suspicion of his real object her chief thought was whether she could induce him to be a mediator for her between lord cashel and lord ballindine  during the next two days he spoke to her a good deal about her brotherof whom bythebye he had really known nothing he contrived however to praise him as a young man of much spirit and great promise then he spoke of her own large fortune asked her what her wishes were about its investment and told her how happy he would be to express those wishes at once to lord cashel and to see that they were carried out once or twice she had gradually attempted to lead the conversation to lord ballindine but kilcullen was too crafty and had prevented her and she had not yet sufficient courage to tell him at once what was so near her heart  fanny said lady selina one morning about a week after the general arrival of the company at grey abbey and when some of them had taken their departure i am very glad to see you have recovered your spirits i know you have made a great effort and i appreciate and admire it  indeed selina i fear you are admiring me too soon i own i have been amused this week past and to a certain degree pleased but i fear youll find i shall relapse theres been no radical reform my thoughts are all in the same direction as they were  but the great trial in this world is to behave well and becomingly in spite of oppressive thoughts and it always takes a struggle to do that and that struggle youve made i hope it may lead you to feel that you may be contented and in comfort without having everything which you think necessary to your happiness im sure i looked forward to this week as one of unmixed trouble and torment but i was very wrong to do so it has given me a great deal of unmixed satisfaction  im very glad of that selina but what was it im sure it could not have come from poor mrs ellison or the bishops wife and you seemed to me to spend all your time in talking to them virtue they say is its own reward i dont know what other satisfaction you can have had from them  in the first place it has given me great pleasure to see that you were able to exert yourself in company and that the crowd of people did not annoy you but i have chiefly been delighted by seeing that you and adolphus are such good friends you must think fanny that i am anxious about an only brotherespecially when we have all had so much cause to be anxious about him and dont you think it must be a delight to me to find that he is able to take pleasure in your society i should be doubly pleased doubly delighted if i could please him myself but i have not the vivacity to amuse him  what nonsense selina dont say that  but its true fanny i have not and grey abbey has become distasteful to him because we are all sedate steady people perhaps some would call us dull and heavy and i have grieved that it should be so though i cannot alter my nature but you are so much the contrarythere is so much in your character like his own before he became fond of the world that i feel he can become attached to and fond of you and i am delighted to see that he thinks so himself what do you think of him now that you have seen more of him than you ever did before  indeed said fanny i like him very much  he is very clever isnt he he might have been anything if he had given himself fair play he seems to have taken greatly to you  oh yes we are great friends and then fanny pausedso great friends she continued looking somewhat gravely in lady selinas face that i mean to ask the greatest favour of him that i could ask of anyone one i am sure i little dreamed i should ever ask of him  what is it fanny is it a secret  indeed it is selina but its a secret i will tell you i mean to tell him all i feel about lord ballindine and i mean to ask him to see him for me adolphus has offered to be a brother to me and i mean to take him at his word  lady selina turned very pale and looked very grave as she replied  that is not giving him a brothers work fanny a brother should protect you from importunity and insult from injury and wrong and that i am sure adolphus would do but no brother would consent to offer your hand to a man who had neglected you and been refused and who in all probability would now reject you with scorn if he has the opportunityor if not that will take you for your moneys sake that fanny is not a brothers work and it is an embassy which i am sure adolphus will not undertake if you take my advice you will not ask him  as lady selina finished speaking she walked to the door as if determined to hear no reply from her cousin but as she was leaving the room she fancied that she heard her sobbing and her heart softened and she again turned towards her and said god knows fanny i do not wish to be severe or illnatured to you i would do anything for your comfort and happiness but i cannot bear to think that you shouldlady selina was puzzled for a word to express her meaningthat you should forget yourself and she attempted to put her arm round fannys waist  but she was mistaken fanny was not sobbing but was angry and what selina now said about her forgetting herself did not make her less so  no she said withdrawing herself from her cousins embrace and standing erect while her bosom was swelling with indignation i want no affection from you selina that is accompanied by so much disapprobation you dont wish to be severe only you say that i am likely to forget myself forget myself and fanny threw back her beautiful head and clenched her little fists by her side the other day you said disgrace myself and i bore it calmly then but i will not any longer bear such imputations i tell you plainly selina i will not forget myself nor will i be forgotten nor will i submit to whatever fate cold unfeeling people may doom me merely because i am a woman and alone i will not give up lord ballindine if i have to walk to his door and tell him so and were i to do so i should never think that i had forgotten myself  listen to me fanny said selina  wait a moment continued fanny i have listened enough it is my turn to speak now for one thing i have to thank you you have dispelled the idea that i could look for help to anyone in this family i will not ask your brother to do anything for me which you think so disgraceful i will not subject him to the scorn with which you choose to think my love will be treated by him who loved me so well that you should dare to tell me that he who did so much for my love should now scorn itoh selina that i may live to forget that you said those words and fanny for a moment put her handkerchief to her eyesbut it was but for a moment however she continued i will now act for myself as you think i might forget myself i tell you i will do it in no clandestine way i will write to lord ballindine and i will show my letter to my uncle the whole house shall read it if they please i will tell lord ballindine all the truthand if lord cashel turns me from his house i shall probably find some friend to receive me who may still believe that i have not forgotten myself and fanny wyndham sailed out of the room  lady selina when she saw that she was gone sat down on the sofa and took her book she tried to make herself believe that she was going to read but it was no use the tears dimmed her eyes and she put the book down  the same evening the countess sent for selina into her boudoir and with a fidgety mixture of delight and surprise told her that she had a wonderful piece of good news to communicate to her  i declare my dear she said its the most delightful thing ive heard for years and years and its just exactly what i had planned myself only i never told anybody dear me it makes me so happy  what is it mamma  your papa has been talking to me since dinner my love and he tells me adolphus is going to marry fanny wyndham  going to marry whom said lady selina almost with a shout  fanny i say its the most delightful match in the world its just what ought to be done i suppose they wont have the wedding before summer though may is a very nice month let me see it only wants three weeks to may  mamma what are you talking aboutyoure dreaming  dreaming my dear im not dreaming at all its a fact whodve thought of all this happening so soon out of this party which gave us so much trouble however i knew your father was right i said all along that he was in the right to ask the people  mamma said lady selina gravely listen to me calmly now and attentively i dont know what papa has told you but i tell you fanny does not dream of marrying adolphus he has never asked her and if he did she would never accept him fanny is more than ever in love with lord ballindine  the countess opened her eyes wide and looked up into her daughters face but said nothing  tell me mamma as nearly as you can recollect what it is papa has said to you that if possible we may prevent mischief and misery papa couldnt have said that fanny had accepted adolphus  he didnt say exactly that my dear but he said that it was his wish they should be married that adolphus was very eager for it and that fanny had received his attentions and admiration with evident pleasure and satisfaction and so she has my dear you couldnt but have seen that yourself  well mamma what else did papa say  why he said just what im telling you that i wasnt to be surprised if we were called on to be ready for the wedding at a short notice or at any rate to be ready to congratulate fanny he certainly didnt say she had accepted him but he said he had no doubt about it and im sure from what was going on last week i couldnt have any doubt either but he told me not to speak to anyone about it yet particularly not to fanny only my dear i couldnt help you know talking it over with you and the countess leaned back in her chair very much exhausted with the history she had narrated  now mamma listen to me it is not many hours since fanny told me she was unalterably determined to throw herself at lord ballindines feet  goodness gracious me how shocking said the countess  she even said that she would ask adolphus to be the means of bringing lord ballindine back to grey abbey  lord have mercy said the countess  i only tell you this mamma to show you how impossible it is that papa should be right  what are we to do my dear oh dear therell be such a piece of work what a nasty thing fanny is im sure shes been making love to adolphus all the week  no mamma she has not dont be unfair to fanny if there is anyone in fault it is adolphus but as you say what shall we do to prevent further misunderstanding i think i had better tell papa the whole  and so she did on the following morning but she was too late she did not do it till after lord kilcullen had offered and had been refused     xxxii  how lord kilcullen fares in his wooing   about twelve oclock the same night lord kilcullen and mat tierney were playing billiards and were just finishing their last game the bedcandles were lighted ready for them and tierney was on the point of making the final hazard  so youre determined to go tomorrow mat said kilcullen  oh yes ill go tomorrow your motherll take me for a second paddy rea else said mat  who the deuce was paddy rea  didnt you ever hear of paddy reamichael french of glare abbeyhes dead now but he was alive enough at the time im telling you of and kept the best house in county clarewell he was coming down on the limerick coach and met a deuced pleasant goodlooking talkative sort of a fellow atop of it they dined and got a tumbler of punch together at roscrea and when french got down at bird hill he told his acquaintance that if he ever found himself anywhere near ennis hed be glad to see him at glare abbey he was a hospitable sort of a fellow and had got into a kind of way of saying the same thing to everybody without meaning anything except to be civiljust as id wish a man good morning well french thought no more about the man whose name he didnt even know but about a fortnight afterwards a hack car from ennis made its appearance at glare abbey and the talkative traveller and a small portmanteau had soon found their way into the hail french was a good deal annoyed for he had some fashionables in the house but he couldnt turn the man out so he asked his name and introduced paddy rea to the company how long do you think he stayed at glare abbey  heaven only knowsthree months  seventeen years said mat they did everything to turn him out and couldnt do it it killed old french and at last his son pulled the house down and paddy rea went then because there wasnt a roof to cover him now i dont want to drive your father to pull down this house so ill go tomorrow  the place is so ugly that if you could make him do so it would be an advantage but im afraid the plan wouldnt succeed so i wont press you but if you go i shant remain long if it was to save my life and theirs i cant get up small talk for the rector and his curate  well good night said mat and the two turned off towards their bedrooms  as they passed from the billiardroom through the hall lord cashel shuffled out of his room in his slippers and dressinggown  kilcullen said he with a great deal of unconcerned good humour affected in his tone just give me one momentive a word to say to you goodnight mr tierney goodnight im sorry to hear were to lose you tomorrow  lord kilcullen shrugged his shoulders winked at his friend and then turned round and followed his father  its only one word kilcullen said the father who was afraid of angering or irritating his son now that he thought he was in so fair a way to obtain the heiress and her fortune ill not detain you half a minute and then he said in a whisper take my advice kilcullen and strike when the irons hot  i dont quite understand you my lord said his son affecting ignorance of his fathers meaning  i mean you cant stand better than you do with fanny youve certainly played your cards admirably and shes a charming girl a very charming girl and i long to know that shes your own take my advice and ask her at once  my lord said the dutiful son if im to carry on this affair i must be allowed to do it in my own way you i dare say have more experience than i can boast and if you choose to make the proposal yourself to miss wyndham on my behalf i shall be delighted to leave the matter in your hands but in that case i shall choose to be absent from grey abbey if you wish me to do it you must let me do it when i please and how i please  oh certainly certainly kilcullen said the earl i only want to point out that i think youll gain nothing by delay  very well my lord good night and lord kilcullen went to bed and the father shuffled back to his study he had had three different letters that day from lord kilcullens creditors all threatening immediate arrest unless he would make himself responsible for his sons debts no wonder that he was in a hurry poor man  and lord kilcullen though he had spoken so coolly on the subject and had snubbed his father was equally in a hurry he also received letters and threats and warnings and understood even better than his father did the perils which awaited him he knew that he couldnt remain at grey abbey another week that in a day or two it wouldnt be safe for him to leave the house and that his only chance was at once to obtain the promise of his cousins hand and then betake himself to some place of security till he could make her fortune available  when fanny came into the breakfastroom next morning he asked her to walk with him in the demesne after breakfast during the whole of the previous evening she had sat silent and alone pretending to read although he had made two or three efforts to engage her in conversation she could not however refuse to walk with him nor could she quite forgive herself for wishing to do so she felt that her sudden attachment for him was damped by what had passed between her and lady selina but she knew at the same time that she was very unreasonable for quarrelling with one cousin for what another had said she accepted his invitation and shortly after breakfast went upstairs to get ready it was a fine bright april morning though the air was cold and the ground somewhat damp so she put on her boa and strong boots and sallied forth with lord kilcullen not exactly in a good humour but still feeling that she could not justly be out of humour with him at the same moment lady selina knocked at her fathers door with the intention of explaining to him how impossible it was that fanny should be persuaded to marry her brother poor lord cashel his life at that time was certainly not a happy one  the two cousins walked some way nearly in silence fanny felt very little inclined to talk and even kilcullen with all his knowledge of womankindwith all his assurance had some difficulty in commencing what he had to get said and done that morning  so grey abbey will once more sink into its accustomed dullness said he cokely went yesterday and tierney and the ellisons go today dont you dread it fanny  oh im used to it besides im one of the component elements of the dullness you know im a portion of the thing itself its you that must feel it  i feel it i suppose i shall but as i told you before the physic to me was not nearly so nauseous as the sugar im at any rate glad to get rid of such sweetmeats as the bishop and mrs ellison and they were both silent again for a while  but youre not a portion of the heaviness of grey abbey fanny said he referring to what she had said youre not an element of its dullness i dont say this in flatteryi trust nothing so vile as flattery will ever take place between us but you know yourself that your nature is intended for other things that you were not born to pass your life in such a house as this without society without excitement without something to fill your mind fanny you cant be happy here at grey abbey  happy thought fanny to herself no indeed im not happy she didnt say so however and kilcullen after a little while went on speaking  im sure you cant be comfortable here you dont feel it i dare say so intolerable as i do but still you have been out enough enough in the world to feel strongly the everlasting donothingness of this horrid place i wonder what possesses my father that he does not go to londonfor your sake if for no one elses its not just of him to coop you up here  indeed it is adolphus said she you mistake my character im not at all anxious for london parties and gaiety stupid as you may think me im quite as well contented to stay here as i should be to go to london  do you mean me to believe said kilcullen with a gentle laugh that you are contented to live and die in single blessedness at grey abbeythat your ambition does not soar higher than the interchange of worstedwork patterns with miss ojoscelyn  i did not say so adolphus  what is your ambition then what kind and style of life would you choose to live come fanny i wish i could get you to talk with me about yourself i wish i could teach you to believe how anxious i am that your future life should be happy and contented and at the same time splendid and noble as it should be im sure you must have ambition i have studied lavater 47 well enough to know that such a head and face as yours never belonged to a mind that could satisfy itself with worstedwork       footnote 47 lavaterjohann kaspar lavater 17411801                    swiss writer whose only widely read book was a                    tract on physiognomy physiognomische fragmente                    zur beförderung der menschenkenntnis und                    menschenliebe the victorians put much stock in                    physiognomy  you are very severe on the poor worstedwork  but am i not in the right  decidedly not lavater and my head and face have misled you  nonsense fanny do you mean to tell me that you have no aspiration for a kind of life different from this you are leadingif so i am much disappointed in you much very much astray in my judgment of your character then he walked on a few yards looking on the ground and said come fanny i am talking very earnestly to you and you answer me only in joke you dont think me impertinent do you to talk about yourself  impertinent adolphusof course i dont  why wont you talk to me then in the spirit in which i am talking to you if you knew fanny how interested i am about you how anxious that you should be happy how confidently i look forward to the distinguished position i expect you to fillif you could guess how proud i mean to be of you when you are the cynosure of all eyesthe admired of all admirersadmired not more for your beauty than your talentif i could make you believe fanny how much i expect from you and how fully i trust that my expectations will be realised you would not at any rate answer me lightly  adolphus said fanny i thought there was to be no flattering between us  and do you think i would flatter you do you think i would stoop to flatter you oh fanny you dont understand me yet you dont at all understand how thoroughly from the heart im speakinghow much in earnest i am and so far from flattering you i am quite as anxious to find fault with you as i am to praise you could i feel that i had liberty to do so  pray do said fanny anything but flattery for a friend never flatters  but kilcullen had intended to flatter his fair cousin and he had been successful she was gratified and pleased by his warmth of affection pray do repeated fanny i have more faults than virtues to be told of and so im afraid youll find out when you know me better  to begin then said kilcullen are you not wrongbut no fanny i will not torment you now with a catalogue of faults i did not ask you to come out with me for that object you are now in grief for the death of poor harryfanny blushed as she reflected how much more poignant a sorrow weighed upon her heartand are therefore unable to exert yourself but as soon as you are ablewhen you have recovered from this severe blow i trust you will not be content to loiter and dawdle away your existence at grey abbey  not the whole of it said fanny  none of it replied her cousin every month every day should have its purpose my father has got into a dull heartless apathetic mode of life which suits my mother and selina but which will never suit you grey abbey is like the dead sea of which the waters are always bitter as well as stagnant it makes me miserable dearest fanny to see you stifled in such a pool your beauty talents and energiesyour disposition to enjoy life and power of making it enjoyable for others are all thrown away oh fanny if i could rescue you from this  you are inventing imaginary evils said she at any rate they are not palpable to my eyes  thats it thats just what i fear said the other that time habit and endurance may teach you to think that nothing further is to be looked for in this world than vegetation at grey abbey or some other place of the kind to which you may be transplanted i want to wake you from such a torpor to save you from such ignominy i wish to restore you to the world  theres time enough adolphus youll see me yet the gayest of the gay at almacks  ah but to please me fanny it must be as one of the leaders not one of the led  oh thatll be in years to come in twenty years time when i come forth glorious in a jewelled turban and yards upon yards of yellow satinfat fair and forty ive certainly no ambition to be one of the leaders yet  lord kilcullen walked on silent for a considerable time during which fanny went on talking about london almacks and the miserable life of lady patronesses till at last she also became silent and began thinking of lord ballindine she had some little time since fully made up her mind to open her heart to lord kilcullen about him and she had as fully determined not to do so after what selina had said upon the subject but now she again wavered his manner was so kind and affectionate his interest in her future happiness appeared to be so true and unaffected at any rate he would not speak harshly or cruelly to her if she convinced him how completely her happiness depended on her being reconciled to lord ballindine she had all but brought herself to the point she had almost determined to tell him everything when he stopped rather abruptly and said  i also am leaving grey abbey again fanny  leaving grey abbey said fanny you told me the other day you were going to live here  so i intended so i do intend but still i must leave it for a while im going about business and i dont know how long i may be away i go on saturday  i hope adolphus you havent quarrelled with your father said she  oh no said he it is on his advice that i am going i believe there is no fear of our quarrelling now i should rather say i trust there is none he not only approves of my going but approves of what i am about to do before i go  and what is that  i had not intended fanny to say what i have to say to you for some time for i feel that different circumstances make it premature but i cannot bring myself to leave you without doing so and again he paused and walked on a little way in silenceand yet he continued i hardly know how to utter what i wish to say or rather what i would wish to have said were it not that i dread so much the answer you may make me stop fanny stop a moment the seat is quite dry sit down one moment  fanny sat down in a little alcove which they had reached considerably embarrassed and surprised she had not however the most remote idea of what he was about to say to her had any other man in the world almost spoken to her in the same language she would have expected an offer but from the way in which she had always regarded her cousin both heretofore when she hardly knew him and now when she was on such affectionate terms with him she would as soon have thought of receiving an offer from lord cashel as from his son  fanny he said i told you before that i have my fathers warmest and most entire approval for what i am now going to do should i be successful in what i ask he will be delighted but i have no words to tell you what my own feelings will be fanny dearest fanny and he sat down close beside heri love you betterah how much better than all the world holds beside dearest dearest fanny will you can you return my love  adolphus said fanny rising suddenly from her seat more for the sake of turning round so as to look at him than with the object of getting from him adolphus you are joking with me  no by heavens then said he following her and catching her hand no man in ireland is this moment more in earnest no man more anxiously painfully in earnest oh fanny why should you suppose that i am not so how can you think i would joke on such a subject no hear me he said interrupting her as she prepared to answer him hear me out and then you will know how truly i am in earnest  no not a word further almost shrieked fannynot a word more adolphusnot a syllable at any rate till you have heard me oh you have made me so miserable and fanny burst into tears  i have spoken too suddenly to you fanny i should have given you more timei should have waited till  no no no said fanny it is not thatbut yes what you say is true had you waited but one hourbut ten minutesi should have told you that which would for ever have prevented all this i should have told you adolphus how dearly how unutterably i love another and fanny again sat down hid her face in her handkerchief against the corner of the summerhouse and sobbed and cried as though she were brokenhearted during which time kilcullen stood by rather perplexed as to what he was to say next and beginning to be very doubtful as to his ultimate success  dear fanny he said for both our sakes pray try to be collected all my future happiness is at this moment at stake i did not bring you here to listen to what i have told you without having become too painfully sure that your hand your heart your love are necessary to my happiness all my hopes are now at stake but i would not if i could secure my own happiness at the expense of yours pray believe me fanny when i say that i love you completely unalterably devotedly it is necessary now for my own sake that i should say as much as that having told you so much of my own heart let me hear what you wish to tell me of yours oh that i might have the most distant gleam of hope that it would ever return the love which fills my own  it cannot adolphusit never can said she still trying to hide her tears oh why should this bitter misery have been added she then rose quickly from her seat wiped her eyes and pushing back her hair continued i will no longer continue to live such a life as i have donemiserable to myself and the cause of misery to others adolphusi love lord ballindine i love him with i believe as true and devoted a love as woman ever felt for a man i valued appreciated gloried in your friendship but i can never return your love my heart is wholly utterly given away and i would not for worlds receive it back till i learn from his own mouth that he has ceased to love me  oh fanny my poor fanny said kilcullen if such is the case you are really to be pitied if this be true your condition is nearly as unhappy as my own  i am unhappy very unhappy in your love said fanny drawing herself up proudly but not unhappy in my own my misery is that i should be the cause of trouble and unhappiness to others i have nothing to regret in my own choice  you are harsh fanny it may be well that you should be decided but it cannot become you also to be unfeeling i have offered to you all that a man can offer my name my fortune my life my heart though you may refuse me you have no right to be offended with me  oh adolphus said she now in her turn offering him her hand pray forgive me pray do not be angry heaven knows i feel no offence and how strongly how sincerely i feel the compliment you have offered me but i want you to see how vain it would be in me to leave youleave you in any doubt i only spoke as i did to show you i could not think twice when my heart was given to one whom i so entirely love respectandand approve  lord kilcullens face became thoughtful and his brow grew black he stood for some time irresolute what to say or do  let us walk on fanny for this is cold and damp he said at last  let us go back to the house then  as you like fanny oh how painful all this is how doubly painful to know that ray own love is hopeless and that yours is no less so did you not refuse lord ballindine  if i did is it not sufficient that i tell you i love him if he were gone past all redemption you would not have me encourage you while i love another  i never dreamed of this what fanny what are your hopes what is it you wish or intend supposing me as i wish i were fathoms deep below the earth what would you do you cannot marry lord ballindine  then i will marry no one said fanny striving hard to suppress her tears and barely succeeding  good heavens exclaimed kilcullen what an infatuation is thisand then again he walked on silent a little way have you told any one of this fannydo they know of it at grey abbey come fanny speak to me forget if you will that i would be your lover remember me only as your cousin and your friend and speak to me openly do they know that you have repented of the refusal you gave lord ballindine  they all know that i love him your father your mother and selina  you dont say my father  yes said fanny stopping on the path and speaking with energy as she confronted her cousin yes lord cashel he above all others knows it i have told him so almost on my knees i have implored him as a child may implore her father to bring back to me the only man i ever loved i have besought him not to sacrifice me oh how i have implored him to spare me the dreadful punishment of my own follywretchedness ratherin rejecting the man i loved but he has not listened to me he will never listen to me and i will never ask again he shall find that i am not a tree or a stone to be planted or placed as he chooses i will not again be subjected to what i have today suffered i will noti will not but fanny was out of breath and could not complete the catalogue of what she would not do  and did you intend to tell me all this had i not spoken to you as i have done said kilcullen  i did said she i was on the point of telling you everything twice i had intended to do so i intended to implore you as you loved me as your cousin to use your exertions to reconcile my uncle and lord ballindineand now instead of that  you find i love you too well myself  oh forget adolphus forget that the words ever passed your lips you have not loved me long and therefore will not continue to love me when you know i never can be yours forget your shortlived love wont you adolphusand she put her clasped hands upon his breastforgetlet us both forget that the words were ever spoken be still my cousin my friend my brother and we shall still both be happy  different feelings were disturbing lord kilcullens breastdifferent from each other and some of them very different from those which usually found a place there he had sought fannys hand not only with most sordid but also with most dishonest views he not only intended to marry her for her fortune but also to rob her of her money to defraud her that he might enable himself once more to enter the world of pleasure with the slight encumbrance of a wretched wife but in carrying out his plan he had disturbed it by his own weakness he had absolutely allowed himself to fall in love with his cousin and when as he had just done he offered her his hand he was quite as anxious that she should accept him for her own sake as for that of her money he had taught himself to believe that she would accept him and many misgivings had haunted him as to the ruined state to which he should bring her as his wife but these feelings though strong enough to disturb him were not strong enough to make him pause he tried to persuade himself that he could yet make her happy and hurried on to the consummation of his hopes he now felt strongly tempted to act a generous part to give her up and to bring lord ballindine back to her feet to deserve at any rate well of her and leave all other things to chance but lord kilcullen was not accustomed to make such sacrifices he had never learned to disregard himself and again and again he turned it over in his mindhow could he get her fortunewas there any way left in which he might be successful  this is childs play fanny he said you may reject me to that i have nothing further to say for i am but an indifferent wooer but you can never marry lord ballindine  oh adolphus for mercys sake dont say so  but i do say so fanny god knows not to wound you or for any unworthy purpose but because it is so he was your lover and you sent him away you cannot whistle him back as you would a dog  fanny made no answer to this but walked on towards the house anxious to find herself alone in her own room that she might compose her mind and think over all that she had heard and said nor did lord kilcullen renew the conversation till he got to the house he could not determine what to do under other circumstances it might he felt have been wise for him to wait till time had weakened fannys regret for her lost lover but in his case this was impracticable if he waited anywhere it would be in the queens bench and yet he could not but feel that at present it was hopeless for him to push his suit  they reached the steps together and as he opened the front door fanny turned round to wish him good morning as she was hurrying in but he stopped her and said  one word more fanny before we part you must not refuse me nor must we part in this way step in here i will not keep you a minute and he took her into a room off the halldo not let us be children fanny do not let us deceive each other or ourselves do not let us persist in being irrational if we ourselves see that we are so and he paused for a reply  well adolphus was all she said  if i could avoid it continued he i would not hurt your feelings but you must see you must know that you cannot marry lord ballindinefanny who was now sitting bit her lips and clenched her hands but she said nothing if this is soif you feel that so far your fate is fixed are you mad enough to give yourself up to a vain and wicked passionfor wicked it will be will you not rather strive to forget him who has forgotten you  that is not true interposed fanny  his conduct unfortunately proves that it is too true continued kilcullen he has forgotten you and you cannot blame him that he should do so now that you have rejected him but he neglected you even before you did so is it wise is it decorous is it maidenly in you to indulge any longer in so vain a passion think of this fanny as to myself heaven knows with what perfect truth with what true love i offered you this morning all that a man can offer how ardently i hoped for an answer different from that you have now given me you cannot give me your heart now love cannot at a moment be transferred but think fanny think whether it is not better for you to accept an offer which your friends will all approve and which i trust will never make you unhappy than to give yourself up to a lasting regretto tears misery and grief  and would you take my hand without my heart said she  not for worlds replied the other were i not certain that your heart would follow your hand whoever may be your husband you will love him but ask my mother talk to her ask her advice she at any rate will only tell you that which must be best for your own happiness go to her fanny if her advice be different from mine i will not say a word farther to urge my suit  i will go to no one said fanny rising i have gone to too many with a piteous story on my lips i have no friend now in this house i had still hoped to find one in you but that hope is over i am of course proud of the honour your declaration has conveyed but i should be wicked indeed if i did not make you perfectly understand that it is one which i cannot accept whatever may be your views your ideas i will never marry unless i thoroughly love and feel that i am thoroughly loved by my future husband had you not made this illtimed declarationhad you not even persisted in repeating it after i had opened my whole heart to you i could have loved and cherished you as a brother under no circumstances could i ever have accepted you as a husband good morning and she left him alone feeling that he could have but little chance of success should he again renew the attempt  he did not see her again till dinnertime when she appeared silent and reserved but still collected and at her ease nor did he speak to her at dinner or during the evening till the moment the ladies were retiring for the night he then came up to her as she was standing alone turning over some things on a sidetable and said fanny i probably leave grey abbey tomorrow i will say good bye to you tonight  good bye adolphus may we both be happier when next we meet said she  my happiness i fear is doubtful but i will not speak of that now if i can do anything for yours before i go i will fanny i will ask my father to invite lord ballindine here he has been anxious that we should be married when i tell him that that is impossible he may perhaps be induced to do so  do that said fanny and you will be a friend to me do that and you will be more than a brother to me  i will and in doing so i shall crush every hope that i have had left in me  do not say so adolphusdo not  youll understand what i mean in a short time i cannot explain everything to you now but this will i do i will make lord cashel understand that we never can be more to each other than we are now and i will advise him to seek a reconciliation with lord ballindine and now good bye and he held out his hand  but i shall see you tomorrow  probably not and if you do it will be but for a moment when i shall have other adieux to make  good bye then adolphus and may god bless you and may we yet live to have many happy days together and she shook hands with him and went to her room     xxxiii  lord kilcullen makes another visit to the bookroom   lord cashels plans were certainly not lucky it was not that sufficient care was not used in laying them nor sufficient caution displayed in maturing them he passed his time in care and caution he spared no pains in seeing that the whole machinery was right he was indefatigable in deliberation diligent in manoeuvring constant in attention but somehow he was unlucky his schemes were never successful in the present instance he was peculiarly unfortunate for everything went wrong with him he had got rid of an obnoxious lover he had coaxed over his son he had spent an immensity of money he had undergone worlds of trouble and selfrestraintand then when he really began to think that his wards fortune would compensate him for this his own family came to him one after another to assure him that he was completely mistakenthat it was utterly impossible that such a thing as a family marriage between the two cousins could never take place and indeed ought not to be thought of  lady selina gave him the first check on the morning on which lord kilcullen made his offer she paid her father a solemn visit in his bookroom and told him exactly what she had before told her mother assured him that fanny could not be induced at any rate at present to receive her cousin as her lover whispered to him with unfeigned sorrow and shame that fanny was still madly in love with lord ballindine and begged him to induce her brother to postpone his offer at any rate for some months  i hate lord ballindines very name said the earl petulant with irritation  we none of us approve of him papa we dont think of supposing that he could now be a fitting husband for fanny or that they could possibly ever be married of course its not to be thought of but if you would advise adolphus not to be premature he might in the end be more successful  kilcullen has made his own bed and he must lie in it i wont interfere between them said the angry father  but if you were only to recommend delay suggested the daughter a few months delay think how short a time harry wyndham has been dead  lord cashel knew that delay was death in this case so he pished and hummed and hawed quite lost the dignity on which he piqued himself and ended by declaring that he would not interfere that they might do as they liked that young people would not be guided and that he would not make himself unhappy about them and so lady selina crestfallen and disappointed went away  then lady cashel reflecting on what her daughter had told her and yet anxious that the marriage should if possible take place at some time or other sent griffiths down to her lord with a messagewould his lordship be kind enough to step upstairs to her ladyship lord cashel went up and again had all the difficulties of the case opened out before him  but you see said her ladyship poor fannyshes become so unreasonablei dont know whats come to herim sure i do everything i can to make her happy but i suppose if she dont like to marry nobody can make her  make herwhos talking of making her said the earl  no of course not continued the countess thats just what selina says no one can make her do anything shes got so obstinate of late but its all that horrid lord ballindine and those odious horses im sure i dont know what business gentlemen have to have horses at all theres never any good comes of it theres adolphushes had the good sense to get rid of his and yet fannys so foolish shed sooner have that other horrid manand im sure hes not half so goodlooking nor a quarter so agreeable as adolphus  all these encomiums on his son and animadversions on lord ballindine were not calculated to put the earl into a good humour he was heartily sick of the subject thoroughly repented that he had not allowed his son to ruin himself in his own way detested the very name of lord ballindine and felt no very strong affection for his poor innocent ward he accordingly made his wife nearly the same answer he had made his daughter and left her anything but comforted by the visit  it was about eleven oclock on the same evening that lord kilcullen after parting with fanny opened the bookroom door he had been quite sincere in what he had told her he had made up his mind entirely to give over all hopes of marrying her himself and to tell his father that the field was again open for lord ballindine as far as he was concerned  there is no doubt that he would not have been noble enough to do this had he thought he had himself any chance of being successful but still there was something chivalrous in his resolve something magnanimous in his determination to do all he could for the happiness of her he really loved when everything in his own prospects was gloomy dark and desperate as he entered his fathers room feeling that it would probably be very long before he should be closeted with him again he determined that he would not quietly bear reproaches and even felt a source of satisfaction in the prospect of telling his father that their joint plans were overturnedtheir schemes completely at an end  im disturbing you my lord im afraid said the son walking into the room not at all with the manner of one who had any hesitation at causing the disturbance  whos that said the earladolphusnoyes that is im just going to bed what is it you want the earl had been dozing after all the vexations of the day  to tell the truth my lord ive a good deal that i wish to say will it trouble you to listen to me  wont tomorrow morning do  i shall leave grey abbey early tomorrow my lord immediately after breakfast  good heavens kilcullen what do you mean youre not going to run off to london again  a little farther than that im afraid will be necessary said the son i have offered to miss wyndhamhave been refusedand having finished my business at grey abbey your lordship will probably think that in leaving it i shall be acting with discretion  you have offered to fanny and been refused  indeed i have finally and peremptorily refused not only that i have pledged my word to my cousin that i will never renew my suit  the earl sat speechless in his chairso much worse was this catastrophe even than his expectations lord kilcullen continued  i hope at any rate you are satisfied with me i have not only implicitly obeyed your directions but i have done everything in my power to accomplish what you wished had my marriage with my cousin been a project of my own i could not have done more for its accomplishment miss wyndhams affections are engaged and she will never i am sure marry one man while she loves another  loves anotherpsha roared the earl is this to be the end of it all after your promises to meafter your engagement after such an engagement sir you come to me and talk about a girl loving another loving another will her loving another pay your debts  exactly the reverse my lord said the son i fear it will materially postpone their payment  well sir said the earl he did not exactly know how to commence the thunder of indignation with which he intended to annihilate his son for certainly kilcullen had done the best in his power to complete the bargain but still the storm could not be stayed unreasonable as it might be for the earl to be tempestuous on the occasion well sir and he stood up from his chair to face his victim who was still standingand thrusting his hands into his trowsers pockets frowned awfullywell sir am i to be any further favoured with your plans  i have none my lord said kilcullen i am again ready to listen to yours  my plansi have no further plans to offer for you you are ruined utterly ruined you have done your best to ruin me and your mother i have pointed out to you i arranged for you the only way in which your affairs could be redeemed i made every thing easy for you  no my lord you could not make it easy for me to get my cousins love  dont contradict me sir i say i did i made every thing straight and easy for you and now you come to me with a whining story about a girls love whats her love to me sir where am i to get my thirty thousand pounds sirand my note of hand is passed for as much more at this time twelvemonth where am i to raise that sir do you remember that you have engaged to repay me these sumsdo you remember that or have such trifles escaped your recollection  i remember perfectly well my lord that if i married my cousin you were to repay yourself those sums out of her fortune but i also remember and so must you that i beforehand warned you that i thought she would refuse me  refuse you said the earl with a contortion of his nose and lips intended to convey unutterable scorn of course she refused you when you asked her as a child would ask for an apple or a cake what else could you expect  i hardly think your lordship knows  dont you hardly thinkthen i do know and know well too i know you have deceived me grossly deceived meinduced me to give you moneyto incur debts with which i never would have burdened myself had i not believed you were sincere in your promise but you have deceived me sirtaken me in for by heaven its no betterits no better than downright swindlingand that from a son to his father but its for the last time not a penny more do you get from me you can ruin the property indeed i believe you have but for your mothers and sisters sake ill keep till i die what little you have left me  lord cashel had worked himself up into a perfect frenzy and was stamping about the room as he uttered this speech but as he came to the end of it he threw himself into his chair again and buried his face in his hands  lord kilcullen was standing with his back resting against the mantelpiece with a look of feigned indifference on his face which he tried hard to maintain but his brow became clouded and he bit his lips when his father accused him of swindling and he was just about to break forth into a torrent of recrimination when lord cashel turned off into a pathetic strain and kilcullen thought it better to leave him there  what im to do i dont know what i am to do i do not know said the earl beating the table with one hand and hiding his face with the other sixty thousand pounds in one year and that after so many drainsand theres only my own lifetheres only my own lifeand then there was a pause for four or five minutes during which lord kilcullen took snuff poked the fire and then picked up a newspaper as though he were going to read it this last was too much for the father and he again roared out well sir what are you standing there for if youve nothing else to say why dont you go ive done with youyou can not get more out of me i promise you  ive a good deal to say before i go my lord said kilcullen i was waiting till you were disposed to listen to me ive a good deal to say indeed which you must hear and i trust therefore you will endeavour to be cool whatever your opinions may be about my conduct  coolno sir i will not be cool youre too cool yourself  cool enough for both you think my lord  kilcullen said the earl youve neither heart nor principle you have done your worst to ruin me and now you come to insult me in my own room say what you want to say and then leave me  as to insulting language my lord i think you need not complain when you remember that you have just called me a swindler because i have been unable to accomplish your wish and my own by marrying my cousin however i will let that pass i have done the best i could to gain that object i did more than either of us thought it possible that i should do when i consented to attempt it i offered her my hand and assured her of my affection without falsehood or hypocrisy my bargain was that i should offer to her i have done more than that for i have loved her i have however been refused and in such a manner as to convince me that it would be useless for me to renew my suit if your lordship will allow me to advise you on such a subject i would suggest that you make no further objection to fannys union with lord ballindine for marry him she certainly will  what sir again shouted lord cashel  i trust fanny will receive no further annoyance on the subject she has convinced me that her own mind is thoroughly made up and she is not the person to change her mind on such a subject  and havent you enough on hand in your own troubles but what you must lecture me about my wardis it for that you have come to torment me at this hour had not you better at once become her guardian yourself sir and manage the matter in your own way  i promised fanny i would say as much to you i will not again mention her name unless you press me to do so  thats very kind said the earl  and now about myself i think your lordship will agree with me that it is better that i should at once leave grey abbey when i tell you that if i remain here i shall certainly be arrested before the week is over if i am found outside the house i do not wish to have bailiffs knocking at your lordships door and your servants instructed to deny me  upon my soul you are too good  at any rate said kilcullen youll agree with me that this is no place for me to remain in  youre quite at liberty to go said the earl you were never very ceremonious with regard to me pray dont begin to be so now pray gotonight if you like your mothers heart will be broken thats all  i trust my mother will be able to copy your lordships indifference  indifference is sixty thousand pounds in one year and more than double within three or four indifference i have paid too much to be indifferent but it is hopeless to pay more i have no hope for you you are ruined and i couldnt redeem you even if i would i could not set you free and tell you to begin again even were it wise to do so and therefore i tell you to go and now good night i have not another word to say to you and the earl got up as if to leave the room  stop my lord you must listen to me said kilcullen  not a word further i have heard enough and he put out the candles on the bookroom table having lighted a bed candle which he held in his hand  pardon me my lord continued the son standing just before his father so as to prevent his leaving the room pardon me but you must listen to what i have to say  not another wordnot another word leave the door sir or i will ring for the servants to open it  do so said kilcullen and they also shall hear what i have to say i am going to leave you tomorrow perhaps for ever and you will not listen to the last word i wish to speak to you  ill stay five minutes said the earl taking out his watch and then ill go and if you attempt again to stop me ill ring the bell for the servants  thank you my lord for the five minutes it will be time enough i purpose leaving grey abbey tomorrow and i shall probably be in france in three days time when there i trust i shall cease to trouble you but i cannot indeed i will not go without funds to last me till i can make some arrangement your lordship must give me five hundred pounds i have not the means even of carrying myself from hence to calais  not one penny not one pennyif it were to save you from the gaol tomorrow this is too bad and the earl again walked to the door against which lord kilcullen leaned his back by heaven sir ill raise the house if you think to frighten me by violence  ill use no violence but you must hear the alternative if you please it the whole house shall hear it too if you persist in refusing the small sum i now ask  i will not give you one penny to save you from gaol is that plain  perfectly plain and very easy to believe but you will give more than a penny you would even give more than i ask to save yourself from the annoyance you will have to undergo  not on any account will i give you one single farthing  very well then i have only to tell you what i must do of course i shall remain here you cannot turn me out of your house or refuse me a seat at your table  by heavens though i both can and will  you cannot my lord if you think of it youll find you cannot without much disagreeable trouble an eldest son would be a very difficult tenant to eject summarily and of my own accord i will not go without the money i ask  by heavens this exceeds all i ever heard would you rob your own father  i will not rob him but ill remain in his house the sheriffs officers doubtless will hang about the doors and be rather troublesome before the windows but i shall not be the first irish gentleman that has remained at home upon his keeping and like other irish gentlemen i will do so rather than fall into the hands of these myrmidons i have no wish to annoy you i shall be most sorry to do so most sorry to subject my mother to the misery which must attend the continual attempts which will be made to arrest me but i will not put my head into the lions jaw  this is the return for what i have done for him ejaculated the earl in his misery unfortunate reprobate unfortunate reprobatethat i should be driven to wish that he was in gaol  your wishing so wont put me there my lord if it would i should not be weak enough to ask you for this money do you mean to comply with my request  i do not sir not a penny shall you havenot one farthing more shall you get from me  then good night my lord i grieve that i should have to undergo a siege in your lordships house more especially as it is likely to be a long one in a weeks time there will be a ne exeat 48 issued against me and then it will be too late for me to think of france and so saying the son retired to his own room and left the father to consider what he had better do in his distress       footnote 48 ne exeatlatin let him not leave a legal                    writ forbidding a person to leave the jurisdiction                    of the court  lord cashel was dreadfully embarrassed what lord kilcullen said was perfectly true an eldest son was a most difficult tenant to eject and then the ignominy of having his heir arrested in his own house or detained there by bailiffs lurking round the premises he could not determine whether it would be more painful to keep his son or to give him up if he did the latter he would be driven to effect it by a most disagreeable process he would have to assist the officers of the law in their duty and to authorise them to force the doors locked by his son the prospect either way was horrid he would willingly give the five hundred pounds to be rid of his heir were it not for his words sake or rather his prides sake he had said he would not and as he walked up and down the room he buttoned up his breeches pocket and tried to resolve that come what come might he would not expedite his sons departure by the outlay of one shilling  the candles had been put out and the gloom of the room was only lightened by a single bedroom taper which as it stood near the door only served to render palpable the darkness of the further end of the chamber for half an hour lord cashel walked to and fro anxious wretched and in doubt instead of going to his room how he wished that lord ballindine had married his ward and taken her off six months sinceall this trouble would not then have come upon him and as he thought of the thirty thousand pounds that he had spent and the thirty thousand more that he must spend he hurried on with such rapidity that in the darkness he struck his shin violently against some heavy piece of furniture and limping back to the candlestick swore through his teethno not a penny were it to save him from perdition ill see the sheriffs officer ill see the sheriff himself and tell him that every door in the houseevery closetevery cellar shall be open to him my house shall enable no one to defy the law and with this noble resolve to which by the bye the blow on his shin greatly contributed lord cashel went to bed and the house was at rest  about nine oclock on the following morning lord kilcullen was still in bed but awake his servant had been ordered to bring him hot water and he was seriously thinking of getting up and facing the troubles of the day when a very timid knock at the door announced to him that some stranger was approaching he adjusted his nightcap brought the bedclothes up close to his neck and on giving the usual answer to a knock at the door saw a large cap introduce itself the head belonging to which seemed afraid to follow  whos that he called out  its me my lord said the head gradually following the cap griffiths my lord  well  lady selina my lord her ladyship bids me give your lordship her love and would you see her ladyship for five minutes before you get up  lord kilcullen having assented to this proposal the cap and head retired a second knock at the door was soon given and lady selina entered the room with a little bit of paper in her hand  good morning adolphus said the sister  good morning selina said the brother it must be something very particular which brings you here at this hour  it is indeed something very particular i have been with papa this morning adolphus he has told me of the interview between you last night  well  oh adolphus he is very angryhes  so am i selina i am very angry tooso were quits we laid a plan together and we both failed and each blames the other so you need not tell me anything further about his anger did he send any message to me  he did he told me i might give you this if i would undertake that you left grey abbey today and lady selina held up but did not give him the bit of paper  what a dolt he is  oh adolphus said selina dont speak so of your father  so he is how on earth can you undertake that i shall leave the house  i can ask you to give me your word that you will do so and i can take back the check if you refuse said lady selina conceiving it utterly impossible that one of her own family could break his word  well selina ill answer you fairly if that bit of paper is a cheque for five hundred pounds i will leave this place in two hours if it is not  it is said selina it is a cheque for five hundred pounds and i may then give it to you  i thought as much said lord kilcullen i thought hed alter his mind yes you may give it me and tell my father ill dine in london tomorrow evening  he says adolphus hell not see you before you go  well theres comfort in that anyhow  oh adolphus how can you speak in that manner nowhow can you speak in that wicked thoughtless reckless manner said his sister  because im a wicked thoughtless reckless man i suppose i didnt mean to vex you selina but my father is so pompous so absurd and so tedious in the whole of this affair i have endeavoured to do exactly as he would have me and he is more angry with me now because his plan has failed than he ever was before for any of my past misdoingsbut let me get up now theres a good girl for ive no time to lose  will you see your mother before you go adolphus  why no itll be no useonly tormenting her tell her something you know anything that wont vex her  but i cannot tell her anything about you that will not vex her  well then say what will vex her least tell hertell her oh you know what to tell her and im sure i dont  and fanny will you see her again  no said kilcullen i have bid her good bye but give her my kindest love and tell her that i did what i told her i would do  she told me what took place between you yesterday  why selina everybody tells you everything and now ill tell you something if you care for your cousins happiness do not attempt to raise difficulties between her and lord ballindine and now i must say good bye to you ill have my breakfast up here and go directly down to the yard good bye selina when im settled ill write to you and tell you where i am  good bye adolphus god bless you and enable you yet to retrieve your course im afraid it is a bad one and she stooped down and kissed her brother  he was as good as his word in two hours time he had left grey abbey he dined that day in dublin the next in london and the third in boulogne and the subsheriff of county kildare in vain issued halfadozen writs for his capture     xxxiv  the doctor makes a clean breast of it   we will now return for a while to dunmore and settle the affairs of the kellys and lynches which we left in rather a precarious state  barrys attempt on doctor colligans virtue was very unsuccessful for anty continued to mend under the treatment of that uncouth but safe son of galen as colligan told her brother the fever had left her though for some time it was doubtful whether she had strength to recover from its effects this however she did gradually and about a fortnight after the dinner at dunmore house the doctor told mrs kelly and martin that his patient was out of danger  martin had for some time made up his mind that anty was to live for many years in the character of mrs martin and could not therefore be said to be much affected by the communication but if he was not his mother was she had made up her mind that anty was to die that she was to pay for the doctorthe wake and the funeral and that she would have a hardship and grievance to boast of and a subject of selfcommendation to enlarge on which would have lasted her till her death and she consequently felt something like disappointment at being ordered to administer to anty a mutton chop and a glass of sherry every day at one oclock not that the widow was less assiduous or less attentive to antys wants now that she was convalescent but she certainly had not so much personal satisfaction as when she was able to speak despondingly of her patient to all her gossips  poor cratur she used to sayits all up with her now the lord be praised for all his mercies shes all as one as gone glory be to god and the blessed virgin shure no good ever come of illgot moneynot that she was iver to blame thank the lord av i have a penny saved at all it was honestly come by not

lynch scraped together out of the gutthers       footnote 49 stivera dutch coin worth almost nothing  there was a degree of triumph in these lamentations a tone of selfsatisfied assurance in the truth of her melancholy predictions which showed that the widow was not ill at ease with herself when anty was declared out of danger her joy was expressed with much more moderation  yes thin she said to father pat geoghegan poor thing shes rallying a bit the docthor says maybe shell not go this time but hes much in dread of a reclaps  relapse mrs kelly i suppose  well relapse av you will father patrelapse or reclaps its pretty much the same im thinking for shed niver get through another bout god send we may be well out of the hobble this day twelvemonth martins my own son and aint above industhrying as his father and mother did afore him and i wont say a word agin him but hes brought more throuble on me with them lynches than iver i knew before what has a lone woman like me father pat to do wid sthrangers like them jist to turn their backs on me when i aint no furder use and to be gitting the hights of insolence and abuse as i did from that blagguard barry hed betther keep his toe in his pump and go asy or hell wake to a sore morning yet some day  doctor colligan also was in trouble from his connection with the lynches not that he had any dissatisfaction at the recovery of his patient for he rejoiced at it both on her account and his own he had strongly that feeling of selfapplause which must always be enjoyed by a doctor who brings a patient safely through a dangerous illness but barrys iniquitous proposal to him weighed heavy on his conscience it was now a week since it had been made and he had spoken of it to no one he had thought much and frequently of what he ought to do whether he should publicly charge lynch with the fact whether he should tell it confidentially to some friend whom he could trust or whetherby far the easiest alternative he should keep it in his own bosom and avoid the man in future as he would an incarnation of the devil it preyed much upon his spirits for he lived in fear of barry lynchin fear lest he should determine to have the first word and in his own defence accuse him colligan of the very iniquity which he had himself committed nothing the doctor felt would be too bad or too false for barry lynch nothing could be more damnable than the proposal he had made and yet it would be impossible to convict him impossible to punish him he would of course deny the truth of the accusation and probably return the charge on his accuser and yet colligan felt that he would be compromising the matter if he did not mention it to some one and that he would outrage his own feelings if he did not express his horror at the murder which he had been asked to commit  for one week these feelings quite destroyed poor colligans peace of mind during the second he determined to make a clean breast of it and on the first day of the third week after turning in his mind twenty different peoplemartin kellyyoung dalythe widowthe parish priestthe parish parsonthe nearest stipendiary magistrateand a brother doctor in tuam he at last determined on going to lord ballindine as being both a magistrate and a friend of the kellys doctor colligan himself was not at all acquainted with lord ballindine he attended none of the family who extensively patronised his rival and he had never been inside kellys court house he felt therefore considerable embarrassment at his mission but he made up his mind to go and manfully setting himself in his antique rickety gig started early enough to catch lord ballindine as he thought before he left the house after breakfast  lord ballindine had spent the last week or ten days restlessly enough armstrong his clerical ambassador had not yet started on his mission to grey abbey and innumerable difficulties seemed to arise to prevent his doing so first of all the black cloth was to be purchased and a tailor sufficiently adept for making up the new suit was to be caught this was a work of some time for though there is in the west of ireland a very general complaint of the stagnation of trade trade itself is never so stagnant as are the tradesmen when work is to be done and it is useless for a poor wight to think of getting his coat or his boots till such time as absolute want shall have driven the artisan to look for the price of his jobunless some private and underhand influence be used as was done in the case of jerry blakes new leather breeches  this cause of delay was however not mentioned to lord ballindine but when it was well got over and a neighbouring parson procured to preach on the next sunday to mrs okelly and the three policemen who attended ballindine church mrs armstrong broke her thumb with the rollingpin while making a beef pudding for the family dinner and her husbands departure was again retarded and then on the next sunday the neighbouring parson could not leave his own policemen and the two spinsters who usually formed his audience  all this tormented lord ballindine and he was really thinking of giving up the idea of sending mr armstrong altogether when he received the following letter from his friend dot blake      limmers hotel april 1847     dear frank     one cries out what are you at the other what are you after    every one is saying what a fool you are kilcullen is at grey abbey    with the evident intention of superseding you in possession of miss    w and what is much more to his taste as it would be to mine    of her fortune mr t has written to me from grey abbey where he    has been staying he is a goodhearted fellow and remembers how    warmly you contradicted the report that your match was broken off    for heavens sake follow up your warmth of denial with some show of    positive action a little less cool than your present quiescence or    you cannot expect that any amount of love should be strong enough    to prevent your affianced from resenting your conduct i am doubly    anxious quite as anxious that kilcullen whom i detest should not    get young wyndhams money as i am that you should he is utterly    utterly smashed if he got double the amount of fanny wyndhams    cash it could not keep him above water for more than a year or so    and then she must go down with him i am sure the old fool his    father does not half know the amount of his sons liabilities or    he could not be heartless enough to consent to sacrifice the poor    girl as she will be sacrificed if kilcullen gets her i am not    usually very anxious about other peoples concerns but i do feel    anxious about this matter i want to have a respectable house in the    country in which i can show my face when i grow a little older and    be allowed to sip my glass of claret and talk about my horses in    spite of my iniquitous propensitiesand i expect to be allowed to    do so at kellys court but if you let miss wyndham slip through    your fingers you wont have a house over your head in a few years    time much less a shelter to offer a friend for gods sake start    for grey abbey at once why man alive the ogre cant eat you     the whole town is in the devil of a ferment about brien of course    you heard the rumour last week of his heels being cracked some    of the knowing boys want to get out of the trap they are in and    despairing of bringing the horse down in the betting by fair means    got a boy out of scotts stables to swear to the fact i went down    at once to yorkshire and published a letter in bells life last    saturday stating that he is all right this you have probably seen    you will be astonished to hear it but i believe lord tattenham    corner got the report spread for heavens sake dont mention this    particularly not as coming from me they say that if brien does the    trick he will lose more than he has made these three years and i    believe he will he is nominally at 4 to 1 but you cant get 4 to    anything like a figure from a safe party     for heavens sake go to grey abbey and at once     always faithfully     w blake   this letter naturally increased lord ballindines uneasiness and he wrote a note to mr armstrong informing him that he would not trouble him to go at all unless he could start the next day indeed that he should then go himself if mr armstrong did not do so  this did not suit mr armstrong he had made up his mind to go he could not well return the twenty pounds he had received nor did he wish to forego the advantage which might arise from the trip so he told his wife to be very careful about her thumb made up his mind to leave the three policemen for once without spiritual food and wrote to lord ballindine to say that he would be with him the next morning immediately after breakfast on his road to catch the mailcoach at ballyglass  he was as good as his word or rather better for he breakfasted at kellys court and induced lord ballindine to get into his own gig and drive him as far as the mailcoach road  but youll be four or five hours too soon said frank the coach doesnt pass ballyglass till three  i want to see those cattle of rutledges ill stay there and maybe get a bit of luncheon its not a bad thing to be provided for the road  ill tell you what though said frank i want to go to tuam so you might as well get the coach there and if theres time to spare you can pay your respects to the bishop  it was all the same to mr armstrong and the two therefore started for tuam together they had not however got above half way down the avenue when they saw another gig coming towards them and after sundry speculations as to whom it might contain mr armstrong pronounced the driver to be that dirty gallipot colligan  it was colligan and as the two gigs met in the narrow road the dirty gallipot took off his hat and was very sorry to trouble lord ballindine but had a few words to say to him on very important and pressing business  lord ballindine touched his hat and intimated that he was ready to listen but gave no signs of getting out of his gig  my lord said colligan its particularly important and if you could as a magistrate spare me five minutes  oh certainly mr colligan said frank that is im rather hurriedi may say very much hurried just at present but stilli suppose theres no objection to mr armstrong hearing what you have to say  why my lord said colligan i dont know your lordship can judge yourself afterwards but id rather  oh ill get down said the parson ill just take a walk among the trees i suppose the doctor wont be long  if you wouldnt mind getting into my buggy and letting me into his lordships gig you could be following us on mr armstrong suggested colligan  this suggestion was complied with the parson and the doctor changed places and the latter awkwardly enough but with perfect truth whispered his tale into lord ballindines ear  at first frank had been annoyed at the interruption but as he learned the cause of it he gave his full attention to the matter and only interrupted the narrator by exclamations of horror and disgust  when doctor colligan had finished lord ballindine insisted on repeating the whole affair to mr armstrong i could not take upon myself said he to advise you what to do much less to tell you what you should do there is only one thing clear you cannot let things rest as they are armstrong is a man of the world and will know what to do you cannot object to talking the matter over with him  colligan consented and armstrong having been summoned drove the doctors buggy up alongside of lord ballindines gig  armstrong said frank i have just heard the most horrid story that ever came to my ears that wretch barry lynch has tried to induce doctor colligan to poison his sister  what shouted armstrong to poison his sister  gently mr armstrong pray dont speak so loud or itll be all through the country in no time  poison his sister repeated armstrong oh itll hang him theres no doubt itll hang him of course youll take the doctors information  but the doctor hasnt tendered me any information said frank stopping his horse so that armstrong was able to get close up to his elbow  but i presume it is his intention to do so said the parson  i should choose to have another magistrate present then said frank really doctor colligan i think the best thing you can do is to come before myself and the stipendiary magistrate at tuam we shall be sure to find brew at home today  but my lord said colligan i really had no intention of doing that i have no witnesses i can prove nothing indeed i cant say he ever asked me to do the deed he didnt say anything i could charge him with as a crime he only offered me the farm if his sister should die but i knew what he meant there was no mistaking it i saw it in his eye  and what did you do doctor colligan at the time said the parson  i hardly remember said the doctor i was so flurried but i know i knocked him down and then i rushed out of the room i believe i threatened id have him hung  but you did knock him down  oh i did he was sprawling on the ground when i left him  youre quite sure you knocked him down repeated the parson  the divil a doubt on earth about that replied colligan i tell you when i left the room he was on his back among the chairs  and you did not hear a word from him since  not a word  then there cant be any mistake about it my lord said armstrong if he did not feel that his life was in the doctors hands he would not put up with being knocked down and ill tell you whats moreif you tax him with the murder hell deny it and defy you but tax him with having been knocked down and hell swear his foot slipped or that hed have done as much for the doctor if he hadnt run away and then ask him why the doctor knocked him downyoull have him on the hip so  theres something in that said frank but the question is what is doctor colligan to do he says he cant swear any information on which a magistrate could commit him  unless he does my lord said armstrong i dont think you should listen to him at all at least not as a magistrate  well doctor colligan what do you say  i dont know what to say my lord i came to your lordship for advice both as a magistrate and as a friend of the young man who is to marry lynchs sister of course if you cannot advise me i will go away again  you wont come before me and mr brew then  i dont say i wont said colligan but i dont see the use im not able to prove anything  ill tell you what ballindine said the parson only i dont know whether it maynt be tampering with justicesuppose we were to go to this hellhound you and i together and telling him what we know give him his option to stand his trial or quit the country take my word for it hed go and that would be the best way to be rid of him hed leave his sister in peace and quiet then to enjoy her fortune  thats true said frank and it would be a great thing to rid the country of him do you remember the way he rode atop of that poor bitch of mine the other daygoneaway you know the best bitch in the pack  indeed i do said the parson but for all that she wasnt the best bitch in the pack she hadnt half the nose of gaylass  but as i was saying armstrong it would be a great thing to rid the country of barry lynch  indeed it would  and thered be nothing then to prevent young kelly marrying anty at once  make him give his consent in writing before you let him go said armstrong  ill tell you what doctor colligan said frank do you get into your own gig and follow us on and ill talk the matter over with mr armstrong  the doctor again returned to his buggy and the parson to his own seat and lord ballindine drove off at a pace which made it difficult enough for doctor colligan to keep him in sight  i dont know how far we can trust that apothecary said frank to his friend  hes an honest man i believe said armstrong though hes a dirty drunken blackguard  maybe he was drunk this evening at lynchs  i was wrong to call him a drunkard i believe he doesnt get drunk though hes always drinking but you may take my word for it what hes telling you now is as true as gospel if he was telling a lie from malice hed be louder and more urgent about it you see hes half afraid to speak as it is he would not have come near you at all only his conscience makes him afraid to keep the matter to himself you may take my word for it ballindine barry lynch did propose to him to murder his sister indeed it doesnt surprise me he is so utterly worthless  but murder armstrong downright murder of the worst kind studiedpremeditated he must have been thinking of it and planning it for days a man may be worthless and yet not such a wretch as that would make him can you really think he meant colligan to murder his sister  i can and do think so said the parson the temptation was great he had been waiting for his sisters death and he could not bring himself to bear disappointment i do not think he could do it with his own hand for he is a coward but i can quite believe that he could instigate another person to do it  then id hang him i wouldnt raise my hand to save him from the rope  nor would i but we cant hang him we can do nothing to him if he defies us but if hes well handled we can drive him from the country  the lord and the parson talked the matter over till they reached dunmore and agreed that they would go with colligan to barry lynch tell him of the charge which was brought against him and give him his option of standing his trial or of leaving the country under a written promise that he would never return to it in this case he was also to write a note to anty signifying his consent that she should marry martin kelly and also execute some deed by which all control over the property should be taken out of his own hands and that he should agree to receive his income whatever it might be through the hands of an agent  there were sundry matters connected with the subject which were rather difficult of arrangement in the first place frank was obliged very unwillingly to consent that mr armstrong should remain at any rate one day longer in the country it was however at last settled that he should return that night and sleep at kellys court then lord ballindine insisted that they should tell young kelly what they were about before they went to barrys house as it would be necessary to consult him as to the disposition he would wish to have made of the property armstrong was strongly against this measurebut it was at last decided on and then they had to induce colligan to go with them he much wished them to manage the business without him he had had quite enough of dunmore house and in spite of the valiant manner in which he had knocked its owner down the last time he was there seemed now quite afraid to face him but mr armstrong informed him that he must go on now as he had said so much and at last frightened him into an unwilling compliance  the three of them went up into the little parlour of the inn and summoned martin to the conference and various were the conjectures made by the family as to the nature of the business which brought three such persons to the inn together but the widow settled them all by asserting that a kelly neednt be afeared thank god to see his own landlord in his own house nor though he brought an attorney wid him as well as a parson and a docther and so martin was sent for and soon heard the horrid story not long after he had joined them the four sallied out together and meg remarked that something very bad was going to happen for the lord never passed her before without a kind word or a nod and now he took no more notice of her than if it had been only sally herself that met him on the stairs     xxxv  mr lynch bids farewell to dunmore   poor martin was dreadfully shocked and not only shocked but grieved and astonished he had never thought well of his intended brotherinlaw but he had not judged him so severely as mr armstrong had done he listened to all lord ballindine said to him and agreed as to the propriety of the measures he proposed but there was nothing of elation about him at the downfall of the man whom he could not but look on as his enemy indeed he was not only subdued and modest in his demeanour but he appeared so reserved that he could hardly be got to express any interest in the steps which were to be taken respecting the property it was only when lord ballindine pointed out to him that it was his duty to guard antys interests that he would consent to go to dunmore house with them and to state when called upon to do so what measures he would wish to have adopted with regard to the property  suppose he denies himself to us said frank as the four walked across the street together to the great astonishment of the whole population  if hes in the house ill go bail we wont go away without seeing him said the parson will he be at home kelly do you think  indeed he will mr armstrong said martin hell be in bed and asleep hes never out of bed i believe much before one or two in the day its a bad life hes leading since the ould man died  you may say that said the doctorcursing and drinking drinking and cursing nothing else youll find him curse at you dreadful mr armstrong im afraid  i can bear that doctor its part of my own trade you know but i think well find him quiet enough i think youll find the difficulty is to make him speak at all youd better be spokesman my lord as youre a magistrate  no armstrong i will not youre much more able and more fitting if its necessary for me to act as a magistrate ill do sobut at first well leave him to you  very well said the parson and ill do my best but ill tell you what i am afraid of if we find him in bed we must wait for him and when the servant tells him who we are and mentions the doctors name along with yours my lord hell guess what were come about and hell be out of the window or into the cellar and then thered be no catching him without the police we must make our way up into his bedroom  i dont think we could well do that said the doctor  no armstrong said lord ballindine i dont think we ought to force ourselves upstairs we might as well tell all the servants what wed come about  and so we must said armstrong if its necessary the more determined we arein fact the rougher we are with him the more likely we are to bring him on his knees i tell you you must have no scruples in dealing with such a fellow but leave him to me and so saying the parson gave a thundering rap at the hail door and in about one minute repeated it which brought biddy running to the door without shoes or stockings with her hair streaming behind her head and in her hand the comb with which she had been disentangling it  is your master at home said armstrong  begorra he is said the girl out of breath that is hes not up yet nor awake yer honer and she held the door in her hand as though this answer was final  but i want to see him on especial and immediate business said the parson pushing back the door and the girl together and walking into the hall i must see him at once mr lynch will excuse me weve known each other a long time  begorra i dont know said the girl only hes in bed and fast couldnt yer honer call agin about four or five oclock thats the time the masthers most fittest to be talking to the likes of yer honer  these gentlemen could not wait said the parson  shure the docther there and mr martin knows well enough im not telling you a bit of a lie misther armstrong said the girl  i know youre not my good girl i know youre not telling a liebut nevertheless i must see mr lynch just step up and wake him and tell him im waiting to say two words to him  faix yer honer hes very bitther intirely when hes waked this early but in course ill be led by yer honers ill say then that the lord and parson armstrong and the docther and mr martin is waiting to spake two words to him is that it  thatll do as well as anything said armstrong and then when the girl went upstairs he continued you see she knew us all and of course will tell him who we are but ill not let him escape for ill go up with her and as the girl slowly opened her masters bedroom door mr armstrong stood close outside it in the passage  after considerable efforts biddy succeeded in awaking her master sufficiently to make him understand that lord ballindine and doctor colligan were downstairs and that parson armstrong was just outside the bedroom door the poor girl tried hard to communicate her tidings in such a whisper as would be inaudible to the parson but this was impossible for barry only swore at her and asked her what the d she meant by jabbering there in that manner when however he did comprehend who his visitors were and where they were he gnashed his teeth and clenched his fist at the poor girl in sign of his anger against her for having admitted so unwelcome a party but he was too frightened to speak  mr armstrong soon put an end to this dumb show by walking into the bedroom when the girl escaped and he shut the door barry sat up in his bed rubbed his eyes and stared at him but he said nothing  mr lynch said the parson i had better at once explain the circumstances which have induced me to make so very strange a visit  confounded strange i must say to come up to a mans room in this way and him in bed  doctor colligan is downstairs  d doctor colligan hes at his lies again i suppose much i care for doctor colligan  doctor colligan is downstairs continued mr armstrong and lord ballindine who you are aware is a magistrate they wish to speak to you mr lynch and that at once  i suppose they can wait till a mans dressed  that depends on how long youre dressing mr lynch  upon my word this is cool enough in a mans own house said barry well you dont expect me to get up while youre there i suppose  indeed i do mr lynch never mind me just wash and dress yourself as though i wasnt here ill wait here till we go down together  im dd if i do said barry ill not stir while you remain there and he threw himself back in the bed and wrapped the bedclothes round him  very well said mr armstrong and then going out on to the landingplace called out over the banistersdoctordoctor colligan tell his lordship mr lynch objects to a private interview he had better just step down to the courthouse and issue his warrant you might as well tell constable nelligan to be in the way  dn exclaimed barry sitting bolt upright in his bed who says i object to see anybody mr armstrong what do you go and say that for mr armstrong returned into the room its not true i only want to have my bedroom to myself while i get up  for once in the way mr lynch you must manage to get up although your privacy be intruded on to tell you the plain truth i will not leave you till you come downstairs with me unless it be in the custody of a policeman if you will quietly dress and come downstairs with me i trust we may be saved the necessity of troubling the police at all  barry at last gave way and gradually extricating himself from the bedclothes put his feet down on the floor and remained sitting on the side of his bed he leaned his head down on his hands and groaned inwardly for he was very sick and the fumes of last nights punch still disturbed his brain his stockings and drawers were on for terry when he put him to bed considered it only waste of time to pull them off for shure wouldnt they have jist to go on agin the next morning  dont be particular mr lynch never mind washing or shaving till were gone we wont keep you long i hope  youre very kind i must say said barry i suppose you wont object to my having a bottle of soda waterand he gave a terrible tug at the bell  not at allnor a glass of brandy in it if you like it indeed mr lynch i think that just at present it will be the better thing for you  barry got his bottle of soda water and swallowed about two glasses of whiskey in it for brandy was beginning to be scarce with him and then commenced his toilet he took parson armstrongs hint and wasnt very particular about it he huddled on his clothes smoothed his hair with his brush and muttering something about its being their own fault descended into the parlour followed by mr armstrong he made a kind of bow to lord ballindine took no notice of martin but turning round sharp on the doctor said  of all the false ruffians i ever met colliganby heavens youre the worst theres one comfort no man in dunmore will believe a word you say he then threw himself back into the easy chair and said well gentlemenwell my lordhere i am you cant say im ashamed to show my face though i must say your visit is not made in the genteelest manner  mr lynch said the parson do you remember the night doctor colligan knocked you down in this room in this room wasnt it doctor  yes in this room said the doctor rather sotto voce  do you remember the circumstance mr lynch  its a lie said barry  no its not said the parson if you forget it i can call in the servant to remember so much as that for me but youll find it better mr lynch to let us finish this business among ourselves come think about it im sure you remember being knocked down by the doctor  i remember a scrimmage there was between us i dont care what the girl says she didnt see it colligan i suppose has given her halfacrown and shed swear anything for that  well you remember the night of the scrimmage  i do colligan got drunk here one night he wanted me to give him a farm and said cursed queer things about my sister i hardly know what he said but i know i had to turn him out of the house and there was a scrimmage between us  i see youre so far prepared mr lynch now ill tell you my version of the storymartin kelly just see that the door is shut you endeavoured to bribe doctor colligan to murder your own sister  its a most infernal lie said barry wheres your evidencewheres your evidence whats the good of your all coming here with such a story as that wheres your evidence  youd better be quiet mr lynch or well adjourn at once from here to the open courthouse  adjourn when you like its all one to me wholl believe such a drunken ruffian as that colligan id like to know such a story as that  my lord said armstrong im afraid we must go on with this business at the courthouse martin i believe i must trouble you to go down to the police barrack and the whole party except barry rose from their seats  what the devil are you going to drag me down to the courthouse for gentlemen said he ill give you any satisfaction but you cant expect ill own to such a lie as this about my sister i suppose my words as good as colligans gentlemen i suppose my character as a protestant gentleman stands higher than hisa dirty papist apothecary he tells one story i tell another only hes got the first word of me thats all i suppose gentlemen im not to be condemned on the word of such a man as that  i think mr lynch said armstrong if youll listen to me youll save yourself and us a great deal of trouble you asked me who my witness was my witness is in this house i would not charge you with so horrid so damnable a crime had i not thoroughly convinced myself you were guiltynow do hold your tongue mr lynch or i will have you down to the courthouse we all know you are guilty you know it yourself  im began barry  stop mr lynch not one word till ive done or what i have to say shall be said in public we all know you are guilty but we probably maynt be able to prove it  no i should think not shouted barry  we maynt be able to prove it in such a way as to enable a jury to hang you or upon my word i wouldnt interfere to prevent it the law should have its course id hang you with as little respite as i would a dog  barry grinned horribly at this suggestion but said nothing and the parson continued  it is not the want of evidence that stands in the way of so desirable a proceeding but that doctor colligan thoroughly disgusted and shocked at the iniquity of your proposal  oh go on mr armstronggo on i see you are determined to have it all your own way but my turnll come soon  i say that doctor colligan interrupted you before you fully committed yourself  fully committed myself indeed why colligan knows well enough that when he got up in such a fluster thered not been a word at all said about anty  hadnt there mr lynchjust now you said you turned the doctor out of your house for speaking about your sister youre only committing yourself i say therefore the evidence though quite strong enough to put you into the dock as a murderer in intention might not be sufficient to induce a jury to find you guilty but guilty you would be esteemed in the mind of every man woman and child in this county guilty of the wilful deliberate murder of your own sister  by heavens ill not stand this exclaimed barryill not stand this i didnt do it mr armstrong i didnt do it hes a liar lord ballindine upon my sacred word and honour as a gentleman hes a liar why do you believe him when you wont believe me aint i a protestant mr armstrong and aint you a protestant clergyman dont you know that such men as he will tell any lie will do any dirty job on my sacred word of honour as a gentleman lord ballindine he offered to poison anty on condition he got the farm round the house for nothinghe knows its true and why should you believe him sooner than me mr armstrong  barry had got up from his seat and was walking up and down the room now standing opposite lord ballindine and appealing to him and then doing the same thing to mr armstrong he was a horrid figure he had no collar round his neck and his handkerchief was put on in such a way as to look like a hangmans knot his face was blotched and red and greasy for he had neither shaved nor washed himself since his last nights debauch he had neither waistcoat nor braces on and his trousers fell on his hips his long hair hung over his eyes which were bleared and bloodshot he was suffering dreadfully from terror and an intense anxiety to shift the guilt from himself to doctor colligan he was a most pitiable objectso wretched so unmanned so low in the scale of creation lord ballindine did pity his misery and suggested to mr armstrong whether by any possibility there could be any mistake in the matterwhether it was possible doctor colligan could have mistaken lynchs objectthe poor wretch jumped at this loophole and doubly condemned himself by doing so  he did then said barry he must have done so as i hope for heaven lord ballindine i never had the idea of getting him toto do anything to anty i wouldnt have done it for worldsindeed i wouldnt there must be some mistake indeed there must hed been drinking mr armstrongdrinking a good deal that nightisnt that true doctor colligan come man speak the truthdont go and try and hang a fellow out of mistake his lordship sees its all a mistake and of course hes the best able to judge of the lot here a magistrate and a nobleman and all i know you wont see me wronged lord ballindine i know you wont i give you my sacred word of honour as a gentleman it all came from mistake when we were both drunk or nearly drunk come doctor colligan speak manisnt that the truth i tell you mr armstrong lord ballindines in the right of it there is some mistake in all this  as sure as the lords in heaven said the doctor now becoming a little uneasy at the idea that lord ballindine should think he had told so strange a story without proper foundationas sure as the lords in heaven he offered me the farm for a reward should i manage to prevent his sisters recovery  what do you think mr armstrong said lord ballindine  think said the parsontheres no possibility of thinking at all the truth becomes clearer every moment why you wretched creature its not ten minutes since you yourself accused doctor colligan of offering to murder your sister according to your own showing therefore there was a deliberate conversation between you and your own evasion now would prove which of you were the murderer were any additional proof wanted but it is not barry lynch as sure as you now stand in the presence of your creator whose name you so constantly blaspheme you endeavoured to instigate that man to murder your own sister  oh lord ballindineoh lord ballindine shrieked barry in his agony dont desert me pray pray dont desert me i didnt do iti never thought of doing it we were at school together werent weand you wont see me put upon this way you maynt think much of me in other things but you wont believe that a schoolfellow of your own evereverever barry couldnt bring himself to use the words with which his sentence should be finished and so he flung himself back into his armchair and burst into tears  you appeal to me mr lynch said lord ballindine and i must say i most firmly believe you to be guilty my only doubt is whether you should not at once be committed for trial at the next assizes  oh my g exclaimed barry and for some time he continued blaspheming most horriblyswearing that there was a conspiracy against himaccusing mr armstrong in the most bitter terms of joining with doctor colligan and martin kelly to rob and murder him  now mr lynch continued the parson as soon as the unfortunate man would listen to him as i before told you i am in doubtwe are all in doubtwhether or not a jury would hang you and we think that we shall do more good to the community by getting you out of the way than by letting you loose again after a trial which will only serve to let everyone know how great a wretch there is in the county we will therefore give you your option either to stand your trial or to leave the country at onceand for ever  and my propertywhats to become of my property said barry  your propertys safe mr lynch we cant touch that were not prescribing any punishment to you we fear indeed we know youre beyond the reach of the law or we shouldnt make the proposal barry breathed freely again as he heard this avowal but youre not beyond the reach of public opinionof public execrationof general hatred and of a general curse for your sisters sakefor the sake of martin kelly who is going to marry the sister whom you wished to murder and not for your own sake you shall be allowed to leave the country without this public brand being put upon your name if you remain no one shall speak to you but as to a man who would have murdered his sister murder shall be everlastingly muttered in your ears nor will your going then avail you for your character shall go with you and the very blackguards with whom you delight to assort shall avoid you as being too bad even for their society go now mr lynchgo at onceleave your sister to happiness which you cannot prevent and she at least shall know nothing of your iniquity and you shall enjoy the proceeds of your property anywhere you willanywhere that is but in ireland do you agree to this  im an innocent man mr armstrong i am indeed  very well said the parson then we may as well go away and leave you to your fate come lord ballindine we can have nothing further to say and they again all rose from their seats  stop mr armstrong stop said barry  well said the parson for barry repressed the words which were in his mouth when he found that his visitors did stop as he desired them  well mr lynch what have you further to say  indeed i am not guilty mr armstrong put on his hat and rushed to the doorbut continued barry  i will have no buts mr lynch will you at once and unconditionally agree to the terms i have proposed  i dont want to live in the country said barry the countrys nothing to me  you will go then immediately said the parson  as soon as i have arranged about the property i will said barry  that wont do said the parson you must go at once and leave your property to the care of others you must leave dunmore today for ever  today shouted barry  yes today you can easily get as far as roscommon you have your own horse and car and what is more before you go you must write to your sister telling her that you have made up your mind to leave the country and expressing your consent to her marrying whom she pleases  i cant go today said barry sulkily whos to receive my rents wholl send me my moneybesidesbesides oh comethats nonsense i aint going to be turned out in that style  you aint in earnest are you about his going today whispered frank to the parson  i am and youll find hell go too said armstrong it must be todaythis very day mr lynch martin kelly will manage for you about the property  or you can send for mr daly to meet you at roscommon suggested martin  thank you for nothing said barry youd better wait till youre spoken to i dont know what business you have here at all  the business that all honest men have to look after all rogues said mr armstrong come mr lynch youd better make up your mind to prepare for your journey  well i wontand theres an end of it said barry its all nonsense you cant do anything to me you said so yourself im not going to be made a fool of that wayim not going to give up my property and everything  dont you know mr lynch said the parson that if you are kept in jail till april next as will be your fate if you persist in staying at dunmore tonight your creditors will do much more damage to your property than your own immediate absence will do if mr daly is your lawyer send for him as martin kelly suggests im not afraid that he will recommend you to remain in the country even should you dare to tell him of the horrid accusation which is brought against you but at any rate make up your mind for if you do stay in dunmore tonight it shall be in the bridewell and your next move shall be to galway  barry sat silent for a while trying to think the parson was like an incubus upon him which he was totally unable to shake off he knew neither how to resist nor how to give way misty ideas got into his head of escaping to his bedroom and blowing his own brains out different schemes of retaliation and revenge flitted before him but he could decide on nothing there he sat silent stupidly gazing at nothing while lord ballindine and mr armstrong stood whispering over the fire  im afraid were in the wrong i really think we are said frank  we must go through with it now any way said the parson come mr lynch i will give you five minutes more and then i go and he pulled out his watch and stood with his back to the fire looking at it lord ballindine walked to the window and martin kelly and doctor colligan sat in distant parts of the room with long faces silent and solemn breathing heavily how long those five minutes appeared to them and how short to barry the time was not long enough to enable him to come to any decision at the end of the five minutes he was still gazing vacantly before him he was still turning over in his brain one after another the same crowd of undigested schemes  the time is out mr lynch will you go said the parson  ive no money hoarsely croaked barry  if thats the only difficulty well raise money for him said frank  ill advance him money said martin  do you mean youve no money at all said the parson  dont you hear me say so said barry  and youll go if you get moneysay ten pounds said the parson  ten pounds i can go nowhere with ten pounds you know that well enough  ill give him twentyfive said martin im sure his sisterll do that for him  say fifty said barry and im off at once  i havent got it said martin  no said the parson ill not see you bribed to go take the twentyfivethat will last you till you make arrangements about your property we are not going to pay you for going mr lynch  you seem very anxious about it any way  i am anxious about it rejoined the parson i am anxious to save your sister from knowing what it was that her brother wished to accomplish  barry scowled at him as though he would like if possible to try his hand at murdering him but he did not answer him again arrangements were at last made for barrys departure and off he went that very daynot to roscommon but to tuam and there at the instigation of martin daly the attorney took upon himself the division and temporary management of the property from thence with martins or rather with his sisters twentyfive pounds in his pocket he started to that elysium for which he had for some time so ardently longed and soon landed at boulogne regardless alike of his sister his future brother lord ballindine or mr armstrong the parson had found it quite impossible to carry out one point on which he had insisted he could not induce barry lynch to write to his sister no not a line not a word had it been to save him from hanging he could hardly have induced himself to write those common words dear sister  oh you can tell her what you like said he its youre making me go away at once in this manner tell her whatever confounded lies you like tell her im gone because i didnt choose to stay and see her make a fool of herselfand thats the truth too if it wasnt for that i wouldnt move a step for any of you  he went however as i have before said and troubled the people of dunmore no longer nor shall he again trouble us   oh but martin what nonsense said the widow coaxingly to her son that night before she went to bed the lord wouldnt be going up there just to wish him good byeand parson armstrong too what the dickens could they be at there so long come martinyoure safe with me you know tell us something about it now  nonsense mother ive nothing to tell barry lynch has left the place for good and all thats all about it  god bless the back of him thin hed my lave for going long since but you might be telling us what made him be starting this way all of a heap  dont you know mother he was head and ears in debt  dont tell me said the widow parson armstrongs not a sheriffs officer that he should be looking after folks in debt  no mother hes not that i know of but he dont like for all that to see his tithes walking out of the country  dont be coming over me that way martin barry lynch nor his father before him never held any land in ballindine parish  didnt theywell thin you know more than i mother so its no use my telling you and martin walked off to bed  ill even you yet my lad said she close as you are you see else wait awhile till the moneys wanting and then lets see wholl know all about it and the widow slapped herself powerfully on that part where her pocket depended in sign of the great confidence she had in the strength of her purse  did i manage that well said the parson as lord ballindine drove him home to kellys court as soon as the long interview was over if i can do as well at grey abbey youll employ me again i think  upon my word then armstrong said frank i never was in such hot water as i have been all this day and now its over to tell you the truth im sorry we interfered we did what we had no possible right to do  nonsense man you dont suppose id have dreamed of letting him off if the law could have touched him but it couldnt no magistrates in the county could have committed him for he had done and as far as i can judge had said literally nothing its true we know what he intended but a score of magistrates could have done nothing with him as it is weve got him out of the country hell never come back again  what i mean is we had no business to drive him out of the country with threats  oh ballindine thats nonsense one can keep no common terms with such a blackguard as that however its done now and i must say i think it was well done  theres no doubt of your talent in the matter armstrong upon my soul i never saw anything so cool what a wretchwhat an absolute fiend the fellow is  bad enough said the parson ive seen bad men before but i think hes the worst i ever saw whatll mrs okelly say of my coming in this way without notice  the parson enjoyed his claret at kellys court that evening after his hard days work and the next morning he started for grey abbey     xxxvi  mr armstrong visits grey abbey on a delicate mission   lord cashel certainly felt a considerable degree of relief when his daughter told him that lord kilcullen had left the house and was on his way to dublin though he had been forced to pay so dearly for the satisfaction had had to falsify his solemn assurance that he would not give his son another penny and to break through his resolution of acting the roman father 50 he consoled himself with the idea that he had been actuated by affection for his profligate son but such had not been the case could he have handed him over to the sheriffs officer silently and secretly he would have done so but his pride could not endure the reflection that all the world should know that bailiffs had forced an entry into grey abbey       footnote 50 roman fatherlucius junius brutus legendary                    founder of the roman republic was said to have                    passed sentence of death on his two sons for                    participating in a rebellion  he closely questioned lady selina with regard to all that had passed between her and her brother  did he say anything at last he saiddid he say anything aboutabout fanny  not much papa but what he did say he said with kindness and affection replied her ladyship glad to repeat anything in favour of her brother  affectionpooh said the earl he has no affection no affection for any one he has no affection even for mewhat did he say about her selina  he seemed to wish she should marry lord ballindine  she may marry whom she pleases now said the earl i wash my hands of her i have done my best to prevent what i thought a disgraceful match for her  it would not have been disgraceful papa had she married him six months ago  a gambler and a roué said the earl forgetting it is to be supposed for the moment his own sons character shell marry him now i suppose and repent at her leisure ill give myself no further trouble about it  the earl thought upon the subject however a good deal and before mr armstrongs arrival he had all but made up his mind that he must again swallow his word and ask his wards lover back to his house he had at any rate become assured that if he did not do so some one else would do it for him  mr armstrong was happily possessed of a considerable stock of selfconfidence and during his first days journey felt no want of it with regard to the delicate mission with which he was entrusted but when he had deposited his carpetbag at the little hotel at kilcullen bridge and found himself seated on a hack car and proceeding to grey abbey he began to feel that he had rather a difficult part to play and by the time that the house was in sight he felt himself completely puzzled as to the manner in which he should open his negotiation  he had however desired the man to drive to the house and he could not well stop the car in the middle of the demesne to mature his plans and when he was at the door he could not stay there without applying for admission so he got his cardcase in his hand and rang the bell after a due interval which to the parson did not seem a bit too long the heavylooking powdered footman appeared and announced that lord cashel was at home and in another minute mr armstrong found himself in the bookroom  it was the morning after lord kilcullens departure and lord cashel was still anything but comfortable her ladyship had been bothering him about the poor boy as she called her son now that she learned he was in distress and had been beseeching him to increase his allowance the earl had not told his wife the extent of their sons pecuniary delinquencies and consequently she was greatly dismayed when her husband very solemnly said  my lady lord kilcullen has no longer any allowance from me  good gracious screamed her ladyship no allowancehow is the poor boy to live  that i really cannot tell i cannot even guess but let him live how he may i will not absolutely ruin myself for his sake  the interview was not a comfortable one either to the father or mother lady cashel cried a great deal and was very strongly of opinion that her son would die of cold and starvation how could he get shelter or food any more than a common person if he had no allowance mightnt he at any rate come back and live at grey abbeythat wouldnt cost his father anything and then the countess remembered how she had praised her son to mrs ellison and the bishops wife and she cried worse than ever and was obliged to be left to griffiths and her drops  this happened on the evening of lord kilcullens departure and on the next morning her ladyship did not appear at breakfast she was weak and nervous and had her tea in her own sittingroom there was no one sitting at breakfast but the earl fanny and lady selina and they were all alike stiff cold and silent the earl felt as if he were not at home even in his own breakfastparlour he felt afraid of his ward as though he were conscious that she knew how he had intended to injure her and as soon as he had swallowed his eggs he muttered something which was inaudible to both the girls and retreated to his private den  he had not been there long before the servant brought in our friends name the rev george armstrong written on a plain card the parson had not put the name of his parish fearing that the earl knowing from whence he came might guess his business and decline seeing him as it was no difficulty was made and the parson soon found himself têteàtête with the earl  i have taken the liberty of calling on you lord cashel said mr armstrong having accepted the offer of a chair on a rather delicate mission  the earl bowed and rubbed his hands and felt more comfortable than he had done for the last week he liked delicate missions coming to him for he flattered himself that he knew how to receive them in a delicate manner he liked also displaying his dignity to strangers for he felt that strangers stood rather in awe of him he also felt though he did not own it to himself that his manner was not so effective with people who had known him some time  i may say a very delicate mission said the parson and one i would not have undertaken had i not known your lordships character for candour and honesty  lord cashel again bowed and rubbed his hands  i am my lord a friend of lord ballindine and as such i have taken the liberty of calling on your lordship  a friend of lord ballindine said the earl arching his eyebrows and assuming a look of great surprise  a very old friend my lord the clergyman of his parish and for many years an intimate friend of his father i have known lord ballindine since he was a child  lord ballindine is lucky in having such a friend few young men now i am sorry to say care much for their fathers friends is there anything mr armstrong in which i can assist either you or his lordship  my lord said the parson i need not tell you that before i took the perhaps unwarrantable liberty of troubling you i was made acquainted with lord ballindines engagement with your ward and with the manner in which that engagement was broken off  and your object is mr armstrong  my object is to remove if possible the unfortunate misunderstanding between your lordship and my friend  misunderstanding mr armstrongthere was no misunderstanding between us i really think we perfectly understood each other lord ballindine was engaged to my ward his engagement however being contingent on his adoption of a certain line of conduct this line of conduct his lordship did not adopt perhaps he used a wise discretion however i thought not i thought the mode of life which he pursued  but  pardon me a moment mr armstrong and i shall have said all which appears to me to be necessary on the occasion perhaps more than is necessary more probably than i should have allowed myself to say had not lord ballindine sent as his ambassador the clergyman of his parish and the friend of his father and lord cashel again bowed and rubbed his hands i thought mr armstrong that your young friend appeared wedded to a style of life quite incompatible with his incomewith his own income as a single man and the income which he would have possessed had he married my ward i thought that their marriage would only lead to poverty and distress and i felt that i was only doing my duty to my ward in expressing this opinion to her i found that she was herself of the same opinion that she feared a union with lord ballindine would not ensure happiness either to him or to herself his habits were too evidently those of extravagance and hers had not been such as to render a life of privation anything but a life of misery  i had thought  one moment more mr armstrong and i shall have done after mature consideration miss wyndham commissioned me to express her sentimentsand i must say they fully coincided with my ownto lord ballindine and to explain to him that she found herself obliged tototo retrace the steps which she had taken in the matter i did this in a manner as little painful to lord ballindine as i was able it is difficult mr armstrong to make a disagreeable communication palatable it is very difficult to persuade a young man who is in love to give up the object of his idolatry but i trust lord ballindine will do me the justice to own that on the occasion alluded to i said nothing unnecessarily harshnothing calculated to harass his feelings i appreciate and esteem lord ballindines good qualities and i much regretted that prudence forbad me to sanction the near alliance he was anxious to do me the honour of making with me  lord cashel finished his harangue and felt once more on good terms with himself he by no means intended offering any further vehement resistance to his wards marriage he was indeed rejoiced to have an opportunity of giving way decently but he could not resist the temptation of explaining his conduct and making a speech  my lord said the parson what you tell me is only a repetition of what i heard from my young friend  i am glad to hear it i trust then i may have the pleasure of feeling that lord ballindine attributes to me no personal unkindness  not in the least lord cashel very far from it though lord ballindine may not bemay not hitherto have been free from the follies of his age he has had quite sense enough to appreciate your lordships conduct  i endeavoured at any rate that it should be such as to render me liable to no just imputation of fickleness or cruelty  no one would for a moment accuse your lordship of either it is my knowledge of your lordships character in this particular which has induced me to undertake the task of begging you to reconsider the subject lord ballindine has you are aware sold his racehorses  i had heard so mr armstrong though perhaps not on good authority  he has and is now living among his own tenantry and friends at kellys court he is passionately devotedly attached to your ward lord cashel and with a young mans vanity he still thinks that she may not be quite indifferent to him  it was at her own instance mr armstrong that his suit was rejected  i am well aware of that my lord but ladies you know do sometimes mistake their own feelings miss wyndham must have been attached to my friend or she would not have received him as her lover will you my lord allow me to see miss wyndham if she still expresses indifference to lord ballindine i will assure her that she shall be no further persecuted by his suit if such be not the case surely prudence need not further interfere to prevent a marriage desired by both the persons most concerned lord ballindine is not now a spendthrift whatever he may formerly have been and miss wyndhams princely fortune though it alone would never have induced my friend to seek her hand will make the match all that it should be you will not object my lord to my seeing miss wyndham  mr armstrongreallyyou must be aware such a request is rather unusual  so are the circumstances replied the parson they also are unusual i do not doubt miss wyndhams wisdom in rejecting lord ballindine when as you say he appeared to be wedded to a life of extravagance i have no doubt she put a violent restraint on her own feelings exercised in fact a selfdenial which shows a very high tone of character and should elicit nothing but admiration but circumstances are much altered  lord cashel continued to raise objections to the parsons request though it was throughout the interview his intention to accede to it at last he gave up the point with much grace and in such a manner as he thought should entitle him to the eternal gratitude of his ward lord ballindine and the parson he consequently rang the bell and desired the servant to give his compliments to miss wyndham and tell her that the rev mr armstrong wished to see her alone upon business of importance  mr armstrong felt that his success was much greater than he had had any reason to expect from lord ballindines description of his last visit at grey abbey he had in fact overcome the only difficulty if miss wyndham really disliked his friend and objected to the marriage mr armstrong was well aware that he had only to return and tell his friend so in the best way he could if however she still had a true regard for him if she were the fanny wyndham ballindine had described her to be if she had ever really been devoted to him if she had at all a wish in her heart to see him again at her feet the parson felt that he would have good news to send back to kellys court and that he would have done the lovers a service which they never could forget  at any rate mr armstrong said lord cashel as the parson was bowing himself backwards out of the room you will join our family circle while you are in the neighbourhood whatever may be the success of your missionand i assure you i hope it may be such as will be gratifying to you i am happy to make the acquaintance of any friend of lord ballindines when lord ballindine chooses his friends so well this was meant as a slap at dot blake you will give me leave to send down to the town for your luggage mr armstrong made no objection to this proposal and the luggage was sent for  the powderhaired servant again took him in tow and ushered him out of the bookroom across the hall through the billiardroom and into the library gave him a chair and then brought him a newspaper giving him to understand that miss wyndham would soon be with him  the parson took the paper in his hands but he did not trouble himself much with the contents of it what was he to say to miss wyndhamhow was he to commence he had never gone lovemaking for another in his life and now at his advanced age it really did come rather strange to him and then he began to think whether she were short or tall dark or fair stout or slender it certainly was very odd but in all their conversations on the subject lord ballindine had never given him any description of his inamorata mr armstrong however had not much time to make up his mind on any of these points for the door opened and miss wyndham entered  she was dressed in black for she was of course still in mourning for her brother but in spite of her sable habiliments she startled the parson by the brilliance of her beauty there was a quiet dignity of demeanour natural to fanny wyndham a wellbalanced pose and a grace of motion which saved her from ever looking awkward or confused she never appeared to lose her selfpossession though never arrogant she seemed always to know what was due to herself no insignificant puppy could ever have attempted to flirt with her  when summoned by the servant to meet a strange clergyman alone in the library at the request of lord cashel she felt that his visit must have some reference to her lover indeed her thoughts for the last few days had run on little else she had made up her mind to talk to her cousin about him then her cousin had matured that determination by making love to her himself then she had talked to him of lord ballindine and he had promised to talk to his father on the same subject and she had since been endeavouring to bring herself to make one other last appeal to her uncles feelings her mind was therefore full of lord ballindine when she walked into the library but her face was no telltale her gait and demeanour were as dignified as though she had no anxious love within her heartno one grand desire to disturb the even current of her blood she bowed her beautiful head to mr armstrong as she walked into the room and sitting down herself begged him to take a chair  the parson had by no means made up his mind as to what he was to say to the young lady so he shut his eyes and rushed at once into the middle of his subject miss wyndham he said i have come a long way to call on you at the request of a friend of yoursa very dear and old friend of mineat the request of lord ballindine  fannys countenance became deeply suffused at her lovers name but the parson did not observe it indeed he hardly ventured to look in her face she merely said in a voice which seemed to him to be anything but promising well sir the truth was she did not know what to say had she dared she would have fallen on her knees before her lovers friend and sworn to him how well she loved him  when lord ballindine was last at grey abbey miss wyndham he had not the honour of an interview with you  no sir said fanny her voice look and manner were still sedate and courtly her heart however was beating so violently that she hardly knew what she said  circumstances i believe prevented it said the parson my friend however received through lord cashel a message from you whichwhichwhich has been very fatal to his happiness  fanny tried to say something but she was not able  the very decided tone in which your uncle then spoke to him has made lord ballindine feel that any further visit to grey abbey on his own part would be an intrusion  i never said fanny i never  you never authorised so harsh a message you would say it is not the harshness of the language but the certainty of the fact that has destroyed my friends happiness if such were to be the caseif it were absolutely necessary that the engagement between you and lord ballindine should be broken off the more decided the manner in which it were done the better lord ballindine now wishesi am a bad messenger in such a case as this miss wyndham it is perhaps better to tell you at once a plain tale frank has desired me to tell you that he loves you well and truly that he cannot believe you are indifferent to him that your vows to him so precious are still ringing in his ears that he is as far as his heart is concerned unchanged and he has commissioned me to ascertain from yourself whether youhave really changed your mind since he last had the pleasure of seeing you the parson waited a moment for an answer and then added lord ballindine by no means wishes to persecute you on the subject nor would i do so if he did wish it you have only to tell me that you do not intend to renew your acquaintance with lord ballindine and i will leave grey abbey fanny still remained silent say the one word go miss wyndham and you need not pain yourself by any further speech i will at once be gone  fanny strove hard to keep her composure and to make some fitting reply to mr armstrong but she was unable her heart was too full she was too happy she had openly and in spite of rebuke avowed her love to her uncle her aunt to lady selina and her cousin but she could not bring herself to confess it to mr armstrong at last she said  i am much obliged to you for your kindness mr armstrong perhaps i owe it to lord ballindine toto    i will ask my uncle sir to write to him  i shall write to lord ballindine this evening miss wyndham will you intrust me with no message i came from him to see you with no other purpose i must give him some news i must tell him i have seen you may i tell him not to despair  tell himtell him said fannyand she paused to make up her mind as to the words of her messagetell him to come himself and hurrying from the room she left the parson alone to meditate on the singular success of his mission he stood for about half an hour thinking over what had occurred and rejoicing greatly in his mind that he had undertaken the business what fools men are about women he said at last to himself they know their nature so well when they are thinking and speaking of them with reference to others but as soon as a man is in love with one himself he is cowed he thinks the nature of one woman is different from that of all others and he is afraid to act on his general knowledge well i might as well write to him for thank god i can send him good newsand he rang the bell and asked if his bag had come it had and was in his bedroom could the servant get him pen ink and paper the servant did so and within two hours of his entering the doors of grey abbey he was informing his friend of the success of his mission     xxxvii  veni vidi vici 51        footnote 51 veni vidi vicilatin julius caesars terse                    message to the senate announcing his victory over                    king pharnaces ii of pontus in 47 bc i came                    i saw i conquered  the two following letters for lord ballindine were sent off in the grey abbey postbag on the evening of the day on which mr armstrong had arrived there they were from mr armstrong and lord cashel that from the former was first opened      grey abbey april 1844     dear frank     you will own i have not lost much time i left kellys court the day    before yesterday and i am already able to send you good news i have    seen lord cashel and have found him anything but uncourteous i    have also seen miss wyndham and though she said but little to me    that little was just what you would have wished her to say she    bade me tell you to come yourself in obedience to her commands i    do hereby require you to pack yourself up and proceed forthwith    to grey abbey his lordship has signified to me that it is his    intention in his own and lady cashels name to request the renewed    pleasure of an immediate and he hopes a prolonged visit from your    lordship you will not my dear frank i am sure be such a fool as    to allow your dislike to such an empty butterfirkin as this earl    to stand in the way of your love or your fortune you cant expect    miss wyndham to go to you so pocket your resentment like a sensible    fellow and accept lord cashels invitation as though there had been    no difference between you     i have also received an invite and intend staying here a day or    two i cant say that judging from the master of the house i think    that a prolonged sojourn would be very agreeable i have as yet    seen none of the ladies except my embryo lady ballindine     i think i have done my business a little in the veni vidi vici    style what has effected the change in lord cashels views i need    not trouble myself to guess you will soon learn all about it from    miss wyndham     i will not in a letter express my admiration c c c but i    will proclaim in connaught on my return that so worthy a bride was    never yet brought down to the far west lord cashel will of course    have some pet bishop or dean to marry you but after what has    passed i shall certainly demand the privilege of christening the    heir     believe me dear frank     your affectionate friend     george armstrong   lord cashels letter was as follows it cost his lordship three hours to compose and was twice copied i trust therefore it is a fair specimen of what a nobleman ought to write on such an occasion      grey abbey april 1844     my dear lord     circumstances to which i rejoice that i need not now more    particularly allude made your last visit at my house a disagreeable    one to both of us the necessity under which i then laboured of    communicating to your lordship a decision which was likely to be    inimical to your happiness but to form which my duty imperatively    directed me was a source of most serious inquietude to my mind i    now rejoice that that decision was so painful to youhas been so    lastingly painful as i trust i may measure your gratification at a    renewal of your connection with my family by the acuteness of the    sufferings which an interruption of that connexion has occasioned    you     i have i can assure you my lord received much pleasure from the    visit of your very estimable friend the reverend mr armstrong and    it is no slight addition to my gratification on this occasion to    find your most intimate friendship so well bestowed i have had much    unreserved conversation today with mr armstrong and i am led by    him to believe that i may be able to induce you to give lady cashel    and myself the pleasure of your company at grey abbey we shall be    truly delighted to see your lordship and we sincerely hope that the    attractions of grey abbey may be such as to induce you to prolong    your visit for some time     perhaps it might be unnecessary for me now more explicitly to allude    to my ward but still i cannot but think that a short but candid    explanation of the line of conduct i have thought it my duty to    adopt may prevent any disagreeable feeling between us should you    as i sincerely trust you will do us the pleasure of joining our    family circle i must own my dear lord that a few months since i    feared you were wedded to the expensive pleasures of the turfyour    acceptance of the office of steward at the curragh meetings    confirmed the reports which reached me from various quarters my    wards fortune was then not very considerable and actuated by an    uncles affection for his niece as well as a guardians caution for    his ward i conceived it my duty to ascertain whether a withdrawal    from the engagement in contemplation between miss wyndham and    yourself would be detrimental to her happiness i found that my    wards views agreed with my own she thought her own fortune    insufficient seeing that your habits were then expensive and    perhaps not truly knowing the intensity of her own affection she    coincided in my views you are acquainted with the result these    causes have operated in inducing me to hope that i may still welcome    you by the hand as my dear nieces husband her fortune is very    greatly increased your character isi will not say alteredis now    fixed and established and lastly and chiefly i findi blush my    lord to tell a ladys secretthat my wards happiness still    depends on you     i am sure my dear lord i need not say more we shall be delighted    to see you at your earliest convenience we wish that you could have    come to us before your friend left but i regret to learn from him    that his parochial duties preclude the possibility of his staying    with us beyond thursday     i shall anxiously wait for your reply in the meantime i beg to    assure you with the joint kind remembrances of all our party that    i am     most faithfully yours     cashel   mr armstrong descended to the drawingroom before dinner looking most respectable with a stiff white tie and the new suit expressly prepared for the occasion he was introduced to lady cashel and lady selina as a valued friend of lord ballindine and was received by the former at least in a most flattering manner lady selina had hardly reconciled herself to the return of lord ballindine it was from no envy at her cousins happiness she was really too highminded and too falsely proud also to envy anyone but it was the harsh conviction of her mind that no duties should be disregarded and that all duties were disagreeable she was always opposed to the doing of anything which appeared to be the especial wish of the person consulting her because it would be agreeable she judged that it would be wrong she was most sincerely anxious for her poor dependents but she tormented them most cruelly when biddy finn wished to marry lady selina told her it was her duty to put a restraint on her inclinations and ultimately prevented her though there was no objection on earth to tony mara and when the widow cullen wanted to open a little shop for soap and candles having eight pounds ten shillings left to stock it after the wake and funeral were over lady selina told the widow it was her duty to restrain her inclination and she did so and the eight pounds ten shillings drifted away in quarters of tea and most probably half noggins of whiskey  in the same way she could not bring herself to think that fanny was doing right in following the bent of her dearest wishesin marrying this man she loved so truly she was weak she was giving way to temptation she was going back from her word she was she said giving up her claim to that high standard of feminine character which it should be the proudest boast of a woman to maintain  it was in vain that her mother argued the point with her in her own way but why shouldnt she marry him my dear said the countess when they love each otherand now theres plenty of money and all that and your papa thinks its all right i declare i cant see the harm of it  i dont say theres harm mother said lady selina not absolute harm but theres weakness she had ceased to esteem lord ballindine  ah but my dear she very soon began to esteem him again poor dear she didnt know how well she loved him  she ought to have known mammato have known well before she rejected him but having rejected him no power on earth should have induced her to name him or even to think of him again she should have been dead to him and he should have been the same as dead to her  well i dont know said the countess but im sure i shall be delighted to see anybody happy in the house again and i always liked lord ballindine myself there was never any trouble about his dinners or anything  and lady cashel was delighted the grief she had felt at the abrupt termination of all her hopes with regard to her son had been too much for her she had been unable even to mind her worstedwork and griffiths had failed to comfort her but from the moment that her husband had told her with many hems and haws that mr armstrong had arrived to repeat lord ballindines proposal and that he had come to consult her about again asking his lordship to grey abbey she became happy and lighthearted and before griffiths had left her for the night she had commenced her consultations as to the preparations for the wedding     xxxviii  wait till i tell you   there was no one at dinner that first evening but mr armstrong and the family circle and the parson certainly felt it dull enough fanny naturally was rather silent lady selina did not talk a great deal the countess reiterated twenty times the pleasure she had in seeing him at grey abbey and asked one or two questions as to the quantity of flannel it took to make petticoats for the old women in his parish but to make up the rest lord cashel talked incessantly he wished to show every attention to his guest and he crammed him with ecclesiastical conversation till mr armstrong felt that poor as he was and much as his family wanted the sun of lordly favour he would not give up his little living down in connaught where at any rate he could do as he pleased to be domestic chaplain to lord cashel with a salary of a thousand ayear  the next morning was worse and the whole of the long day was insufferable he endeavoured to escape from his noble friend into the demesne where he might have explored the fox coverts and ascertained something of the sporting capabilities of the country but lord cashel would not leave him alone for an instant and he had not only to endure the earls tediousness but also had to assume a demeanour which was not at all congenial to his feelings lord cashel would talk church and ultraprotestantism to him and descanted on the abominations of the national system and the glories of sundayschools now mr armstrong had no leaning to popery and had nothing to say against sunday schools but he had not one in his own parish in which by the bye he was the father of all the protestant children to be found therewithout the slightest slur upon his reputation be it said lord cashel totally mistook his character and mr armstrong did not know how to set him right and at five oclock he went to dress more tired than he ever had been after hunting all day and then riding home twelve miles on a wet dark night with a lame horse  to do honour to her guest lady cashel asked mr ojoscelyn the rector together with his wife and daughters to dine there on the second day and mr armstrong though somewhat afraid of brother clergymen was delighted to hear that they were coming anything was better than another têteàtête with the ponderous earl there were no other neighbours near enough to grey abbey to be asked on so short a notice but the rector his wife and their daughters entered the diningroom punctually at halfpast six  the character and feelings of mr ojoscelyn were exactly those which the earl had attributed to mr armstrong he had been an orangeman 52 and was a most ultra and even furious protestant he was by principle a charitable man to his neighbours but he hated popery and he carried the feeling to such a length that he almost hated papists he had not generally speaking a bad opinion of human nature but he would not have considered his life or property safe in the hands of any roman catholic he pitied the ignorance of the heathen the credulity of the mahommedan the desolateness of the jew even the infidelity of the atheist but he execrated abhorred and abominated the church of rome anathema maranatha 53 get thee from me thou child of satango out into utter darkness thou worker of iniquityinto everlasting lakes of fiery brimstone thou doer of the devils workthou false prophetthou ravenous wolf such was the language of his soul at the sight of a priest such would have been the language of his tongue had not as he thought evil legislators given a licence to falsehood in his unhappy country and rendered it impossible for a true churchman openly to declare the whole truth       footnote 52 orangemana member of the orange order a militant                    irish protestant organization founded in 1746 and                    named after william of orange who in 1688 deposed                    his fatherinlaw catholic king james ii became                    king william iii and helped establish protestant                    faith as a prerequisite for succession to the                    english throne the orange order is still exists                    and remains rabidly anticatholic       footnote 53 anathema maranathaan extreme form of                    excommunication from the catholic church formulated                    by the fathers of the fourth council of toledo                    the person so excommunicated is also condemned to                    damnation at the second coming  but though mr ojoscelyn did not absolutely give utterance to such imprecations as these against the wolves who as he thought destroyed the lambs of his flockor rather turned his sheep into foxesyet he by no means concealed his opinion or hid his light under a bushel he spent his lifean eager anxious hardworking life in denouncing the scarlet woman of babylon and all her abominations and he did so in season and out of season in town and in country in public and in private from his own pulpit and at other peoples tables in highways and byways both to friendswho only partly agreed with him and to strangers who did not agree with him at all he totally disregarded the feelings of his auditors he would make use of the same language to persons who might in all probability be romanists as he did to those whom he knew to be protestants he was a most zealous and conscientious but a most indiscreet servant of his master he made many enemies but few converts he rarely convinced his opponents but often disgusted his own party he had been a constant speaker at public meetings an orator at the rotunda and on one occasion at exeter hall but even his own friends the ultra protestants found that he did the cause more harm than good and his public exhibitions had been as much as possible discouraged apart from his fanatical enthusiasm he was a good man of pure life and simple habits and rejoiced exceedingly that in the midst of the laxity in religious opinions which so generally disfigured the age his wife and his children were equally eager and equally zealous with himself in the service of their great master  a beneficed clergyman from the most benighted that is most papistical portion of connaught would be sure thought mr ojoscelyn to have a fellowfeeling with him to sympathise with his wailings and to have similar woes to communicate  how many protestants have you said he to mr armstrong in the drawingroom a few minutes after they had been introduced to each other i had two hundred and seventy in the parish on new years day and since that weve had two births and a very proper church of england policeserjeant has been sent here in place of a horrid papist weve a great gain in serjeant woody my lord  in one way we certainly have mr ojoscelyn said the earl i wish all the police force were protestants i think they would be much more effective but serjeant carroll was a very good man you know he was removed from hence on his promotion  i know he was my lordjust to please the priests just because he was a papist do you think there was a single thing done or a word said at petty sessions but what father flannery knew all about ityes every word when did the police ever take any of father flannerys own people  didnt serjeant carroll take that horrible man leary that robbed the old widow that lived under the bridge said the countess  true my lady he did said mr ojoscelyn but youll find if you inquire that leary hadnt paid the priest his dues nor yet his brother how a protestant government can reconcile it to their consciencehow they can sleep at night after pandering to the priests as they daily do i cannot conceive how many protestants did you say you have mr armstrong  were not very strong down in the west mr ojoscelyn said the other parson there are usually two or three in the kellys court pew the vicarage pew musters pretty well for mrs armstrong and five of the children are always there then there are usually two policemen and the clerk though by the bye he doesnt belong to the parish i borrowed him from claremorris  mr ojoscelyn gave a look of horror and astonishment  i can however make a boast which perhaps you cannot mr joscelyn all my parishioners are usually to be seen in church and if one is absent im able to miss him  it must paralyse your efforts preaching to such a congregation said the other  do not disparage my congregation said mr armstrong laughing they are friendly and neighbourly if not important in point of numbers and if i wanted to fill my church the roman catholics think so well of me that theyd flock in crowds there if i asked them and the priest would show them the wayfor any special occasion i mean if the bishop came to see me or anything of that kind  mr ojoscelyn was struck dumb and indeed he would have had no time to answer if the power of speech had been left to him for the servant announced dinner  the conversation was a little more general during dinnertime but after dinner the parish clergyman returned to another branch of his favourite subject perhaps he thought that mr armstrong was himself not very orthodox or perhaps that it was useless to enlarge on the abominations of babylon to a protestant peer and a protestant parson but on this occasion he occupied himself with the temporal iniquities of the roman catholics the trial of oconnell and his fellowprisoners had come to an end and he and they with one exception had just commenced their period of imprisonment the one exception was a clergyman who had been acquitted he had in some way been connected with mr ojoscelyns parish and as the parish priest and most of his flock were hot repealers there was a good deal of excitement on the occasionrejoicings at the priests acquittal and howlings yellings and murmurings at the condemnation of the others  weve fallen on frightful days mr armstrong said mr ojoscelyn frightful lawless dangerous days  we must take them as we find them mr ojoscelyn  doubtless mr armstrong doubtless and i acknowledge his infinite wisdom who for his own purposes now allows sedition to rear her head unchecked and falsehood to sit in the high places they are indeed dangerous days when the sympathy of government is always with the evil doers and the religion of the state is deserted by the crown  why god bless me mr ojoscelynthe queen hasnt turned papist and the repealers are all in prison or soon will be there  i dont mean the queen i believe she is very good i believe she is a sincere protestant god bless her and mr ojoscelyn in his loyalty drank a glass of port wine but i mean her advisers they do not dare protect the protestant faith they do not dare secure the tranquillity of the country  are not oconnell and the whole set under conviction at this moment im no politician myself but the only question seems to be whether they havent gone a step too far  why did they let that priest escape them said mr ojoscelyn  i suppose he was not guilty said mr armstrong at any rate you had a staunch protestant jury  i tell you the priests are at the head of it all oconnell would be nothing without them he is only their creature the truth is the government did not dare to frame an indictment that would really lead to the punishment of a priest the government is truckling to the false hierarchy of rome look at oxforda jesuitical seminary devoted to the secret propagation of romish falsehoodgo into the churches of england and watch their bowings their genuflexions their crosses and their candles see the demeanour of their apostate clergy look into their private oratories see their redlettered prayerbooks their crucifixes and images and then can you doubt that the most dreadful of all prophecies is about to be accomplished  but i have not been into their closets mr ojoscelyn nor yet into their churches lately and therefore i have not seen these things nor have i seen anybody who has have you seen crucifixes in the rooms of church of england clergymen or candles on the altarsteps of english churches  god forbid that i should willingly go where such things are to be seen but of the fearful fact there is unfortunately no doubt and then as to the state of the country we have nothing round us but anarchy and misrule my life mr armstrong has not been safe any day this week past  good heaven mr ojoscelynyour life not safe i thought you were as quiet here in kildare as we are in mayo  wait till i tell you mr armstrong you know this priest whom they have let loose to utter more seditionhe was coadjutor to the priest in this parish  was he the people are not attacking you i suppose because hes let loose  wait till i tell you no the people are mad because oconnell and his myrmidons are to be locked up and mingled with their fury on this head are their insane rejoicings at the escape of this priest they are thereforeor were till saturday last howling for joy and for grief at the same time oh such horrid howls mr armstrong i declare mr armstrong i have trembled for my children this week past  the earl who well knew mr ojoscelyn and the nature of his grievances had heard all these atrocities before and not being very excited by their interest had continued sipping his claret in silence till he began to doze and by the time the worthy parson had got to the climax of his misery the nobleman was fast asleep  you dont mean that the people made any attack on the parsonage said mr armstrong  wait till i tell you mr armstrong replied the other on thursday morning last they all heard that oconnell was a convicted felon  conspirator i believe mr ojoscelyn  conspiracy is felony mr armstrongand that their priest had been let loose it was soon evident that no work was to be done that day they assembled about the roads in groups at the chapeldoor at priest flannerys house at the teetotal readingroom as they call it where the people drink cordial made of whiskey and disturb the neighbourhood with cracked horns and we heard that a public demonstration was to be made  was it a demonstration of joy or of grief  both mr armstrong it was mixed they were to shout and dance for joy about father tyrrel and howl and curse for grief about oconnell and they did shout and howl with a vengeance all thursday you would have thought that a legion of devils had been let loose into kilcullen  but did they commit any personal outrages mr ojoscelyn  wait till i tell you i soon saw how the case was going to be and i determined to be prepared i armed myself mr armstrong and so did mrs ojoscelyn mrs ojoscelyn is a most determined womana woman of great spirit we were resolved to protect our daughters and our infants from illusage as long as god should leave us the power to do so we both armed ourselves with pistols and i can assure you that as far as ammunition goes we were prepared to give them a hot reception  dear me this must have been very unpleasant to mrs ojoscelyn  oh shes a woman of great nerve mr armstrong mary is a woman of very great nerve i can assure you we shall never forget that thursday night about seven in the evening it got darkish but the horrid yells of the wild creatures had never ceased for one halfhour and a little after seven twenty different bonfires illuminated the parish there were bonfires on every side of us huge masses of blazing turf were to be seen scattered through the whole country  did they burn any thing except the turf mr ojoscelyn  wait till i tell you mr armstrong i shall never forget that night we neither of us once lay down no not for a moment about eight the children were put to bed but with their clothes and shoes on for there was no knowing at what moment and in how sudden a way the poor innocents might be called up my daughters behaved admirably they remained quite quiet in the drawingroom till about eleven when we had evening worship and then they retired to rest their mother however insisted that they should not take off their petticoats or stockings at about one we went to the halldoor it was then bright moonlightbut the flames of the surrounding turf overpowered the moon the whole horizon was one glare of light  but were not the police about mr ojoscelyn  oh they were about to be sure poor men but what could they do the government now licenses every outrage  but what did the people do said mr armstrong  wait till i tell you they remained up all night and so did we you may be sure mary did not rise from her chair once that night without a pistol in her hand we heard the sounds of their voices continually close to the parsonage gate we could see them in the road from the windowscrowds of themmen women and children and still they continued shouting the next morning they were a little more quiet but still the parish was disturbed nobody was at work and men and women stood collected together in the roads but as soon as it was dusk the shoutings and the bonfires began again and again did i and mrs ojoscelyn prepare for a night of anxious watching we sat up all friday night mr armstrong  with the pistols again  indeed we did and lucky for us that we did so had they not known that we were prepared i am convinced the house would have been attacked our daughters sat with us this night and we were so far used to the state of disturbance that we were able to have a little supper  you must have wanted that i think  indeed we did about four in the morning i dropped asleep on the sofa but mary never closed her eyes  did they come into the garden at all or near the house  no they did not and i am very thankful they refrained from doing so for i determined to act promptly mr armstrong and so was marythat is mrs ojoscelyn we were both determined to fire if we found our premises invaded thank god the miscreants did not come within the gate  you did not suffer much then except the anxiety mr ojoscelyn  god was very merciful and protected us but who can feel safe living in such times and among such a people and it all springs from rome the scarlet woman is now in her full power and in her full deformity she was smitten down for a while but has now risen again for a while the right foot of truth was on her neck for a while she lay prostrated before the strength of those who by gods grace had prevailed against her but the latter prophecies which had been revealed to us are now about to be accomplished it is well for those who comprehend the signs of the coming time  suppose we join the ladies said the earl awakened by the sudden lull in mr ojoscelyns voice but wont you take a glass of madeira first mr armstrong  mr armstrong took his glass of madeira and then went to the ladies and the next morning left grey abbey for his own parish well thought he to himself as he was driven through the park in the earls gig im very glad i came here for franks sake ive smoothed his way to matrimony and a fortune but i dont know anything which would induce me to stay a week at grey abbey the earl is badnearly unbearable but the parsonid sooner by half be a roman myself than think so badly of my neighbours as he does many a time since has he told in connaught how mr ojoscelyn and mary his wife sat up two nights running armed to the teeth to protect themselves from the noisy repealers of kilcullen  mr armstrong arrived safely at his parsonage and the next morning he rode over to kellys court but lord ballindine was not there he had started for grey abbey almost immediately on receiving the two letters which we have given and he and his friend had passed each other on the road     xxxix  it never rains but it pours   when frank had read his two letters from grey abbey he was in such a state of excitement as to be unable properly to decide what he would immediately do his first idea was to gallop to tuam as fast as his best horse would carry him to take four horses there and not to stop one moment till he found himself at grey abbey but a little consideration showed him that this would not do he would not find horses ready for him on the road he must take some clothes with him and it would be only becoming in him to give the earl some notice of his approach so he at last made up his mind to postpone his departure for a few hours  he was however too much overcome with joy to be able to do anything rationally his anger against the earl totally evaporated indeed he only thought of him now as a man who had a house in which he could meet his love he rushed into the drawingroom where his mother and sisters were sitting and with the two letters open in his hand proclaimed his intention of leaving home that day  goodness gracious frank and where are you going said mrs okelly  to grey abbey  no said augusta jumping up from her chair  i am so glad shouted sophy throwing down her portion of the worstedwork sofa  you have made up your difference then with miss wyndham said the anxious mother i am so glad my own dear good sensible frank  i never had any difference with fanny said he i was not able to explain all about it nor can i now it was a crotchet of the earlsonly some nonsense however im off nowi cant wait a day for i mean to write to say i shall be at grey abbey the day after tomorrow and i must go by dublin i shall be off in a couple of hours so for heavens sake sophy look sharp and put up my things  the girls both bustled out of the room and frank was following them but his mother called him back when is it to be frank come tell me something about it i never asked any questions when i thought the subject was a painful one  god bless you mother you never did but i can tell you nothingonly the stupid old earl has begged me to go there at once fanny must settle the time herself therell be settlements and lawyers work  thats true my love a hundred thousand pounds in ready cash does want looking after but look here my dear fanny is of age isnt she  she is mother  well now frank take my advice theyll want to tie up her money in all manner of ways so as to make it of the least possible use to you or to her either they always do theyre never contented unless they lock up a girls money so that neither she nor her husband can spend the principal or the interest dont let them do it frank of course she will be led by you let them settle whatever is fair on her but dont let them bother the money so that you cant pay off the debts itll be a grand thing frank to redeem the property  frank hemmed and hawed and said hed consult his lawyer in dublin before the settlements were signed but declared that he was not going to marry fanny wyndham for her money  thats all very well frank said the mother but you know you could not marry her without the money and mind its now or never think what a thing it would be to have the property unencumbered  the son hurried away to throw himself at the feet of his mistress and the mother remained in her drawingroom thinking with delight on the renovated grandeur of the family and of the decided lead which the okellys would again be able to take in connaught  fannys joy was quite equal to that of her lover but it was not shown quite so openly her aunt congratulated her most warmly kissed her twenty times called her her own dear darling niece and promised her to love her husband and to make him a purse if she could get griffiths to teach her that new stitch it looked so easy she was sure she could learn it and it wouldnt tease her eyes lady selina also wished her joy but she did it very coldly though very sensibly  believe me my dear fanny i am glad you should have the wish of your heart there were obstacles to your union with lord ballindine which appeared to be insurmountable and i therefore attempted to wean you from your love i hope he will prove worthy of that love and that you may never have cause to repent of your devotion to him you are going greatly to increase your cares and troubles may god give you strength to bear them and wisdom to turn them to advantage  the earl made a very long speech to her in which there were but few pauses and not one full stop fanny was not now inclined to quarrel with him and he quite satisfied himself that his conduct throughout towards his ward had been dignified prudent consistent and disinterested  these speeches and congratulations all occurred during the period of mr armstrongs visit and fanny heard nothing more about her lover till the third morning after that gentlemans departure the earl announced then on entering the breakfastroom that he had that morning received a communication from lord ballindine and that his lordship intended reaching grey abbey that day in time for dinner  fanny felt herself blush but she said nothing lady selina regretted that he had had a very wet day yesterday and hoped he would have a fine day today and lady cashel was overcome at the reflection that she had no one to meet him at dinner and that she had not yet suited herself with a cook  dear me exclaimed her ladyship i wish wed got this letter yesterday no one knows now beforehand when people are coming im sure it usent to be so i shall be so glad to see lord ballindine you know fanny he was always a great favourite of mine do you think selina the ojoscelyns would mind coming again without any notice im sure i dont knowi would not for the world treat lord ballindine shabbily but what can i do my dear  i think my lady we may dispense with any ceremony now with lord ballindine said the earl he will i am sure be delighted to be received merely as one of the family you need not mind asking the ojoscelyns today  do you think not well thats a great comfort besides lord ballindine never was particular but still fanny had i known he was coming so soon i would have had murray down from dublin again at once for mrs richards is not a good cook  during the remainder of the morning fanny was certainly very happy but she was very uneasy she hardly knew how to meet lord ballindine she felt that she had treated him badly though she had never ceased to love him dearly and she also thought she owed him much for his constancy it was so good of him to send his friend to herand one to whom her uncle could not refuse admission and then she thought she had treated mr armstrong haughtily and unkindly she had never thanked him for all the trouble he had taken she had never told him how very happy he had made her but she would do so at some future time when he should be an honoured and a valued guest in her own and her husbands house  but how should she receive her lover would they allow her to be alone with him if only for a moment at their first meeting oh how she longed for a confidante but she could not make a confidante of her cousin twice she went down to the drawingroom with the intention of talking of her love but lady selina looked so rigid and spoke so rigidly that she could not do it she said such commonplace things and spoke of lord ballindine exactly as she would of any other visitor who might have been coming to the house she did not confine herself to his eating and drinking as her mother did but she said hed find the house very dull she was afraidespecially as the shooting was all over and the hunting very nearly so that he would however probably be a good deal at the curragh races  fanny knew that her cousin did not mean to be unkind but there was no sympathy in her she could not talk to her of the only subject which occupied her thoughts so she retreated to her own room and endeavoured to compose herself as the afternoon drew on she began to wish that he was not coming till tomorrow she became very anxious she must see him somewhere before she dressed for dinner and she would not could not bring herself to go down into the drawingroom and shake hands with him when he came before her uncle her aunt and her cousin  she was still pondering on the subject when about four oclock in the afternoon she got a message from her aunt desiring her to go to her in her boudoir  thatll do griffiths said the countess as fanny entered her room you can come up when i ring sit down fanny sit down my dear i was thinking lord ballindine will soon be here  i suppose he will aunt in his letter to lord cashel he said hed be here before dinner  im sure hell be here soon dear me im so glad its all made up between you im sure fanny i hope and think and believe youll be very very happy  dear auntand fanny kissed lady cashel a word of kindness to her then seemed invaluable  it was so very proper in lord ballindine to give up his horses and all that sort of thing said the countess im sure i always said hed turn out just what he should be and he is so goodtempered i suppose dear youll go abroad the first thing  i havent thought of that yet aunt said fanny trying to smile  oh of course you will youll go to the rhine and switzerland and como and rome and those sort of places itll be very nice we went thereyour uncle and iand it was delightful only i used to be very tired it wasnt then we went to rome though i remember now it was after adolphus was born poor adolphus and her ladyship sighed as her thoughts went back to the miseries of her eldest born but ill tell you why i sent for you my dear you know i must go downstairs to receive lord ballindine and tell him how glad i am that hes come back and im sure i am very glad that hes coming and your uncle will be there but i was thinking youd perhaps sooner see him first alone youll be a little flurried my dearthats natural so if you like you can remain up here my dear in my room quiet and comfortable by yourself and griffiths shall show lord ballindine upstairs as soon as he leaves the drawingroom  how very very kind of you dear aunt said fanny relieved from her most dreadful difficulty and so it was arranged lady cashel went down into the drawingroom to await her guest and fanny brought her book into her aunts boudoir and pretended she would read till lord ballindine disturbed her  i need hardly say that she did not read much she sat there over her aunts fire waiting to catch the sound of the wheels on the gravel at the front door at one moment she would think that he was never comingthe time appeared to be so long and then again when she heard any sound which might be that of his approach she would again wish to have a few minutes more to herself  at length however she certainly did hear him there was the quick rattle of the chaise over the gravel becoming quicker and quicker till the vehicle stopped with that kind of plunge which is made by no other animal than a posthorse and by him only at his arrival at the end of a stage then the steps were let down with a crashshe would not go to the window or she might have seen him she longed to do so but it appeared so undignified she sat quite still in her chair but she heard his quick step at the hail door she was sureshe could have sworn to his stepand then she heard the untying of cords and pulling down of luggage lord ballindine was again in the house and the dearest wish of her heart was accomplished  she felt that she was trembling she had not yet made up her mind how she would receive himwhat she would first say to himand certainly she had no time to do so now she got up and looked in her aunts pierglass it was more a movement of instinct than one of premeditation but she thought she had never seen herself look so wretchedly she had however but little time either for regret or improvement on that score for there were footsteps in the corridor he couldnt have stayed a moment to speak to anyone downstairshowever there he certainly was she heard griffiths voice in the passage this way my lordin my ladys boudoir and then the door opened and in a moment she was in her lovers arms  my own fannyonce more my own  oh frank dear frank  lord ballindine was only ten minutes late in coming down to dinner and miss wyndham not about half an hour which should be considered as showing great moderation on her part for of course frank kept her talking a great deal longer than he should have done and then she not only had to dress but to go through many processes with her eyes to obliterate the trace of tears she was however successful for she looked very beautiful when she came down and so dignified so composed so quiet in her happiness and yet so very happy in her quietness fanny was anything but a hypocrite she had hardly a taint of hypocrisy in her composition but her looks seldom betrayed her feelings there was a majesty of beauty about her a look of serenity in her demeanour which in public made her appear superior to all emotion  frank seemed to be much less at his ease he attempted to chat easily with the countess and to listen pleasantly to the wouldbe witticisms of the earl but he was not comfortable he did not amalgamate well with the family had there been a larger party he could have talked all dinnertime to his love but as it was he hardly spoke a word to her during the ceremony and indeed but few during the evening he did sit next to her on the sofa to be sure and watched the lace she was working but he could not talk unreservedly to her when old lady cashel was sitting close to him on the other side and lady selina on a chair immediately opposite and then it is impossible to talk to ones mistress in an ordinary voice on ordinary subjects when one has not seen her for some months a lover is never so badly off as in a family party a têteàtête or a large assembly are what suit him best he is equally at his ease in either but he is completely out of his element in a family party after all lady cashel was right it would have been much better to have asked the ojoscelyns  the next morning frank underwent a desperate interview in the bookroom his head was dizzy before lord cashel had finished half of what he had to say he commenced by pointing out with what perfect uprightness and wisdom he had himself acted with regard to his ward and lord ballindine did not care to be at the trouble of contradicting him he then went to the subject of settlements and money matters professed that he had most unbounded confidence in his young friends liberality integrity and good feeling that he would be glad to listen and he had no doubt to accede to any proposals made by him that he was quite sure lord ballindine would make no proposal which was not liberal fair and most proper and he said a great deal more of the kind and then himself proposed to arrange his wards fortune in such a way as to put it quite beyond her future husbands control on this subject however frank rather nonplussed the earl by proposing nothing and agreeing to nothing but simply saying that he would leave the whole matter in the hands of the lawyers  quite right my lord quite right said lord cashel my men of business green and grogram will manage all that they know all about fannys property they can draw out the settlements and grogram can bring them here and we can execute them thatll be the simplest way  ill write to mr cummings then and tell him to wait on messrs green and grogram cummings is a very proper man he was recommended to me by guinness  oh ahyes your attorney you mean said the earl why yes that will be quite proper too of course mr cummings will see the necessity of absolutely securing miss wyndhams fortune  nothing further however was said between them on the subject and the settlements whatever was their purport were drawn out without any visible interference on the part of lord ballindine but mr grogram the attorney on his first visit to grey abbey on the subject had no difficulty in learning that miss wyndham was determined to have a will of her own in the disposition of her own money  fanny told her lover the whole episode of lord kilcullens offer to her but she told it in such a way as to redound rather to her cousins credit than otherwise she had learned to love him as a cousin and a friend and his illtimed proposal to her had not destroyed the feeling a woman can rarely be really offended at the expression of love unless it be from some one unfitted to match with her either in rank or age besides fanny thought that lord kilcullen had behaved generously to her when she so violently repudiated his love she believed that it had been sincere she had not even to herself accused him of meanness or treachery and she spoke of him as one to be pitied liked and regarded not as one to be execrated and avoided  and then she confessed to frank all her fears respecting himself how her heart would have broken had he taken her own rash word as final and so deserted her she told him that she had never ceased to love him for a day not even on that day when in her foolish spleen she had told her uncle she was willing to break off the match she owned to him all her troubles all her doubts how she had made up her mind to write to him but had not dared to do so lest his answer should be such as would kill her at once and then she prayed to be forgiven for her falseness for having consented even for a moment to forget the solemn vows she had so often repeated to him  frank stopped her again and again in her sweet confessions and swore the blame was only his he anathematised himself his horses and his friends for having caused a moments uneasiness to her but she insisted on receiving his forgiveness and he was obliged to say that he forgave her with all his follies and all his weakness lord ballindine was not of an unforgiving temperament he was too happy to be angry with any one now he forgave even lord cashel and had he seen lord kilcullen he would have been willing to give him his hand as to a brother  frank spent two or three delightful weeks basking in the sunshine of fannys love and lord cashels favour nothing could be more obsequiously civil than the earls demeanour now that the matter was decided every thing was to be done just as lord ballindine liked his taste was to be consulted in every thing the earl even proposed different visits to the curragh asked after the whereabouts of fin mcoul and brien boru and condescended pleasantly to inquire whether dot blake was prospering as usual with his favourite amusement  at length the day was fixed for the marriage it was to be in the pleasant sweetsmelling grateful month of maythe end of may and lord and lady ballindine were then to start for a summer tour as the countess had proposed to see the rhine and switzerland and rome and those sort of places and now invitations were sent far and wide to relatives and friends lord cashel had determined that the wedding should be a great concern the ruin of his son was to be forgotten in the marriage of his niece the bishop of maryborough was to come and marry them the ellisons were to come again and the fitzgeralds a duchess was secured though duchesses are scarce in ireland and great exertions were made to get at a royal prince who was commanding the forces in the west but the royal prince did not see why he should put himself to so much trouble and he therefore sent to say that he was very sorry but the peculiar features of the time made it quite impossible for him to leave his command even on so great a temptation and a paragraph consequently found its way into the papers very laudatory of his royal highnesss military energy and attention mrs okelly and her daughters received a very warm invitation which they were delighted to accept sophy and augusta were in the seventh heaven of happiness for they were to form a portion of the fair bevy of bridesmaids appointed to attend fanny wyndham to the altar frank rather pished and poohed at all these preparations of grandeur he felt that when the ceremony took place he would look like the ornamental calf in the middle of it but on the whole he bore his martyrdom patiently four spanking bays and a new chariot ordered from huttons on the occasion would soon carry him away from the worst part of it  lord cashel was in the midst of his glory he had got an occupation and he delighted in it lady selina performed her portion of the work with exemplary patience and attention she wrote all the orders to the tradesmen and all the invitations she even condescended to give advice to fanny about her dress and to griffiths about the arrangement of the rooms and tables but poor lady cashel worked the hardest of allher troubles had no end had she known what she was about to encounter when she undertook the task of superintending the arrangements for her nieces wedding she would never have attempted it she would never have entered into negotiations with that treacherous murraythat man cook in dublinbut have allowed mrs richards to have done her bestor her worstin her own simple way in spite of the duchess and the bishop and the hopes of a royal prince indulged in by lord cashel she did not dare to say as much to her husband but she confessed to griffiths that she was delighted when she heard his royal highness would not come she was sure his coming would not make dear fanny a bit happier and she really would not have known what to do with him after the married people were gone  frank received two letters from dot blake during his stay at grey abbey in the former he warmly congratulated him on his approaching nuptials and strongly commended him on his success in having arranged matters you never could have forgiven yourself he said had you allowed miss wyndhams splendid fortune to slip through your hands i knew you were not the man to make a vain boast of a girls love and i was therefore sure that you might rely on her affection i only feared you might let the matter go too far you know i strongly advised you not to marry twenty thousand pounds i am as strongly of opinion that you would be a fool to neglect to marry six times as much you see i still confine myself to the money part of the business as though the lady herself were of no value i dont think so however only i know you never would have lived happily without an easy fortune and then he spoke of brien boru and informed lord ballindine that that now celebrated nag was at the head of the list of the derby horses that it was all but impossible to get any odds against him at allthat the whole betting world were talking of nothing else that three conspiracies had been detected the object of which was to make him safethat is to make him very unsafe to his friends that scotts foreman had been offered two thousand to dose him and that scott himself slept in the stable with him every night to prevent anything like false play  the second letter was written by dot at epsom on the 4th of may thirty minutes after the great race had been run it was very short and shall therefore be given entire      epsom derby day     race just over     god bless you my dear boybrien has done the trick and done it    well butler rode him beautifully but he did not want any riding    hes the kindest beast ever had a saddle on the stakes are close    on four thousand pounds your share will do well to pay the    posters c for yourself and my lady on your wedding trip i win    wellvery well but i doubt the settling we shall have awful faces    at the corner next week youll probably have heard all about it by    express before you get this     in greatest haste yours     w blake   the next week the following paragraph appeared in bells life in london      it never rains but it pours it appears pretty certain now that    brien boru is not the property of the gentleman in whose name he has    run but that he is owned by a certain noble lord well known on    the irish turf who has lately however been devoting his time to    pursuits more pleasant and more profitable than the cares of the    stablepleasant and profitable as it doubtless must be to win    the best race of the year the pickup on the derby is about four    thousand pounds and brien boru is certainly the best horse of his    year but lord ballindines matrimonial pickup is we are told a    clear quarter of a million and those who are good judges declare    that no more beautiful woman than the future lady ballindine will    have graced the english court for many a long year his lordship    on the whole is not doing badly   lord cashel also congratulated frank on his success on the turf in spite of the very decided opinion he had expressed on the subject when he was endeavouring to throw him on one side  my dear ballindine he said i wish you joy with all my heart a most magnificent animal im told is brien and still partly your own property you say well its a great triumph to beat those english lads on their own ground isnt it and thorough irish blood toothorough irish blood he has the paddy whack strain in him through the damthe very best blood in ireland you know my mare dignity that won the oaks in 29 was by chanticleer out of floribel by paddy whack you say you mean to give up the turf and you know ive done so too but if you ever do change your mindshould you ever run horses againtake my advice and stick to the paddy whack strain theres no beating the real paddy whack blood  on the 21st of may 1844 lord ballindine and fanny wyndham were married the bishop turned em off iligant as a wag said in the servants hall there was a long account of the affair in the morning post of the day there were eight bridesmaids all of whom it was afterwards remarked were themselves married within two years of the time an omen which was presumed to promise much continued happiness to lord and lady ballindine and all belonging to them  murray the man cook did come down from dublin just in time but he behaved very badly he got quite drunk on the morning of the wedding he however gave richards an opportunity of immortalising herself she behaved on the trying occasion so well that she is now confirmed in her situation and lady cashel has solemnly declared that she will never again on any account be persuaded to allow a man cook to enter the house  lady selinashe would not officiate as one of the bridesmaidsis still unmarried but her temper is not thereby soured nor her life embittered she is active energetic and good as ever and as ever cold hard harsh and dignified lord kilcullen has hardly been heard of since his departure from grey abbey it is known that he is living at baden but no one knows on what his father never mentions his name his mother sometimes talks of poor adolphus but if he were dead and buried he could not give less trouble to the people of grey abbey  no change has occurred or is likely to take place in the earl himselfnor is any desirable how could he change for the better how could he bear his honours with more dignity or grace his high position with more decorum every year since the marriage of his niece he has sent lord and lady ballindine an invitation to grey abbey but there has always been some insuperable impediment to the visit a child had just been born or was just going to be born or mrs okelly was ill or one of the miss okellys was going to be married it was very unfortunate but lord and lady ballindine were never able to get as far as grey abbey  great improvements have been effected at kellys court old buildings have been pulled down and additions built up a great many thousand young trees have been planted and some miles of new roads and walks constructed the place has quite an altered appearance and though connaught is still connaught and county mayo is the poorest part of it lady ballindine does not find kellys court unbearable she has three children already and doubtless will have many more her nursery therefore prevents her from being tormented by the weariness of the far west  lord ballindine himself is very happy he still has the hounds and maintains in the three counties round him the sporting preeminence which has for so many years belonged to his family but he has no racehorses his friend dot purchased the lot of them out and out soon after the famous derby and a very good bargain for himself he is said to have made he is still intimate with lord ballindine and always spends a fortnight with him at kellys court during the huntingseason  sophy okelly married a blake and augusta married a dillon and as they both live within ten miles of kellys court and their husbands are related to all the blakes and all the dillons and as ballindine himself is the head of all the kellys there is a rather strong clan of them about fiveandtwenty cousins muster together in red coats and topboots every tuesday and friday during the huntingseason it would hardly be wise in that country to quarrel with a kelly a dillon or a blake     xl  conclusion   we must now return to dunmore and say a few parting words of the kellys and anty lynch and then our task will be finished  it will be remembered that that demon of dunmore barry lynch has been made to vanish like lord kilcullen he has gone abroad he has settled himself at an hotel at boulogne and is determined to enjoy himself arrangements have been made about the property certainly not very satisfactory to barry because they are such as make it necessary for him to pay his own debts but they still leave him sufficient to allow of his indulging in every vice congenial to his taste and if he doesnt get fleeced by cleverer rogues than himselfwhich however will probably be the casehe will have quite enough to last him till he has drunk himself to death  after his departure there was nothing to delay antys marriage but her own rather slow recovery she has no other relatives to ask no other friends to consult now that barry was gone she was entirely her own mistress and was quite willing to give up her dominion over herself to martin kelly she had however been greatly shaken not by illness only but by fear alsoher fears of barry and for barry she still dreamed while asleep and thought while awake of that horrid night when he crept up to her room and swore that he would murder her this and what she had suffered since had greatly weakened her and it was some time before doctor colligan would pronounce her convalescent at last however the difficulties were overcome all arrangements were completed anty was well the property was settled martin was impatient and the day was fixed  there was no bishop no duchess no mancook at the weddingparty given on the occasion by mrs kelly nevertheless it was in its way quite as grand an affair as that given by the countess the widow opened her heart and opened her house her great enemy barry lynch was goneclean beaten out of the fieldthoroughly vanquished as far as ireland was concerned annihilated and therefore any one else in the three counties was welcome to share her hospitality oh the excess of delight the widow experienced in speaking of barry to one of her gossips as the poor misfortunate crature daly the attorney was especially invited and he came moylan also was asked but he stayed away doctor colligan was there in great feather had it not been for him there would probably have been no wedding at all it would have been a great thing if lord ballindine could have been got to grace the party though only for ten minutes but he was at that time in switzerland with his own bride so he could not possibly do so  well maam said mrs costelloe the grocers wife from tuam an old friend of the widow who had got into a corner with her to have a little chat and drink halfapint of porter before the ceremonyand im shure i wish you joy of the marriage faux im tould its nigh to five hundred ayear miss anty has may god bless and incrase it well martin has his own luck but he desarves it he desarves it  i dont know so much about luck thin mrs costelloe said the widow who still professed to think that her son gave quite as much as he got in marrying anty lynch i dont know so much about luck martin was very well as he was his poor father didnt lave him that way that he need be looking to a wife for mains the lord be praised  and thats thrue too mrs kelly said the other but miss antys fortune aint a bad step to a young man neither why there wont be a young gintleman within tinno not within forty miles more respectable than martin kelly that is regarding mains  and you neednt stop there maam neither you may say the very same regarding characther tooand family too glory be to the virgin id like to know where some of their ancesthers wor when the kellys of ould wor ruling the whole counthry  thrue for you my dear id like to know indeed theres nothing afther all like blood and a good characther but is it thrue mrs kelly that martin will live up in the big house yonder  where should a man live thin mrs costelloe when he gets married but jist in his own house why for should he not live there  thats thrue agin to be shure but yet only to think martinliving in ould sim lynchs big house i wondther what ould sim would say hisself av he could only come back and see it  ill tell you what hed say thin av he tould the thruth hed say there was an honest man living there which wor niver the case as long as any of his own breed was in itbarring anty i main shes honest and thrue the lord be good to her the poor thing but the porters not to your liking mrs costelloeyoure not tasting it at all this morning  no one could have been more humble and meek than was anty herself in the midst of her happiness she had no idea of taking on herself the airs of a fine lady or the importance of an heiress she had no wish to be thought a lady she had no wish for other friends than those of her husband and his family she had never heard of her brothers last horrible proposal to doctor colligan and of the manner in which his consent to her marriage had been obtained nor did martin intend that she should hear it she had merely been told that her brother had found that it was for his advantage to leave the neighbourhood altogether that he had given up all claim to the house and that his income was to be sent to him by a person appointed in the neighbourhood to receive it anty however before signing her own settlement was particularly careful that nothing should be done injurious to her brothers interest and that no unfair advantage should be taken of his absence  martin too was quiet enough on the occasion it was arranged that he and his wife and at any rate one of his sisters should live at dunmore house and that he should keep in his own hands the farm near dunmore which old sim had held as well as his own farm at toneroe but to tell the truth martin felt rather ashamed of his grandeur he would much have preferred building a nice snug little house of his own on the land he held under lord ballindine but he was told that he would be a fool to build a house on another mans ground when he had a very good one ready built on his own he gave way to such good advice but he did not feel at all happy at the idea and when going up to the house always felt an inclination to shirk in at the backway  but though neither the widow nor martin triumphed aloud at their worldly prosperity the two girls made up for their quiescence they were full of nothing else their brothers fine houseantys great fortune their wealth prosperity and future station and happiness gave them subjects of delightful conversation among their friends meg moreover boasted that it was all her own doing that it was she who had made up the match that martin would never have thought of it but for hernor anty either for the matter of that  and will your mother be staying down at the shop always the same as iver said matilda nolan the daughter of the innkeeper at tuam  deed she says so then said jane in a tone of disappointment for her mothers pertinacity in adhering to the counter was at present the one misery of her life  and which of you will be staying here along with her dears said matilda shell be wanting one of you to be with her any ways  oh turn about i suppose said jane  shell not get much of my company any way said meg ive had enough of the nasty place and now martin has a dacent house to put over our heads and mainly through my mains i may say i dont see why im to be mewing myself up in such a hole as this theres room for her up in dunmore house and wilcome too let her come up there av she mains to demain herself by sticking down here she may stay by herself for me  but youll take your turn meg said jane  itll be a very little turn then said meg im sick of the nasty ould place fancy coming down here matilda to the tobacco and sugar after living up there a month or so with everything nice and comfortable and its only mothers whims for she dont want the shop anty begged and prayed of her for to come and live at dunmore house for good and all but no she says shell never live in any ones house that isnt her own  im not so any way said jane id be glad enough to live in another persons house av i liked it  ill go bail you would my dear said matilda willing enoughespecially john dolans  oh av i iver live in that itll be partly my own you know and maybe a girl might do worse  thats thrue dear said matilda but john dolans not so soft as to take any girl just as she stands what does your mother say about the money part of the business  and so the two friends put their heads together to arrange another wedding if possible  martin and anty did not go to visit switzerland or rome as soon as they were married but they took a bathinglodge at renvill near galway and with much difficulty persuaded mrs kelly to allow both her daughters to accompany them and very merry they all were anty soon became a different creature from what she ever had been she learned to be happy and gay to laugh and enjoy the sunshine of the world she had always been kind to others and now she had round her those who were kind and affectionate to her her manner of life was completely changed indeed life itself was an altered thing to her it was so new to her to have friends to be loved to be one of a family who regarded and looked up to her she hardly knew herself in her new happiness  they returned to dunmore in the early autumn and took up their residence at sim lynchs big house as had been arranged martin was very shy about it it was long before he talked about it as his house or his ground or his farm and it was long before he could find himself quite at home in his own parlour  many attempts were made to induce the widow to give up the inn and shift her quarters to the big house but in vain she declared that ould as she was she wouldnt think of making herself throublesome to young folks who maybe afther a bit would a dail sooner have her room than her company that she had always been misthress and mostly masther too in her own house glory be to god and that she meant to be so still and that poor as the place was she meant to call it her own she didnt think herself at all fit company for people who lived in grand houses and had their own demesnes and gardens and the rest of it she had always lived where money was to be made and she didnt see the sense of going in her old age to a place where the only work would be how to spend it some folks would find it was a dail asier to scatther it than it wor to put it together all this she said and a great deal more which had her character not been known would have led people to believe that her son was a spendthrift and that he and anty were commencing life in an expensive way and without means but then the widow kelly was known and her speeches were only taken at their value  she so far relaxed however that she spent every sunday at the house on which occasions she invariably dressed herself with all the grandeur she was able to display and passed the whole afternoon sitting on a sofa with her hands before her trying to look as became a lady enjoying herself in a fine drawingroom her sundays were certainly not the comfort to her which they had been when spent at the inn but they made her enjoy with a keener relish the feeling of perfect sovereignty when she returned to her own domains  i have nothing further to tell of mr and mrs kelly i believe doctor colligan has been once called in on an interesting occasion if not twice so it is likely that dunmore house will not be left without an heir  i have also learned on inquiry that margaret and jane kelly have both arranged their own affairs to their own satisfaction
