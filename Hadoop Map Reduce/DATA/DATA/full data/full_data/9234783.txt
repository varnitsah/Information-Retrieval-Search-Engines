9234783	abbeychurch  or  selfcontrol and selfconceit   by  charlotte m yonge   the author of the heir of redclyffe    second edition  the original printed text of this work is in the possession of the charlotte m yonge fellowship     never think yourself safe because you do your duty in ninetynine points it is the hundredth which is to be the ground of your selfdenial which must evidence or rather instance and realize your faith       newmans sermons     preface  rechauffes are proverbially dangerous but everyone runs into them sooner or later and the world has done me the kindness so often to inquire after my first crude attempt that after it has lain for many years out of print i have ventured to launch it once moreimperfections and allthough it is guilty of the error of pointing rather to a transient phase of difficulty than to a general principle  the wheels of this world go so quickly round that i have lived to see that it would have been wiser in the clergyman to have directed rather than obstructed the socalled march of intellect i have lived also to be somewhat ashamed of the exuberant outpouring of historical allusions which however were perfectly natural among the set of girls from whom my experience was taken but these defects as well as the more serious one of tyrannical aversion to vulgarity are too inherent in this tale to be removed and the real lesson intended to be conveyed of obedience and sincerity of course remains unchanged  the later story was a rather hasty attempt to parody the modern sensation novel as northanger abbey did the radclyffe school but it makes the mistake of having too real a mystery  however such as they are the two stories go forth in company trusting that they may not prove too utterly wearisome to be brought forward this second time                                      may 9th 1872      abbeychurch  or  selfcontrol and selfconceit     chapter i   one summer afternoon helen woodbourne returned from her daily walk with her sisters and immediately repaired to the schoolroom in order to put the finishing touches to a drawing with which she had been engaged during the greater part of the morning  she had not been long established there before her sister katherine came in and taking her favourite station leaning against the window shutter so as to command a good view of the street she began helen do you know that the consecration is to be on thursday the twentyeighth instead of the tuesday after  i know lizzie wished that it could be so said helen because the twentyeighth is st augustines day but i thought that the bishop had appointed tuesday  but papa wrote to him and he has altered the day as papa wished i heard mamma and mr somerville talking about it just now when i went into the drawingroom answered katherine  will everything be ready in time said helen  dear me cried katherine i wonder if it will  what is to be done if that tiresome miss dighten does not send home our dresses in time we must go and hurry her tomorrow  and i must get mamma to go to baysmouth this week to get our ribbons  i looked over all mr greens on monday and he has not one bit of pink satin ribbon wide enough or fit to be seen  oh but i meant the things in the churchthe cushions and the carving on the font said helen  oh dear yes the font is very nearly done we saw today you know and as to the cushions mrs webbe may have sarah to help her and then they will certainly be finished  i wonder whether there will be any fun said katherine  is a consecration an occasion for fun asked helen very gravely  why no i do not exactly mean that replied katherine but there will be a great many people and the mertons staying here and rupert is always so full of fun  hmm said helen i do not suppose he will be come back from scotland  and mrs turner says continued katherine that of course as the bishop is coming to luncheon after church mamma must give an elegant dejeuner a la fourchette to everybody  next time i go to st martins street mrs turner is going to give me a receipt for making blancmanger with some cheap stuff which looks quite as well as isinglass  it is made on chemical principles she says for she heard it all explained at the mechanics institute  and aunt anne will be sure to bring us some of their grand fruit from merton hall what a setout it will be  the old vicarage will not know itself how delightful it will be  so you think the happiness of the consecration day depends upon the party and the luncheon said helen  no no of course i do not said katherine but we must think about that too or we should not do what is proper  someone must said helen but it is happy for us that we are not called upon to do so yet  why we must help mamma said katherine i am sure that is our duty  certainly said helen but we need not dwell upon such thoughts for our own pleasure  no i do not i am sure said katherine i do not care about the grand dejeuner i am sure i think a great deal more about the church and the bishopi wonder whether he will come by the railroad  at this moment the door was thrown back hastily and elizabeth the elder sister of katherine and helen darted in looking full of indignation which she only wanted to pour forth without much caring whether it was listened to with sympathy or not  so have you heard she began these hazlebys are coming  did you ever hear of such a nuisance  anything so preposterous  mrs hazleby at a consecrationi should as soon think of asking gillespie grumach  it is for the majors sake of course said helen he will like to come  ay but he is not coming he cannot get leave said elizabeth if he was i should not mind it so much but it is only mrs hazleby and the girls for she has the grace to bring lucy on mammas special invitation  but only think of mrs hazleby scolding and snapping for ever and harriet with her finery and folly and vulgarity  and that at a time which ought to be full of peace and glorious feelings  oh they will spoil all the pleasure  all said helen  all that they can touch all that depends upon sympathy said elizabeth  well but i do not see said katherine  no no said elizabeth we all know that you will be happy enough with your beloved harriet  how frivolous and silly you will be by the end of the first evening she has been here  i am sure i think harriet is very silly indeed said katherine i cannot bear her vulgar ways bouncing about as she does and such dress i never did see  last time she was here she had a great large artificial rose upon her bonnet i wonder what papa would say if he saw me in such a thing  pray keep the same opinion of her all the time she is here kate said elizabeth but i know you too well to trust you  i only know they will keep me in a perpetual state of irritation all the time and i hope that will not quite spoil my mind for the service  how can you talk of mammas relations in that way lizzie said helen  i do not care whose relations they are said elizabeth if people will be disagreeable i must say so  mrs staunton used to say replied helen that people always ought to keep up their connexion with their relations whether they like them or not  there were some very stupid people relations of mr stauntons near dykelands whom fanny and jane could not endure but she used to ask them to dinner very often and always made a point  well if i had any disagreeable relations said elizabeth i would make a point of cutting them  i do not see why relations have a right to be disagreeable  i do not see how you could said helen  for instance would you prevent mamma from ever seeing the major her own brother  he cannot be half so well worth seeing since he chose to marry such a horrid wife said elizabeth  would you never see horace again if he did such a thing said katherine i am sure i would not give him up  would you  i could trust horace i think said elizabeth i will give him fair warning and i give you and helen warning that if you marry odious people i will have done with you  when i was at dykelands said helen everybody was talking about a man who had married  never mind dykelands now helen said elizabeth and do put down your pencil  that drawing was tolerable before luncheon but you have been making your tree more like mr dillons sunday periwig every minute since i have been here  and such a shadow  but do not stop to mend it  you will not do any good now and here is some better work mamma wants us to help to finish the cushions  we must do something to earn the pleasure of having st austins church consecrated on st austins day  what do you mean that i am to work on that hard velvet said helen who was a little mortified by the unsparing criticism on her drawing  yes i undertook that we three should make up the two cushions for the desk and eagle mrs webbes hands are full of business already but she has explained it all to me and kate will understand it better than i can  i thought sarah webbe was to help said helen  she is doing the carpet said elizabeth  oh if you look so lamentable about it helen we do not want your help  dora will sew the seams very nicely and enjoy the work too  i thought you might be glad to turn your handiwork to some account  really lizzie said helen i shall be very glad to be useful if you want me  what shall i do  this was said in no gracious tone and elizabeth would not accept such an offer of assistance  no no never mind said she putting a skein of crimson sewingsilk over katherines outstretched hands and standing with her back to helen who took up her pencil again in silence and made her black shadows much darker  elizabeth who had not been of the walking party and had thus heard of all the arrangements which had been made that afternoon went on talking to katherine  as soon as church is over the bishop is coming to luncheon here and then to settle some business with papa then is to be the schoolchildrens feastin the quadrangle of course  oh how delightful that will be  and mamma and i have been settling that we will have a little table for the smallest creatures because the elder sisters get no time to eat if they are attending to them and if the little ones are all together everyone will come and help them  the old women in the almshouses will said katherine  yes and dora will manage that nicely too the table will not be too high for her to reach and she will be very happy to be able to wait on her little class  and they are to have tea and cake instead of dinner for we do not want to have more cooking than can be helped that people may not be prevented from going to church and the children will be thirsty after being in church all the morning  but we have a dinnerparty do not we said katherine  yes but our youth and innocence will save us from being much plagued by it said elizabeth  oh  i thought you and anne at least would dine with the company said katherine  so mamma thought said elizabeth but then she recollected that if we did and not harriet mrs hazleby would be mortally offended and when we came to reckon it appeared that there would be thirteen without us and then papa and i persuaded her that it would be much less uncivil to leave out all the misses than to take one and leave the rest  you know anne and i are both under seventeen yet so that nobody will expect to see us  only thirteen people said katherine i thought the bishop was to dine and sleep here  oh no that was settled long ago papa found he had engaged to go to marlowe court said elizabeth and so there was room for the hazlebys i hoped he would have guarded us from them  but will there be room said katherine i cannot fancy it  oh  half the rooms can be made knights templars horses and carry double said elizabeth mrs hazleby and both the girls may very well be in the blue room  and there is the best room for the mertons and horaces for rupert said katherine  poor horace it is a shame that he who laid the first stone should not be at the consecration said elizabeth  well but where is anne to be said katherine if we take dora into our room and winifred goes to the nursery there is their room but aunt annes maid must have that  anne shall come to my roomif aunt anne will let her that is to say said elizabeth i wonder i never thought of that before it will counteract some of the horrors of the hazlebys  i shall have the comfort of talking things over with the only person who knows what to feel  yes i will go and speak to mamma and shew her that it is the only way of lodging the world conveniently  oh how happy we shall be  as soon as elizabeth had finished winding her skein she hastened to mrs woodbourne and found no great difficulty in gaining her consent to the plan and she then sat down to write to miss merton to inform her of the change of day and invite her to share her room  elizabeth woodbourne and anne merton were first cousins and nearly of the same age  they had spent much of their time together in their childhood and their early attachment to each other strengthening as they grew older was now becoming something more than girlish affection  anne was an only daughter and elizabeth though the eldest of a large family had not hitherto found any of her sisters able to enter into her feelings as fully as her cousin and perhaps there was no one who had so just an appreciation of elizabeths character as anne who though hers was of a very different order had perhaps more influence over her mind than anyone excepting mr woodbourne  sir edward merton was brother to mr woodbournes first wife the mother of elizabeth katherine and helen he had been mr woodbournes principal assistant in the erection of the new church and indeed had added all the decorations which the vicars limited means aided by a subscription could not achieve and his wife and daughter had taken nearly as much interest in its progress as the ardent elizabeth herself  anne eagerly read elizabeths note to her mother and waited her consent to the scheme which it proposed  well mamma said anne can you consent to this arrangement or are you afraid that lizzie and i should chatter all night  i hope you have outgrown your old habits of gossipping and idling said lady merton i believe i may trust you and it may be inconvenient to mrs woodbourne to find room for you elsewhere  i am very much obliged to you mamma said anne at first gravely then laughing i mean that i shall enjoy it very much  but pray mamma do not trust too much to our age and experience for i do not know anything more difficult than to stop short in a delightful talk only just for the sake of going to sleep  yes it requires some selfcontrol said lady merton  selfcontrol repeated anne  mamma i am sure that patient cautious selfcontrol is wisdoms root must be your motto for you are sure to tell me of it on every occasion  i hope you are not tired of it anne said lady merton for most probably i shall often tell you of it again  oh yes i hope you will said anne there will be more need of it than ever in this visit to abbeychurch  yes said lady merton you live so quietly here excepting when rupert is at home that you must take care that all the excitement and pleasure there does not make you wild  indeed i must said anne i cannot fancy enjoying anything much more than the consecration of a church for which papa has done so much and going with lizzie and meeting rupert  really mamma it is lucky there is that one drawback to keep it from seeming too pleasant beforehand  you mean the hazelbys said her mother  yes mamma replied anne i am rather surprised to hear that they are to be there  i should not think that a vulgarminded scotchwoman such as lizzie describes mrs hazleby would take much delight in a consecration but i suppose uncle woodbourne could not well avoid asking them on such an occasion i believe she is rather touchy  you must take care what you say to lizzie about the hazlebys said lady merton a very little might make it appear that we wished to set her against her stepmothers relations  oh that would never do said anne but i am afraid it will be very difficult to keep from shewing what we think if mrs hazleby is all that lizzie says  your papa was pleased with what he saw of major hazleby last year said lady merton  oh yes lizzie likes him very much said anne it is the lady of whom she has such a horror  i should fancy said lady merton that mrs woodbournes horror of her was almost equal to lizzies  kind gentle aunt mildred said anne do you think she ever had a horror of anyone  it is certainly rather a strong word said lady merton but you will allow me to say that she has a great dread of her i think mrs hazleby scolds and frightens her  what a fury she must be said anne laughing to be able to scold and frighten such a gentle desdomona as mrs woodbourne  do not say too much on that subject said lady merton or we shall be forced to call your beloved lizzie a fury  o mamma cried anne you cannot say that she is impetuous and violent now  she used i allow to be rather overbearing to mrs woodbourne but that was before she was old enough fully to feel and love her gentleness  then she did take advantage of it and argue and dispute but now  she has her own way without disputing said lady merton  o mamma do you think so said anne as if she thought it a terrible accusation  yes i really think that she has but then her way is generally right  yes said lady merton she is in some respects more fit to govern herself than most girls of sixteen  her good sense will keep her from going very far wrong  very far mamma repeated anne  yes for such an excitable impetuous creature is not likely to escape going wrong without steady control from herself or from someone else said lady merton  but i can hardly imagine lizzies actually doing wrong said anne we were certainly both naughty children but i think the worst we did was rather what makes nurses scold than what would seriously displease you or papa  oh she was always an upright noblespirited child said lady merton  and now continued anne when she is much interested in anything when her brilliant dark eyes are lighted up and her beautiful smile is on her lips and her whole face is full of brightness and she looks slight and airy enough to be a spirit and when she is talking about some thingsi could fancy her some higher kind of creature  lady merton smiled  i think i know what you mean said she i used to feel something of the kind with her mother  what a wonderful person aunt katherine must have been cried anne she paused and presently added mamma i do not know whether i ought to say so but much as i like mrs woodbourne i do rather wonder that uncle woodbourne married again  so did your papa and i said lady merton but you must excuse him when you think of his three little girls elizabeth especially requiring such anxious care of body and mind  but you do not think mrs woodbourne could manage lizzie said anne  no said lady merton she could not manage her in the least but her mild influence has i think been of great service to her lizzie has certainly grown more gentle of late and i think it is from consideration for her and the little children  and i suppose said anne that mrs woodbourne has done as much for kate as anyone could  not quite said lady merton i think your aunt katherine would have made her a little less trifling and silly  but no one could ever have made her like lizzie said aune  no but i think she might have been rather more than a mere goodnatured gossip said lady merton  it is curious to see how much difference expression makes in those two sisters said anne their features are so much alike that strangers never know them apart the only difference between them that i could mention is that lizzie is the most delicate looking yet how exceedingly unlike they are to each other  yes said lady merton though lizzies whole countenance and air is almost exactly her mothers yet there is nothing about kate but her voice which they have in common that reminds me of her  helen is very unlike the others in everything said anne  helen will be the handsomest as far as regularity of features goes said lady merton  do you think so said anne  certainly said lady merton her features are less prominent and her colour has not that fixed hectic look that both the others have especially lizzie  but she wants brightness and animation said anne and she so often looks dismal and fretful that i cannot fancy admiring her  there has never been much sympathy between you and helen said lady merton smiling  no said anne i never felt as if i knew or liked her  i believe rupert and i were very unkind to her in our younger days but oh she was the most tiresome whining child i ever knew  i believe that though she was too young to know it said lady merton poor little helen suffered more from your aunts death than either of her sisters  how so mamma said anne looking rather alarmed  she was a very delicate baby requiring a great deal of care said lady merton indeed we have always thought that your aunt laid the foundation of her illness by sitting up with her while she was cutting her large teeth and during your aunts illness it was painful to see how the poor child missed her  and after her mother died though helen had grown strong and healthy old margaret still made her the pet and uncertain nursery treatment without her mothers firm kindness was not the best cure for such a temper as hers  yes said anne i remember she was always called baby and allowed to have her own way till she was six years old when horace was born how very illnatured i must have been to her and how cruel it really was of me  but i wonder my uncle did not prevent margaret from spoiling her  my dear a man with a parish of fifteen hundred inhabitants cannot watch his own nursery very minutely said lady merton he taught elizabeth admirably and that was all that could be expected of him besides with all his perfections managing little girls is not what he is best fitted for  anne laughed  no he is too grave and cold i am rather afraid of him still i do not think he has any toleration for nonsense but of course he must be different with his own children  and how do you think mrs woodbourne trained helen  i can hardly tell said lady merton i used to admire her patience and sweetness of temper when helens fretfulness was most wearisome at the same time that i thought it might have been better for the child to speak sharply to her and punish her if she did not leave off whining directly  i believe i should have done so though i do not know that it would have been the best way or in accordance with what you call my motto  well said anne if dykelands has done such wonders for helen as they say i hope i shall make friends with her if she will let me which i do not think i deserve after my illusage of her  last time i saw her it was but for two days and she was so odd and grave and shy that i could not get on with her besides that i wanted to make the most of my time with lizzie  i hope rupert will not teaze her as he used to do said lady merton last time she was here his teazing and her whining were nearly unbearable  oh she must have outgrown whining said anne  i am afraid you cannot promise me that he has outgrown teazing said lady merton  the one depends upon the other said anne if she does not whine he will not teaze  but had i not better finish my letter to him and tell him he must shorten his stay on the border  yes do so said lady merton and tell him not to lose his keys as usual  i suppose they are gone by this time said anne as lady merton left the room and she sat down to her desk to write to her brother     chapter ii   abbeychurch st marys was a respectable old town situated at the foot of st austins hill a large green mound of chalk named from an establishment of augustine friars whose monastery now converted into almshouses and noble old church were the pride of the county abbeychurch had been a quiet dull place scarcely more than a large village until the days of railroads when the sober inhabitants and especially the vicar and his family were startled by the news that the line of the new baysmouth railway was marked out so as to pass exactly through the centre of the court round which the almshouses were built happily however the difficulty of gaining possession of the property required for this course proved too great even for the railway company and they changed the line cutting their way through the opposite side of st austins hill and spoiling three or four watermeadows by the river  soon after the completion of this work the town was further improved by the erection of various rows of smart houses which arose on the slope of the hill once the airy and healthy playplace of the rising generation of abbeychurch and the best spot for flying kites in all the neighbourhood  london tradesmen were tempted to retire to the beautiful and venerable town of abbeychurch the houses were quickly filled one street after another was built till the population of the town was more than doubled  a deficiency in church accommodation was soon felt for the old church had before been but just sufficient for the inhabitants various proposals were madeto fill up the arches with galleries and to choke the centre aisle with narrow pews but all were equally distasteful to mr woodbourne who placing some benches in the aisle for the temporary accommodation of his new parishioners made every effort to raise funds to build and endow an additional church  he succeeded as we have heard and it was the tall white spire of the now church of st austins which greeted anne mertons delighted eyes as on the 27th of august she with her father and mother came to the top of a long hill about five miles from abbeychurch  what that sight was to her only those who have shared in the joys of churchbuilding can know she had many a time built the church in her fancy she knew from drawing and description nearly every window every buttress every cornice she had heard by letter of every step in the progress of the building but now that narrow white point in the greyish green of the distance shewed her for the first time what really was the work of her fatheryes of her father for without him that spire would never have been there with the best intentions mr woodbourne could not have accomplished more than a solid wellproportioned building with capabilities of embellishment it was not till they had nearly reached the town that her thoughts turned to the pleasure of seeing her cousins or even of meeting her brother whom she expected to find at the vicarage on his return from scotland where he had been spending the last six weeks  in this anticipation however she was disappointed he was not among the group who stood in the hall eager to greet the travellers and no tidings had been heard of him  after talking over the chances of his arriving in the course of the evening sir edward went with mr woodbourne to see the new church and the ladies were conducted to their apartments mrs woodbourne making apologies to anne for lodging her with elizabeth and anne laughingly declaring that she enjoyed elizabeths company much more than solitary grandeur  the two cousins were followed by the whole tribe of children flaxenhaired and blueeyed little sprites the younger of whom capered round anne in high glee though with a little shyness sometimes looking upon her as a stranger sometimes recollecting former frolics till elizabeth declared that it was time to dress and dorothea the eldest a quiet and considerate little maiden of seven years old carried off winifred and edward to their own domains in the nursery  elizabeths room had been set to rights for the accommodation of the visitor so that it suited most peoples ideas of comfort better just then than in its usual state  a number of books and papers had been cleared from the table to leave it free for annes toilette apparatus and a heap of school girls frocks and tippets which had originally been piled up on two chairs but daily increasing in number had grown topheavy fallen down and encumbered the floor had that morning been given away so that there was at least room to sit down  elizabeths desk and painting box were banished to the top of her chestofdrawers where her lookingglass stood in a dark corner being by no means interesting to her  near the window was her bookcase tolerably well supplied with works both english and foreign and its lower shelf containing a double row of brownpaper covered volumes and manycoloured and much soiled little books belonging to the lending library  the walls were hung with elizabeths own works for the most part more useful than ornamental there were genealogical and chronological charts of kings and kaisars comparisons of historical characters tables of christian names and their derivations botanical lists maps and drawingsall in such confusion that once when helen attempted to find the pope contemporary with edward the first she asked elizabeth why she had written the pope down as leo nonus cardinal on which she was informed with a sufficient quantity of laughter that the word in question was the name of a flower leonurus cardiaca looking like anything but what it was intended for in elizabeths writing and that pope martin the fourth was to be found on the other side of the kings of france and spain and the portrait of charles the first the chimneypiece was generally used as a place of refuge for all small things which were in danger of being thrown away if left loose on the table but often forgotten in their asylum had accumulated and formed a strange medley which its mistress jealously defended from all attacks of housemaids  in the middle stood a plaster cast of the statue of the maid of orleans a present from her little brother horace above it hung a small geneva watch which had belonged to elizabeths own mother and there were besides a few treasures of horaces too tender to be trusted in the nursery in his absence at school  the window looked out upon the empty solitary street of the old town and though little was to be seen from it which could interest the two girls yet after the little ones were gone they stood there talking for some minutes elizabeth inquiring after half the people about merton hall a place which she knew almost as well as her own home  when does mrs hazleby come said anne beginning to dress  oh do not ask me said elizabeth i do not know and hardly care quite late i hope and trust  but lizzie asked anne what have these unfortunate hazlebys done to offend you  done answered elizabeth oh a thousand things all too small to be described but together they amount to a considerable sum i can tell you  there has been a natural antipathy an instinctive dislike between mrs major hazleby and me ever since she paid her first visit here and seeing me listening to something she was saying to mamma she turned round upon me with that odious proverb little pitchers have long ears  perhaps she meant it as a compliment said anne you know mary of scotland says that sovereigns ought to have long ears  i suppose her son was of the same opinion said elizabeth when he built his famous lug  as to mrs hazleby she is never happy but when she is finding fault with someone  it will make you sick to hear her scolding and patronizing poor mamma  she has been in india has she not said anne in order to avoid answering  yes replied elizabeth she married the poor major there and the eldest son was born there  i often think i should like to ask old mrs hazleby how she felt on her first meeting with her fair daughterinlaw  they were safe in ireland when papa married and did not burst upon us in full perfection till horaces christening when the aforesaid little pitcher speech was made  and her daughters said anne i never heard you mention them  lucy is a nice quiet girl and a great ally of helens unless she has cast her off for her new friends at dykelands said elizabeth she is rather creepmouse but has no other fault that i know of she is like her fathers family something like mamma  but as for harriet the eldest and her mothers darling you will soon be sensible of some of her charms  i only hope she will not teaze the children into naughtiness as she did last year  i do not know what would be done if horace was at home  one day he had a regular battle with her  it began of course in fun on both sides but he soon grew angry and at last tore her frock and trod pretty hard on her foot i could not be sorry for her she deserved it so completely but then poor horace had to be punished  and another time she shut dora up in a dark room and really it did the poor little girl a great deal of harm she could not sleep quietly for three nights after  dora is old enough to take care of herself now and edward is quieter than horace which is a great comfort but oh i wish the hazlebys were forty miles off  now lizzie said anne is it not a very strange thing to hear you talk in this manneryou the most goodnatured person in the world  thank you said elizabeth that is as much as to say that i am the greatest goose in the world  and you had rather be a goose than illnatured said anne  it does not follow that i should be a goose for want of illnature said elizabeth  but you say that to be goodnatured is to be a goose said anne  yes but goodnature is too poor a thing to be the reverse of illnature said elizabeth it is only a negative quality  i thought goodnatured people were those who never used the negative said anne laughing  do not pun in the middle of a serious argument miss anne said elizabeth putting on a solemn face  well i will be quite as grave as the occasion requires said anne i believe i ought to have used the word kindness as that is as active in good as illnature in evil  but pray lizzie do not let us get into any of these abstruse metaphysical discussions or we shall arrive at conclusions as wise as when we reasoned ourselves into saying nine years ago that it was better to be naughty than good because good people in books were always stupid  idle as we were said elizabeth smiling i do not think that we ever intended to act on that maxim  but really anne i do believe that if you had been a prim pattern of perfection a real good little girl a true miss jenny meek who never put her foot in a puddle never tore her frock never spoke above her breath and never laughed louder than a sucking dove i should never have cared two straws for you  i think little dora might convince you that goodness and stupidity need not always be united said anne after a short pause  demure dolly as horace calls her said elizabeth yes she is a very choice specimen but sweet little thing as she is she would not be half so good a subject for a story as our highspirited horace and wild winifred  dora is like peaceful times in historyvery pleasant to have to do with but not so entertaining to read about  poor dora i thought she looked disconsolate as well as demure without horace said anne  she has been very forlorn poor child said elizabeth there was quite a beautiful chivalrous friendship between the brother and sister he delighting in her gentleness and she in his high daring spirit edward and winifred are scarcely companions to her yet so that she is forced to turn to us and be one of the elders  you think horace is happy at sandleford said anne i should hope he would be rupert always looks back to his days there with a great deal of pleasure  i hope horaces teeth will not meet with the same disaster as ruperts said elizabeth he has not quite so much beauty to spare but he really is a very fine looking boy and just the bold merry fellow to get on well at school so that he is quite happy now that he has recovered the leaving home  but i am afraid my classical lore will die of his departure for my newly acquired knowledge of virgil and the greek declensions will not be of use to edward these three years  he is only just conquering lapis lapidis  but you can go on with latin and greek alone as you did with german cannot you said anne  i do sometimes construe a little virgil said elizabeth but horace is his natural contemporary and he is not happy without him besides when i have nothing to oblige me to learn regularly i do not know when to do it so dido has been waiting an unconscionable time upon her funeral pile for who could think of jupiter and venus in the midst of all our preparations for the consecration  i am glad helen came home in time for it said anne  i began to think we should never see her more said elizabeth there was no gentleman at dykelands to escort her and papa was too busy to fetch her till at last captain atherley mrs stauntons brother took pity upon her or rather on us and brought her home  captain atherley is the only one of the family whom i have ever seen said anne i have always wished to know something more of them they were all such friends of papas and mammas and aunt katherines  if you wish to hear anything of mrs staunton and her daughters said elizabeth you have only to ask helen you will open the floodgates of a stream which has overwhelmed us all ever since she came home  then i hope helen likes them as well as they seem to like her said anne mrs staunton spoke very highly of her in her letter to mamma  oh yes said elizabeth they seem to have done nothing but sit with their mouths open admiring her and she really is very much improved positively grown a reflective creature and the most graceful as well as the prettiest of the family  she would be almost a beau ideal of a sister if she had but a few more home feelings or as you say if she did not like the stauntons quite so much  i wonder what you will think of her  now are you ready   let us come down  when the two cousins came into the drawingroom they found the rest of the ladies already there  katherine and helen woodbourne were busy arranging a quantity of beautiful flowers which had been brought from merton hall to decorate the vicarage on this occasion mrs woodbourne was sitting at her favourite little worktable engaged as usual with her delicate berlin embroidery  a few of the choicest of the flowers had been instantly chosen out for her and were placed on her table in a slender coloured glass which she held up to elizabeth as she entered the room  oh how beautiful cried elizabeth advancing to the table which was strewn with a profusion of flowers  what delightful heliotrope and geranium  oh anne how could you tear off such a branch of cape jessamine that must have been your handiwork you ruthless one  anne has been more kind to us than to her greenhouse said mrs woodbourne i am afraid she has displeased mr jenkins but i hope the plants are not seriously damaged  oh no indeed said anne you should see the plants before you pity them aunt mildred we never let mr jenkins scold us for helping ourselves or our friends out of our own garden for making a great glorious nosegay is a pleasure which i do not know how to forego  do you call this a nosegay said elizabeth i call it a forest of flowers  really a consecration opens peoples heartsi do not mean that yours is not open enough on ordinary occasions aunt anne but when the children took their walk in the almshouse court this morning they were loaded with flowers from all quarters beginning with old mr dillon offering winifred his best variegated dahlia by name dods mary  mr dillon exclaimed katherine i thought he never gave away his flowers on any account  i know said elizabeth but i have also heard him say that he could not refuse little miss winifred if she asked him for the very house over his head  did she ask him for the dahlia said mrs woodbourne  no said elizabeth it was a free offer on his part  dora the discreet tried to make her refuse it but the dahlia had been gathered long before winifred could make up her mind to say no and when the little things came in this morning they looked like walking garlands did you see the noble flowerpot in the hall  you must go and look at the fruit which lady merton has been so kind as to bring us lizzie said mrs woodbourne you never saw such fine grapes and pines  i hear you have undertaken that part of the arrangement young ladies said lady merton  yes said elizabeth but i am afraid we do not know much about the matter  i am sure i cannot tell what i should do if you did not undertake it my dears said mrs woodbourne  do not begin thanking us till we have done the deed mamma said elizabeth it may turn out a great deal worse than if we had left it to the unassisted taste of the maids  the four girls continued to arrange the flowers elizabeth inquiring after many of the plants at merton hall anne telling how the myrtle was prospering how well the geraniums had flowered describing a new fuchsia and triumphing in the prize which the salpiglossis had gained from the horticultural society helen comparing the flora of merton hall with that of dykelands mrs woodbourne rejoicing in cuttings to be saved from the branches gathered by annes unsparing hand and lady merton promising to send her seeds and young plants by rupert when he should return to oxford  when the forest of flowers had been dispersed in the epergne and in various bowls and glasses to ornament the drawingroom the three sisters began to collect the green leaves and pieces of stalks remaining on the table and as they bent down to sweep them off into a basket their heads chanced to be almost close together  why lizzie said lady merton where are your curls  have you made yourself look so very different from kate to prevent all future mistakes between you and helen have you really become a pasha of two tails  is it not very silly of helen to wear them aunt anne said elizabeth  indeed dear aunt anne said helen my hair never will curl well and mrs staunton always said it made me look like an old woman in the way i wore it before so what could i do but try it in the way in which fanny and jane wore theirs  oh we must all bow before dykelands said elizabeth  and i have been wondering what made you look so altered lizzie said lady merton and now i see it is your hair being straight  i like your curls better  ah so do i said mrs woodbourne but lizzie docs not like the trouble of curling it  no said elizabeth i think it a very useless plague  it used really to take me two hours a day and now i am ready directly without trouble or fuss  people i care about will not think the worse of me for not looking quite so well  perhaps not said lady merton but they would think the better of you for a little attention to their taste  they might for attention to their wishes aunt anne said elizabeth but hardly to their taste  taste is such a petty nonsensical thing  i shall leave you and anne to argue about the fine distinction between taste and wishes said lady merton it is more in your line than mine  you mean to say that i have been talking nonsense aunt anne said elizabeth  i say nothing of the kind lizzie said her aunt i only say that you are in the habit of splitting hairs  elizabeth saw that her aunt was not pleased  she went to the chimneypiece and employed herself in making a delicate piece of ixia get a better view of itself in the lookingglass  presently she turned round saying yes aunt anne i was very wrong i was making a foolish pretence at refinement to defend myself  i did not mean to begin scolding you the very moment i came near you lizzie said lady merton  indeed i wish you would aunt anne said elizabeth pray scold me from morning till night there is no one who wants it more  my dear child how can you say so cried mrs woodbourne  many thanks for the agreeable employment you propose to me lizzie said lady merton  if rupert docs not come tonight i mean to undertake a little of that agreeable employment myself when he arrives said elizabeth and to make anne help me  i believe rupert is so fond of being scolded that it only makes him worse said lady merton  here are papa and uncle edward coming back at last said katherine who was as usual sitting in the window  mrs woodbourne looked greatly relieved she had been for some time in trouble for the dinner not being able to console herself in the way in which elizabeth sometimes attempted to reassure her in such casesnever mind mamma the dinner is used to waiting     chapter iii   as soon as dinner was over the girls proposed to walk to the new church that anne might see it at her leisure before the consecration the younger children were very urgent to be allowed to accompany them but mrs woodbourne would only consent to doras doing so on her eldest sisters promise to return before her bedtime  and mamma said elizabeth as soon as this question was decided and the other two children had taken out their basket of bricks at the other end of the room have you settled whether edward is to go to the consecration tomorrow  i really think he is almost too young my dear said mrs woodbourne you know it is a very long service  oh mamma said dora he is five years old now and he says he will be very good and he will be very much disappointed if he has to stay at home now he has had his new frock and trousers and winifred and i are going  really dora said elizabeth i think he had better not go unless he has some reason for wishing to do so better than what you have mentioned  i believe he understands it all as well as we do said dora we have all been talking about it in the nursery this evening at supperand you know mamma he has quite left off being naughty in church  still my dear said mrs woodbourne i scarcely think that we can take him i cannot have him sitting with me among the people whom we have invited and he will certainly grow tired and restless  i do not think his being tired just at last will signify said elizabeth he will attend at first i am sure and it is a thing he must never forget all his life  i will take care of him and winifred and dora can behave well without being watched  very well my dear said mrs woodbourne in her plaintive voice i shall be glad for him to go if you can undertake to keep him in order but you must take care you do not tire yourself  you will have almost too much to do afterwards and you must not let yourself be harassed by his restlessness  oh no mamma thank you said elizabeth he will not fidget and i am not afraid of anything in the summer and on such a great day as tomorrow  i could walk to johnny groats house and take care of fifty children if need were  edward was called examined as to his reasons for wishing to go to the consecration made to promise to behave well and sent back in high glee to play with winifred  elizabeth and dorothea then followed the others upstairs to prepare for the walk  it is very strange remarked mrs woodbourne as they left the room that elizabeth can manage the children so much better than anyone else can they always like best to be with her though she always makes them mind her and kate is much more what people would call goodnatured  do you not think lizzie goodnatured said lady merton rather surprised  oh yes indeed i do said mrs woodbourne she is a most kindhearted creature  i really believe there is nothing she would not do for the children or me i do not know what would become of me without her but you know her way of speaking she does not mean any harm but still when people are not used to her it vexes them indeed i did not mean to say anything against her she is a most excellent creature quite her papas right hand  horace grew almost too much for her to manage before he went to school did not he said lady merton  poor little boy said mrs woodbourne we miss him sadly with his merry face and droll ways  you know he was always a very highspirited child but lizzie could always make him mind her in the end and he was very obedient to his papa and me  edward is a quiet meek boy he has not his brothers high spirits and i hope we shall keep him at home longer  horace is certainly very young for a schoolboy said lady merton rupert was ten years old when he went to sandleford but sir edward afterwards regretted that he had not gone there earlier and the little boys are very well taken care of there  yes mr woodbourne said everything looked very comfortable said mrs woodbourne sighing and i suppose he must rough it some time or other poor little fellow so that it may be as well to begin early  and he has taken a good place said lady merton lizzie wrote in high glee to tell anne of it  yes said mrs woodbourne she had brought him on wonderfully i am sure i wonder how she could with only a little occasional assistance from her papa but then horace is certainly a very clever child and few have lizzies spirits and patience to be able to bear with a little boys idleness and inattention so goodhumouredly  and i do believe she enjoyed playing with him and the others as much as the children themselves i used to say it was no use to send lizzie to keep the children in order she only promoted the fun and noise  she is a merry creature said lady morton her spirits never seem to flag and i think she is looking stronger than when i saw her last  indeed i am very glad to hear you say so said mrs woodbourne she has seemed very well and strong all the summer but she still has that constant cough and we must always be anxious about her i wish she would take a little more care of herself but she will not understand how necessary precautions are she goes out in all sorts of weather and never allows that anything will give her cold indeed i let dora go out with them this evening because i knew that lizzie would stay out of doors too long unless she had her to make her come in for her sake  how bright and well helen looks said lady merton she seems to have been very happy at dykelands  very happy indeed said mrs woodbourne i am sure we are exceedingly obliged to mrs staunton for asking her  she has come back quite a different creature and can speak of nothing but the kindness of her friends at dykelands  here the conversation dropped for a minute or two for lady morton found it difficult to reply  mrs staunton had lived in the village where merton hall was situated and where both lady merton and her sisterinlaw had spent their childhood  she had been much attached to mrs woodbourne and was helens godmother but having settled in a distant county had scarcely kept up any intercourse with the woodbourne family since her friends death though constantly corresponding with lady merton and occasionally writing and sending presents to her little goddaughter  chancing however to come to london on business she had written to mr woodbourne to beg him to bring helen to meet her there and allow her to take her back with her into lincolnshire to spend some time with her and her daughters mr woodbourne knowing that his wife had esteemed her very highly complied after a little deliberation  helens visit had lasted longer than at first proposed and she only returned home after an absence of five months just in time to wish her little brother farewell on his departure for school a few weeks before the consecration of st austins  lady merton would have been glad to read mrs woodbourne all the admiration of helen which mrs staunton had poured forth to her in a letter written a short time before but the terms in which it was expressed were more exaggerated than lady merton liked to shew to one who was not acquainted with mrs staunton and besides her praise of helen was full of comparison with her mother  visiting abbeychurch was always painful to lady merton and her manner usually rather cold was still more constrained when she was there for although both she and sir edward had been very careful not to shew any want of cordiality towards mr and mrs woodbourne they could not but feel that the vicarage never could be to them what it once had been  it was certainly quite impossible not to have an affection for its present gentle kindhearted mistress and lady merton felt exceedingly grateful to her for having some years ago nursed rupert through a dangerous attack of scarletfever with which he had been seized at abbeychurch when on his way from school when she herself had been prevented by illness from coming to him and mrs woodbourne making light of her anxiety for her own children had done all that the most affectionate mother could have done for him and had shewn more energy than almost anyone had believed her to possess comforting sir edward with hopes and cheerful looks soothing the boys waywardness and bearing with his fretfulness in his recovery as none but a mother or a friend as gentle as mrs woodbourne could have done  still much as she loved mrs woodbourne for her own sake lady merton could not help missing katherine her first playfellow the bright friend of her youth her sisterinlaw mrs woodbourne a shy timid person many years younger felt that such must be the case and always feared that she was thinking that the girls would have been in better order under their own mother so that the two ladies were never quite at their ease when alone together  in the mean time elizabeth quite unconscious that dora was intended to act as a clog round her neck to keep her from straying too far was mounting the hill the merriest of the merry party  it is certainly an advantage to the world in general to have the church on a hill said anne both for the poetry and beauty of the sight but i should think that the world in particular would be glad if the hill were not quite so steep  oh said elizabeth on the side towards the new town it is fair and soft enough to suit the laziest it is only on our side that it resembles the mountain of fame or of happiness and st austins as the new town is now to be called is all that has any concern with it  i wish it was not so steep on our side said katherine i do not think i ever was so hot in all my life as i was yesterday when we carried up all the cushions ourselves and papa sent me all the way back to the vicarage only just to fetch a needle and thread for mamma to sew on a little bit of fringe  really kate said elizabeth you might have thought yourself very happy to have anything to do for the church  all it was all very well for you to say so said katherine you were sitting in the cool at home only hearing edward read not toiling in the sun as i was  that is not fair kate said helen you know it is sometimes very hard work to hear edward read and besides mamma had desired lizzie to sit still in the house because she had been at the church ever since five helping papa to settle the velvet on the pulpit after the people had put it on wrong  you would not imagine anne said elizabeth how fearfully deficient the world is in common sense  would you believe it the workmen actually put the pulpitcloth on with the embroidery upsidedown and i believe we were five hours setting it right again  without any breakfast said anne  oh we had no time to think of breakfast till mr somerville came in at ten oclock to see what was going on and told us how late it was said elizabeth  by this time they had reached the brow of the hill from whence they had a fine view of abbeychurch old and new  anne observed upon the difference between the two divisions of the town  yes said elizabeth our town consists of the remains of old respectable england and the beginning of the new great workshop of all nations met together in tolerably close companionship  i could almost grudge that beautiful gothic church to those regular redbrick uniform rows of deformity  i do not think even the new church can boast of more beauty than st marys said anne  no and it wants the handiwork of that best artist old time said elizabeth it will be long before queen victorias head on the corbel at the new church is of as good a colour as queen eleanors at the old one and we never shall see anything so pretty at st austins as the yellow lichen cap and plume of spleenwort feathers which edward the first wears  how beautiful the old church tower is said anne turning round to look at it and the gable ends of your house and the tall trees of the garden with the cloistered almshouses have still quite a monastic air  if you only look at the tower with its intersecting arches and their zigzag mouldings said elizabeth and shut your eyes to our kitchen chimney on which rests all the fame of the vicar before last  what can you mean said anne  that when anyone wishes to distinguish the reverend hugh puddington from all other vicars of abbeychurch his appellation is the man that built the kitchen chimney  that being i suppose the only record he has left behind him said anne  the only one now existing said elizabeth since papa has made his great horrid pew in the chancel into open seatsdo not you remember it kate and how naughty you used to be when margaret left off sitting there with us and there was no one to see what we were aboutoh and there is a great fat patience on a monument on the wall over our heads and a very long inscription recording things quite as unsuitable to a clergyman  i do not understand you lizzie said helen unsuitable as what patience or building chimneys or making pews  patience is a virtue when she is not on a monument said elizabeth  and neither pews nor chimneys can be unsuitable to a clergyman said little dora there are four pews in the new church and papa built a chimney for the school  everyone laughed much to doras surprise and somewhat to helens and elizabeth was forced to explain for doras edification that what she intended by the speech in question was only that it was unsuitable to a clergyman to leave no record behind him but what had been intended to gratify his own love of luxury  i am sorry i said anything about him said she to anne it was scarcely right to laugh at him especially before dora i am afraid she will never see the monument without thinking of the chimney  at this moment they arrived at the church and all their attention was bestowed upon it  it was built in the early english style and neither pains nor expense had been spared  anne who had not been there since the wall had been four feet above the ground was most eager to see it and elizabeth who had watched it from day to day was equally eager to see whether anne would think of everything in it as she did herself  as the door opened a flood of golden light poured in upon the pure white stone font while the last beams of the evening sun were streaming through the western window shining on the edges of the carved oak benches and glancing upon the golden embroidery of the crimson velvet on the altar above which the shadows on the groined roof of the semioctagonal chancel were rapidly darkening and the deep tints of the five narrow lancet windows within five arches supported and connected by slender clustered shafts with capitals of richly carved foliage were full of solemn richness when contrasted with the glittering gorgeous hues of the west window  oh anne whispered elizabeth as they stood together in the porch giving a parting look before she closed the door it is all glorious within even now and think what it will be tomorrow  nothing more was said till they had left the churchyard when anne exclaimed looking wistfully towards the railroad then there is but one chance of ruperts coming tonight  when the eight oclock train comes in said katherine it is that which is to bring the hazlebys  i really think said helen that the gas manufactory and the union poorhouse grow more frightful every day  i thought they looked worse than ever when i came home and saw the contrast with lincolnshire  i hope the old and new towns will long be as different as they are now  i am afraid they hardly will said anne the old town will soon begin to rival the new one  you must already find new notions creeping into it  creeping cried elizabeth they gallop along the railroad as fast as steam can carry them  however we are happily a quiet dull race and do not take them in we only open our eyes and stare at all the wonders round  i do not know what we may come to in time we may be as genteel as kates friend willie turner says the people are in aurelia placethat perkedup row of houses whose windows and doors give them such a comical expression of countenance more like butterflies than aurelias  who is kates friend asked anne in a wondering tone  willie turner said elizabeth oh the apothecarys daughter wilhelmina  you must have heard of mr turner  rupert has made a standing joke of him ever since the scarletfever  oh yes said anne i know mr turners name very well but i never knew that miss turner was a friend of kates  she was not said elizabeth till helen went to dykelands and poor kitty was quite lonely for want of someone to gossip with and so she struck up a most romantic friendship with willie turner and really it has done us one most important servicemay i mention it kate without betraying your confidence  nonsense lizzie said katherine  oh you do not object said elizabeth then be it known to you anne that once upon a time kitty confided to me what i forthwith confided to papa that mrs turner was working in crossstitch a picture of st augustine preaching to the saxons which she intended to present as a cushion for one of the chairs of st austins church  oh dreadful cried anne  papa walked up and down the room for full ten minutes after he heard of it said elizabeth but mamma came to our rescue  she the mildspoken mildred you know set off with the saxon winifred the peacemaker to reject the saint of the saxons more civilly than the british bishops did  she must have managed most beautifully so as to satisfy everybody  i believe that she lamented that the austin friars who named our hill were not called after the converter of our forefathers looking perfectly innocent of kittys secret all the time and winifred eat mrs turners plumcake and stared at her curiosities so as to put her into good humour  thus far is certain from that day to this no more has been heard of st augustine or king ethelbert  oh her work is made up into a screen now said katharine and is very pretty  and last time mrs turner called at the vicarage she was very learned about the bishop of hippo said elizabeth she is really very clever in concealing her ignorance when she does not think herself learned  i thought they were not likely to promote the decoration of the new church said anne  oh she does not trouble herself about consistency said elizabeth anything which attracts notice pleases her  she thinks our dear papa has done more for the living than nine out of ten would have thought of and if there was any talk of presenting him with some small testimonial of respect her mite would be instantly forthcoming and sir edward merton he is the most munificent gentleman she ever heard of if all of his fortune were like him nowonly my dear miss lizzie does not your papa think of having a lightning conductor attached to the spire such an elevation it quite frightens me to think of it and the iron of the railroad too  oh is she scientific too aaid anne  yes you see how the march of intellect has reached us said elizabeth poor kate is so much afraid of the electric fluid that she cannot venture to wear a steel buckle  you have no idea of the efforts we are making to keep up with the rest of the world  we have a wicked radical newspaper all to ourselves i wonder it has the face to call itself the abbeychurch reporter  your inns are on the move said anne i see that little beershop near the station calls itself the locomotive hotel  i wish it were really locomotive said elizabeth so that it would travel out of abbeychurch it is ruining half the young men here  well perhaps the new town will mend said anne it will have a christian name tomorrow and perhaps the influence of the old town will improve it  i think papa has little hope of that kind said elizabeth if the new town does grow a little better the old will still grow worse it is grievous to see how much less conformable papa finds the people of the old town than even i can remember them  but come we must be locomotive or dora will not be at home in time     chapter iv   the clock was striking eight as the young ladies entered the house but dora was allowed to sit up a little longer to see her aunt mrs hazleby  it was not long before a loud knock at the door announced that ladys arrival  mrs hazleby was a tall bony scotchwoman with fiercelooking grey eyes  she gave mrs woodbourne a very overpowering embrace and then was careful to mark the difference between her niece little dora whom she kissed and the three elder girls with whom she only shook hands she was followed by her daughtersharriet a tall showy girl of sixteen and lucy a pale quiet delicatelooking creature a year younger  rupert merton was still missing but his movements were always so uncertain that his family were in no uneasiness on his account  as mrs woodbourne was advancing to kiss harriet a loud sharp yap was heard from something in the arms of the latter mrs woodbourne started turned pale and looked so much alarmed that anne could not laugh  harriet however was not so restrained but laughed loudly as she placed upon a chair a little blenheim spaniel with a blue ribbon round his neck and called to her sister lucy to look after fido  it presently appeared that the little dog had been given to them at the last place where they had been staying on the road to abbeychurch and mrs hazleby and her eldest daughter continued for some time to expatiate upon the beauty and good qualities of fido as well as those of all his kith and kin  he was not however very cordially welcomed by anyone at the vicarage for mr woodbourne greatly disliked little dogs in the house his wife dreaded them much among her children and there were symptoms of a deadly feud between him and elizabeths only pet the great black cat meg merrilies but still his birth parentage and education were safe subjects of conversation and all were sorry when mrs hazleby had exhausted them and began to remark how thin elizabeth lookedto tell a story of a boy who had died of a fever some said of neglect at the school where horace wasto hint at the possibility of ruperts having been lost on the scottish mountains blown up on the railroad or sunk in a steamvesselto declare that girls were always spoiled by being long absent from home and to dilate on the advantages of cheap churches  she had nearly all the conversation to herself the continual sound of her voice being only varied by harriets notes and comments given in a pert shrill high key and by a few syllables in answer from lady merton and mrs woodbourne  the two gentlemen happily for themselves had a great quantity of plans and accounts of the church to look over together which were likely to occupy them through the whole of sir edwards visit  elizabeth was busy numbering the consecration tickets for the next day and anne in helping her so that they sat quietly together in the inner drawingroom during the greater part of the evening  when they went upstairs to bed elizabeth exclaimed oh that horrid new bonnet of mine  i had quite forgotten it and i must trim it now for i shall not have time tomorrow morning  i will run to kate and helens room and fetch my share of the ribbon  as she returned and sat down to work she continued it is too much plague to quill up the ribbon as the others have theirs  it will do quite well enough plain  now anne do not you think that as long as dress is neat which of course it must be prettiness does not signify  perhaps i might think so if i had to trim my own bonnets said anne laughing  ah you do not think soanne you who have everything about you from your shoestrings upwards in the most complete order and elegant taste  but then you know you would do quite as well if the things were ugly  if i wore yellow gowns and scarlet bonnets for instance asked anne  no no that would not be modest said elizabeth you would be no longer a lady so that you could not look ladylike which i maintain a lady always is whether each morsel of her apparel is beautiful in itself or not  indeed lizzie said anne i cannot say that i think as you do at least as far as regards ourselves i think that it may be possible to wear ugly things and still be ladylike and i am sure i honour people greatly who really deny themselves for the sake of doing right if anyone can seriously care for such a thing as dress but i consider it as a duty in such as ourselves to consult the taste of the people we live with  as your mother said about my hair said elizabeth thoughtfully i will do as she advised anne but not while she is here for fear mamma should fancy that i do so because aunt anne wished it though i would not to please her  i believe you are right but look here will my bonnet do  i think it looks very well said anne but will it not seem remarkable for you to be unlike your sisters  ah it will give mrs hazleby an opportunity of calling me blue and tormenting mamma said elizabeth besides mamma wished us all to be alike down to the little ones so i will make the best of it and trim it like any london milliner  but anne you must consider it is a great improvement in me to allow that respectable people must be neat i used to allow it in theory but not in practice  i do not think i ever saw you untidy lizzie said anne except after a days nutting in the hanging wood  oh yes i could generally preserve a little outward tidiness said elizabeth besides a visit at merton hall is very different from every day in shabby old abbeychurch  no you must know that when i was twelve years old i was supposed to be capable of taking care of my own wardrobe and for some time all went on very smoothly only that i never did a stitch towards mending anything  did a beneficent fairy do it for you then  not a sprite nor even a brownie but one of the old wrinkled kind of fairies  old margaret that kindest of nurses could not bear to see her dear miss lizzie untidy or to hear her dear miss lizzie scolded so she mended and mended without saying anything encouraging me in habits of arrant slovenliness and if i had but known it of deceit dear old margery it was a heartbreaking thing when she went away to all from winifred upwards and to none more than to  me who could remember those two melancholy years when she often seemed my only friend when i was often naughty and papa angry with me and i feeling motherless and wretched used to sit on her lap and cry  dear old margery it is a shame to abuse her in spite of the mischief her overkindness did us all  well when our new maid came on the supposition that miss woodbourne took care of her own clothes she never touched them and as margarets work was not endowed with the fairy power of lasting for ever i soon grew as ragged as any raggedrobin in the hedge  mamma used to complain of my slovenliness but i am afraid i was naughty enough to take advantage of her gentleness and outargue her so things grew worse and worse till at last one fatal day papa was aware of a great hole in my stockings then forth it all came he asked question after question and dear kind mamma even more unwilling to expose me than i was myself was forced to answer and you may suppose how angry he was  oh anne i can hardly bear to think of the stern kindness of his voice when he saw i was really quite wretched  and only think how kind it was in him he spoke seriously to me he shewed me that building the church helping our poor people even mammas comforts and the boys education depend upon home economy and how even i could make a difference by not wasting my clothes and making another servant necessary  then could you really gain neat habits immediately asked anne there could be no doubt of your resolving to do so but few people could or would persevere  oh i am not properly tidy now said elizabeth opening a most chaotic tabledrawer see there is a proof of it  however i do not think i have been shamefully slovenly in my own person since that explosion and i have scarcely been spoken to about it  who could disregard such an appeal  but anne are you not enchanted with sweet mrs hazleby  i wish you would not ask me lizzie said anne feeling very prudent you know that i know nothing of her  no and you never will know enough of her to say such savage things as i do said elizabeth but at any rate you saw her when she came in  certainly  i mean the kissing i am sure i am glad enough to escape it and always think mamma and the children seem to be hugged by a bear but you know making such distinctions is not the way to make us like her even if we were so disposed  oh and about me in particular i am convinced that she thinks that mamma hates me as much as she does for she seems to think it will delight her to hear that i am thinner than ever and that such bright colour is a very bad sign and then she finishes off with a hypocritical sigh and half whisper of it can be no wonder poor thing trying to put everyone especially papa and uncle edward in mind of my own poor mother  i declare i have no patience with her or harriet or that ugly little wretch of a dog  in the mean time katherine and helen were visiting their guests harriet and lucy hazleby whom contrary to elizabeths arrangement mrs woodbourne had lodged in the room where her own two little girls usually slept  harriet was sitting at the table at her ease curling her long corkscrew ringlets with fido at her feet lucy was unpacking her wardrobe katherine lighting her and admiring each article as it was taken out in spite of her former disapprobation of harriets style of dress  helen stood lingering by the door with her hand on the lock still listening or talking though not much interested and having already three times wished her guests good night  their conversation though not worth recording for any sense or reflection shewn by any of the talkers may perhaps display their characters and add two or three facts to our story which may be amusing to some few of our readers  oh lucy cried harriet with a start take care of my spotted muslin it is caught on the lock of the box  you always are so careless  katherine assisted lucy to rescue the dress from the threatened danger and harriet continued well and what do you wear tomorrow kate  white muslin with pink ribbons said katherine  i have a green and orange striped mousseline de laine mamma gave only fifteenpence a yard for it i will shew it to you when lucy comes to it and you will see if it is not a bargain  and what bonnets  straw with ribbon like our sashes said katherine  oh we had so much trouble to get  my bonnet is green satin said harriet but if i had been you kate i would have had leghorn  wouldnt you lucy  five leghorn bonnets would have cost too much said katherine and mamma wished us all to be alike  ah she would not let you be smarter than her own girls eh kitty said harriet laughing  i had been obliged to buy a very nice new straw bonnet at dykelands said helen and it would have been a pity not to use that  well i have no notion of a whole row of sisters being forced to dress alike said harriet aunt mildred might  here lucy stopped her sisters speech by bringing the gown forward to display it  when harriet had sufficiently explained its excellence she began so your cousin young merton is coming is he  yes said katherine we expected him last night or in the course of this day but he has not come yet  well what sort of a young fellow is he said harriet  very clever indeed said katherine  oh then he will not be in my line at all said harriet those clever boys are never worth speaking to are they lucy  do you like stupid ones better said helen  capital isnt it lucy cried harriet i did not mean stupid i only meant clever boys as they call them have no fun they only read read for ever like my brother allan  i am sure rupert is full of fun said katherine  oh but he is quite a boy is not he said harriet  nineteen and at oxford said katherine  oh i call that quite a boydont you lucy said harriet is he handsome  yes very said katherine  not like his sister then i suppose said harriet  oh do not you think anne pretty said katherine  i do not knowno too small and pale to suit me said harriet  rupert is not like anne said katherine he has a very bright pink and white complexion and light hair  is he tall  no not so tall as your brother george but slighter  he has had two of his front teeth knocked out by a stone at school said katherine  what a fuss they did make about those teeth muttered helen  was that the school where horace is said harriet  yes said katherine sandleford  how you must miss horace said lucy  poor little fellow yes that we do said katherine but he was so riotous he would pull all my things to pieces  nobody could manage him but lizzie and she never minds what she has on  what a tear he did make in my frock said harriet laughing didnt he lucy  how tired you look lucy said helen i am sure you ought to be in bed  oh no i am not very sleepy said lucy smiling  i am dead tired i am sure said harriet yawning it was so hot in the railway carriage  cannot the rest of those things be put away tomorrow morning harriet said helen  oh said harriet yawning there will not be time lucy may as well do them all now she has begun  how sleepy i am we walked about london all the morning  come helen said katherine it is quite time for us to be gone we must be up early tomorrow     chapter v   the morning of the twentyeighth of august was as fine as heart could wish and the three sisters rose almost as soon as it was light to fulfil their promise of attending to all the small nondescript matters of arrangement needful when a large party is expected by a family not much in the habit of receiving company  katherine who had quite given up all thoughts of equalling her elder sister in talent and who prided herself on being the useful member of the family made herself very busy in the storeroom helen arranged the fruit with much taste and elizabeth was upstairs and down here there and everywhere till it was difficult to find anything which she had not rectified by labour of head or hand  well said she as she brought helen a fresh supply of vine leaves from the garden i wonder whether rupert will come in time  i shall be very sorry if he does not for he has done a great deal for the church  has he indeed said helen with an air that expressed i should not have thought it  o helen how can you take so little interest in the church said elizabeth do not you remember how much trouble rupert took to find a pattern for the kneelingstools and what a beautiful drawing he sent of those at magdalen collegia chapel  i am sure he would be very much vexed to miss the consecration  i suppose he might come if he pleased said helen but perhaps he did not choose to get up early enough  that is the first time i ever heard rupert accused of indolence said elizabeth  i do not mean that he does not generally get up in good time said helen he is not lazy but i do not think he chooses to put himself out of the way and besides he rather likes to make people anxious about him  i know you have never liked rupert said elizabeth drily  papa thinks as i do said helen i have heard him say that he is a spoiled child and thinks too much of himself  oh that was only because aunt anne worked that beautiful waistcoat for him said elizabeth that was not ruperts fault  and papa said that he was quite fond enough already of smart waistcoats said helen and he laughed at his wearing a ring  that is only a bloodstone with his crest said elizabeth and i am sure no one can accuse rupert of vulgar smartness  not of vulgar smartness said helen but you must allow that everything about him has akind ofwhat shall i sayrecherche air that seems as if he thought a great deal of himself i am sure you must have heard papa say something of the kind  really helen said elizabeth i cannot think why you should be determined to say all that you can against that poor rupert  helen made no answer  i do believe said elizabeth that you have had a grudge against him ever since he made you an april fool  oh how capital it was cried she sitting down to laugh at the remembrance  to make you believe that the beautiful workbox uncle edward sent you was a case of surgical instruments for mr turner to shew his gratitude for his attendance upon rupert when he had the fever and for setting his mouth to rights when his teeth were knocked out at school  oh there never was such fun as to see how frightened you looked and how curious kate and horace were and how mamma begged him not to open the box and shew her the horrid things  i wish rupert would keep to the truth with his jokes said helen  helen said elizabeth you cannot mean to say that he ever says what is untrue  you are letting yourself be carried much too far by your dislike  if he does not positively assert what is not true he often makes people believe it said helen  only stupid people who have no perception of a joke said elizabeth he never deceived me with any joke it is only that you do not understand  i wonder how such a candid person as you are can defend the slightest departure from truth for any purpose said helen  i would not defend anyone whom i did not believe to be upright and open said elizabeth but it is only your slowness and old spite against rupert because he used to joke you that puts these fancies into your head  now i must go to the children i hope helen you will really enter into the spirit of the day little as you seem to care about the church  helen gave a deep sigh as her sister left the room she was vexed at having been laughed at at the disregard of her arguments at the reproach and perhaps a little at elizabeths having taken no notice of the beautiful pyramid of cherries which had cost her half an hours labour  there was some truth in what helen said of her cousin though few would have given his faults so much prominence  rupert merton was an only son and very handsome and this was the history of nearly all his foibles  no one could say that his career at school and so far at college had not been everything that could be wished and most people had nearly as high an opinion of him as he had of himself but helen who had almost always been made a laughingstock when he was with her had not quite so agreeable a recollection of his lively graceful pleasant manners as her sisters had and was glad to find that his tormenting ways were not entirely caused by her own querulous temper as elizabeth sometimes told her they were  when mrs woodbourne came down helens handiwork received its full share of admiration and mrs woodbourne was much pleased by the girls forethought and activity which had saved her from a great deal of fatigue  the breakfast was quickly finished and immediately afterwards the four eldest miss woodbournes together with anne went to the school to see if the children were ready to go to church  it was pleasant to see the smiling courtesying row of girls each with her prayerbook in her hand replying to elizabeths nods greetings and questions with bright affectionate looks or a few words which shewed that they were conscious of the solemnity of the service in which they were about to bear a part  elizabeth left her sisters and anne to assist the schoolmistress in marshalling them on their way to church and returned home to fetch edward and winifred whom she had engaged to take with her  she found that nearly all the party were gone and report said that the bishop had arrived at the house of mr somerville who was to be curate of st austins  winifred and edward were watching for her at the door in great dread of being forgotten for they said papa had come for mamma and fetched her away in a great hurry and then harriet and lucy set off after them and uncle edward had taken aunt anne long before to look at the church  elizabeth was rejoicing in the prospect of a quiet walk with the children and was only delaying in a vain attempt to reduce the long fingers of winifreds glove to something more like the length of the short fingers of its owner when a sharp voice at the top of the stairs cried out wait for me and mrs hazleby appeared looking very splendid in a short black silk cloak trimmed with scarlet  where have you been all this time said she to elizabeth while she caught hold of winifreds hand or more properly speaking of her wrist we shall all be too late  i have been at the school said elizabeth  what do you keep school today asked mrs hazleby  no said elizabeth but the children are going to the consecration  poor little things exclaimed mrs hazleby how will they sit out such a service  none under seven years old are to be there said elizabeth and of the older ones only those who are tolerably good and i should think they could join in the service sufficiently to prevent them from finding it tedious  well i hope so said mrs hazleby in a voice which meant what nonsense  how steep the hill is added she presently what a fatigue for old people  it is not nearly so steep on the other side replied elizabeth and the people on this side have the old church  why did they choose such an exposed situation continued mrs hazleby so hot in summer and so cold in winter  there was no other open piece of ground to be had near enough to the new town answered elizabeth keeping to herself an additional reason which was that tradition said that there had once been a little chapel dedicated in the name of st augustine on the site of the new church mrs hazleby was silent for a few moments when as they came in sight of what was passing at the top of the hill she saw a gentleman hasten across the churchyard and asked who he was  mr somerville the new curate was the answer  what another curate  i thought mr walker might have been enough exclaimed mrs hazleby  papa did not think so said elizabeth drily  well i suppose that is another hundred a year out of mr woodbournes pocket said mrs hazleby enough to ruin his family  i am sure said elizabeth beginning to grow angry papa had rather do his duty as a clergyman than lay up thousands for us  fine talking for young things said mrs hazleby besides it is nothing to you you three elder ones will be well enough off with your mothers fortune  elizabeth was more annoyed and provoked by this speech than by anything mrs hazleby had ever said to her before her cheeks burnt with indignation and something which felt very like shame but her bonnet concealed them and she attempted no reply  mrs hazleby began talking to winifred about her new sash and criticizing elizabeths dress and though elizabeth could have wished winifreds mind to have been occupied with other things at such a time yet she was glad of the opportunity this diversion gave her to compose herself before entering the church  almost everyone who has ever joined in our beautiful consecration service can imagine the feelings of some of the party from the vicaragecan figure to themselves mrs woodbournes quiet tears doras happy yet awestruck face anne sympathizing with everyone rather than feeling on her own account can think of the choking overwhelming joy with which elizabeth looked into little edwards wondering eyes as the name of their father was read the first among those who petitioned the bishop to set that building apart from all ordinary and common uses can feel or perhaps have known the exultation with which she joined in the psalms and the swelling of heart as she followed the prayer for a blessing on the families of those who had been the means of the building of that house  but we must go no farther for such thoughts and scenes are too high to be more than touched upon in a story of this kind therefore we will only add that winifred and edward behaved quite as well as elizabeth had engaged that they should do only beginning to yawn just before the end of the service  after they had returned from the church the luncheon at the vicarage gave ample employment to elizabeths hands and nearly enough to her thoughts in carving cold chicken and doing the honours of merton hall peaches at the sidetable and she was very glad when at three oclock the company adjourned to the quadrangle to see the schoolchildrens feast  the quadrangle was enclosed on the north side by the old church on the south and west by the almshouses and on the east by the low wall of the vicarage garden there was a wide gravel path all round the court and here tables were spread around which were to be seen the merry faces of all the children of the two schoolsthe boys a uniform rank arrayed in king edwards blue coats and yellow stockings with but a small proportion of modernlooking youths in brown or blue and deep white collarsthe girls a long partycoloured line only resembling each other in the white tippets which had lately encumbered elizabeths room  much activity was called for from all who chose to take part in supplying the children the young ladies baskets of buns were rapidly emptied and mr somervilles great pitcher of tea frequently drained although he pretended to be very exclusive and offer his services to none but the children of st austins to whom winifred introduced him the rest of the company walked round the cloisters which were covered with dark red roses and honeysuckles talking to the old people admiring their flowers especially mr dillons dahlias and watching the troop of children who looked like a living flowerbed  mrs hazleby chanced to be standing near mrs bouverie a lady who lived at some distance from abbeychurch and who was going to stay and dine at the vicarage  she was tolerably well acquainted with mr woodbourne but she had not seen the girls since they were quite young children and now remarking elizabeth she asked mrs hazleby if she was one of mr woodbournes daughters  oh yes said mrs hazleby the eldest of them  she has a remarkably fine countenance said mrs bouverie  do you admire her said mrs hazleby well i never could see anything so remarkably handsome in lizzie woodbourne  too thin too sharp too highcoloured kate is twenty times prettier to say nothing of the little ones  i should not call miss woodbourne pretty said mrs bouverie but i think her brow and eye exceedingly beautiful and full of expression  oh yes cried mrs hazleby she is thought vastly clever i assure you though for my part i never could see anything in her but pertness  she has not the air of being pert said mrs bouverie  oh she can give herself airs enough said mrs hazleby my poor sisterinlaw has had trouble enough with her just like her mother they say  so i was thinking said mrs bouverie looking at elizabeth who was stooping down to a little shy girl and trying to hear her whispered request  mrs bouverie spoke in a tone so different from that which mrs hazleby expected that even she found that she had gone too far and recollected that it was possible that mrs bouverie might have known the first mrs woodbourne  she changed her note just like her poor mother and quite as delicate poor girl  is she indeed said mrs bouverie in a tone of great interest  yes that she is scarcely ever without a cough  full of spirits you seerather too much of it but i should not be surprised any day  at this moment winifred came running up to cry look aunt hazleby at the basket of balls i have been to the house to fetch them and now the boys are going away to the cricketground and the girls are to have a famous game at play  mrs hazleby only said hm but the other lady paid more attention to the little girl who was very little troubled with shyness and soon was very happythrowing the balls to the girls andat the same timechattering to mrs bouverie and saying a great deal about lizzie telling how lizzie said that one little girl was good and another was naughty that lizzie said she should soon begin to teach her french lizzie taught her all her lessons mamma only heard her music lizzie had shewn her where to look in her consecrationbook so that she should not be puzzled at church today lizzie said she had behaved very well and that she should tell papa so she had a red ribbon with a medal with winchester cathedral upon it which lizzie let her wear to shew papa and mamma when she was good at her lessons she hoped she should wear it today though she had not done any lessons for lizzie said it was a joyful day like a sunday all this made mrs bouverie desirous of being acquainted with lizzie but she could find no opportunity of speaking to her as elizabeth never willingly came near strangers and was fully occupied with the schoolchildren so that she and anne were the last to come indoors to dress  they were surprised on coming in to find helen sitting on the last step of the stairs with dora on her lap the latter crying bitterly and helen using all those means of consolation which with the best intention have generally the effect of making matters worse  as soon as elizabeth appeared dora sprang towards her exclaiming lizzie dear lizzie do you know aunt hazleby says that my mamma is not your mamma nor kates nor helens and i do not like it  what does she mean  lizzie i do not understand  elizabeth looked up rather fiercely but kissing her little sister said gently yes dora it is really true my own mother lies in the churchyard  i will shew you where  and are you not my sisters asked dora holding firmly by the hands of elizabeth and helen  oh yes yes dora cried helen we are your sisters only not quite the same as winifred  and have you no mamma really no mamma continued dora looking frightened although soothed by elizabeths manner and by feeling that the truth was really told her  not really dora but your mamma is quite the same to us as if she really was our mother said elizabeth leading the little girl away and leaving anne and helen looking unutterable things at each other  helen then went into the large drawingroom to fetch some of her outofdoor apparel which she had left there and anne followed her no one was in the room but mrs hazleby who looked more disconcerted than helen had ever seen her before  she seemed to think it necessary to make some apology and began i am sure i had no notion that the child did not know it all perfectly at her age  mamma has always wished to keep the little ones from knowing of any difference as long as possible said helen rather indignantly but recollecting herself she added i think dora is rather tired and perhaps she was the more easily overcome for that reason  ah very likely poor child said mrs hazleby it was folly to take her to such a ceremony  she seemed to enjoy it and enter into it as much as any of us said helen  ah well some peoples children are vastly clever said mrs hazleby  do you know where fido is miss helen if one may ask you such a question  helen replied very courteously by an offer to go and look for him he was quickly found and as soon as she had brought him to his mistress she followed anne to elizabeths room where in a short time they were joined by the latter looking worn and tired and with the brilliant flush of excitement on her cheeks  is dora comforted was the first question asked on her entrance  oh yes said elizabeth that was soon settled she was only scared so i took her to mamma who kissed us both told dora she loved us all the same and so on which made her quite happy again  dear little affectionate creature exclaimed helen warmly  how very angry with her mrs hazleby seemed said anne  yes said helen because dora came to me in her distress and would not let mrs hazleby kiss her  how came mrs hazleby to begin upon it said elizabeth was it from her instinctive perception of disagreeable subjects  i can hardly tell said helen i was not there at first i rather think but here she stopped short and looked confused  well what do you think  why i believe it arose from her seeing uncle edward playing with edward on the green began helen with a good deal of hesitation saying that he was his godfather andand sheshe hoped he would be would be ashe would do as much for him as if he was actually his uncle  horrid woman said elizabeth blushing deeply  my dear lizzie said anne laughing do you hope he will not  nonsense anne said elizabeth laughing too but i hope you quite give up the hazlebys after this specimen  now lizzie said helen that is quite in your unjust sweeping style of censuring  you do not mean to say that lucy or the major or the boys are disagreeable  root and branch they are all infected said elizabeth who could help it living with mrs hazleby  pray do not be so unfair lizzie continued helen i am sure that lucy is a most amiable sensible gentle creature the more to be admired for having such a mother and sister  by way of foil i suppose said elizabeth still saving your presence helen i think that if lucy had all the sense you ascribe to her she might keep things a little more straight  really lizzie said helen it is not like you to blame poor lucy for her misfortunes but i know very well that you only do it to contradict me  well said elizabeth impatiently i do allow that she is a redeeming point but i do not give her such hyperbolical praise as you do i may say she is the best of them without calling her a paragon of perfection  i never called her any such thing exclaimed helen but you will always wrest my words and pretend to misunderstand me  i am sorry i have vexed you helen said elizabeth more kindly and helen left the room  indeed lizzie said anne i cannot think why you argued against this poor girl after what you said yesterday  because i cannot bear helens sententious decided manner said elizabeth and she exaggerates so much that i must sometimes take her down  but said anne do you not exaggerate the exaggeration and so put her more in the right than yourself  you mean by turning her string of superlatives into a paragon of perfection said elizabeth i certainly believe i was unjust but i could not help it  anne did not see that her cousin might not have helped it but she thought she had said enough on the subject and let it pass  now anne said elizabeth presently after what strange people we are to stand here abusing helen and the hazlebys instead of talking over such wonderful happiness as it is to think that your father and mine have been allowed to complete such a work as this church  indeed it is wonderful happiness said anne her eyes filling with tears but i do not know whether you feel as i do that it is too great too overwhelming to talk of now it is fresh  we shall enjoy looking back to it more when we are further from it  yes said elizabeth this morning i was only fit to laugh or cry at i did not know what and now i am vexed with myself for having been too much occupied and annoyed with little things to be happy enough  this consecration day will be a glorious time to look back to when it is alone on the horizon and we have lost sight of all that blemishes it now  i will tell you what it will be like  i once saw the church on a misty day from a great distance  it was about the middle of the day and the veil of mist was hanging all round the hill but there stood the church clear and bright and alone in the sunshine all the scaffold poles and unfinished roughness lost sight of in the distance i never saw a more beautiful sight  and do you expect that distance of time will conceal all blemishes as well as distance of place said anne  yes unless i take a telescope to look at them with answered elizabeth perhaps anne in thirty years time if we both live so long we may meet and talk over this day and smile and wonder that we could have been vexed by anything at such a time  you like looking forward said anne i suppose i am too happy for i am afraid to look forward any change of any sort must bring sorrow with it  i suppose you are right said elizabeth that is i believe the safest frame of mind to be that which resigns itself to anything that may be appointed for it rather than that which makes schemes and projects for itself  oh but lizzie said anne i did not mean that  mine is rather an indolent frame which does not scheme because my present condition is i do believe happier than any i could imagine upon earth  i do not think that is resignationthere are some things under which i do not think i could be resigned at least not with my present feelings  yes you would anne said elizabeth you are just the calm tempered person who would rise up to meet the trial in peacebut i do not know what i am talking about and so i shall go on with what i meant to say beforethat bright visions are my great delight  i like to fancy what horace and edward may be i like to imagine my own mind grown older i like to consider what i shall think of the things that occupy us now but then i am not likely to be disappointed even if my castles in the air should fall down  you know i am not likely to be a longlived person  oh do not say so my dear lizzie cried anne i cannot bear it  indeed anne said elizabeth i did not mean to say anything which could shock you  i only touched upon what you must have known half your life and what mrs hazleby has taken good care that i should not forget  i am perfectly well now and have nothing the matter with me but then i know that a little illness has a great effect upon me and my colds are much sooner caught than cured  before anne could answer there was a knock at the door and lady mertons maid appeared ready to dress her young lady for the evening and thus the conversation ended  the girls were to drink tea in the inner drawingroom as soon as the company were gone into the diningroom and anne and elizabeth waited to come downstairs till dinner had begun  as soon as they entered the room harriet began to admire the lace trimming of annes dress asking many questions about it to all of which anne replied with great good nature  as soon as the lace had been sufficiently discussed harriet turned round to elizabeth exclaiming why lizzie why in the world have you taken to that fashion of doing your hair it makes you look thinner than ever such dark hair too it wants a little colour to relieve it why do you not wear a red band in it like mine  i thought this way of wearing it saved time said elizabeth but i believe i shall curl it again  indeed i hope you will you have no notion how thin it makes you look said harriet  of course i must look thin if i am thin said elizabeth a good deal annoyed by harriets pertinacity  thin you are indeed continued harriet taking hold of her wrist elizabeth drew back hastily and harriet relinquished it conscious perhaps that however thin the arm might look her own broad ruddy hand would hardly bear a comparison with elizabeths long slender white fingers and returned to the subject of the hair shaking her profusion of ringlets  and straight hair is all the fashion now but i think it gives a terrible dowdy look  only that does not signify when you are not outbythebye miss merton are you out  i shall not be seventeen these three months said anne  well i am not seventeen yet nor near it pursued harriet but i always dine out and at home too  dont i lucy  elizabeth did not think it necessary to make any apology for harriets not having been asked to dine with the company since mrs woodbourne had already settled that matter with mrs hazleby but katharine who though younger had more idea of manner said after a little hesitation mamma talked of it but papa said that if one dined all must and there would be too many  oh law kate said harriet never mind i do not mind it a bit i would just as soon drink tea here as dineyou are not out are you lizzie  if you consider that dining constitutes being out i generally am said elizabeth rather coldly and haughtily  ay ay cried harriet laughing you would be out indeed to go without your dinnercapital is not it kate but i wanted to know whether you are regularly come out  i do not know replied elizabeth  oh then you are not said harriet everyone knows who is out i should not have been out now if it had not been for frank hollis he is senior lieutenant at last you knowwell when our officers gave the grand ball at hull frank hollis came to mamma and said they could do nothing without the majors daughter and i must open the ball such nonsense he talkeddidnt he lucy  well mamma gave way and said shed persuade the major  papa was rather grumpy at first you know lucy but we coaxed him over at last  oh it was such fun  i danced first with frank hollisjust out of gratitude you know and then with captain murphy and theno lucy do you remember whoand i had a silk dress which mamma brought from india trimmed just like yours miss merton only with four rows of lace because i am taller you know and a berthe of  elizabeth could endure this no longer and broke in and pray harriet did you learn the book of fashions by heart  not quite said harriet with provoking obtuseness or good humour i did very nearly though when i was making my dress  now lizzie do not you wish you were out  no not in the least said elizabeth by this time quite out of patience i think society a nuisance and i am glad to be free of it as long as i can  lizzie said helen gravely you are talking rhodomontade  by no means helen said elizabeth it is my serious opinion that unless you can find real friends minds that suit you you should keep to yourself and let bores and geese keep to themselves  becoming yourself one of the interesting tribe of bears or perhaps of crabs whispered anne  well what an odd girl you are cried harriet well if ever  but lizzie what would become of the world if there was no society said katherine  and lizzie began helen very seriously do not you know that it is a duty to take part in society that  oh yes helen answered elizabeth i know all that books and wise people say but what i say is this if a sumptuary law could decree that wits should be measured by one standard like the ruffs and rapiers in queen elizabeths time so that those found wanting might be banished there might be some use in meeting people but in the present state of things there is none  but how would you choose your standard said anne everyone would take their own degree of sense as a measure  let them said elizabeth there would be a set of measures like the bolters in a mill one for the pastryflour one for the breadflour one for the blues one for the bran  i am glad you put the blues after the bread said anne there is hope of you yet lizzie  elizabeth was too far advanced in her career of nonsense to be easily checked even by anne and she continued sir walter scott says in one of his letters that he wishes there could be a whole village of poets and antiquaries isolated from the rest of the world  that must be like what i mean  i do not think he meant what he said there said helen  and pray remember said anne that your favourite brown bread is made of all those kinds mixedbran and pastryflour and all  yes said helen all the world would turn idiots if there were not a few sensible people to raise the others  well said elizabeth you know the veillees du chateau says there is a village where all the people do turn idiots at fourteen  you are just the right age helen said anne you had better take care since lizzie says you live in such a foolish world  helen had not tact enough to perceive that it was better to turn off the discussion by a joke and continued and you forget how useful it is to the sensible people to be obliged to bear and forbear  i should be content if the foolish people would be raised by the wise instead of debasing them said elizabeth  if people are really wise they will not let themselves be debased said anne  helen glanced towards lucy elizabeth caught her eye and smiled in a way which almost compensated for all her unkindness in their dispute an hour before  harriet and katherine who had not been much interested by this argument now started another subject of conversation which they had almost entirely to themselves and which occupied them until tea was over somewhat to annes amusement and elizabeths disgust as they listened to it  as soon as the teathings were removed elizabeth and anne went to fetch the children  elizabeth let loose her indignation as soon as she was out of the drawingroom  did you ever hear anything so vulgar said she  indeed it was very ridiculous said anne beginning to laugh at the remembrance  how can you be diverted with things that enrage me said elizabeth  it is better than taking them to heart as you do my poor lizzie said anne they are but folly after all  disgusting provoking folly said elizabeth and then to see kate looking as if she thought it must be so delectable  really kate is quite spoiled between harriet and the abbeychurch riffraff and i can do nothing to prevent it  but said anne diffidently seeing that her cousin was in a graver mood this evening do not you think that perhaps if you could be a little more companionable to kate and not say things so evidently for the sake of contradiction you might gain a little useful influence  well said elizabeth smiling i believe i do deserve a good scolding i fancy i was outrageously rude but when people talk such stuff i do not much care what i say as long as i am on the other side of the question  still the reverse of wrong is not always right said anne  they now found themselves at the nursery door and summoned the children from that scene of playthings and bread and butter downstairs one of those games at romps arose for which little children are often made an excuse by great ones and which was only concluded by the entrance of the ladies from the drawingroom which caused harriet hastily to retreat into the inner drawingroom to smoothe her ruffled lace while katherine was retying winifreds loosened sash and laying a few refractory curls in their right places  mrs woodbourne called elizabeth and introduced her as my eldest daughter to mrs bouverie and to mrs dale a lady who had lately come to live in the neighbourhood and who discovered a most striking resemblance between mrs woodbourne and elizabeth certainly at the expense of a considerable stretch of imagination as mrs woodbourne was a very little and very elegant looking person very fair and pale and elizabeth was tall darkeyed darkhaired her figure much too slender for her height and her movements too rapid to be graceful altogether as different a style of person as could well be imagined  not much prepossessed in favour of the party in general by this specimen elizabeth after shaking hands with miss maynard and her niece people whom she seldom saw and did not much like retreated to one of the windows and there began to meditate as was her usual custom on such occasions  once when accompanying mrs woodbourne on a morning visiting expedition she had translated the erl king which she knew by heart into english far more literal than sir walter scotts and with no fault except that not above half the couplets professed to rhyme and most of those that did were deficient in metre  another time she had composed three quarters of a story of a saxon hero oppressed by a norman baron and going to the crusades and at another time she had sent back the whole party to the times of queen elizabeth and fancied what they might be saying about the spanish armada  but now whether because there was too much talking in the room or because the consecration had lately left no room for the fancies on which she was accustomed to feed she could find nothing more sublime to reflect upon than the appearance of her cousin anne who was entertaining the young miss maynard a shy girl yet pleased with notice by a conversation which if not very interesting saved her from belonging to any of the four agreeable tribes mentioned at teatime  now anne though she did not posses the tall figure or striking countenance of her cousins the woodbournes or the brilliant complexion of her brother was one of those people who always look well  she was small and slightly made and very graceful and everything she wore was appropriate and becoming so that without bestowing much thought on the matter she never looked otherwise than perfectly well dressed  she was rather pale her eyes were grey with long dark lashes and her hair brown her features were well formed and animated and though by no means remarkable everyone called her nicelooking some said she was pretty and a few thought and felt that her countenance was lovely  so much had lately been said about dressabout elizabeths curls and helens tails and annes lacethat wonderful to say it was the readiest subject elizabeth could find to meditate upon  as she looked at her cousins white muslin frock with its border of handsome moravian work and its delicate blue satin ribbons at her well arranged hair and pretty mosaic brooch she entered upon a calculation respecting the portion of a womans mind which ought to be occupied with her dressa mental process the result of which might perhaps have proved of great benefit to herself and ultimately to dora and winifred had it not been suddenly cut short in the midst by a piercing scream from the latter young lady who had been playing on the floor with edward and fido  mrs woodbourne instantly caught up the little girl in her arms and sat down on the sofa with her on her lap while winifred buried her hand in her pockethandkerchief screaming and sobbing violently fido slunk away under the sofa and elizabeth hastily made her way through the circle of ladies who surrounded mrs woodbourne  that is what comes of teazing him said mrs hazleby reproachfully to edward who answered in a loud voice i am sure i did not make him do it  elizabeth knelt down by mrs woodbourne and began to unroll the handkerchief in which winifred had wound up her hand but she was prevented by a fresh scream from the patient  oh my dear never mind do not cry come be a brave woman said poor mrs woodbourne her voice quivering with alarm  poor little dear exclaimed mrs dale she bears it like a little angel but it is quite a severe bite  mamma said elizabeth rising i think she had better come upstairs with me  do not you come mamma i will send for you ifif it is more than a scratch  she took winifred in her arms and carried her off followed by mrs dale miss maynard harriet katherine and dora the lastmentioned looking quite pale with fright  if you please said elizabeth turning round at the foot of the stairs i can manage her better alone  she gained her point though at the expense of politeness  mrs dale and miss maynard retreated and harriet and katherine followed in their train  dora looked inquiringly at her eldest sister  yes dora you may come said she running upstairs to her own room where she shut the door and set winifred on her feet again well winifred let us see said she cheerfully are you much hurt  it bleeds said winifred withholding her hand  not very much said elizabeth removing the handkerchief and washing off the blood which had been more the cause of the scream than the pain  she soon satisfied herself and her sisters that the bite was scarcely more than a scratch and a piece of stickingplaster fetched by dora whose ready eye and clear thoughtful head had already made her the best finder in the family had covered the wound before mrs woodbourne came up to satisfy herself as to the extent of the injury winifred had by this time been diverted from the contemplation of her misfortunes by the fitting on of the stickingplaster and by admiration of annes bright rosewood dressingbox and was full of the delight of discovering that a k m engraven in silver upon the lid stood for anne katherine merton when her mamma came in  it appeared that the little girl and her brother had been playing rather too roughly with fido and that he had revenged himself after the usual fashion of little dogs especially of those not come to years of discretion  winifred was quite ready to assure her mamma that he had scarcely hurt her and that she was very sorry she had cried so much mrs woodbourne and elizabeth however agreed that it would be better for her to appear no more that evening and dora undertook to keep her company in the nurseryglad as elizabeth could see to escape from the presence of aunt hazleby who had sunk much in doras good graces since her conversation with her in the afternoon  if people would but let children alone said elizabeth as the two little girls departed hand in hand it puts me out of all patience to see her first made silly by being pitied and then told she is an angel  too bad and too silly i declare  you should consider a little my dear and not speak so hastily said gentle mrs woodbourne they mean it kindly  mistaken kindness said elizabeth as she opened the drawingroom door  in a moment they were overwhelmed with inquiries for the sweet little sufferer as mrs dale called her  i only hope there is no fear of the dogs being mad observed that lady  oh there is no danger of that said elizabeth knowing how such a terror would dwell on mrs woodbournes spirits  see he can drink  mrs hazleby had taken possession of the creamjug which had accompanied the coffee and was consoling the offender by pouring some of its contents into a saucer for him  but i thought it was water that mad dogs refuse said mrs dale  mad dog cried mrs hazleby he is as mad as i am i fancy it was quite enough to make him bite when edward there was pulling his ears  i did not pull his ears aunt hazleby i did not make him bite winifred vociferated edward i told you so before aunt hazleby and you will say so  fine little fellow whispered mrs dale quite loud enough for edward to hear her i quite admire his spirit  do not be rude edward my dear said his mother  but aunt hazleby will say that i made fido bite winifred mamma said edward and i did not he did it of himself  never mind now my love pray be quiet my dear boy said mrs woodbourne imploringly and edward who was really a very tractable boy walked off to his sister katherine  mrs dale then seized upon mrs woodbourne to tell her some horrible stories of hydrophobia and elizabeth in hopes of lessening the impression such stories were likely to make on mrs woodbournes mind listened also sometimes not very courteously correcting evident exaggerations and at others contradicting certain statements  at last just as the subject fertile as it was was exhausted annes going to the piano and carrying off a train of listeners brought mrs bouverie next to elizabeth and she took the opportunity of entering into conversation with her  do you play miss woodbourne  no i do not replied elizabeth who particularly disliked this mode of beginning a conversation  do not you like music continued mrs bouverie  i seldom have heard any i liked said elizabeth shortly  indeed you have been unfortunate said mrs bouverie but perhaps you are not fond of the piano  no said elizabeth with rather less of the manner of a suspected criminal examined in sight of the rack i am sick of all the abbeychurch pianos i know them all perfectly and hear nothing else  mrs bouverie laughed and was glad to obtain something like an answer your cousin plays very well said she  yes said elizabeth i like her music better than most peoples and she does not make a great fuss about it she plays when she thinks people like it and not when they ask only out of politeness without caring about it  do you think many people ask in that manner said mrs bouverie  oh yes everyone said elizabeth what can they do when they see a disconsolate damsel sitting in a corner with nothing to say and only longing to be at the piano by way of doing something  it would be too cruel not to ask her  did you ever do so said mrs bouverie smiling  no said elizabeth luckily it is no affair of mine yet but if ever it was there would be a hard struggle between my politeness and sincerity  sincerity would be most likely to gain the day thought mrs bouverie  perhaps said she you are not a fair judge of other peoples sincerity since you do not like music yourself  i think said elizabeth that even if i did play i could see in peoples faces whether they meant what they said that is if vanity and love of applause did not blind me  mrs bouverie was silent for a moment and then said well i must say i am disappointed to find that you do not play  elizabeth remembered how well her mother had played and it was plain to her that mrs bouverie was noticing her for her mothers sake  she looked down and coloured as she replied both my sisters are musical and helen is said to be likely to sing very well  i believe the history of my want of music to be added she with a bright smile that i was too naughty to learn and now i am afraidi am not sorry for it as it would have taken up a great deal of time and two singing sisters are surely enough for one family  i was in hopes of hearing said mrs bouverie that you had trained your schoolchildren to sing the sixtyfifth psalm as nicely as they did today  i am sure their teacher must have come from the vicarage  no said elizabeth it was the schoolmaster who taught them perhaps if helen had not been from home so long she might have helped the girls but when she came home three weeks ago it was hardly worth while for her to begin  that is the only reason i ever wished to understand music  mrs bouverie now began talking to her about the church and its architecture and of the children in exactly the way that elizabeth liked and in half an hour she saw more of elizabeths true self than miss maynard had ever seen though she had known her all her life miss maynard had seen only her roughness  mrs bouverie had found her way below it   elizabeth was as sincere and open as the day although from seldom meeting with anyone who could comprehend or sympathize with her ideas her manners had acquired a degree of roughness and reserve difficult to penetrate and anything but attractive suiting ill with her sweet smile and beaming eyes  she was talking quite happily and confidentially to mrs bouverie when she caught mrs woodbournes eye and seeing her look anxious she remembered winifreds disaster and took the first opportunity of hastening upstairs to see whether the little girls hand was still in as favourable a state as when she left her  a few moments after she had quitted the room sir edward merton approached mrs bouverie and took the place beside her which elizabeth had lately occupied  i hope elizabeth has been gracious to you as i see you have been so kind as to talk to her said he smiling  oh i hope we are becoming good friends said mrs bouverie i have seldom seen so young a girl shew as much mind as your niece  i am very glad to hear you say so said sir edward for she is apt to be rather more reserved with strangers than could be wished  perhaps she did not consider me as an entire stranger i remember seeing her once when a most engaging little child of four or five years old said mrs bouverie and now i hope our acquaintance will continue  shall we see her at marlowe court tomorrow as i believe we meet you there  of course we shall see miss merton  no i believe not said sir edward we are rather too large a number without the girls who really form quite a troop by themselves  i like to see your daughter and miss woodbourne together said mrs bouverie i am sure they must be great allies  yes said sir edward there is a tolerably strong cousinly friendship between them anne has a wholesome feeling of inferiority which makes her rather proud of her cousins preference  do you not think miss woodbourne very like her mother said mrs bouverie  i knew her immediately by the resemblance  veryvery like her a little darker certainly said sir edward but she reminds me of her constantlytherethat smile is my sisters exactly  elizabeth had just then reentered the room and was assuring her mamma that winifred had been as playful as ever all the remainder of the evening and was now fast asleep in bed  i am only afraid she is too fragile and delicate a creature said mrs bouverie is her health strong  strong no not very said sir edward she requires care but there is nothing much amiss with her i know most people about here are in the habit of lamenting over her as in a most dangerous state but i believe the fact is that mrs woodbourne is a nervous anxious person and frightens herself more than there is any occasion for  then i hope she generally looks less delicate than she does tonight said mrs bouverie  oh she may well look overworked tonight said sir edward she has a spirit in her which would not let her rest on such a day as thiscome here miss lizzie said he beckoning to her i want you to account for those two red spots upon your cheeks  do you think they ought to be there  yes if they come in a good cause uncle said elizabeth  do you mean then to wear them any longer than necessary said sir edward pray have you sat still for five minutes together today  yes while i was at tea said elizabeth  and why are not you in bed and asleep at this moment asked her uncle  that is the very question mamma has been asking said elizabeth and i have been promising to depart as soon as i can make my escape so good night uncle edwardgood night said she giving her hand to her uncle and to mrs bouverie with almost equal cordiality  good night lizzie get you gone said sir edward and if you can carry off my girl with you i shall be all the better pleased  elizabeth succeeded in touching annes arm and the two cousins flitted away together and soon forgot the various delights and annoyances of the day in sleep     chapter vi   the next morning was gloomy and rainy as elizabeth informed anne at about seven oclock and i am not sorry for it said she for i want to have you all to myself at home so we will turn the incubi over to kate and helen and be comfortable together  will they submit to such treatment said anne  oh yes my dear said elizabeth they want us as little as we want them they only want a little civility and i will not be so sparing of that useful commodity as i was yesterday evening  and now anne i am going to beg your pardon for being so excessively rude to harriet as i was last night  she did not mind it but you did and much more than if it had been to yourself  i believe i did said anne other people do not know what you mean when you set up your bristles and i do  besides i was sorry for lucy who looks as if she had sensitiveness enough for the whole family  poor lucy said elizabeth             a weary lot is thine fair maid              a weary lot is thine   yes lucy has very deep feeling you may see it in the painful flushing of her cheek and the downcast look of her eye when her mother and sister expose themselves  i really believe that that poor girl has more to endure than most people  o lizzie said anne how differently you spoke of her yesterday  yes said elizabeth but then i was furious with mrs hazleby and besides i believe the truth was that i was very tired and very cross not exactly the way in which i intended to conclude the consecration day and now i am in my senses i am very sorry i behaved as i did but anne though i hereby retract all i said in dispraise of lucy and confess that i was rude to harriet do not imagine that i disavow all i said about society last night for i assure you that i expressed my deliberate opinion  your deliberate opinion my dear said anne laughing  yes my deliberate opinion my dear repeated elizabeth  pray why should not i have a deliberate opinion as well as hannah more or locke on the human understanding or anyone else  because rejoined anne i think that if the rest of the world were of your deliberate opinion there would soon be a lock on the human understanding  i am sure i think there is at present returned elizabeth did you see aunt anne last night wasted upon mrs dale obliged to listen to the dullest stuff that ever was invented and poor mamma frightened out of her wits  i should not wonder if she had dreamt of mad dogs all night  i do not defend mrs dales powers of intellect said anne but i should have thought that you at least had little reason to complain you were very well off next to mrs bouverie  oh mrs bouverie is a rara avis an exception to the general rule said elizabeth but you know she or my uncle or aunt or papa are generally forced to put a lock on their understanding  why anne what are you laughing at  lizzie i beg your pardon said anne trying to check herself but i could not help it  your speech put me in mind of the prints from albanos four elements  do not you remember junos visit to aeolus where he is opening the door of a little corner cupboard where he keeps the puffcheeked winds locked up  do you mean to say that mamma keeps her mighty powers of mind locked up in the same way for fear they should burst out and overwhelm everybody  elizabeth heartily joined in her cousins merriment  i will tell you what i do mean anne what the great law of society is  now do not put on that absurd face of mock gravity or i shall only laugh instead of arguing properly  well let us hear said anne  it is almost more important than the law that you must eat with a knife and fork said elizabeth  there is one level of conversation fit for the meanest capacity and whoever ventures to transgress it is instantly called blue or a horrid bore c c  nonsense lizzie said anne laughing i am sure i have heard plenty of clever people talk about sensible things too and never did i hear them called bores or blue or any of your awful et ceteras either  because people did not dare to do so said elizabeth but they thought it all the same  what do you mean by people said anne  the dull respectable commonplace gentry who make up the mass of mankind said elizabeth  do they said anne  do not they said elizabeth  i do not know what the mass of mankind may be at abbeychurch said anne but i am sure the people whom we see oftenest at home are such as i think it a privilege to know  and she began to enumerate these friends  oh anne interrupted elizabeth do not for pitys sake make me discontented here am i in abbeychurch and must make the best of it i must be as polite and hypocritical as i can make myself  i must waste my time and endure dullness  as to waste of time said anne perhaps it is most usefully employed in what is so irksome as you find being in company  mamma has always wished me to remember that acquiring knowledge may after all be but a selfish gratification and many things ought to be attended to first  that doctrine would not do for everybody said elizabeth  no said anne but it does for us and you will see it plainer if you remember on what authority it is said that all knowledge is profitable for nothing without charity  charity yes said elizabeth but christian love is a very different thing from drawingroom civility  not very different from bearing and forbearing as helen said answered anne  politeness is not great enough said elizabeth to belong to charity  you are not the person to say so said anne  because i dislike it so much said elizabeth but that is because i despise it  it is such folly to sit a whole evening with your hands before you doing nothing  but do you not think said anne that enduring restraint and listening to what is not amusing for the sake of pleasing others is doing something  passively not actively said elizabeth but it is not to please others it is only that they may think you well bred or rather that they may not think about you at all  it is to please our father and mother said anne  yes and that is the reason it must be done said elizabeth it is the way of the world and cannot be helped  rather say it is the trial which has been ordained for us said anne  well said elizabeth smiling i know all the time that you have the best of the argument  it would not be so if it was not good for us  and as it is said anne i believe that there is more enjoyment in the present order of things than there would be in any arrangement we could devise  oh doubtless said elizabeth just as the corn ripens better with all the disasters that seem to befall it than it would if we had the command of the clouds  of course said anne you really are a much more reasonable creature than you pretend to be lizzie  am i said elizabeth  well i will just tell you my great horror and i suppose you will laugh at me  i can endure gossip for old people who cannot employ themselves and must talk and have nothing to talk of but their neighbours but only think of those wretched fainéants who go chattering on wasting their own time and other peoples doing no good on the face of the earth and a great deal of harm  but these unfortunates are probably quite as unable to talk on any very wise subjects as your beloved old people to whom you give a license to gossip said anne and you do not wish to condemn them to perpetual silence  they are most likely to be estimable people who ought to be amused  estimableyes perhaps said elizabeth but then i cannot esteem a silly gossip  why lizzie cried anne you are still at the old story that it is better to be wicked than stupid at least you reason upon that foundation though you do not really think so  i believe said elizabeth that there must be some great crook in my mind for though i know and believe as firmly as i do any other important thing that mere intellect is utterly worthless i cannot feel it it bewitches me as beauty does some people and i suppose always will till i grow old and stupid or get my mind into better order  really said anne i think the strongest proof of your beginning to grow old and stupid is your doing such a very commonplace thing as to abuse honest gossip  there was service at st marys church on wednesday and friday mornings but on this day the rain was so violent that of all the party at the vicarage the mertons and elizabeth katherine and helen alone ventured to go to church  when they returned anne followed her mother to her room to talk over the events of the previous day  after much had been said of the consecration and also of their wonder and regret at ruperts absence anne said how strange it seems to lose sight of you and papa as i have done ever since i have been here  mamma i have scarcely been with you at all and never see papa but when he is talking to uncle woodbourne and everyone else is in the room  but i hope you are enjoying yourself my dear said lady merton  oh yes mamma cried anne lizzie is more delightful than ever when we are alone  are you taking a sudden romantic turn said lady merton smiling do you mean in future to keep one friend all to yourself  oh no mamma said anne laughing i only meant that lizzie is more like herself when we are alone together  sometimes when the others are there she gets vexed and says things which i do not like to hear only for the sake of differing from them  i have seen something of the kind about her before said lady merton but not enough to be unpleasant  no mamma because you do not talk as miss hazleby did yesterday said anne smiling  she certainly did make a very ridiculous oration about officers and flirtations but lizzie instead of putting a stop to it quietly and gently only went into the other extreme and talked about disliking all society  i am very sorry to hear this said lady merton i am afraid she will make herself absurd and disagreeable by this spirit of contradiction even if nothing worse comes of it  it was not all out of a spirit of contradiction said anne though she said this morning that she was very tired and very cross yesterday evening  but mamma she also said that she thinks the time she spends in company wasted and she really believes that no one dares to talk sense or that if he does everyone dislikes him  that is only a little unconscious affectation of being wiser than other people assisted by living in a place where there are the usual complement of dull people and where her fathers situation prevents him from associating only with those whom he would prefer said lady merton her good sense will get the better of it  i am much more anxious about this spirit of contradiction  yes it certainly led her to be very unjust as she acknowledged this morning said anne and rather unkind to helen  but then it was no wonder that she was mad with the hazlebys  anne then told the history of poor doras trouble and was quite satisfied with her mothers displeasure at mrs hazleby and her admiration of little dora  and what do you think of helen asked she presently  i can hardly tell said anne she is still very demure with very little of lizzies sparkling merriment indeed she does not seem in the least able to enter into a joke  but then she said some very sensible things  lizzie said she wondered what we should think of her she thinks her very much improved but complains that she has lost her home feelings and cares only for dykelands i scarcely know what she means  i think that i can guess said lady merton from knowing a little more of mrs stauntons character  she is a very amiable person and has in reality i believe plenty of good sense but she has allowed herself to fall into an exaggerated style of feeling and expression which i dare say bewitched a girl like helen and now makes her find home cold and desolate  like the letter which mrs staunton wrote to you about rupert and which papa called ecstatic said anne  that is an instance of mrs stauntons way of expressing herself said lady merton now i will give you one of her acuteness of feeling as she calls it  your aunt katherine was her greatest friend when she was a girl though i believe the kind epithets she lavished upon me would have been enough to stock two or three moderate friendships  we all used to walk together and spend at least one evening in the week together  one evening your aunt who had a good deal of the same high careless spirit which you observe in lizzie chanced to make some observation upon the rudeness of sailors in general forgetting that helen atherleys brother was a sailor  or if she had remembered it said anne judging by lizzie she would have said the same thing she would have taken it for granted that the present company was always excepted  captain atherley was not of the present company said lady merton he was in the mediterranean and it happened that he had not had time to call at merton hall in due form the last time he had been at home so that poor helen thought that this speech was aimed at him she said nothing at the time but next morning arrived a note to me to entreat me to find out what her darling henry could possibly have done to offend dearest katherine merton for she should be wretched till she understood it and katherine had forgiven her and him  she assured me that she had lain awake all night thinking it over and had at last come to the conclusion that it must be this unfortunate omission and she promised to write to dear henry immediately to make him send all possible apologies  poor captain atherley exclaimed anne and what could my aunt say  unfortunately said lady merton both she and i had entirely forgotten the speech and could not guess what could have given rise to helens imaginations  after a consultation i was deputed to helen with many assurances that katherine was very sorry she could not exactly tell why but for whatever had grieved helen and after a good deal of kissing and lamenting on both sides which i believe katherine considered as a punishment for her inconsiderate speech things were set right again  inconsiderate mamma said anne that seems as if you blamed my aunt when it seems to me that mrs staunton deserved all the blame for her excessive folly and what i should think want of confidence in her friends affection  it was certainly very silly said lady merton but you know anne that when people have once accustomed themselves to get into a habit of making mountains of molehills they cannot see anything as it really is  i thought katherine quite in the right as you do now but i believe she considered that knowing as she did the oversensitiveness of her friend she should have been more cautious in what she said  that was the right way for her to take it said anne but i still think mrs staunton must be an excessively silly person  of course one would wish to keep from hurting peoples feelings but it really is hardly possible to help it if they will ride out to meet offence in such a way  yet anne said her mother you may comfort yourself with knowing that as long as you do what is commanded set a watch before your lips you are not likely to wound the feelings of others however sensitive  i know mamma said anne that would correct every fault of that kind but then i hardly know how to do so thoroughly  and i think sensitiveness is a good thingat least it makes people know better what will hurt others  be sensitive for others without being ready to take offence for yourself then anne said lady merton  and now that you have fitted the moral to my story i must go down and help mrs woodbourne to entertain mrs hazleby  i pity you said anne  if everyone or indeed if half the world were like her i should be more violent in my opinions than lizzie is  and what are you going to do asked lady merton  i am going to sit in the schoolroom said anne i had a special invitation from dora this morning  on going downstairs anne found that katherine and harriet had gone to spend the morning with the mrs turner mentioned during the walk to st austins as her daughter miss wilhelmina had engaged to teach harriet to make wax flowers  lucy was upstairs writing to major hazleby and helen was sitting in the schoolroom where elizabeth was teaching the children  little winifred had just finished her lessons and was skipping off in high glee with her medal round her neck to tell her mamma that she had gained four good marks  dora was perched on a high stool at elizabeths desk with a broadly ruled paper before her on the top of which the words my dear horace st austins church was consecrated yesterday were to be seen in fair round hand no more was visible for the little girl laughingly laid down her rosy cheek and all her light wavy curls flat upon the letter as  anne advanced and made a stealthy attempt to profit by the intelligence she was sending to her brother  edward was standing by elizabeth reading mrs trimmers fabulous histories for though five years old he made very slow progress in english literature being more backward in learning to read than any of the others had been excepting helen  he did not like the trouble of spelling and was in the habit of guessing at every word he did not know and on his very composedly calling old joe the gardener the old gander anne burst into an irrepressible giggle and helen sedate as she was could not help following her example  they had just composed themselves when edward made another blunder which set them off again and elizabeth who when alone with the children could bear anything with becoming gravity also gave way  edward finding that he was diverting them began to make absurd mistakes on purpose so that elizabeth was forced to call him to order anne thought it best to leave the room and helen followed her saying we had better leave lizzie to manage him by herself she always does better without me  you have never shewn me your drawings helen said anne i should like very much to see them if you will let me  if you please said helen  will you come up to my room  i keep all my own things there out of the way of the critics  what critics inquired anne  lizzie to be sure and papa said helen i think them the severest people i know  do you indeed said anne  do not you said helen does not lizzie say the sharpest things possible  i am sure she does to me and she never likes anything i do if there is any little fault in it she and papa always look at that rather than anything else  well said anne it is a comfort that if they like anything you do you are sure it is really very good  their praise is worth more than that of other people  helen sighed but made no reply as by this time they had arrived at the door of the room which she shared with katherine  it was a complete contrast to elizabeths it was larger and lighter and looked out upon the bright garden the almshouses and the church tower  the upper part of the window was occupied by katherines large cage of canary birds and below was a stand of flowerpots a cactus which never dreamt of blossoming an iceplant and a columnia belonging to katherine a nourishing daphne of helens and a verbena and a few geranium cuttings which she had brought from dykelands looking very miserable under cracked tumblers and stemless wineglasses  on a small round table were very prettily arranged various little knicknacks and curiosities which elizabeth always laughed at such as a glass ship which was surrounded with miniature wateringpots hummingtops knives and forks a tonbridgeware box a goldstudded horn bonbonniere a breakwatermarble ruler several varieties of pincushions a penwiper with a doll in the middle of it a little dish of moneycowries and another of indian shot the seed of the mahogany tree some seaeggs a false book made of the wreck of the royal george and some pieces of spar and petrifactions which helen had acquired on an expedition to matlock with the stauntons  the bookshelf however was to anne the most attractive object in the room and whilst helen was untying the strings of her portfolio she went up to it  what a beautiful little bishop wilson exclaimed she taking out one of the books  yes said helen with a sigh that was dear mrs stauntons last present to me before i left dykelands  she said that perhaps she should not see me again before i was confirmed and it was the fittest godmothers gift she could find  and is this pretty lady of the lake yours too said anne what a pretty binding with the douglas arms on it  yes said helen that was fannys present and jane gave me the pretty forgetmenot brooch i wore yesterday  you see i have plenty of keepsakes from the dear people  anne then turned to the portfolio on the table  helen shewed her in the first place a rather stiff and formal looking forgetmenot painted by fanny staunton and a carelessly sketched but neatly shaded head drawn by jane both which specimens of art anne tried hard to admire for helens sake but could not find it in her heart to do so helens own drawings which were landscapes gave more promise of improvement and displayed a good deal of taste and freedom of hand though some were by no means correct in the outline helen pointed out several faults which she candidly acknowledged to be wrong and some others which she said lizzie called blunders  there said she is the house at dear dykelands there is my window with the banksia roses clustering round it so that i could gather them as i stood in my room  that room is still to be called helens  but now anne do you think that line ought to be straight lizzie says it should but i think the perspective alters it i am sure i saw it so  indeed helen said anne i think the shadow must have deceived you  and with a little trouble she proved that elizabeth was right  ah said helen if lizzie would but have shewn me patiently instead of saying why helen cannot you draw a straight line i should have understood her  then she continued while taking out indiarubber and pencil to rectify the mistake i used to draw a great deal at dear dykelands we had a sketching master and used to go out with him twice a week but it was very delightful when we three went alone when one of us used to read while the others drew i am sure these sketches will for ever remind me of those happy days  why helen said anne smiling you speak as if you never meant to be happy again  do i said poor helen i am afraid i do seem rather silly about dear dykelands  the other day i was singing       my hearts in the highlands my heart is not here       my hearts in the highlands gone chasing the deer  when in came lizzie and said no helen        your heart is at dykelands your hearts in the bogs       your heart is at dykelands gone chasing the frogs  for she is always laughing at it for being so damp dear place  and it was before horace went to school and he would do nothing but sing it at me all day and make winifred do so too  anne could not help laughing  then you too think me absurd said helen but if you only knew how happy i was at dykelands and how desolate i sometimes feel here you would not wonder at me  then you do not like abbeychurch said anne incredulously she could not say you are not happy at home  who could prefer a little dismal town to a pleasant house in the country said helen you like merton hall better than this place do not you anne  of course replied anne but then merton hall is my home  and abbeychurch is mine sighed poor helen  i believe it is very wrong to be discontented with home but i cannot help it  my dear helen what do you mean exclaimed anne quite aghast  indeed anne said helen i do not wonder that you are shocked but you do not know how i feel here  at dykelands i felt that people liked me and were pleased with me but at home nobody wants me nobody cares for me i am in the way wherever i go  my dear helen cried anne that must be fancy  i wish it was said poor helen shaking her head  but only think proceeded anne what you are accusing them of not loving you and wishing you away  no i do not say it is as bad as that said helen but i am sure i am of no use here and might as well be away  i suppose said anne that you have been so long away as to have lost all your old home occupations and you have not yet had time to make new ones  perhaps it is so said helen but i do not think i had any occupations before i went to dykelands at least none worth having and now i cannot make myself new ones  lizzie does everything and will not let me help her for fear i should do mischief  now helen said anne who had by this time collected her ideas which had been completely startled by her cousins avowal of dislike of home i will tell you what i think mamma would say to you  i think you used to be indolent and waste your senses but now dykelands has given you a spur and you are very much improved  do you really think so interrupted helen who had lately felt quite starved for want of praise  yes said anne and so does everyone and so lizzie told me  lizzie said helen i thought she considered me as great a baby as ever  no no my dear said anne i will tell you what she said of you she said you were almost all she could wish in a sister and that you were quite a reflective creature and that is high praise from her  well if she thinks so said helen she does not shew it she is always making game of my opinions and feelings  so she does of almost everyones said anne but that is no proof that she does not love them  and she will never listen to anything that i say or take interest in anything i care for continued helen  indeed helen you only think so because you do not understand her ways said anne all last month she could think of nothing but the consecration and horaces going to school  now all that is over and you are quiet again after we are gone you will get on capitally together  i am sure she contradicts every word i say said helen  that is not out of unkindness i assure you said anne who unfortunately could not deny that such was the fact  she only likes an argument which sharpens your wits and does no harm if both sides are but goodhumoured and cheerful  she will find you out in time and you will understand her better  oh lizzie is delightful when she does not contradict said helen she is cleverer than anyone i ever saw even than fanny staunton and papa says her patience and diligence with horace were beyond all praise but i can never be clever enough for her to make me her friend  but you do not think people choose their friends only for their cleverness said anne  why no said helen i do not think they ought but lizzie does you would not be her friend if you were not clever  well said anne but try and convince her that you can be her friend without being clever if you will not allow that you are  oh said helen brightening up if lizzie would but make a friend of me how happy we should be if she would but talk to me of her own concerns and listen to mine  but she never chooses to hear me speak of dykelands  then said anne you must remember that she has never been there and does not know the people  yes said helen but i think that if she had been there and i at home i should have listened for her sake besides that mrs staunton was our own mammas dearest friend  anne had always thought that her own mother had been aunt katherines dearest friend but she had forbearance enough to leave the honour to mrs staunton in helens imagination and answered and for that very reason and for your sake too helen she will delight to hear about mrs staunton when you are quiet together if you do not give her too much at a time or talk of dykelands when she is thinking of something else  oh yes helen you and lizzie will be excellent friends unless you are much more silly than i think either of you  anne smiled so cheerfully that helen could not help smiling too but she would probably have found another sorrow to lament over if at this moment dora had not come up to summon them to their early dinner  helen felt exceedingly grateful to anne for having listened so kindly and patiently to her list of grievances  it was the first sympathy as she considered that she had met with since she had left dykelands and it atoned in her mind for various little thoughtless ways of annes which had wounded her in former years and which she had not perhaps striven sufficiently to banish from her memory and this was a great advantage from this conversation even if she derived no further benefit from it  on her side anne had some thoughts of telling elizabeth what helens feelings really were in hopes that she might shew a little regard for them but sisterless herself she thought the bond of sisterhood too sacred to be rashly interfered with by a strangers hand besides she considered helens complaints as really confidential if not expressly so and resolved to mention them to no one but lady merton and to limit her attempts at being useful to bringing the two sisters before each other in their most amiable light and at any rate to avoid saying anything that could possibly occasion a discussion between them though she could hardly imagine that it was possible to dislike one of the merry arguments that she delighted in however remembering her mothers story of mrs staunton she decided that though it was a great misfortune for people to have such strange fancies yet their friends ought to respect them     chapter vii   as soon as dinner was over elizabeth went up to her own room and was followed in a few moments by anne who found her putting on her bonnet and cloak  can you be going out in such weather as this exclaimed she  yes said elizabeth i must            let content with my fortunes fit            though the rain it raineth every day   but what are the fortunes which oblige you to go out said anne  the fortunes of an old woman to whom kate or i read every friday said elizabeth and the fortunes of various young schoolchildren who must be prepared for papa or mr walker to catechize in church on sunday  why do not you send kate or helen instead of murdering yourself in the wet said anne  miss kitty is three inches deep in the mysteries of a spencer i do not mean edmund said elizabeth and it will not be out of her head these three days at least not till she has made mammas old black satin gown into one after harriets pattern i heard her asking for it as i came upstairs  and would not helen go said anne she does not catch cold as easily as you do  helen has contrived somehow or other said elizabeth to know no more about the schoolchildren than if they were so many esquimaux besides anyone with any experience of helens ways had rather walk ninety miles in the rain than be at the pains of routing her out of the corner of the sofa to do anything useful  indeed said anne i think helen does wish to make herself useful  i dare say she sits still and wishes it in the abstract for i think it must be a very disagreeable thing to reflect that she might as well be that plaster statue for any good that she does said elizabeth but she grumbles at every individual thing you propose for her to do just as she says she wishes to be a companion to dora and winifred yet whenever they wish her to play with them or tell them a story which is all the companionship children of their age understand she is always too much at her ease to be disturbed  and now as she is the only person in the house with whom poor lucy is tolerably at her ease it would be cruel to take her away  that is more of a reason said anne what a pity it is that lucy is so shy  excessive shyness and reserve is what prevents her mother from being able to spoil her said elizabeth so do not regret it  still i do not like to see you going out in this way said anne  i may truly say that rain never hurts me said elizabeth and if i once let one trifle stop me in these parish matters i shall be stopped for ever and never do anything  perhaps i shall not come back this hour and a half for old mrs clayton must be dying to hear all about our consecration luncheon dinner c and as she is the widow of the last vicar we are in duty bound to be civil to her and i must go and call upon her  oh you poor thing i forgot how deserted you will be and really the drawingroom is almost uninhabitable with that bengal tiger in it  here is that delightful norman conquest for you to read pray look at the part about hereward the saxon  elizabeth would not trust herself to stay with anne any longer and ran downstairs and might soon be heard putting up her umbrella and shutting the front door after her  anne found the afternoon pass rather heavily in spite of the companionship of william the conqueror and hereward the saxon of assisting the children in a wet day game of romps and of shewing dora and winifred the contents of the box they had admired the day before helen and lucy were sitting at work very comfortably in the corner of the sofa in the inner drawingroom harriet and katherine very busy contriving the spencer in the front drawingroom keeping up a whispering accompaniment to the conversation of the elder ladiesif conversation it could be called when mrs hazleby had it all to herself while giving lady merton and mrs woodbourne an account of the discomforts she had experienced in country quarters in ireland  sir edward and mr woodbourne were engaged in looking over the accounts of the church in the study and fido was trying to settle his disputes with meg merrilies who with arching back tail erect and eyes like flaming green glass waged a continual war with him over her basket in the hall  anne was very glad to hear her cousins footstep in the hall as she returned  coming straight to the drawingroom elizabeth exclaimed mamma did you tell mrs clarke that she might have a frock for susan  yes my dear said mrs woodbourne she asked me yesterday when you were not near and i told her you would give her one  i thought the child looked very ragged  i suppose she must have it said elizabeth looking much vexed i told her she should not a month ago unless she sent the children to school regularly and they have scarcely been there five days in the last fortnight  i wish i had known it my dear said mrs woodbourne you know i am always very sorry to interfere with any of your plans  o mamma there is no great harm done said elizabeth  she then went to fetch the frock and gave it to the woman with a more gentle and sensible rebuke than could have been expected from the vehemence of her manner towards mrs woodbourne a minute before  when this was done and she had taken off her bonnet she came to beckon anne upstairs  so you have finished your labours said anne taking up her work while elizabeth sat down to rule a copybook for winifred  yes said elizabeth we are free to sport and play i have read to the old woman and crammed the children and given old mrs clayton a catalogue raisonnee of all the company and all their dresses and a bill of fare of our luncheon and dinner and where everything came from  and yet you profess to hold gossip in abomination said anne  oh but this is old gossip regular legitimate amusement for the poor old lady said elizabeth  she really is a lady but very badly off and most of the abbeychurch gentility are too fine to visit her so that a little quiet chat with her is by no means of the commonplace kind  besides she knows and loves us all like her own children  it was one of the first pleasures i can remember to gather roses for her and carry them to her from her own old garden here  well in consideration of all that you say said anne i suppose i must forgive her for keeping you away all this afternoon  and what did you do all that time said elizabeth  have you read hereward and do not you delight in him  yes said anne and i want to know whether he is not the father of cedric of rotherwood  he must have been his grandfather said elizabeth cedric lived a hundred years after  but cedric remembered torquilstone before the normans came said anne  no no he could not though he had been told what it had been before frontdeboeuf altered it said elizabeth  and old ulrica was there when frontdeboeufs father took it said anne  i cannot tell how long a hag may live said elizabeth but she could not have been less than a hundred and thirty years old in the time of richard coeurdelion  coeurdelion came to the throne in 1189 said anne  no i suppose torquil wolfganger could not have been dispossessed immediately after the conquest  but then you know ulrica calls cedric the son of the great hereward  her wits were a little out of order said elizabeth either she meant his grandson or sir walter scott made as great an anachronism as when he made that same ulrica compare rebeccas skin to paper  if she had said parchment it would not have been such a compliment  how much interest ivanhoe makes us take in the saxons and normans said anne  and what nonsense it is to say that works of fiction give a distaste for history said elizabeth  you are an instance to the contrary said anne no one loves stories so well and no one loves history better  i believe such stories as ivanhoe were what taught me to like history said elizabeth  in order to find out the anachronisms in them said anne i think it is very ungrateful of you  no indeed said elizabeth why they used to be the only history i knew and almost the only geography  do not you remember aunt annes laughing at me for arguing that bohemia was on the baltic because perdita was left on its coast  and now i believe that coeur de lion feasted with robin hood and his merry men although history tells me that he disliked and despised the english and the only sentence of their language history records of his uttering was he speaks like a fool briton  i believe that queen margaret of anjou haunted the scenes of grandeur that once were hers and that she lived to see the fall of charles of burgundy and die when her last hope failed her though i know that it was not so  then i do not quite see how such stories have taught you to like history said anne  they teach us to realize and understand the people whom we find in history said elizabeth  oh yes said anne who would care for louis the eleventh if it was not for quentin durward and shakespeare makes us feel as if we had been at the battle of shrewsbury  yes said elizabeth and they have done even more for history they have taught us to imagine other heroes whom they have not mentioned cannot you see the black prince his slight graceful figure his fair delicate face full of gentleness and kindnessfierce warrior as he ishis black steel helmet and tippet of chainmail his clustering white plume his surcoat with englands leopards and frances lilies cannot you make a story of his long constant attachment to his beautiful cousin the fair maid of kent  cannot you imagine his courteous conference with bertrand du guesclin the brave ugly bretonedward lying almost helpless on his couch broken down with suffering and disappointment and the noble affectionate captal de buch who died of grief for him thinking whether he will ever be able to wear his black armour again and carry terror and dismay to the stoutest hearts of france  give froissart some of the credit of your picture said anne  froissart is in some places like sir walter himself said elizabeth but now i will tell you of a person who lived in no days of romance and has not had the advantage of a poetical historian to light him up in our imagination  i mean the great prince of conde now though he is very unlike shakespeares coriolanus yet there is resemblance enough between them to make the comparison very amusing there was much of coriolanus indomitable pride and horror of mob popularity when he offended beaufort and his kingdom in the halles when though as louis de bourbon he refused to do anything to shake the power of the throne he would not submit to be patronized by the mean fawning mazarin  not that the hardhearted conde would have listened to his wife and mother even if he had loved them as coriolanus did or that his arrogance did not degenerate into wonderful meanness at last such as coriolanus would have scorned but the parallel was very amusing and gave me a great interest in conde  and did you ever observe what a great likeness there is in the characters of the two apostates julian and frederick the great  then you like history for the sake of comparing the characters mentioned in it said anne  i think so said elizabeth and that is the reason i hate abridgements the mere bare bones of history  i cannot bear dry facts such as that charles the fifth beat francis the first at pavia in a war for the duchy of milan and nothing more told about them  i am always ready to say as the grand seignior did about some such great battle among the christians that i do not care whether the dog bites the hog or the hog bites the dog  what a kind interest in your fellowcreatures you display said anne i think one reason why i like history is because i am searching out all the characters who come up to my notion of perfect chivalry or rather of christian perfection  i am making a book of true knights  i copy their portraits when i can find them and write the names of those whose likenesses i cannot get  i paint their armorial bearings over them when i can find out what they are and i have a great red cross in the first page  and i will tell you of something else to put at the beginning said elizabeth a branch of laurel entwined with the beautiful white bindweed  one of our laurels was covered with wreaths of it last year and i thought it was a beautiful emblem of a purehearted hero the glaring sun which withers the fair white spotless flower is like worldly prosperity spoiling the pure simple mind and you know how often it is despised and torn away from the laurel to which it is so bright an ornament  yes said anne it clings more safely and fearlessly round the simplest and most despised of plants  and would you call the little pink bindweed childish innocence  no i do not think i should said elizabeth it is not sufficiently stainless  but then innocence from not seeing or knowing what is wrong is not like the guilelessness which can use the world as not abusing it  yet adam and eve fell when they gained the knowledge of good and evil said anne  yes because they gained their knowledge by doing evil said elizabeth but you must allow that what is tried and not found wanting is superior to what has failed only because it has had no trial  st johns day is placed nearer christmas than that of the holy innocents  and st john knew what evil was said anne yes you are right there  you speak as if you still had some fault to find with me anne said elizabeth  no indeed i have not said anne i quite agree with you it was only your speaking of knowledge of evil us a kind of advantage that startled me  because you think knowledge and discernment my idol said elizabeth but we have wandered far away from my white convolvulus and i have not done with it yet  when autumn came and the leaves turned bright yellow it was a golden crown  but there your comparison ends said anne the laurel ought to vanish away and leave the golden wreath behind  no said elizabeth call the golden wreath the crown of glory on the brow of the old saintlike hero and remember that when he dies the immortality the world prizes is that of the coarse evergreen laurel and no one dreams of his white wreath  i wish you would make a poem of your comparison for the beginning of my book of chivalry said anne  it will not do said elizabeth i am no poet besides if i wished to try just consider what a name the flower hasconvolvulus a prosaic dragging botanical term a mile long  then bindweed only reminds me of smothered and fettered raspberry bushes and a great hoe lily as the country people call it is not distinguishing enough besides that no one ever heard of a climbing lily  but anne do tell me whom you have in your book of knights  i know of a good many in the real heroic age but tell me some of the later ones  lord exmouth said anne i am sure he was a true knight  and the vendeen leaders i suppose said elizabeth  yes i have written the names of m de lescure and of henri de la rochejaquelein i wish i knew where to find their pictures and i want a prussian patriot  i think the baron de la motte fouque who was a knight of st john and who thought so much of true chivalry would come in very well  i do not know anything about himself said elizabeth though certainly no one but a true knight could have written sintram  i am afraid there was no leader good enough for you among the spanish patriots in the peninsular war  i do not know said anne i admire don jose palafox for his defence of zaragoza but i know nothing more of him and there is no chance of my getting his portrait  i am in great want of cameron of lochiel or lord nithsdale or derwentwater for claverhouse is the only jacobite leader i can find a portrait of and i am afraid the blood of the covenanters is a blot on his escutcheon a stain on his white wreath  i am sorry you have nothing to say to bonnie dundee said elizabeth for really between the whiggery and stupidity of england and the wickedness of france good people are scarce from charles the martyr to george the third  how i hate that part of history  oh but there were prince eugene and the vicomte de turenne  prince eugene behaved very well to marlborough in his adversity said anne but i do not like people to take affront and abandon their native country  oh but savoy was more his country than france said elizabeth however i do not know enough about him to make it worth while to fight for him  and as to turenne said anne i do not like the little i know of him he was horribly cruel was he not  oh every soldier was cruel in those days said elizabeth it was the custom of their time and they could not help it  anne shook her head  then you will be forced to give up my beloved black prince continued elizabeth piteously you know he massacred the people at limoges  i cannot do without him said anne he was ill and very much exasperated at the time and i choose to believe that the massacre was commanded by john of gaunt  and i choose to believe that all the cruelties of the french were by the express order of louis quatorze said elizabeth you cannot be hard on a man who gave all his money and offered to pawn his plate to bring charles the second back to england  i must search and consider said anne i will hunt him out when i go home and if we have a print of him and if he is tolerably goodlooking i will see what i can do with him  you have lodges portraits said elizabeth so you are well off for cavaliers do you mean to take prince rupert in compliment to your brother  no he is not good enough i am afraid said anne though besides our own vandyke there is a most tempting print of him in lodge with a buff coat and worked ruffles but though i used to think him the greatest of heroes i have given him up and mean to content myself with charles himself the two lindsays ormond and strafford derby and capel and sir ralph hopton  and montrose and the marquis of winchester said elizabeth you must not forget the noblest of all  i only forgot to mention them said anne i could not leave them out  the only difficulty is whom to choose among the cavaliers  and who comes next said elizabeth  gustavus adolphus and sir philip sydney  do not mention them together they are no pair said elizabeth what a pity it was that sir philip was a euphuist  forgive him for that failing in consideration of his speech at zutphen said anne  only that speech is so hackneyed and commonplace said elizabeth i am tired of it  the deed was not commonplace said anne  no and dandyism was as entirely the fault of his time as cruelty was of turennes said elizabeth sir walter raleigh was worse than sydney and surrey quite as bad to judge by his picture  it is not quite as bad a fault as cruelty said anne little as you seem to think of the last  now comes the chivalric age said elizabeth never mind telling me all the names only say who is the first of your heroesneither orlando nor sir galahad i suppose  no nor huon de bordeaux said anne  the cid then i suppose said elizabeth unless he is too fierce for your tender heart  ruy mi cid campeador said anne i must have him in consideration of his noble conduct to the king who banished him and the speech the ballad gives him            for vassals vengeance on their lord              though just is treason still            the noblest blood is his who best              bears undeserved ill   and the loyalty he shewed in making the king clear himself of having any share in his brothers death even though alphonso was silly enough to be affronted  like montroses feeling towards his ladylove said elizabeth not bearing the least stain on what he loved or honoured  but he is not our earliest knight said anne i begin with our own alfred with his blue shield and golden cross  king alfred exclaimed elizabeth do you consider him a knight  certainly said anne besides that i care more for the spirit of chivalry than for the etiquette of the accolade and golden spurs we know that alfred knighted his grandson athelstane so that he must have been a knight himself  bythebye said elizabeth i think i have found out the origin of the golden spurs being part of a knights equipment  do you remember when the cids beloved king don sancho was killed that rodrigo could not overtake the traitor bellido dolfos because he had no spurs on whereupon he cursed every knight who should for the future ride without them  now that was at the time when the laws of chivalry were attaining their perfection but  not so fast said anne i have a much earlier pair of golden spurs for you  do not you remember edmund the last king of east anglia being betrayed to the danish weddingparty at hoxne by the glitter of his golden spurs and cursing every new married pair who should ever pass over the bridge where he was found  i think that makes for my side of the question  here is edmund a knight in golden spurs when alfred was a child  ah ha miss lizzie  before elizabeth could answer winifred came to tell her that her mamma wanted her and she was forced to leave the question of king alfreds and king edmunds chivalry undecided for to her praise be it spoken she was much too useful a person ever to be able to pursue her own peculiar diversions for many minutes together  she had to listen to some directions and undertake some messages so that she could not return to her own room till after anne had gone downstairs  she herself was not ready till just as the elders were setting off to the dinnerparty at marlowe court and rejoicing in the cessation of the rain and the fineness of the evening  about half an hour afterwards the young ladies assembled in the inner drawingroom to drink tea  helen however remained in the outer drawingroom practising her music regardless of the sounds of mirth that proceeded from the other room until elizabeth opened the door calling out       sweet bird that shunnest the noise of folly        most musical most melancholy  come in to tea so please your highness  what can you mean said helen i am sure i am not melancholy  i am sure you shun the noise of folly said elizabeth  i am sorry you consider all our merriment as folly said anne hoping to save helen  indeed i do not said elizabeth it was no more folly than a kittens play and quite as much in the natural course of things  helens occupation being out of the natural course of things said anne i should think she was better employed than we were  in making a noise said elizabeth so were we i do not see much difference  o lizzie it was not the same thing said helen exceedingly mortified at being laughed at for what she considered as a heroic piece of selfdenial and so it was though perhaps not so great in her as it would have been in one who was less musical and more addicted to the noise of folly  how touchy helen is this evening thought elizabeth i had better let her alone both for her sake and my own  how foolish i was to interfere thought anne it was the most awkward thing i ever did i only roused the spirit of contradiction and did helen more harm than good i never will meddle between sisters again  presently after elizabeth asked harriet hazleby whether she had ever been at winchester  yes was the answer and a duller place i would not wish to see  it is a handsome old town is it not inquired anne turning to lucy but harriet caught up the word and exclaimed handsome indeed  i do not think there is one tolerable new looking street in the whole place except one or two houses just up by the railroad station  anne still looked towards lucy as if awaiting her answer lucy replied the cathedral and college and the old gateways are very beautiful but there are not so many old looking houses as you would expect  it must be badly off indeed said elizabeth if it has neither old houses nor new but i wanted to know whether william rufus monument is in a tolerable state of preservation  oh the monuments are very grand indeed said harriet everyone admired them  there are the heads of some of the old kings most beautifully painted put away in a dark corner  they are very curious things indeed i wonder they do not bring them out  those are the heads of the stuart kings whispered lucy  why harriet exclaimed dora william rufus was not a stuart he was the second of the normans  very likely very likely dora my dear answered harriet i have done with all those things now thank goodness i only know that seeing the cathedral was good fun i did not like going into the crypts i said i would not go when i saw how dark it was and frank hollis said i should and it was such fun  dora opened her eyes very wide and elizabeth said there could certainly never be a better time or place  looking up she saw poor lucys burning cheeks and was sorry she had not been silent  no one spoke for a few moments but presently anne said alfred the great is not buried in the cathedral is he  no one could tell at last helen said i remember reading that he was buried in hyde abbey which is now pulled down  there is a street at winchester called hyde street said lucy  yes i know said harriet where the bridewell is i remember  bythebye anne said elizabeth anxious to cut short harriets reminiscences i never answered what you said about alfred and athelstane  i do not think that alfred did more than present him with his sword which was always solemnly done even to squires before they were allowed to fight and might be done by a priest  but when athelstane is called a knight and the ceremony of presenting him with his weapons is mentioned said anne i cannot see why we should not consider him to have been really knighted  because said elizabeth i do not think that the old saxon word knight meant the sworn champion the devoted warrior of noble birth which it now expresses  you know canutes old rhyme says row  to the shore knights as if they were boatmen and not gentlemen  i do not think it could have been beneath the dignity of a knight to row canute said anne considering that eight kings rowed edgar the peaceable  other things prove that knight meant a servant in saxon said elizabeth  i know it does sometimes as in german now said anne but the question is when it acquired a meaning equivalent in dignity to the french chevalier  though it properly means anything but a horseman said elizabeth we ought to have a word answering to the german ritter  yes our language was spoilt by being mixed with french before it had come to its perfection said anne but still you have not proved that king alfred was not a knight in the highest sense of the word a preux chevalier  i never heard of alfred on horseback nor did i ever know him called sir alfred of wessex  sir is french and short for seigneur or senior said anne besides i suppose you never heard coeurdelion called sir richard plantagenet  i will tell you how you may find out all about it interrupted katherine mrs turners nephew mr augustus mills is going to give a lecture this evening at seven oclock upon chivalry and all that mrs turner has been telling us all day how much she wishes us to go  mr augustus mills said elizabeth is he the little redhaired wretch who used to pester me about dancing all last year  no no said katherine that was mr adolphus mills his brother who is gone to be clerk to an attorney somewhere  this is mr augustus a very fine young man and so clever willie says and he has most beautiful curling black hair  it wants a quarter to seven now said elizabeth and the sky is most beautifully clear at last  do you like the thoughts of this lecture anne  i should like to go very much indeed said anne but first i must go and seal and send some letters for mamma so i must depart while you finish your tea  so saying she left the room  pray kate said helen as anne closed the door where is this lecture to be given  at the mechanics institute of course said katherine  so we cannot go said helen  and pray why not my sapient sister said elizabeth what objection has your high mightiness  my dear lizzie said helen i wish you had heard all that i have heard at dykelands about mechanics institutes  my dear helen said elizabeth i wish you would learn that dykelands is no delphos to me  nay but my dearest sister exclaimed helen clasping her hands do but listen to me i am sure that harm will come of your going  well ope your lips sir oracle said elizabeth impatiently no dog shall bark only make haste about it or we shall be too late  do you not know lizzie said helen that socialists often hold forth in mechanics institutes  the abuse of a thing does not cancel its use said elizabeth and i do not suppose that mr mills preaches socialism  captain atherley says persisted helen that all sorts of people ought not to mix themselves up together on equal terms  oh then he never goes to church retorted elizabeth  no no that was only my foolish way of expressing myself said helen i meant that he says that it is wrong for church people to put themselves on a level with dissenters or infidels or socialists for aught they know to the contrary  since you have been in the north helen said elizabeth you have thought every third man you met a chartist or a socialist but as i do not believe there are specimens of either kind in abbeychurch i see no harm in taking our chance of the very few dissenters there are here and sitting to hear a lecture in company with our own townspeople  really i think we had better not go without asking leave first said katherine  in the first place said elizabeth there is no one to ask and next i know that mrs turner has offered hundreds of times to take us there and i suppose papa would have refused once for all if he had been so very much afraid of our turning chartists as helen seems to be i can see no reason why we should not go  then you consider my opinion as utterly worthless cried helen losing all command of temper which indeed she had preserved longer than could have been expected  i might have known it you never care for one word i say  you will repent it at last i know you will  it is not that i never care for what you say helen said elizabeth it is only when you give me dykelands opinions instead of your own and talk of what you do not understand  i suppose no one has any objection to a walk at least  shall we get ready  everyone consented and they went to prepare  it should be said in excuse for elizabeth that both she and helen had been absent from home at the time of the establishment of the mechanics institute at abbeychurch so that they had not known of their fathers opposition to it  helen who when at dykelands had been nearer the manufacturing districts had heard more of the follies and mischiefs committed by some of the favourers of these institutions unfortunately however her temper had prevented her from reasoning calmly and elizabeth had wilfully blinded herself and shut her ears to conviction being determined to follow her own course  anne who had always lived at merton hall excepting two months of each year which she spent in london knew nothing of country town cabals and thinking the lecture was of the same nature as those she had heard in london asked no questions as she had not heard the debate between elizabeth and helen katherine however hesitated to go without the permission of her father and mother or in other words she was afraid they would reprove her and she was not unwilling to listen to helens representations on the subject while they were putting on their bonnets  it is not only said helen that we are sure that it is not right to go anywhere without leave from papa or mamma but that i know that these mechanics institutes are part of a system of  oh yes i know said katherine of chartism and socialism and all that is horrible  i cannot imagine how lizzie can think of going  then you will not go said helen  oh i do not know said katherine it will seem so odd and so particular if anne and lizzie and the hazlebys go and we do not it would be like setting ourselves up against our elders  you do not always think much of that kate said helen besides if our eldest sister thinks proper to do wrong i do not see that we are forced to do so too  well but lizzie said it was not wrong and she is the eldest argued katherine  lizzie said it was not wrong that she might have her own way and contradict me said helen  we shall see what anne says said katherine but if they go i must you know  it was to me that mrs turner gave the invitation and she and willie would think it so odd to see the others without me and mr mills too he said so very politely that he hoped that he should be honoured with my presence and harriets it would be an additional stimulus to his exertions he said  my dear kate exclaimed helen how could you listen to such affected nonsense  why lizzie says everybody talks nonsense said katherine but we must listen and be civil you know i am sure i wish people would not be so silly it is very disagreeable to hear it but i cannot help it and after this i really think i ought to go it would be very odd if i did not  better do what is odd than what is wrong said helen  in her secret soul katherine had been of the same opinion the whole time and now that she thought she had made a sufficient merit of giving up the expedition she was about to promise to follow helens advice when she was interrupted by the entrance of harriet with her shawl and bonnet in her hand coming to gossip with katherine and thus escape from lucy who had been quietly suggesting that in a doubtful case such as the present seemed to be it was always best to keep to the safe side  harriet had laughed at lucy for not being able to give any reasons told her that it was plain that helen knew nothing about the matter and declared that she thanked goodness that if mr woodbourne was ever so angry he was not her master and her own mamma never minded what she did  lucy could make no answer in words but her silent protest against her sisters conduct made harriet so uneasy that she quitted her as soon as she could  helen still hoped that anne would see the folly of the scheme and persuade elizabeth to give it up and content herself with taking a walk or that her sisters better sense would prevail but she was disappointed when as they left the house anne asked where the lecture was to be given elizabeth replied at the mechanics institute and no further observation was made annes silence confirming elizabeth in her idea that helen had been talking nonsense still as st martins street where mr turner lived was their way out of the town helen remained in doubt respecting her sisters intentions until they reached mr turners house and elizabeth walked up the steps and knocked at the door  helen immediately wheeled round and walked indignantly homewards too full of her own feelings to make any attempt to persuade katherine to follow her example and every step shewing how grieved and affronted she was  lucy laid her hand on her sisters arm and looked up imploringly in her face  pooh said harriet pettishly jerking the ribbon by which she was leading fido give me one reason lucy and i will come  what helen said answered lucy  stuff and nonsense said harriet that was no reason at all  what did helen say asked anne who had been rather startled by her departure  only some dykelands fancies about socialists said elizabeth that is the reason she has gone off like a tragedy queen  i did not think all abbeychurch was ready for the french revolutionthat was all  there lucy you see said harriet come along theres a good girl  here mrs turners page opened the door and answered that his mistress was at home  dora my dear said elizabeth this is too late an affair for you we shall not be at home till after you are gone to bed goodnightrun after helen  dora obeyed and lucy also turned away katherine lingered  come kate said harriet mounting the steps lucy you nonsensical girl come back everyone can see you out of the window it is very rude now if mrs turner sees you what will she think  mamma would be very angry to see you so silly  come back i tell you  lucy only looked back and shook her head and then hastened away but katherine fearing that her friends would be irrecoverably offended if she turned away from their house thinking that she had gone too far to recede and trusting to elizabeth to shield her from blame followed the others upstairs  helen turned back much surprised as lucy and dora overtook her and they hastened to give explanations  lizzie said i had better come home said dora  and i thought it would be the safest thing to do said lucy  i am very glad of it said helen i am sure it is not right to go but when lizzie has once set her mind on anything she will listen to no one  then do you think papa and mamma will be displeased said dora i do not think lizzie thinks so  i cannot be quite sure said helen but i do not think lizzie chooses to believe that they will  but let me understand you helen said lucy i only know that you think that uncle woodbourne would not approve of your going  what are your reasons for thinking so  i did not clearly understand you churchpeople and dissenters put themselves on a level in almost every public place  they do not meet in every public place on what they agree to call neutral ground said helen or profess to lay aside all such distinctions and to banish religion in order to avoid raising disputes  you know that no subject can be safely treated of except with reference to the christian religion  how do you mean said lucy  why said helen hesitating a little how many people run wild and adopt foolish and wicked views of politics for want of reading history religiously  and the astronomers and geologists without faith question the possibility of the first chapter of genesis and some people fancy that the world was peopled with a great tribe of wild savages instead of believing all about adam and eve and the patriarchs  now if you turn religion out you see you are sure to fall into false notions and that is what these mechanics institute people do  yes said lucy i have heard what you say about those things before but i never saw them in connection with each other  nor should i have seen them in this light if it had not been for a conversation between captain atherly and another gentleman one day at dykelands said helen  but lucy did you leave this party then only because i said it was wrong or because you thought so yourself  indeed i can hardly tell answered lucy i scarcely know what to think right and what wrong but i thought i might be certain that it was safer to go home  i do not see said helen drawing herself up and feeling as if she had done a very wise thing and known her reasons for doing it too i do not see that it is so very hard to know what is right from what is wrong  it is the easiest way to think what papa and mamma would approve and then try to recollect what reasons they would give  but then you are not always sure of what they would say replied lucy at least i am not and it is not always possible to ask them what did you do all the time you were at dykelands  oh dear mrs staunton was quite a mother to me said helen and besides it was as easy to think what would please papa there as it is here  you were from home for some time last year were you not lucy  yes replied lucy i spent several months at hastings with grandmamma and i am almost ashamed to say that i felt more comfortable there than anywhere else  i liked being by the sea and having a garden and being out of the way of the officers  papa and grandmamma talked of my always living there and i hoped i should but then i should not have liked to leave papa and the rest and not to be at home in my brothers holidays so i believe things are best as they are  how you must wish to have a home said helen  do not you think that home is wherever your father and mother and brothers and sisters are helen said lucy  oh yes certainly said helen quickly but i meant a settled home  i do sometimes wish we were settled said lucy but i have been used to wandering all my life and do not mind it as much as you would perhaps  we scarcely stay long enough in one place to get attached to it and some places are so disagreeable that it is a pleasure to leave them  such as those in ireland that mrs hazleby was talking of yesterday said helen  i did not mind those half so much as i do some others said lucy we could easily get into the country and i used to walk with papa every day or ride when harriet did not want the horse  it was rather uncomfortable for we were very much crowded when george and allan were at home but then they had leave to shoot and fish and enjoyed themselves very much  really lucy said helen i cannot think how you can be so very contented  i did not know there was anything to be discontented with said lucy smiling i am sure i am very happy  but what did you say just now you disliked said helen  did i say i disliked anything said lucy  oh i know what it was i do not like going to a large town where we can only walk in the streets and go out shopping every day and the boys have nothing to amuse them  and it is worst of all to go to a place where papa and mamma have been before and know all the people we go out to tea half the days we are there or to dinner or have company at home and i never get a quiet evenings reading with papa and allan has a very great dislike to company  as lucy finished her speech they came to the vicarage and as they opened the door meg merrilies came purring out to meet dora  they looked round for fido in order to keep the peace between the two enemies but he was nowhere to be seen and dora remembered to have seen him with harriet just as they left the rest of the party at mr turners door so dismissing him from their minds they went to finish their walk in the garden where helen gave lucy a full description of all the beauties of dykelands and the perfections of its inhabitants and finding her an attentive and obliging listener talked herself into a state of most uncommon good humour and amiability for the rest of the evening  on her side lucy though she had no particular interest in the stauntons and indeed had never heard their name before helens visit to them was really pleased and amused for she had learnt to seek her pleasures in the happiness of other people     chapter viii   if helen had not been too much offended by elizabeths disregard of her counsel to think of anything but her own dignity and had waited to remind katherine of her argument with her the latter might perhaps have taken the safest course for it was not without many qualms of conscience that she ascended the stairs to mrs turners drawingroom  there was no one in the room and as soon as the page had closed the door elizabeth exclaimed i declare anne there is the bone of contention itselfst augustine in his own person  oh look at king ethelberts square blue eye and kate is not this st austins hill itself in the distance  nonsense lizzie said katherine crossly you know it is no such thing  it was in the pattern  i assure you it is round and exactly the colour of st austins said elizabeth there can be no doubt about it  elizabeths criticisms were here cut short by the entrance of mrs turner and her daughter ready dressed for the evenings excursion  mrs turner said elizabeth with all the politeness she was capable of towards that lady we are come to claim your kind offer of taking us to the mechanics institute this evening  oh my dear miss lizzie cried mrs turner i am so delighted to have the honour you cannot think  it is my nephew augustus mills who lectures tonight  most talented young man poor fellow is augustusnever without a book in his hand quite in your line miss lizzie  at this moment the gentleman quite in elizabeths line came into the room  he had a quantity of bushy black hair a long gold chain round his neck a plaid velvet waistcoat in which scarlet was the predominant colourand his whole air expressed full consciousness of the distinguished part which he was about to act  poor elizabeth little reliance as she usually placed in katherines descriptions she had expected to see something a little more gentlemanlike than what she now beheld and her dismay was increased when mrs turner addressed her nephewaugustus augustus my dear you never were so flattered in your life  here is miss merton and miss hazleby and miss lizzie woodbourne all come on purpose to hear your lecture  mr augustus said something about being very happy and bowed but whether to the young ladies or to his own reflection in the lookingglass was doubtful  he was then regularly introduced to anne and elizabeth and upon mr turner making his appearance they arranged themselves for the walk to the mechanics institute  mr turner a fat silent old gentleman very ceremoniously offered his arm to miss merton who though by this time exceedingly amazed and disgusted by all she saw and heard could scarcely refrain from laughing at the airs and graces of her squire or at the horror she plainly perceived in elizabeths face when the talking mrs turner exclaimed now augustus i must have you take miss woodbournei know you will be such friends  little did mrs turner suspect as in the overflowing of her pride and delight she bestowed upon elizabeth the hero of the night the mingled feeling of shame and repugnance which the poor girl had to encounter as she placed her hand within the offered arm of mr mills almost groaning at her own folly and vainly seeking some possible means of escape  mrs turner followed with harriet and katherine and wilhelmina brought up the rear  you are very fond of study i believe miss woodbourne said mr mills as they left the house  elizabeth made some inarticulate answer she was in the utmost dread of meeting either of the curates or worse still her cousin rupert merton if he should chance to arrive that evening  most interesting pursuit continued mr mills wishing to shew his aunt how well he and his companion agreed  i am quite devoted to it always was  you are a classical scholar i presume  elizabeth was ready to wish she had never learnt to read she fancied she saw a figure like ruperts at the other end of the street and was too much frightened to reply  while they were traversing one street of the old town crossing the bridge over the little stream which flowed along the valley and walking along the principal street of the new town mr mills continued to talk and elizabeth to echo the last word of each sentence or when that would not serve for a reply she had recourse to the simple interjection oh that last refuge of listeners with nothing to say after a walk which she thought was at least as many miles in length as it was yards they arrived at the mechanics institute outside which they found sundry loiterers and a strong scent of tobacco and inside some crowded benches a table with some chairs ranged round it and a strong odour of gas  after a good deal of pushing and shoving the ladies were safely deposited on one of the front benches while mr turner who was one of the managing committee seated himself on one of the chairs and mr augustus mills stood at the table  elizabeth felt as if the crimson flush called up by vexation and embarrassment together with her hasty walk would never leave her cheeks she held her head down till katherine touched her to make her look up and trusting that her bonnet would screen her heightened colour from observation she obeyed the sign  a flaring gaslight hung opposite to her and as she raised her face she encountered the gaze of mr higgins the radical and dissenting editor of a newspaper which had several times abused mr woodbourne  the moment he caught her eye he bowed with something of a triumphant air and she doubly ashamed of herself and provoked with him bent her head so low that he might well imagine that she returned the bow  she hoped by looking down to escape all further observation but unfortunately for her mrs turner had taken care to find a conspicuous place for her party and katherine who had by this time quite forgotten her doubts and misgivings was nodding and smiling to everyone with what she considered the utmost grace and affability  anne meanwhile was trying to account for elizabeths ever having thought of going to such a place wondering what sir edward and lady merton would think of the expedition and for a moment considering whether mr woodbourne could approve of it yet at the same time keenly enjoying all that was ludicrous in the scene and longing to talk it over with rupert  she was also much diverted with mr augustus millss eloquent lecture in which she afterwards declared that she heard the words barbarous institution fifteen times repeated and civilized and enlightened age at least twentythree times  she was however not a little fatigued before it was nearly concluded and was heartily glad when after an hour and a half it was terminated by a mighty flourish of rhetoric upon the universal toleration civilization and liberty enjoyed in the nineteenth century  deafened by the applause of those who had heard little and understood less half stifled by the heat of the room and their heads aching from the smell of gas the girls now hoped to escape but they were forced to wait till the crowd nearer the door had dispersed and then to listen to the numerous compliments and congratulations which poured in upon mrs turner from all quarters before they could reach the open air and then strenuously refusing all invitations to take tea in st martins street they happily regained the vicarage helen and lucy met them at the door with hopes that they had had a pleasant evening  elizabeth answered quickly come come say no more about it it was a foolish affair altogether but the inquiry after the feelings she had seen expressed in elizabeths face struck anne as so excessively ridiculous that the moment they were in the drawingroom she sank down upon the sofa giving way to the laughter which long repressed now burst forth louder and more merrily upon every fresh remembrance of the scene while the other girls though persisting in declaring that they had seen nothing diverting were soon infected by her joyous merriment and the room rang again with laughter  well lizzie said anne recovering her breath i hope as helen says you have had a pleasant evening i hope you were very much edified  how can you be so absurd anne answered elizabeth trying to look serious but the corners of her mouth relaxing in spite of her attempts to control her risible muscles  i hope continued anne with a very grave face that mr augustus was fully sensible of your wisdom love of erudition and classical scholarship though i cannot say they appeared on the surface  you may be sure he thought me very wise said elizabeth i only echoed his own wordsand what would a man have more  and how tenderly you touched him with the tip of your glove continued anne  i wish you could have seen yourself  indeed i wish you had lizzie said katherine i think you would have been ashamed of yourself  i am ashamed said elizabeth gravely and shortly  lucy here asked where fido was  no one knew no one could recollect anything about him from the time they had left mr turners house to go to the mechanics institute katherine and harriet went to the front door they called they searched they even went to mr turners to inquire for him but all their researches were fruitless and harriet turned angrily upon her sister saying it is all your fault lucy for running home in such a hurry and never thinking of him  how was i to be watching him there did you think  i should have supposed said elizabeth that the person who was leading the dog was more likely  no no elizabeth hastily interrupted lucy it was my fault in some degree  i know i ought to have thought of him  well say no more about him said elizabeth i dare say he will come home before morning  and elizabeth left the room to take off her bonnet and to visit the nursery where the children were in bed  all were asleep excepting dora and as elizabeth leant over her kissing her and bidding her goodnight the little girl put her arm round her neck and said lizzie will you tell me one thing  was it naughty toto go where you went tonight  elizabeth had felt annoyed and provoked and surprised at herself for her folly but she had not thought herself in fault but now doras soft sweet caressing tone sounded in her ears like a serious reproof and turned her thought upon her sin  she was too upright and sincere to evade such an inquiry as this even from a younger sister and a pupil and answered indeed dora i can hardly tell yet how wrong it was but i am afraid it was very wrong for i am sure it is a thing i hope you will never do  besides i know i was very selfwilled and unkind to helen i have set you a very bad example dora and i believe i ought to beg your pardon for it goodnight my dear  was elizabeth lowered in her sisters eyes by humbling herself  just as the girls were arranging themselves in the drawingroom for the evening a loud knocking was heard at the frontdoor and harriet and anne both sprang upthe one exclaiming someone has brought fido backthe other can that be rupert  the last supposition was proved to be right and in another moment rupert merton was receiving the affectionate greetings of his sister and cousins  elizabeth felt some embarrassment in performing a regular introduction of mr merton to the miss hazlebys but ruperts easy wellbred manners rendered the formidable ceremony much easier than she had expected and the cousins soon fell into their usual style of conversation  well mr rupert said elizabeth better late than never that is all that can be said for you  am i late said rupert i hope no one has waited for me  i hope not indeed said elizabeth pray did you expect the bishop and clergy and the whole town of abbeychurch st mary and st austin to wait your pleasure and convenience  anne did you ever hear the like  do you think prince rupert himself was ever so favoured and honoured  what do you mean said rupert  that you have come a day too late you idle boy said anne  i thought next tuesday was to have been the day of the consecration said rupert  did you never get my letter said anne i wrote to tell you that the day was altered and you were to meet us here on the wednesday  can i ask you to believe a gentlemans word in opposition to a ladys said rupert looking round  i did indeed receive a letter from my amiable sister full oflet me seehistories of dogs and cats and the harvest and old dame philips and commissions for pencils which i will produce if i have not lost the key of my portmanteau but not one word of the consecration  but indeed i wrote a good many words about it said anne have you the letter rupert  have i the letter cried rupert  young ladies did you ever hear of such overweening presumption  here is a damsel who expects her scraps of angular writing to be preserved with as much care as the golden bulls of the pope  that is to say you burnt it without reading it said anne  the former part of your supposition is true sweet sister mine replied rupert not knowing what spells it might contain seeing that miss mertons caligraphy is more like the cabalistic characters of a sorceress than the italianhand of a gentle demoiselle i exorcised iti committed it to the devouring element  without turning over the second page of the second piece of notepaper i suppose said anne  how was i ever to suppose that anyone would write a letter for the purpose of giving me an important piece of information said rupert and then put the pith of it in a place where no one would ever dream of looking  no lady elizabeth if by my absence your feast has lost its brightest ornament its wittiest and wisest cavalier it is this sister of mine whom you must accuse  it was really not a little provoking to be blamed in this manner for ruperts own carelessness but anne was used to her brothers ways and could bear them with good humour  elizabeth however attacked him why rupert one would suppose you had never heard where a womans mind is to be found  these are most futile excuses  i will only attempt one other said the truantthe utter worthlessness of young ladies letters which is such as not to encourage their friends to make any very strict researches into them  worse and worse said elizabeth you have certainly behaved most cavalierly that must be confessed  we are only considering what punishment you deserve  i deserve the punishment i have had lizzie said rupert i have missed the consecration and three days of this fair company  besides that you will be held up ever after as a warning to horace and edward said elizabeth  i saw that firstmentioned pupil of yours on sunday said rupert  oh how pleased mamma will be cried elizabeth then you went to sandleford  yes finding myself too late for the coach on saturday afternoon by which i had intended to go to ely said rupert i made up my mind to spend sunday at sandleford and take a cursory view of the young gentleman and of my old haunts  thank you said elizabeth her eyes beaming with pleasure i am sure that was very kind of you  and how did he look poor little fellow and what did he say and was not he delighted to see you  i shall leave you to judge of that said rupert and say that he looked very happy and flourishing with face and shirtcollar all over ink on saturday afternoon and he said more than i can remember on sunday evening  and what does dr freeman say of him said elizabeth  dr freeman assured mewhat do you think young ladiesthat master horatio woodbourne is by far the most promising youth who has entered his celebrated academy sinceof course you know whom i mean and will spare my blushes  unluckily said anne the evident fabrication of the latter part of that speech destroys our belief in the beginning of it  no no said elizabeth it is only the most promising not the most performing  no one can doubt of ruperts promises  rupert you always do talk such nonsense said katherine  many thanks for the compliment lady kate said rupert with a bow considering how my intelligence is received i think i shall spare it in future  i have a letter and parcel from master horatio in my portmanteau and they may speak for themselves if i have not lost my keys as i said before  o rupert cried anne how could you lose them again after all the pains mamma took to save them  indeed anne i did behave better than usual said rupert i kept them safe till yesterday i assure you  i wish you would come and give me the carriage keys perhaps some of them may unlock the portmanteau  anne did not think they would she said they had all been tried twice before but rupert would not be satisfied till the experiment had been repeated once more and long after all the other girls were gone to bed he kept his sister up looking out some things which had been brought from merton hall for him while he sat by recounting all his adventures in scotland  anne was much delighted to listen and very glad to have her brother with her again but perhaps if he had not been quite so much engrossed by his own affairs he would have seen that she looked very tired and have remembered that it was much later than her usual bedtime  while katherine and helen were undressing the former began  helen i wish you had gone it was such fun  was it said helen  i thought lizzie did not seem much gratified  lizzie  oh no said katherine she only hung her head and looked vexed though there were such a number of people all so civil and bowingmr wilkins and the greens and mr higgins  did mr higgins bow to you and lizzie exclaimed helen  yes that he did said katherine triumphantly and a very polite bow he made i assure you helen  i was quite glad to see him i hope he is coming round  how did lizzie like it asked helen  oh she is so odd you know said katherine she seemed really quite angry i jogged her once or twice to make her look up but she shook me off quite crossly i thought she would have been pleased  i should think few things would vex her much more said helen  well said katherine willie once told me that some people think lizzie very proud and disdainful and i really begin to believe so too  oh no kate said helen i am sure she is not proud it is only  mercy helen here interrupted kate what are you doing to your hair  curling it replied helen in her composed manner  why in the world said katherine i thought you liked your plaits better  lizzie does not said helen  well said katherine i am sure i should never dream of doing such a thing only because lizzie chooses to make a fuss  perhaps not said helen  there was a silence  presently helen said i suppose mr higginss next sundays paper will mention that the mechanics institute was honoured by the presence of the miss woodbournes  dear me do you think so said katherine who could not guess from her sisters manner what opinion she intended to express  i think it very probable indeed said helen such a sanction to the educationwithoutreligion system is not to be neglected  system said katherine looking bewildered how are we to sanction anything  our station here as the daughters of the clergyman gives us some weight said helen besides that what each person does however trifling is of importance to others  this was not very clearly expressed and katherine did not trouble herself to understand it  she only said well i hope we have not got into a scrape however you know it was lizzies doing not mine  i thought you went said helen  yes said katherine but that was only because lizzie said it was not wrong  she is the eldest and you know she is accountable  i should think that poor consolation said helen  well said katherine sleepily goodnight  those horrid gaslights have made my head ache  i cannot talk any more     chapter ix   although she had sat up so much later than usual the night before anne was dressed on saturday morning in time to go to her mothers room for a little while before breakfast  mamma said she after they had spoken of ruperts arrival where do you think we went yesterday evening  where my dear  to hear a lecture at the mechanics institute mamma  i should not have thought that your uncle would have approved of his daughters going to such a place said lady merton  do you think we ought not to have gone mamma said anne  i do not know the circumstances my dear said lady merton the mechanics institute may perhaps be under your uncles management and in that case  oh no said anne  i do not think it isat least i do not think uncle woodbourne would have liked the lecture we heard much better than lizzie and i did and after it was too late i found that helen had declared it was very wrong of us to go  she would not go and i found that when i was out of the room she and lizzie had had a great debate about it  anne then gave a full account of all that had occurred and ended with now mamma do you think we could have helped going on after we once came to mrs turners and found what kind of a thing it was likely to be  people certainly cannot stop themselves easily when they have taken the first wrong step said lady merton  anne sighed then i am afraid we have done very wrong said she  for yourself anne said her mother i do not think you are much to blame since i cannot see how you were to know that your cousins were going without their fathers consent  i am glad you think so mamma said anne but i cannot be quite happy about it for i might certainly have supposed that there was some reason against our going when helen and the youngest miss hazleby turned back and went home  you heard none of helens remonstrances said lady merton  no mamma i was foolish enough to be satisfied with lizzies saying that she had been talking nonsense said anne besides i could see that helen was out of temper and i thought that might account for her objecting  these are very good reasons anne said lady merton  indeed they are not mamma said anne i am afraid the real cause was that my head was so full of the pleasure i expected in going to the lecture that i did not choose to think that we ought not to go i am afraid i am growing thoughtless as you said i should here  no no anne said lady merton smiling i did not say you would i only said you must guard against doing so and as far as i have seen you have shewn more selfcommand than when you and lizzie were last together  ah but when you are not looking on mamma said anne that is the dangerous time especially now rupert is come he and lizzie will make us laugh dreadfully  i hope they will said lady merton provided it is without flippancy or unkindness  but mamma said anne presently after what do you think about lizzie was she in the wrong  i cannot tell without knowing more about it said lady merton do you know what she thinks herself  no mamma said anne she was asleep before i went to bed last night and up before i awoke this morning  but i do firmly believe that if lizzie had had the slightest idea that she was doing wrong in going there she would as soon have thought of flying as of doing so  it was now breakfasttime and rupert came up to summon his mother and sister and to inform them that his portmanteau had just been broken open for the seventh time since it had been in his possession he said this with some satisfaction for he was somewhat vain of his carelessness for of what cannot people be vain  during breakfast it was arranged that the three elder ladies should go in the mertons carriage to baysmouth a large town which was about ten miles distant from abbeychurch and take winifred and edward with them dora was to accompany the other young people in a long walk to a farmhouse which report said had been a baronial castle in the days of king stephen and from exploring the antiquities of which some of them expected great things especially as it was known by the mysterious name of whistlefar  mr woodbourne and sir edward expected to be engaged all day in the final settlement of accounts with the architect of the church  as soon as the two parties of pleasure had been arranged elizabeth left the breakfasttable to tell the children of the treat in store for them and to write a little note to horace to accompany doras letter which had been finished that morning before breakfast  just after she had quitted the room sir edward asked what the smartlooking building at the corner of aurelia place was  you mean the mechanics institute said mr woodbourne  never was new town without one said rupert  is this one well conducted inquired lady merton  not much worse than such things usually are replied mr woodbourne two or three socialist lectures were given there but they were stopped before they had time to do much harm  were you obliged to interfere said sir edward  yes said mr woodbourne i went to some of the managing committeemr green and old mr turnerand after some rather strong representations on my part they found means to put a stop to them higgins their chief promoter made several violent attacks upon me in his newspaper for my illiberality and bigotry and poor mr turner was so much distressed that he came to entreat me to go myself or at least to allow my girls to go to some lectures which he promised should be perfectly harmless  i told him that i disapproved of mechanics institutes in general and especially of the way in which this one is conducted and that i had resolved long before that none of my family should ever set foot in it  here the matter ended and i have heard no more of it except that mrs turner is constantly tormenting my wife with offers to take the girls to some peculiarly interesting lecture  if elizabeth had been present she would certainly have immediately confessed her indiscretion of the evening before but she was not there and katherine who was on the point of speaking was checked by an imploring glance from harriet  the conversation was changed and nothing more was said on the subject  as soon as they could leave the breakfasttable all the young ladies instantly flew to the schoolroom where elizabeth was sitting alone writing  lizzie lizzie exclaimed three voices at once do you know what you have done  is it anything very fatal said elizabeth looking quite composed  a fine scrape you have got into cried katherine  a pretty kettle of fish you have brought us into exclaimed harriet  but what is the matter good ladies said elizabeth why do you look so like the form that drew priams curtains at the dead of night  come lizzie said katherine pettishly do not be so provoking with priam and all that stuff but tell us what is to be done about that horrid institute  oh that is it is it said elizabeth so i suppose fido was stolen there and you are afraid to tell  i am afraid he was said katherine but that is not the worst of iti know nothing about him  but do you know what papa says  uncle edward has been asking about the institute and oh dear oh dear papa said he could not bear mechanics institutes and had resolved quite firmly that none of his family should ever set foot in one  elizabeth really looked quite appalled at this piece of intelligence and katherine continued and chartists and socialists and horrible people have been lecturing there  i remember now that when you were at merton hall in the spring there was a great uproar and the abbeychurch reporter behaved very badly to papa about it  a fine affair you have made of it indeed lizzie  and pray miss kate said elizabeth sharply who was the person who first proposed this fine expedition  really i think if everyone had their deserts you would have no small share of blame what could prevent you from telling me all this yesterday when it seems you knew it all the time  i forgot it said katherine  exactly like you continued her sister and how could you listen to all helen said and not be put in mind of it  and how could you bring me back such a flaming description of mrs turners august puppy of a nephew  if we are in a kettle of fish as harriet says you are at the bottom of it  well lizzie said katherine do not be so cross you know mamma says i have such a bad memory i cannot help forgetting  and she began to cry which softened elizabeths anger a little  i did not mean to throw all the blame upon you kate said she i know i ought not to have trusted to you besides that i led you all into it being the eldest  i only meant to shew you that you are not quite so immaculate as you seem to imagine  we have all done very wrong and must take the consequences  helen was leaving the room when harriet died out o helen pray do not go and tell of us  helen has no such intention said elizabeth i am going to tell papa myself as soon as he has done breakfast  oh lizzie dearest lizzie cried harriet i beg you will not you do not know what mamma would do to me  pray harriet said elizabeth scornfully do you think that i am going to conceal my own faults from my own father  but lizzie stop one moment said harriet you know it was you and kate who took me i did not know it was wrong to go and now fido is lost mamma will be certain to say it was by my going and she will be dreadfully angry with me and you would not wish me to be scolded for what was your fault  should not you wish me to tell anne said elizabeth turning her back upon harriet  i told mamma this morning said anne  told her exclaimed harriet and what did she say  she said she wondered that my cousins were allowed to go to such a place said anne and she seemed very sorry we had gone  but was she angry with you persisted harriet  anne hesitated and elizabeth replied no of course she could not be angry with anne when it was all my doing  she must be displeased enough with me though  but will she tell mamma and aunt mildred said harriet  i do not think she will answered anne  no because she trusts to me to tell said elizabeth so that you see i must harriet  must you said harriet i cannot see why it will only get us all a scolding  which we richly deserve said elizabeth  i am sure if you like to be scolded said harriet you are very welcome only do not make mamma scold me too  i am sure if you like to be insincere and cowardly said elizabeth you shall not make me so too  i do not want you to tell a fib said harriet i only want you to say nothing  lun vaut bien lautre said elizabeth  what said harriet do only wait till we are gone if you are determined to telltheres a dear girl  deceive papa and mamma for three whole days cried elizabeth i wonder you are not ashamed of yourself  besides harriet i do not see what you have to fear  it was kate and i who did wrong we knew better and cast away helens good advice we shut our eyes and went headlong into mischief but you had no reason to suppose that you might not do as we did  no said harriet i should not care if it was not for fido  but will my silence find fido said elizabeth  no said harriet but if mamma knows we went there she will scold us for going because she will be angry about fido and if she once thinks that it was i who lost himoh lizzie you do not know how angry she will be  but harriet said katherine i thought you used to say that you could do anything with your mamma and that she never minded where you went  oh that is when she is in good humour said harriet she is not often cross with me but when she is you may hear her from one end of the house to the other  cannot you lucy  and now she will be dreadfully cross about fido and the other thing coming upon it i do not know what she may say  o lizzie you will save me  i will only tell of kate and myself said elizabeth or i will ask papa not to mention it to mrs hazleby though harriet there are some people who prefer any suffering just or unjust to deceit  then you mean to tell directly said katherine in a piteous tone  of course i do said elizabeth there is the diningroom door shut come with me kate  katherine rather unwillingly followed her sister into the passage but when there fear making her ingenious a sudden thought struck her lizzie whispered she if you tell papa that you and i went mrs hazleby will be sure to hear and if she asks harriet about it perhaps sheyou knowmay tell a story about it  fine confidence you shew in your chosen friend said elizabeth  why one must be civil and harriet is a sort of cousin said katherine but i am sure she is not half so much my friend as willie  well never mind defending your taste in friends said elizabeth for as i do think your scruple worth answering i will tell you that i had thought of the same thing but i do not choose to do evil that good may come or that evil may not come  i shall tell papa what an excellent opinion you have of harriet and leave him to do as he pleases  elizabeths hand was on the lock of the door of her fathers study when katherine exclaimed there is someone therei hear voices  uncle edward said elizabeth  i do not mind his being there we ought to beg his pardon for leading anne astray  oh but do not you see said katherine here are a hat and a roll of papers on the table  mr roberts must be come  tiresome man cried elizabeth he will be there all day and i shall not see papa i do not know when  it really was a very convenient thing when the architects of the old german cathedrals used to take a desperate leap from the top of the tower as soon as it was finished well i must find mamma now  cannot you wait till the evening when you may see papa said katherine hoping to put off the evil day  i cannot have this upon my mind all day unconfessed said elizabeth besides harriet will pester me with entreaties as long as it is untold  come kitty do not be such a coward  i am sure i do not want you not to tell said katherine looking rather miserable only i am not in such a hurry about it as you are you do not know where mamma is  no but i will find her said elizabeth  the sisters set off on the chase they looked into the drawingroom the diningroom mrs woodbournes room without success they ran up to the nursery but she was not there and they were going down again when katherine seeing elizabeth go towards the kitchen stairs exclaimed well i will go no further it is so ridiculous as if it was a matter of life and death  you may call if you want me  katherine retreated into her own room and elizabeth ran down to the kitchen where she found mrs woodbourne ordering dinner  elizabeth stood by the fire biting her lip and pinching her finger and trembling all over with impatience while mrs woodbourne and the cook were busily consulting over some grouse which rupert had brought from scotland  lizzie my dear said mrs woodbourne presently would you just run to my room and fetch down the green receiptbook  elizabeth obeyed running was rather a relief to her and she was downstairs again in another instant  why lizzie said mrs woodbourne with a smile you must be wild today you have brought me the accountbook instead ofbut my dear child what is the matter said she perceiving that elizabeths face was scarlet and her eyes full of tears  i will tell you presently whispered elizabeth breathlessly when you have done  she darted away again and returned with the right book but mrs woodbourne was too much alarmed by her manner to spend another moment in giving directions to the cook and instantly followed her to her own room  elizabeth hastily shut the door and sat down to recover her breath  my dear lizzie there is nothing amiss with any of the exclaimed mrs woodbourne almost gasping for breath  oh no mamma said elizabeth a smile passing over her face in spite of her distress it is not winifred who is mad  it is i who have been more mad and foolish and selfwilled than you would ever believe mamma i have been with mrs turner to the mechanics institute  my dear lizzie you do not mean it said mrs woodbourne  yes mamma indeed it is so said elizabeth mournfully i did not know what had happened there certainly but i would not listen to helens good advice and so i have made papa seem to consent to what he abhors i have led kate and anne and harriet all wrong  oh mamma is not it terrible  indeed i wish i had told you what your papa said to mr turner said mrs woodbourne i am afraid your papa will be very much annoyed but my dear do not distress yourself you could not know that it was wrong  yes but mamma said elizabeth i did know that it was wrong to go out without asking your leave  simple obedience might have kept me straight  but now i will tell you all and you shall judge what had best be done about the hazlebys and fido  rather incoherently and with many sobs elizabeth told the history of the preceding evening  mrs woodbourne listened to her with the utmost kindness and said all she could to soothe and console her assuring her that mr woodbourne could not be seriously displeased with her for having transgressed a command of which she was ignorant elizabeth was much relieved by having been able to talk over her conduct in this manner and though she still felt that she had been very much to blame and by no means sure that mr woodbourne would pass over her fault so lightly was greatly comforted by her mammas kindness  she went away to bathe her swollen eyes before she went down to the schoolroom to read the psalms and lessons with her sisters as was their regular custom when there was no service at the church before they began their mornings work mrs woodbourne undertaking to call the children down in a few minutes and saying that she would speak to katherine in the course of the day  she willingly promised to say nothing to mrs hazleby and only wished she was quite sure that there were no symptoms of madness about fido  what a strange girl lizzie is cried harriet just as elizabeth departed on her search for her father or mrs woodbourne  but harriet said lucy drawing her aside to the window what difference is her saying nothing to make  mamma will ask how fido was lost  i am sure lucy that was more your fault than mine said harriet i could not be watching him all the time we were at that place  then why did you take him there said helen  because lucy chose to run away without ever thinking what i was to do said harriet  but when you were leading him and it must have been you who let go his string said helen i cannot see how you can accuse lucy of having been the means of losing him when she was safe at home  harriet was saved from the necessity of finding an answer by hearing her mother calling her in the passage and she hastened to obey the summons  do you know where fido is was mrs hazlebys question  no said harriet finding she had only escaped one dilemma to fall into another  she avoided any further questions however by hastening past her mother and running upstairs  lucy lucy then called mrs hazleby and as lucy came out of the schoolroom she repeated the inquiry  i do not know mamma answered lucy in a low voice but standing quite still  go and ask for him in the kitchen then said mrs hazleby  i am afraid it would be of no use maam said lucy firmly but not daring to raise her eyes we missed him when we came in from walking yesterday evening  yesterday evening cried mrs hazleby and did you never speak of it  i never knew anyone so careless as you are in all my life  it is of no use to leave anything in your charge you care for  here lucy leant back and shut the door behind her so that anne and helen could distinguish nothing but the sound of mrs hazlebys loud angry voice raised to its highest pitch  poor lucy sighed helen  dreadful said anne  and how can anyone say that lucy is not one of the noblest most selfdevoted creatures upon earth exclaimed helen with tears in her eyes there she is bearing all that terrible scolding rather than say it was harriets fault as everyone knows it was  i am sure no one is like lucy  and this is going on continually about something or other  how can she exist said anne  with her acute feelings and painful timidity said helen it is worse for her than it would be for anyone else yet how gently and simply she bears it all and old mrs hazleby says that she is often ill after these scoldings and she would have taken her away to live with her as the major proposed after miss dorothea hazleby died but that she thought it would be taking away all the comfort of her fathers life  oh anne cried helen walking up and down the room as mrs hazlebys voice became louder and louder i cannot bear it what shall i do  oh if it was but right if it would not make it worse for lucy i could i would go out and tell mrs hazleby what everybody thinks of her  i do not wonder that miss hazleby was ready to do almost anything to avoid such a scene said anne  mean selfish creature said helen she ran away on purpose that lucy might stay and bear all this  anne i do believe that if martyrs are made and crowns are gained by daily sufferings and hourly selfdenial that such a crown will be dear dear lucys  annes answer was            and all the happy souls that rode            transfigured through that fresh abode            had heretofore in humble trust            shone meekly mid their native dust            the glowworms of the earth   thank you anne said helen wiping away her tears i will think of lucy as the light the glowworm of her family  thank you the thought of her meek clear light in darkness need not be gloomy as it has been  anne had never thought of helen as possessing so much enthusiasm and was almost more inclined to wonder at her than at lucy  while they had been talking mrs hazlebys voice had ceased steps were now heard in the passage and a letter was brought in and given to helen it was from fanny staunton but she had only just time to glance it over before the three children came in followed by their mother and elizabeth  anne went to call her mother to join them in reading the psalms and lessons and winifred was sent to summon katherine who had purposely lingered upstairs till all the rest were assembled  elizabeths eyes were very red and she was afraid to trust her voice to read the first verse of the psalm as it was always her part to do but little dora who sat next to her and who seemed in part to enter into her feelings although she said nothing read the first verse for her and elizabeth took edward who always looked over her book upon her knee when the lessons began so as to screen her face from her aunt  when they had finished attention was drawn away from her by edward who was eagerly assuring lady merton that the bible and prayerbook which uncle edward his godfather had given him were quite safe and he was to use them himself when lizzie thought he could read well enough  this dora explained as meaning when he had for a week abstained from guessing words instead of spelling them and elizabeth proposed to him to try whether he could read today without one mistake  edward objected to reading at that time as he was to go out at halfpast twelve and there would be no time for lessons elizabeth demonstrated that it was now only halfpast ten and that it was impossible that he could spend two hours in putting on his best frock and trowsers and in settling what to buy with the bright halfcrown which uncle edward had given him and winifred assured him that she meant to do all her lessons today  edward looked round to appeal to his mother but both she and lady merton had left the room and he was forced to content himself with asking anne whether she thought there was time  oh yes edward i hope you will let me hear how well you can read i want to know whether the young robins saw any more monsters said anne goodnaturedly  winifred rather inopportunely was ready with the information that the nest was visited by two more monsters but anne stopped her ears and declared she would hear nothing but from edward himself and the young gentleman was thus persuaded to begin his lesson  helen did not wait to see how the question was decided but went up to her own room to enjoy fanny stauntons letter  she paused however a few moments to consider whether she should go to lucy but thinking that it must certainly be painful to her to speak of what had passed she proceeded to her own room there to send her whole heart and mind to dykelands  fanny stauntons letter was overflowing with affection and with regrets for helens departure and this together with her descriptions of her own and her sisters amusements and occupations made helens heart yearn more strongly than ever after the friends she had left  annes cheerful manner and lucys quiet content had the day before made helen rather ashamed of herself and she had resolved to leave off pining for dykelands and to make herself happy by being useful and obliging without thinking about little grievances such as almost everyone could probably find in their own home if they searched for them  when she had curled her hair it was with the hope that the sacrifice of her tails would convince elizabeth that she had some regard for her taste unfortunately however her hair was rather too soft to curl well and after having been plaited for the last three months it was most obstinate in hanging deplorably straight in a way very uncomfortable to her feelings and irritating to her temper besides which elizabeth had been too much occupied by her own concerns all the morning to observe the alteration and indeed if she had remarked it she was not likely to feel as much flattered by this instance of deference to her opinion as helen thought she ought to be last night helen had lamented that her own petulance had prevented her from reasoning calmly with elizabeth and from setting before her all the arguments upon which she had discoursed so fluently to lucy after the imprudent step had been taken but now she threw the blame upon elizabeths impetuosity and unkindness and felt somewhat aggrieved because neither of her sisters had expressed a full sense of her firmness and discretion  she compared fannys affectionate expressions with elizabeths sharp and hasty manner the admiration which her friends had made rather too evident with the wholesome though severe criticisms she sometimes met with at home the quietness at dykelands with the constant bustle at the vicarage and ended by thinking mrs woodbourne the only person of the family who possessed any gentleness or kindness and making up her mind that dykelands was the only pleasant place in england and that she herself was a most illused person whose merits were not in the least appreciated  such were the feelings which gradually took possession of her mind while she was writing her answer to fannys letter and by the time she had finished had brought her into that agreeable frame which is disposed to be offended with the first person who does not act up to its expectations  katherines study through the whole morning was to avoid a private interview with mrs woodbourne and she really shewed considerable ingenuity in evading her  if mrs woodbourne called her she answered yes mamma i am coming directly but she took care not to come till she knew that her mamma was no longer alone if lady merton wanted anything which she had left upstairs katherine would officiously volunteer to fetch it when particularly told that she was not wanted if mrs woodbourne moved to the door and made signs to katherine to follow her she worked with double assiduity and never looked up unless to speak to rupert or to harriet and thus she contrived to elude the reproof she expected until the whole party except the two gentlemen met at twelve oclock for an early luncheon so that there was no longer any danger that mrs woodbourne would find an opportunity of speaking to her at present  the three children were to dine late with the rest of the party and were in high glee at the prospect of the afternoons amusement elizabeth seemed to have recovered her spirits harriet was as noisy as ever and lucy if possible a little quieter than was her wont anne as usual ready to be amused with anything and rupert quite prepared to amuse everyone  fido was again mentioned and rupert who had heard about half of the history of his loss suggested the possibility of his having been despatched by the railroad to london there to be converted into sausages  harriet after many exclamations of o mr merton declared that if she believed such a thing could ever happen she would never eat another sausage in her life and concluded as usual with would you lucy  mrs woodbourne inquired anxiously after winifreds hand mrs hazleby was on the point of taking fire at the implied suspicion of her lamented favourites sanity when rupert averted the threatened danger by a grave examination of winifred and meg merrilies who had both been wounded and concluded by recommending that as soon as puss shewed symptoms of hydrophobia winifred should be smothered between two featherbeds to prevent further mischief  everyone laughed except dora who thought the proposal exceedingly shocking and rupert argued very gravely with her on the expediency of the measure until she was called away to prepare for the walk     chapter x   dora reconsidered her arguments while putting on her bonnet and the instant the walking party were outside the front door she began again but rupert it would be committing murder to kill winifred even if she had the fidophobia  no no dora said rupert it is your mamma and lizzie who have the fidophobia  what can you mean said helen how can you frighten the child so rupert  do not you know helen said elizabeth tis his vocation  he is a true knight rupert  expound most learned cousin said rupert you are too deep  you must know said elizabeth that knecht ruprecht is the german terrifier of naughty children the same as the chimneysweeper in england or coeur de lion in palestine or the duke of wellington in france            baby baby hes a giant              tall and black as rouen steeple            and he dines and sups tis said              every day on naughty people   i should have thought said rupert that considering my namesakes babebolting propensities and his great black dog that he would have been more likely to be held up in terrorem in england  i suppose there was some old grim sir rupert in germany said elizabeth but my dictionary is my only authority  you are taking knecht to mean a knight said anne contrary to your argument last night  knecht ruprechts origin is not nearly so sublime as you would make it out  keightleys fairy mythology says he is only our old friend robin goodfellow miltons lubber fiend the hob goblin  you know rupert and robert and hob are all the same name rudbryht bright in speech  and a hobbish fellow means a gentleman as clumsy as the lubber fiend said elizabeth  no doubt he wore hobnails in his shoes said rupert  and chimney hobs were so called because his cream bowl was duly set upon them said anne  and he was as familiar as the robin redbreast said elizabeth  and wore a red waistcoat like him and like herb robert said anne  as shabby as this flower said elizabeth gathering a ragged robin from the hedge  well done etymology said rupert now for syntax and prosody  i hope we have been talking syntax all this time said elizabeth we will keep prosody for the evening and then play at conglomeration  they now came to some bright green watermeadows which bordered the little stream as soon as it left the town  there was a broad dry path by the river side and as they walked along it there was no lack of laughter or merriment in anyone but helen and she could find no amusement in anything she saw or heard  at last however she was highly delighted at the sight of some plants of purple loosestrife growing on the bank  oh cried she that is the flower that is so beautiful at dykelands  what the loose strife said elizabeth it is common enough in all damp places  poor helen as if this slight to the flower she admired were not a sufficient shock to her feelings rupert perfectly unconscious on what tender ground he was treading said if it is a lover of damp i am sure it can nowhere be better suited than at dykelands  did you grow webfooted there helen  o rupert said helen i am sure the garden is always quite dry  except when it is wet said elizabeth  that was certainly the case when i was there two years ago observed rupert i could not stir two steps from the door without meeting with a pool deep enough to swim a manofwar  rupert said elizabeth i hereby give notice that whosoever says one single word against the perfect dryness cleanliness and beauty of dear dykelands commits high treason against miss helen woodbourne and as protecting disconsolate damsels is the bounden duty of a true knight and cavalier i advise you never to mention the subject on pain of being considered a discourteous recreant  lizzie how can you said helen peevishly  how strange it is said anne that so many old family houses should have been built in damp places  our ancestors were once apparently frogs said rupert unhappily reminding helen of her sisters parody  well said elizabeth i can understand why monasteries should have been built in damp places near rivers or bogs both for the sake of the fish and to be useful in draining but why any other mortal except dutchmen tadpoles and newts should delight in mud and mire passes my poor comprehension  rupert pointed to a frog which doras foot had startled from its hidingplace and said pray why according to my theory should not the human kind have once been frogs leapfrog being only a return to our natural means of progression  and bullfrogs in a course of becoming stalwart gentlemen said anne  yes we often hear of a croaking disposition do not we helen said elizabeth you see both that propensity and a love of marshes are but indications of a former state of existence  and i am sure that your respectable neighbour mr turner is a toad on his hind legs said rupert  minus the precious jewel said elizabeth  bythebye said rupert is there not some mystery about that gentleman  this morning i hazarded a supposition in the drawingroom that the lost darling we have heard so much of might have been dissected for the benefit of mr turners pupils and thereupon arose a most wonderful whispering between kate and one of your sweet cousins there lizzie about some nephew an adolphus or augustus or some such name but the more questions i asked the more dark and mysterious did the young ladies become  i wonder if it is possible cried elizabeth with a sudden start  what is possible asked anne  that rupert should be right said elizabeth was mrs hazleby in the room when you spoke  yes but what of that said rupert  that you talking at random said elizabeth very nearly betrayed harriets grand secret  really the affair becomes quite exciting said rupert pray do not leave me in suspense explain yourself  i do not think i can rupert said elizabeth not wishing to expose harriet for mrs woodbournes sake  then i am to understand said rupert that miss hazleby has presented fido to this noble adolphus as a pledge of the tenderest friendship and that you and kate act as confidants  nonsense rupert said anne trying to check him by a look  and i suppose proceeded rupert that the gentleman is to extract poor fidos faithful heart and wear it next his own  i never should have devised so refined and sentimental a souvenir  it is far beyond forgetmenots and arrows  so professional too  elizabeth and anne laughed so much that they could neither of them speak for some moments but when anne recovered she took her brother by the arm and whispered rupert the less you say about the turners or fido the better  i will explain it all to you when we have an opportunity  elizabeth thanked her by a look and at this moment dora who had been far in advance with katherine and the hazlebys came running back to beg rupert to gather for her some fine bulrushes which grew on the brink of the river  rupert was very willing to comply with her request but elizabeth recommended dora to leave them till they should return and not to take the trouble of carrying them to whistlefar castle and back again  leaving the river they began to ascend a steep chalky lane which had been wet all the winter and was now full of rough hardened wheelruts and holes made by slipping horses  elizabeth thought that robert bruces calthorps could hardly have made the ground more uneven and she was just going to say so when helen groaned out what a horrid place  i slip and bruise my ancle every minute upon which she immediately took the other side of the question and answered it is not nearly so bad as the long lane on the down and you never complain of that  oh but this is all uphill said helen  i am not in the least tired helen said dora who with ruperts assistance was taking flying leaps over the ruts  you no i should think not said helen in so piteous a tone that rupert very goodnaturedly waited till she came up to him and then offered her his arm  on seeing this harriet was rather vexed that she had not been first noticed by the gentleman and began to make heavy complaints of the badness of the road but no one paid much attention to her elizabeth however gave her arm to lucy who never could bear much fatigue  after they had gained the top of the hill they walked on for some distance between high hedges and as none of the party knew the way further than the river except from some directions given them by mr walker the curate they begun to think that they must have missed a turn to the left which he had told them to take  harriet and helen both declared that they had passed the turning katherine was sure they had not and elizabeth said that she had seen a turn to the right some way behind them but that to the left was yet to come as they could not agree upon this question rupert walked onwards to explore leaving the young ladies to rest on the trunk of a tree lying by the side of the road  while he was gone elizabeth drew helen aside saying helen you had better take care i hope rupert has not observed how much out of humour you are  i am not out of humour said helen according to the usual fashion of denying such a charge  then why do you look and speak as if you were said her sister you had better watch yourself  i think you are enough to vex anyone lizzie said helen bringing me ever so far out of the way on such a road as this and then scolding me for saying i do not like it  i see answered elizabeth you are not in a fit state to be reasoned with  no retorted helen who had indulged in her illhumour till she hardly knew what she said you will never condescend to hear what i have to say  perhaps it might be as well sometimes if you would  yes helen said elizabeth colouring and turning away it would indeed  i know i have given you a right to upbraid me  at this moment rupert came back cheering the drooping courage of the wearied and heated damsels with intelligence that there is no lane without a turning and he had found the one they were seeking  things now went on better they came to a shady green path by the side of a wood and helen was more silent her temper having perhaps been a little improved by the coolness  soon however they had to cross two long fields where gleaning was going on merrily helen made several complaints of the heat and of the small size of her parasol and elizabeth had to catch dora and hold her fast to prevent her from overheating herself by a race after rupert through the stubble  at the first stile harriet thought proper to make a great outcry and was evidently quite disposed for a romp but rupert helped her over so quietly that she had no opportunity for one  they now found themselves in a grass field the length of which made helen sigh  why helen how soon you are tired said rupert i am afraid dykelands did not agree with you  helen is only a little cross she will be better presently said dora in so comical a tone that rupert katherine and harriet all laughed and helen said sharply dora do not be pert  rupert was really a very goodnatured youth but it would have required more forbearance than he possessed to abstain from teazing so tempting a subject as poor helen was at this moment  and how do you know that helen is a little cross dora my dear said he  because she looks so said dora  and how do people look when they are a little cross dora  i do not know answered dora  do they look so my dear said rupert mimicking poor helens woebegone face in a very droll way  dora laughed and helen was still more displeased  dora it is very naughty said she  what to look cross said rupert certainly is it not dora  elizabeth and anne were far in the rear reaching for some botanical curiosity on the other side of a wet ditch or they would certainly have put a stop to this conversation which was not very profitable to any of the parties concerned  dora was rather a matteroffact little person and a very good implement for teazing with as she did not at all suspect the use made of her until a sudden thought striking her she stopped short saying very decidedly we will not talk of this any more  why not said rupert rather sorry to be checked in the full enjoyment of his own wit  because helen does not like it said dora  but dora said rupert wishing to try the little girl rather further do not you think she deserves it for being out of temper  i do not know said dora gravely but i know it is not right or kind to say what vexes her and i shall not stay with you any longer rupert if you will do it  so saying dora wellnamed discreet dolly ran away to lucy of whom she was very fond  rupert was both amused and surprised at doras behaviour and perhaps at the same time a little ashamed and piqued by a little girl of seven years old having shewn more right feeling and selfcommand than he had displayed and to cover all these sensations he began to talk nonsense to katherine and harriet as fast as he could  in the mean time helen walked on alone a little behind the rest of the party for by this time elizabeth and anne had come up with the others and had passed her  as they entered a little copse she began to recollect herself  she had from her infancy been accustomed to give way to fits of peevishness and fretfulness thinking that as long as her illhumour did not burst forth in open name as elizabeths used formerly to do there was no great harm in letting it smoulder away and make herself and everyone else uncomfortable some time ago something had brought conviction to her mind that such conduct was not much better than bearing malice and hatred in her heart and she had resolved to cure herself of the habit  then came her visit to dykelands where everything went on smoothly and there was little temptation to give way to illhumour so that she had almost forgotten her reflections on the subject till the present moment when she seemed suddenly to wake and find herself in the midst of one of her old sullen moods  she struggled hard against it and as acknowledging ill temper is one great step towards conquering it she soon recovered sufficiently to admire the deep pink fruit of the skewerwood and the waxen looking red and yellow berries of the wild guelder rose when suddenly the rear of the darkness dim which overshadowed her spirits was scattered by the lively din of a long loud whistle from rupert who was concealed from her by some trees a little in advance of her  she hastened forwards and found him and all the others just emerged from the wood and standing on an open bare common where neither castle nor cottage was to be seen nothing but a carpet of purple heath dwarf furze and short soft grass upon which a few cows a colt and a donkey were browsing  the party were standing together laughing some moderately others immoderately  what is the matter asked helen  i do not know said elizabeth unless rupert is hallooing because he is out of the wood  wait till you have heard my reasons unfolded said rupert did you never hear how this celebrated fortress came by its name  never said several voices  then listen listen ladies all said rupert  you must know that once upon a time there was a most beautiful princess who lived in a splendid castle where she received all kinds of company  well one day there arrived an old grim palmer just like the picture of hopeful in the pilgrims progress with a fine striped cockleshell sticking upright in his hatband  well the cockleshell tickled the princesss fancy very much and she made her pet knight for she had as many suitors as penelope promise that he would steal it from him that very night  so at the witching hour of midnight the knight approached the palmers couch and gently abstracted the cockle hat and staff placing in their stead the jesters cap and bells and bauble  next morning when it was pitch dark for it was the shortest day up jumped the palmer and prepared to resume his journey  now it chanced that the day before the lady had ordered that the fool should be whipped for mocking her when she could not get the marrow neatly out of a bone with her fingers and peeped into it like a hungry magpie so that the moment the poor palmer appeared in the courtyard all the squires and pages set upon him taking him for the fool and whipped him round and round like any pegtop suddenly down fell the cap and bells and he saw what had been done upon which he immediately turned into an enchanter and commanded the princess and all her train to fall into a deep sleep all excepting the knight who had committed the offence who is for ever riding up and down the castle court repenting of his discourtesy with his face towards the tail of a creamcoloured donkey wearing a cap and bells for a helmet with a rod for a lance and a cockleshell for a shield and starfishes for spurs and the princess can only be disenchanted by her devoted champion doing battle with him all however has vanished away from vulgar eyes and can only be brought to light by being thrice whistled for  a slight tradition has remained and the place has ever since been known by the mysterious name of whistlefar  and has no one ever found it said dora  i cannot say answered rupert  a deed of such high emprise can only be reserved for the great prince rupert himself said elizabeth  how can such nonsensical traditions be kept up said harriet i thought everyone had forgotten such absurd old stories only fit to frighten children  oh you know nobody believes them said katherine  but rupert said helen this must be a modern story it cannot be a genuine old legend it is really not according to the spirit of those times to say that a palmer could be an enchanter or so revengeful  oh said rupert you know everything bad is to be learnt among the saracens  still said helen if you consider the purpose for which the palmers visited the holy land you cannot think them likely to learn the dark rites of the infidels and scarcely to wish to gratify personal resentment  the frock does not make the friar said rupert and this may have been a bad palmer  think of the knights templars  besides said helen how could the squires see either palmer or jester when it was pitch dark  i suppose there were lamps in the court said rupert but            i cannot tell how the truth may be            i tell the tale as twas told to me   but who told you rupert said helen  why the story of red mantle helen cannot you see said elizabeth it was on the table all the morning  o lizzie was there ever anything so cruel cried rupert edie ochiltree was nothing to you  everyone was swallowing it so quietly and you will not even let me enjoy the credit of originality  i am sure i give you credit due said elizabeth it is really an ingenious compound of red mantle the sleeping beauty robert of paris and triermain and the cockleshell shield and starfish spurs form an agreeable variation  i never will tell another story in your presence lizzie said rupert evidently vexed but carrying it off with great good humour you are worse than quarterly edinburgh and blackwood put together  i really think you deserved it rupert said anne i cannot pity you you ought not to laugh at the pilgrims  oh i dare not open my lips before such devotees of crusading said rupert  and pray rupert said elizabeth what did you mean by comparing me to edie ochiltree did you mean to say that you were like monkbarns  i never heard that that gentleman fabricated either legends or curiosities and made them pass for genuine ancient ones  at this moment happily for rupert they came to the top of a small rising ground and beheld a farmhouse at about a hundred yards before them  rupert whistled long and loud and shrill and two or three of the young ladies exclaimed is this whistlefar castle  it is only enchanted said elizabeth clear away the mist of incredulity from your eyes and behold keep drawbridge tower and battlement and loophole grates where captives weep  it cannot be denied that the young party were a little disappointed by the aspect of the renowned whistlefar but they did ample justice to all that was to be seen a few yards of very thick stone wall in the court a coat of arms carved upon a stone built into the wall upside down and the wellturned arch of the doorway  some putting on don quixotes eyes for the occasion saw helmets in milkpails dungeons in cellars battleaxes in billhooks and shields in pewterplates called the baby in its cradle the sleeping princess agreed that the shield must have been reversed by order of the palmer and that one of the cows was the mischievous knights creamcoloured donkey so that laughter happily supplied the place of learned lore  on the way home the party were not quite so merry although helen was unusually agreeable and enjoyed a very pleasant conversation with rupert and anne who she was pleased to find really thought her worth talking to  elizabeth was occupied with dora who was tired and wanted to be cheered and amused  she did not however forget her bulrushes and when they came in sight of them she ran forwards to claim ruperts promise of gathering some for her and her little brother and sister  this was a service of difficulty for some of the bulrushes grew in the water and others on deceitful ground where a pool appeared wherever rupert set his foot  with two or three strides and leaps however he reached a little dry island covered with a tuft of sedges in the midst of the marsh and was reaching some of the bulrushes with the hook of annes parasol when he suddenly cried out hollo what have we here  what said some of the girls  a dead dog i believe said rupert  oh let me see cried harriet advancing cautiously over the morass  are you curious in such matters miss hazleby said rupert laughing as harriet came splashing towards him through the wet holding up her frock with one hand and stretching out the other to him to be helped upon the island  he pulled her upon it safely but it quaked fearfully and there was hardly room for them both to stand on it while harriet holding fast by ruperts hand bent forwards beheld the object of her curiosity uttered a loud scream lost her balance and would have fallen into the river had she not been withheld by ruperts strength of arm  they both slipped down on the opposite sides of the island into the black mud and harriet precipitately retreated to the mainland  well what is the matter said elizabeth  oh my poor dear little doggie cried harriet  is it fido said elizabeth then harriet there is no fear of your eating him in a sausage you may be at rest on that score  but can it really be fido said katherine pressing forwards  do you wish to see said rupert for if so i advise you to make haste the island is sinking fast  i am splashed all over so i do not care  can i have one more look said harriet in a melancholy voice  rupert handed her back to the island where she took her last farewell of poor fido all his long hair drenched with water and the very same blue ribbon which she had herself tied round his neck the day before floating a funeral banner on the surface of the stream she contemplated him until her weight and ruperts had sunk the island so much that it was fast becoming a lake while elizabeth whispered to anne to propose presenting her with a forgetmenot on fidos part  i hope said rupert as they proceeded with their walk that you are fully sensible of poor fidos generous selfsacrifice he immolated himself to remove by the manner of his death any suspicions of winifreds having the fidophobia  perhaps said elizabeth he had some knowledge of the frightful suspicions which attached to him and like the irish varmint in st patricks days                        went flop           slap bang into the water           and thus committed suicide           to save himself from slaughter   they now began to consider how fido could have met with his death harriet was sure that some naughty boy must have thrown him in  lucy thought that in that case he would have lost his blue ribbon dora indignantly repelled the charge of cruelty from the youth of abbeychurch elizabeth said such a puppy was very likely to fall off the bridge and rupert decided that he had most probably been attacked by a fit to which he said halfgrown puppies were often liable  rupert and anne then began talking about a dog which they had lost some time ago in nearly the same manner and during this dialogue the party divided harriet and katherine walked on in close consultation and lucy and helen began helping dora to sort and carry her bulrushes which detained them behind the others  what appears to me the most mysterious part of the story said rupert is how the beloved fido petted and watched and nursed and guarded as he seems to have been should have contrived to stray from your house as far as to the river  oh that is no mystery at all said elizabeth we crossed the bridge twice yesterday evening and i dare say we left him behind us there  what could you have been doing on the bridge yesterday evening said rupert  oh i know i saw the people coming away from a teetotal entertainment you were certainly there anne i hope you enjoyed it  how very near the truth you do contrive to get rupert said elizabeth  then cried rupert with a start i see it all  i thought you all looked very queer at breakfast  i understand it all  you have been to the mechanics institute  yes rupert said elizabeth  no but you do not mean to say that you really have lizzie and anne cried rupert turning round to look into their faces  each made a sign of assent and rupert as soon as he had recovered from his astonishment burst into a violent fit of laughter which lasted longer than either his sister or cousin approved and it was not till after he had been well scolded by both that he chose to listen to their full account of all that had passed on the subject  the worst of it is now said elizabeth that as soon as mrs hazleby hears that fido has been found in the river she will ask how he came near it  and what then said anne  why she well knows that the bridge is not a place to which we are likely to resort she will ask what took us there i would not trust harriet to tell the truth and i have promised not to betray her so what is to be done if mrs hazleby asks me said elizabeth  i hope she will not ask her youngest daughter said anne  that she shall not do said elizabeth i will tell her myself that fido was found in the river and answer all her questions as best i can  it is rather a pity said anne archly that miss hazleby did not actually fall into the river for the sensation caused by ruperts rescuing her would quite have absorbed all the interest in fidos melancholy fate  thank you anne said rupert i am sure i only wonder she was not submerged  i never could have guessed any fair lady could be so heavy i am sure i feel the claw she gave my arm at this moment  how very ungallant said anne  still said rupert without appearing as the preserver of the fair harriet from a watery grave i think i have interest enough with mrs hazleby to be able to break the fatal news to her and calm her first agonies of grief and wrath  you rupert said anne  myself anne replied rupert you have no notion what friends mrs hazleby and i have become  we had a teteatete of an hour and a half this morning  what could you find to talk about said anne  first said rupert she asked about my grouse shooting where i went and with whom and whether i had seen any of the campbells of inchlitherock  of course we embarked in a genealogy of the whole campbell race then came a description of the beauties of inchlitherock   next i was favoured with her private history how she being one of thirteen was forced at eighteen to leave the lovely spot and embark with her brother for india  on speculation said elizabeth  and finally how she came to marry the major  o rupert that is too much you must have invented it cried anne  indeed i did not anne said rupert it is a fact that she lived somewhere in the mofussil with her brother and there she encountered the major  you young ladies may imagine how she fascinated him and how finally her brother seems to have bullied the major into marrying her  poor man said elizabeth i always wondered how he chanced to fall into her clutches  but did you hear no more  no more of her personal history said rupert she kindly employed the rest of her time in giving me wise counsels  oh pray let us have the benefit of them said anne who had by this time pretty well forgotten her prudence  there were many regrets that i was not in the army said rupert and many pieces of advice which would have been very useful if i had but which i am afraid were thrown away upon me ending with wise reflections upon the importance of a wise choice of a wife especially for a young man of family exposed to danger from designing young ladies with cautions against beauty because of its perishable nature and learning because literary ladies are fit for nothing  meaning to imply said elizabeth how fortunate was major hazleby in meeting with so sweet a creature as the charming miss barbara campbell possessed of neither of these dangerous qualities  i do not know said anne i think she might have possessed some of the former when she left inchlitherock  before twenty years of managing and scolding had fixed her eyes in one perpetual stare said elizabeth  but here we are at home  they found the hall table covered with parcels which shewed that mrs woodbourne and her party had returned from their drive and the girls hastened upstairs  anne found her mamma in her room as well as sir edward who was finishing a letter  well mamma had you a prosperous journey said she  yes very much so said lady merton mrs hazleby was in high goodhumour she did nothing but sing ruperts praises and did not scold mrs woodbourne as much as usual  and what have you been doing miss anne said sir edward you are quite on the qui vive  oh i have been laughing at the fun which rupert and lizzie have been making about mrs hazleby said anne i really could not help it mamma and i do not think i began it  began what said sir edward  why mamma was afraid i should seem to set lizzie against her stepmothers relations if i quizzed them or abused them said anne  i do not think what you could say would make much difference in lizzies opinion of them said sir edward but certainly i should think they were not the best subjects of conversation here  but i have not told you of the grand catastrophe said anne we have found poor fido drowned among the bulrushes  i hope mrs woodbourne will be happy again said lady merton  and mamma he must have fallen in while we were at the mechanics institute said anne there is one bad consequence of our folly already  i cannot see what induced you to go said sir edward i thought lizzie had more sense  i believe the actual impulse was given by a dispute between lizzie and me on the date of chivalry said anne  and so ruperts friends the turners are great authorities in history said sir edward i never should have suspected it  now i think of it said anne it was the most ridiculous part of the affair considering the blunder that lizzie told me mrs turner made about st augustine  what could we have been dreaming of  midsummer madness said sir edward  but just tell me papa said anne do you not think helen quite the heroine of the story  i think helen very much improved in appearance and manners said sir edward and i am quite willing to believe all that i see you have to tell me of her  do not wait to tell it now anne said lady merton or mrs woodbourne will not think us improved in appearance or manners it is nearly six oclock  i will keep it all for the journey home said anne when papas ears will be disengaged  and his tongue too to give you a lecture upon radicalism miss said sir edward with a fierce gesture which drove anne away laughing  elizabeth had finished dressing a little too rapidly and had gone to find mrs woodbourne  well mamma said she as soon as she came into her room winifred has lived to say the dog is dead  what do you mean my dear said mrs woodbourne  the enemy is dead mamma said elizabeth we found him drowned by the green meadow  poor little fellow your aunt will be very sorry was kind mrs woodbournes remark  but now mamma said elizabeth you may be quite easy about winifred he could not possibly have been mad  how could he have fallen in poor little dog said mrs woodbourne  he must have strayed about upon the bridge while we were at the mechanics institute said elizabeth it was all my fault and i am afraid it is a very great distress to lucy  helen might well say mischief would come of our going  i wish the loss of fido was all the mischief likely to come of it my dear said mrs woodbourne with a sigh i am afraid your papa will be very much annoyed by it with so much as he has on his mind too  ah mamma that is the worst of it indeed said elizabeth covering her face with her hands if i could do anything  my dearest child said mrs woodbourne do not go on making yourself unhappy i am very sorry i said anything about your papa you know he cannot be angry with one who grieves so sincerely for what she has done amiss  i am sure you have learnt a useful lesson and will be wiser in future  now do put your scarf even and let me pin this piece of lace straight for you it is higher on one side than the other and your band is twisted  on her side lucy trembling as she entered her mothers room but firm in her purpose of preserving her sister from the temptation to prevaricate by taking all the blame which mrs hazleby chose to ascribe to her quietly communicated the fatal intelligence to mrs hazleby  her information was received with a short angry hm and no more was said upon the matter as mrs hazleby was eager to shew harriet some wonderful bargains which she had met with at baysmouth     chapter xi   as soon as mrs hazleby made her appearance in the drawingroom before dinner rupert began repeating            the wound it seemed both sore and sad              to every christian eye            and while they swore the dog was mad              they swore the child would die             but soon a wonder came to light              that shewed the rogues they lied            the child recovered of the bite              it was the dog that died   i beg to offer my congratulations continued he setting a chair for her  mrs hazleby looked surprised  on the demonstration we have this day received of your superior judgement maam said rupert though indeed we could hardly have doubted it before  pray let me understand you mr merton said mrs hazleby  have you not heard of the circumstance to which i allude said rupert for if you are not already aware of it i must beg to be excused from relating it i could not bear to give so great a shock to a ladys feelings  oh you mean about fido said mrs hazleby almost smiling yes lucy told me that you had found him  really my girls are so careless i can trust nothing to them  indeed madam said rupert i assure you that nothing could have been more heartrending than the scene presented to our eyes when the miss hazlebys first became aware of the untimely fate of their favourite  who could behold it with dry eyeor dry foot added he in an undertone with a side glance at anne  rupert contrived to talk so much nonsense to mrs hazleby that he charmed her with his attention gave her no time to say anything about fido and left anne much surprised that she had never found out that he was laughing at her  at dinner the grouse he had brought came to their aid mrs hazleby was delighted to taste a blackcock once more and was full of reminiscences of inchlitherock and by means of these recollections and ruperts newly imported histories sir edward and mr woodbourne contrived to make the conversation more entertaining than elizabeth thought it ever could be in any party in which mrs hazleby was present  afterwards in the drawingroom doras bulrushes and the other childrens purchases were duly admired and the little people being rather fatigued were early sent to bed although edward vehemently insisted with his eyes half shut that he was not in the least sleepy the elder girls then arranged themselves round the table helen was working a bunch of roses of different colours anne admired it very much but critics were not wanting to this as to every other performance of helens  it is all very pretty except that rose said katherine but i am sure that is an unnatural colouris it not anne  i do not think that i ever saw one like it said anne but that is no proof that there is no such flower  what do you think lizzie said katherine ought not helen to alter it  anne was rather alarmed by this appeal but elizabeth answered carelessly without looking up oh you know i know nothing about that kind of work  but you can tell what colour a rose is persisted katherine now do not you think helen will spoil her work with that orangecoloured rose who ever heard of such a thing  helen was on the point of saying that one of the gableends of the house at dykelands was covered with a single rose of that colour but she remembered that dykelands was not a safe subject and refrained  come do not have a york and lancaster war about an orangecoloured rose kate said elizabeth coming up to helen why anne where are your eyes did you never see an austrian briar just the the colour of helens lambswools  though this was a mere trifle helen was pleased to find that elizabeth could sometimes be on her side of the question and worked on in a more cheerful spirit  why anne said elizabeth presently after you are doing that old wreath over again that you were about last year when i was at merton hall  yes said anne it is a pattern which i like very much  do you like working the same thing over again said katherine i always get tired of it  i like it very much said anne going over the same stitches puts me in mind of things that were going on when i was working them beforenow lizzie the edge of that poppy seems to have written in it all that delightful talk we had together at home about growing up that day when papa and mamma dined out and we had it all to ourselves and the iris has the whole of don quixote folded up in it because papa was reading it to us when i was at work upon it  there certainly seems to be a use and pleasure in never sitting down three minutes without that carpetwork which i should never have suspected said elizabeth  anne thinks as i do said mrs woodbourne i find carpetwork quite a companion to me but i cannot persuade lizzie to take any pleasure in it  i have not time for it said elizabeth nor patience if i had time it is all i can persuade myself to do to keep my clothes from being absolute rags  yes said katherine you always read with meg in your lap when you have no mending to do you have been six months braiding that frock  oh that is company work said elizabeth i began it at merton hall for dora but i believe winifred must have it now  but now it is so nearly done that i shall finish while you are here  elizabeth did not however long continue working for as soon as tea was over she proposed to play at the game of conglomeration as she had talked of doing in the course of the walk  i give notice however said she that we are likely to laugh more than will suit the gravity of the elders therefore i recommend adjourning to the inner drawingroommamma may we have candles there  consent was given and while the candles were being brought and elizabeth was looking out some paper anne whispered to her brother rupert pray say nothing about fido or the mechanics institute or something unpleasant will surely come of it  oh anne was the answer you have robbed me of my best couplet            weeping like forsaken dido           when she found the slaughtered fido  where is the use of playing if there is to be no fun  where is the use of fun said the cockchafer to the boy who was spinning it said anne  impertinence impertinence impertinence said rupert shaking his head at her  by this time all was ready and elizabeth called the brother and sister to take their places at the table in the inner drawingroom she then wrote a substantive at the upper end of a long strip of paper and folding it down handed it on to lucy who also wrote a noun turned it down and gave the paper to helen who after writing hers and hiding it passed it on to rupert  thus the paper was handed round till it was filled  it was then unrolled and each player was required to write a copy of verses in which these words were to be introduced as rhymes in the order in which they stood in the list  rupert was rather put out by his sisters not allowing him to turn the poem in the way he wished and he thought proper to find fault with half the words in the list  harrogate said he what is to be done with such a word  you can manage it very well if you choose said elizabeth  but who could have thought of such a word said he holding up the list to the candle and scrutinizing the writing  some one with a watery taste doubtless  you know those things are never divulged said anne  frances too continued rupert there is another impossible case i will answer for it helen wrote that a reminiscence of dear dykelands  no indeed i did not said helen it is francis too i believe  oh yes said harriet it is francis i wrote it becausedo not you remember lucyfrank hollis  well never mind said elizabeth who wished to hear no more of that gentleman you may make it whichever you please  and rupert pray do not be so idle put down the list no one can see it write your own verses and tell me the next word to witch  eyes said rupert and then bounce  i do not believe that word is english  bounce no said katherine it is bonnet i wrote it myself  then why do you make your t so short said rupert i must give you a writing lesson miss kitty  i must give you a lesson in silence mr rupert said elizabeth  i obey said rupert with a funny face of submission and taking up his paper and pencil but in a minute or two he started up exclaiming what are they saying about oxford and walked into the next room intending to take part in the conversation between his father and uncle  mr woodbourne however who was no great admirer of ruperts forwardness did not shew so much deference to his nephews opinion as to make him very unwilling to return to the inner drawingroom when anne came to tell him that all the poems were finished and elizabeth ready to read them aloud  so this is all that you have to shew for yourself said elizabeth holding up a scrap of paper what is all this  a portrait of miss merton said rupert do not you see the poets eye in a fine frenzy rolling  is it said elizabeth i took it for miss squeers in the agonies of death as i see that is the subject of the poemall that there is of it at least      did ever you see a stupider poem     pray who is the author  i know him i know him     he went to school to mr squeers     who often made the youth shed tears  now for the next which is nearly as short       i will write a poem     clear and flowing     it will make you shed tears     and excite your fears     tis about a witch     drowned in a ditch     your tears come from your eyes     if you are wise     dont make a bounce     or youll tear your flounce     and upset the sugar jar     which i cannot spare     i must give some to francis     so well he dances     sugar canes packed up in leaves     the canes are tied up like wheat sheaves     francis wears a scarlet jacket     he made a dreadful racket     at harrogate     because he had to wait     in a field of barley     to hold a parley     about a bone of marrow     his heart was transfixed by an arrow     by a lady in velvet     and he was her pet   all laughed heartily at this poem which perhaps diverted them more than a better would have done harriet was highly delighted with what she considered their applause though she knew that of all the rhymes scarcely three had been found by herself  why mr merton what are you doing asked harriet are you writing any more  oh i hope he will tell us about mr squeers said katherine  no one could doubt that the next which elizabeth read was her own       im afraid you expect a beautiful poem     though i make a long and tedious proem     but great and dreadful are my fears     no poem of mine will put you in tears     my genius suggests neither fairy nor witch     my tales to adorn with cauldrons of pitch     alarm the world with fiery eyes     and from the hero snatch his prize     leap out from her den with a terrible bounce     and on the trembling damsel pounce     and bottle her up in a close corked jar     or whirl her away in a flaming car     then her knight the brave sir francis     upon his noble steed advances     all his armour off he leaves     preserves alone his polished greaves     his defence is a buff jacket     nor sword nor axe nor lance can crack it     it was made at harrogate     by a tailor whose shop had a narrow gate     the elves attack with spears of barley     but he drives them off oh rarely     then they shoot him with an arrow     from bowstrings greased with earwigs marrow     the feathers mothwings downy velvet     the bowstrings of the spiders net     thousands come armed in this pattern     which proves their mistress is no slattern     some wear the legs and hoof of pan     and some are in the form of man     but the knight is armed for in his pocket     he has a talismanic locket     which once belonged to hercules     who wore it on his bunch of keys     the fairy comes quite old and fat     mounted upon a monstrous bat     around the knight a web she weaves     and holds him fast and there she leaves     sir francis weeping for his charmer     and longing for his knightly armour     but his sword was cast in the selfsame forge     as that of the great champion george     thus he defies the witchs army     he breaks his bands ye elves beware me     i fear not your leviathan     no spells can stop a desperate man     away in terror flies the rearguard     he seizes on the witch abhorred     confines her in a cockle shell     and breaks all her enchantments fell     catches her principal lieutenant     makes him of a split pine the tenant     carries away the lady nimble     as eer miss merton plied her thimble     oh this story would your frowns unbend     could i tell it to the end   oh said rupert glad to seize an opportunity of retaliating upon elizabeth i give you credit a very ingenious compound of thalaba pigwiggin and the tempest and the circumstance of the witch whirling away the lady is something new  no it is not said elizabeth it is the beginning of the story of the palace of truth in the veillees du chateau  i only professed to conglomerate the words not to pass off my story as a regular old traditional legend  well well said rupert go on have you only two more  only two said elizabeth kate and lucy behaved as shabbily as you did  helen i believe you must read yours  i can never read your writing readily and besides i am growing hoarse  helen obeyed       how hard it is to write a poem       graceful and witty plain and clear     harder than ploughingtis or sowing       so hard that i should shed a tear      did i not know the highest pitch       of merit in the poets eyes     is but to laugh a height to which       tis not so hard for me to rise      for badness soon is gained forth bounce       my rhymes such as they are     good critics on my lines dont pounce       though on the ear they jar      ive had a letter from dear frances       who says through the light plane tree leaves     upon the lawn the sunbeam glances       the wheat is bound up in its sheaves      by richard in the fustian jacket       his mistress bought at harrogate     and up in lofty ricks they stack it       there for the threshing will it wait      then will they turn to fields of barley       bearded and barbed with many an arrow     just where the fertile soil is marly       and in the spring was used the harrow      drawn by the steeds in coats of velvet       old steady jack and slattern     their manes well combed and black as jet       their tails in the same pattern      while richards son with pipe of pan       his hands within his pockets     walks close beside the old ploughman       dreaming of squibs and rockets      that youth he greatly loves his ease       hes growing much too fat     and though as strong as hercules       hell only use his bat      he wont sweep up the autumn leaves       the trees deciduous armour     no scolding dickeys spirit grieves       like working like a farmer      or labouring like his cousin george       with arms all bare and brawny     within the blacksmiths

the storm of shot and shell       youd soon desert your pennant     care nought for serjeant corporal       or general lieutenant      but prove yourself quite swift and nimble       and thus would meet your end     no better take a tailors thimble       and learn your ways to mend   capital helen said elizabeth  how very pretty said lucy  and very well described said anne you have brought in those ungainly words most satisfactorily  now helen here is annes said elizabeth it is a choice one and i have kept it for the last  let me read annes said rupert no one can decypher her writing as well as i can  as was proved by the thorough acquaintance you shewed with the contents of her last letter said elizabeth  rupert began as follows      now must i write in numbers flowing     extemporaneously a poem   why rupert cried anne you must be reading kates  mine began with  i declare that i have yours in my hand anne said rupert  and i did not write one said katherine       now must i write in numbers flowing     extemporaneously a poem     one that will fill your eyes with tears     while i relate how our worst fears     were realized in yonder ditch     conveyed there by some waterwitch     we found sad sight for longing eyes     fido much loved though small in size     hard fate but while our tears bemoan it     let us take up the corpse and bone it     then place the mummy in a jar     keep it from sausagemakers far     extract his heart to send to francis     this gift from her his soul entrances     within his scarlet goldlaced jacket     his heart makes a tremendous racket     visions of bliss arise a surrogate     ay and a wedding tour to harrogate   when rupert came to fido anne uttered one indignant rupert but as he proceeded she was too much confounded to make the slightest demonstration and yet she was nearly suffocated with laughter in the midst of her vexation when she thought of the ball at hull and frank hollis  elizabeth and katherine too were excessively diverted though the former repented of having ever proposed such a game for so incongruous a party  there was a little selfreproach mingled even with annes merriment for she felt that if she had more carefully abstained from criticising the hazlebys or from looking amused by what was said of them rupert would hardly have attempted this piece of impertinence  helen who considered it as a most improper proceeding sat perfectly still and silent with a countenance full of demure gravity which made elizabeth and anne fall into fresh convulsions as they looked at her lucy only blushed and as for harriet the last two lines could scarcely be heard for her exclamations of o mr merton that is too bad  o mr merton how could you think of such a thing  o mr merton i can never forgive you  oh dear oh dear  i shall never stop laughing  oh dear  mr merton what would frank hollis say to you how ridiculous  now for annes real poem rupert said elizabeth not choosing to make any remarks lest rupert should consider them as compliments  have you not heard it said rupert  nonsense said elizabeth  why i told you i had it in my hand said rupert  and you have it still said elizabeth deliver it up if you please it is the best of all i can tell you i had a cursory view of it  no no said anne who saw that her brother meant to teaze her and not to restore her verses it was a very poor performance it is much better for my fame that it should never be seen  only think what a sublime notion the world will have of it when it is said that even the great rupert himself is afraid to let it appear  elizabeth made another attempt to regain the poem but without effect and anne recalled the attention of all to helens verses  what is a pennant said elizabeth i do not like words to be twisted for the sake of the rhyme  a flag said helen  i never doubted that you intended it for a flag said elizabeth but what i complain of is that it is a transmogrified pennon  i believe a pennant to be a kind of flag said helen  let us refer the question to papa said anne as soon as he has finished that interminable conversation with uncle woodbourne  really in spite of that slight blemish said elizabeth your poem is the best we have heard helen  and i can testify said rupert that the description of the carthorses at dykelands is perfectly correct  but helen is it true that your friend dicky has been seized with a fit of martial ardour such as you describe  yes said helen he was very near enlisting but it made his mother very unhappy and mrs staunton  went down upon her knees to beseech him to remain and let her roast beef be food for him not himself be food for powder said rupert never considering how glad the parish would be to get rid of him  no said helen her powder became food for him she made him undergamekeeper  excellent helen you shine tonight cried elizabeth such a bit of wit never was heard from you before  your poem is a proof that the best way of being original is to describe things as you actually see them said anne  is not mine original  i do not think it was taken from any book said harriet willing to pick up a little more praise  not perhaps from any book said elizabeth with a very grave face but i am afraid we must convict you of having borrowed from the mother of books oral tradition  oral tradition repeated harriet opening her mouth very wide  yes said elizabeth for i cannot help imagining that the former part of your ode is a parody upon              ill tell you a story           about jack anory              and now my storys begun           ill tell you another              about jack and his brother           and now my story is done  and that your friend francis must have been the hero who complains so grievously of taffy the welshman whose house was doubtless situated in a field of barley while his making a dreadful racket is quite according to the ancient notions of what he did with the marrowbone  oh there is papa looking in at us said anne now for the question of pennon and pennant  oh anne it is all nonsense cried helen do not shew it  but anne with helens paper in her hand had already attacked sir edward who to the authors great surprise actually read the poem all through smiling very kindly and finished by saying ah ha helen it is plain enough that your friends are naval  i can see where your pennant came from  but is it not a flag uncle edward asked helen  a flag it is said sir edward and properly called and spelt pendant  there helen you are an antidote to the hydrophobia said rupert everything becomes  do not let us have any more of that stale joke said elizabeth it is really only a poetical license to use a seaflag for a landflag and helen had the advantage of us since we none of us knew that pennant signified anything but the naturalist  and pray helen said sir edward am i to consider this poem as an equivalent for the music you have cheated us of this evening  i hope you will consider that it is said elizabeth is it not positively poetical uncle edward  helen was hardly ever in a state of greater surprise and pleasure than at this moment for though she could not seriously believe that her lines were worthy of all the encomiums bestowed on them yet she was now convinced that elizabeth was not absolutely determined to depreciate every performance of hers and that she really possessed a little kindness for her  when mr woodbourne rang the bell elizabeth gathered up all the papers and was going to put them into a drawer when harriet came up to her saying in a whisper evidently designed to attract notice lizzie do give me that ridiculous thing you know of mr mertons i could not bear you to have it you would shew it to everyone  indeed i should do no such thing said elizabeth i never wish to see it more you are very welcome to it  harriet received the precious document with great satisfaction carefully folded it up and placed it in her bag very much to ruperts delight as he silently watched her proceedings  when they went up to bed anne followed lady merton to her room in order to ask some question about the dress which she was to wear the next day sunday and after remaining with her a few minutes she returned to elizabeth  she found her looking full of trouble quite a contrast to the bright animated creature she had been a few minutes before  my dear lizzie exclaimed anne has anything happened what has grieved you  why anne said elizabeth with almost a groan has not enough happened to grieve me is it not terrible to think of what i have done  anne stood still and silent much struck by her cousins sorrow for she had considered their expedition to the mechanics institute as a foolish girlish frolic but by no means as serious a matter as it now proved to be  i want you to tell me anne continued elizabeth was i not quite out of my senses yesterday evening  i can hardly believe it was myself who went to that horrible place i wish you could prove that it was my doubleganger  anne laughed  but does it not seem incredible said elizabeth that i elizabeth woodbourne should have voluntarily meddled with a radical levelling affair should have sought out mrs turner and all the set i most dislike done perhaps an infinity of mischief and all because kate wanted to go out on a party of pleasure with that foolish willie oh anne i wish you would beat me  would that be any comfort to you said anne smiling  yes said elizabeth i should feel as if i was suffering a little for my madness  oh how i hope papa will speak to me about it  if he does not i shall see his displeasure in his eyes and oh i could bear anything better than the silent stern way in which he used to look at me once before when i had behaved very ill  and then tomorrow is sunday and i shall scarcely see him all day and he will have no time to speak to me and how can i get through a sunday feeling that he is angry with me how shall i teach the children or do anything as usual anne what do you think was the first sound in my ears when i awoke this morning and has been returning upon me all daythe words it was a tree to be desired to make one wise  little wisdom we have gained from it said anne  eves wisdom said elizabeth the knowledge of evil and the wisdom of vanity and vexation of spirit  but was it not curious anne when first i woke before i had opened my eyes those words were sounding in my ears like a dream of papas voice reading the lesson at church i almost fell asleep again and again those words came back in papas voice and then i woke entirely and before i had seen what kind of day it was before i knew whether it was saturday or sunday i was sure there was something wrong and then there was all this black mechanics institute business before me  and all through this day those words have been ringing in my ears and coming upon me like the pressure of king jamess iron belt  have they indeed said anne i could hardly have believed it i have not seen your look oercast and lower like his  perhaps not said elizabeth but yet i was like him            forward he rushed with double glee            into the tide of revelry  and i believe that having anything on my mind puts me in wilder spirits apparently than usual but i am sure that my merriment today was no proof that i was happy  it was partly i believe from a mad spirit like what drives wicked men to drinking and partly from folly and levity  it was the same when mammas sister miss dorothea hazleby died i am sure i was very sorry for aunt dorothy for she was a most amiable person and had always been particularly kind to me and i was very sorry too for mamma and old mrs hazleby who were brokenhearted about it yet would you believe it the very day that papa was gone to hastings to the funeral and mamma was at home too ill and too wretched to go even to her mother i was out in the garden with horace and dora forgot all about her distress and began a noisy game with them close under her window  she sent kate to tell them not to make such a noise and when we came in and she found that it was my doing she gave me such a kind grieved reproachful look that i think i shall never forget it  and now it is most strange to think how wildly and merrily i laughed at all ruperts jokes when i knew i was in disgrace and after having behaved so very ill  indeed i did not think it would have distressed you so much said anne i never thought it was more than a very foolish affair  it is a very different thing for you said elizabeth you have nothing to do with the town and you need not have known that it was not a fit place to go to  but you did not know that it was not fit for us said anne  i did know that i ought not to go where i had not been told i might go said elizabeth  it was relying on my own judgement that led me astray  but oh i wish i had been here at the time the socialist lectures were given i should as soon have thought of climbing up the kitchenchimney as of going to that den and giving the ragamuffins such a victory over papa  it was very silly of us not to ask a few more questions said anne  ah that is the worst part of my behaviour said elizabeth that abominably unfair account which i gave you at mr turners door of helens objections  it was in fact almost deceit and the only thing that can take off from the blackness of it is that i was sufficiently senseless to believe it myself at the time i spoke  oh yes of course you did said anne  yet there must have been a sort of feeling that your hearing her arguments would put a stop to the beautiful scheme said elizabeth you do not know perhaps that kate was nearly convinced by helens good sense and i do believe that the reason i was not was what i tremble to think of that i have been indulging in a frightful spirit of opposing and despising helen because i was angry with her for loving dykelands better than home  i do believe she hardly dares to open her lips  i heard her telling lucy afterwards that there was a rose at dykelands of the colour of her pattern and i dare say she did not say so when it would have been to the purpose for fear i should say that damp turns roses orangecoloured and i could see she did not defend her pendant with captain atherley for fear i should tell her he was not infallible  no wonder she pines for dykelands a fine sort of sister and home she has found here poor child  oh now you think so anne began but here she stopped short checked by her dread of interfering between sisters she could not bear to add to elizabeths bitter feelings of selfreproach and she could not say that her conduct on the preceding evening had been by any means what it ought to have been that she had treated helen kindly or that helen had not suffered much from her want of consideration for her she only kissed her cousin and wished her good night very affectionately and nothing more was said that evening  but annes silence was often very expressive to those who could understand it and of these elizabeth was one  the toilette of katherine and helen passed in a very different manner that evening katherine did nothing but giggle and chatter incessantly about the game they had been playing at in order to prevent helen from saying anything about the result of their excursion the evening before and to keep herself from thinking of the cowardly part she had been acting all day  helen only wished to be left in peace to think over her share in all these transactions and to consider how she might become a tolerably useful member of society for the future and on her making no reply to one of katherines speeches the latter suddenly became silent and she was left to her own reflections     chapter xii   elizabeth was always fully employed on a sunday and on that which followed the consecration she had perhaps more on her hands even than usual so that she had little opportunity for speaking or even for thinking of her troubles  mr woodbourne was going to assist mr somerville in the services at st austins leaving mr walker to do the duty at st marys as the old church was now to be always called  mr somerville had asked mrs woodbourne to bring all her party to luncheon at his house and had added a special invitation to the children to be present at the opening of the new sundayschool which was to take place between the services  it was however necessary that someone should stay and superintend what the young people called rather contemptuously the old school and this elizabeth undertook saying that she did not like to lose one sundays teaching of her own class  anne was about to offer to remain with her and assist her but on helens making the same proposal she thought it better to give the sisters an opportunity of being alone together and as she was more desirous of doing right than of appearing eager to be useful she said nothing of what she had intended  elizabeth was much gratified by her sisters voluntary proffer of assistance for the head and front of helens offences on her return from dykelands had been that she had loathed the idea of helping to train the screaming schoolgirls to sing in church and had altogether shewn far less interest in parish matters than elizabeth thought their due  i am sure said elizabeth as they were walking from school to church it is worth while to stay to see the aisle now it is clear of the benches and there is breathing room left in the dear old church and listen to the bells does not it seem as if the two churches were exchanging greetings on st austins first sunday yes st marys is our home our mother church added she as she walked under the heavy stone porch its groined roof rich with quaint bosses the support of many a swallows nest and came in sight of the huge old square font standing on one large column and four small ones where she herself and all her brothers and sisters had been christened  the three little children were not to go to st austins in the morning but katherine had promised to come back to fetch them in time for the luncheon at mr somervilles and thus dora had the full advantage of studying the puddington monument before the service began  katherine and harriet came back whilst elizabeth and helen were at luncheon and after giving them a list of half the people who were at church they called the children to come to mr somervilles with them  why do not you put on your bonnet dora said winifred  i am not going said dora  why not asked winifred  because i had rather not was the answer  why you silly little child said katherine are you shy of mr somerville look there edward and winifred are not shy and you are quite a great girl  how horace would laugh  i cannot help it said dora i had rather not go  if you are thinking of your little class dora said elizabeth i will hear them for you you will trust them with me will you not and i will remember who is first  thank you said dora i had rather go to church and school with you  nonsense dora said katherine i wish you would come  now do said harriet you cannot think what a nice luncheon mr somerville will have for you  there is a very nice luncheon here said dora  oh but not like a company luncheon said harriet besides mr somerville will be so disappointed if you do not come  poor mr somerville wont you be sorry for him dora  oh no he does not want medoes he lizzie said dora  no i do not suppose he does said elizabeth he only asked you out of good nature  well if dora will not come said katherine there is no use in stayingcome winifred and edward  elizabeth was sure that dora had reasons of her own for choosing to remain with her but she thought it best to ask no questions and the reasons appeared when as they came into the almshouse court after evening service dora pressed her hand saying in a low mysterious tone lizzie will you shew me what you promised  elizabeth knew what she meant and returning through the church into the churchyard led the way to the east end where close beside a projecting buttress dora beheld a plain flat white stone with three small crosses engraven on it and with a feeling between awe and wonder read the simple inscription                                  katherine                     wife of the rev horatio woodbourne                      vicar of abbeychurch st marys                               may 14th 1826                                  aged 28   it was the first time that elizabeth and helen had stood together at their mothers grave for helen was but three years old at the time she had been deprived of her and after their fathers second marriage a kind of delicacy in elizabeth young as she was had prevented her from ever mentioning her to her younger sisters  after a few minutes during which no one spoke the three sisters turned away and reentered the church  helen and dora had reached the north door and were leaving the church when they missed elizabeth and looking round saw her sitting in one of the low pews in the centre aisle her face raised towards the flamboyant tracery of the east window  dora who seemed to have a sort of perception that her presence was a restraint upon her sisters whispered i am going to feed the doves and hastened across the quadrangle while helen came back to elizabeths side  her sister rose and with her own bright smile said helen i could not help coming here it was where i sat at the day of the funeral and i wanted to look at that flameshaped thing in the top of the window as i did all through the reading of the lesson  do you see  what strange thoughts were in my head as i sat looking at that deep blue glass with its shape like an angels head and meeting wings and heard of glories celestial i never hear those words without seeing that form  with these words elizabeth and helen left the church helen put her arm into her sisters a thing which elizabeth very seldom liked anyone to do even anne but now the two girls walked slowly arminarm through the quadrangle and along the broad gravel path in the vicarage garden  then you were at her funeral was the first thing helen said  yes said elizabeth papa wished it and i am sure i am very glad they let me go  no more was spoken till helen began again  when i was at dykelands mrs staunton used often to talk to me about our mother and i began to try to recollect her but i had only an impression of something kind some voice i should know again but i could not remember her in the least  ah i wish you could said elizabeth thoughtfully  i suppose you remember her quite well said helen and all that happened  yes said elizabeth i remember some things as well as if they had happened yesterday and others are all confusion in my mind i quite remember going to kiss her the last day and how strange and silent and sad all the room looked and aunt anne keeping quite calm and composed in the room but beginning to cry as soon as she had led me out  i shall never forget the awful mysterious feelings i had then  and could she speak to you said helen did she know you  yes she gave me one of her own smiles and said something in a very low voice  tell me a little more lizzie said helen for i have thought very much about her lately  can you remember her before she was ill  oh yes said elizabeth speaking slowly and pausing now and then i remember her well i sometimes fancy i can hear her voice and her step at night when she used to come up to the nursery to see us in bed  i always used to listen for her and when she began to grow weak and could not come up so many stairs i used to lie and cry for half an hour  and now when i am reading the same books with the children that i read with her things that she said to me come back upon me  do you think said helen that you are as like her as uncle edward once said you were  elizabeth paused possibly said she in eyes nose and mouth but helen i do not think there ever could be anyone really like our mother i was much too young to know all that she was whilst she was alive but as i have grown older and compared what i have seen of other people with what i recollect of her i have grown certain that she must have been the most excellent sensible clever kind charming person that ever lived  so mrs staunton says replied helen she used to tell me that i was a good deal like her and should be more so but i do not think she would have said so if she had seen you  i am so slow and so dull and so unlike to you in your quick active ways  do you know helen said elizabeth who had been pursuing her own thoughts rather than listening to her sisters words i do believe that we should all have been more like her if she had lived at least i am sure i should  helen did not answer and elizabeth continued in her usual rapid manner i do not mean to lay all my faults at mammas door for i should have been much worse without her and i have spurned away most of the good she would have done me in her kind gentle way but i do believe no one but my own mother ever knew how to manage me  you never were so wild helen and you will do far far better  o lizzie what do you mean cried helen  i mean my dear helen exclaimed elizabeth hardly knowing what she was saying that i have been using you shamefully ever since you came home  i have done nothing but contradict you and snap at you whether right or wrong and a pretty spectacle we must have made of ourselves now i see that you have twice the sense and understanding that i have and are so unpretending as to be worth a hundred times more  i wish with all my heart that i had taken your advice and that the mechanics institute was at the bottom of the sea  before helen had recovered from her astonishment at this incoherent speech sufficiently to make any sort of reply the rest of the party were seen returning from st austins and winifred and edward hastened towards the two sisters to tell them all the wonders they had seen  during the remainder of that day a few words in her mothers feeble voice rung in elizabeths ears more painfully even than the text she had mentioned the day before  it was lizzie i know you will be a kind sister to kate and poor little helen  in the course of the evening lady merton found anne and helen alone together in the drawingroom  helen was reclining on the sofa in a dreamy state her book half closed in her hand and anne was sitting at the window reading as well as she could by the failing light  so you are alone here said lady merton as she entered the room  yes said helen starting up i rather think the hazlebys are packing upyou know they go by the one oclock train tomorrowand i believe kate is helping them and mamma is hearing the little ones say the catechism  so i thought said lady merton  i was surprised to find you here  oh said helen we generally say the catechism to papa every sunday evening and he asks us questions about it and we are to go on with him till we are confirmed  and when will that be said her aunt  next spring said helen we shall all three of us be confirmed at the same time  but if mrs hazleby had not been here papa would have heard us all downstairs  i should have liked for you to hear how perfect edward is now and how well dora answers papas questions though perhaps before you she would be too shy  and i should have been glad for anne to have joined you said lady merton it is long since your godfather has heard you anne  not since we were here last said anne and that is almost two years ago  and where is lizzie said lady merton is she with your mamma  no said helen her other work is not over yet  on sunday evening she always reads with four great girls who have left school and have no time to learn except on sunday evenings  i am sure i cannot think how she can i should have thought morning and afternoon school quite enough for anyone  and she threw herself back on the sofa and gave a very long yawn  her aunt smiled as she answered you certainly seem to find it so  indeed i do said helen i think teaching the most tiresome work in the world  o helen is it possible cried anne  helen is not much used to it said her aunt  no said helen there used to be teachers enough without me but now lizzie wants me to take a class i suppose i must because it is my duty but really i do not think i can ever like it  if you do it cheerfully because it is your duty you will soon be surprised to find yourself interested in it said her aunt  now aunt anne said helen sitting up and looking rather more alive i really did take all the pains i could today but i was never more worried than with the dullness of those children  they could not answer the simplest question  most poor children seem dull with a new teacher said lady merton besides which you perhaps did not use language which they could understand  possibly said helen languidly but then there is another thing which i dislikei cannot bear to hear the most beautiful chapters in the bible stammered over as if the children had not the least perception of their meaning  their not being able to read the chapter fluently is no proof that they do not enter into it said lady merton it often happens that the best readers understand less than some awkward blunderers who read with reverence  then it is very vexatious said helen  you will tell a different story next year said lady merton when you have learnt a little more of the ways of the poor children  i hope so said helen but what i have seen today only makes me wonder how papa and lizzie can get the children to make such beautiful answers as they sometimes do in church  and perhaps said lady merton smiling the person who taught miss helen woodbourne to repeat grays elegy would be inclined to wonder how at fourteen she could have become a tolerably wellinformed young lady  oh aunt said helen have not you forgotten that day  how dreadfully i must have tormented everybody  i am sure mammas patience must have been wonderful  and i am very glad that lizzie saves her from so much of the labour of teaching now said lady merton  i see what you mean said helen i ought to help too  indeed my dear i had no intention of saying so said lady merton yourself and your mamma can be the only judges in such a matter  i believe mamma does think that lizzie has almost too much to do said helen but there has been less since horace has been at school  but edward is fast growing up to take his place said her aunt  edward will never take horaces place said helen he will be five times the trouble  horace could learn whatever he pleased in an instant and the only drawback with him was inattention but edward is so slow and so dawdling that his lessons are the plague of the schoolroom  his reading is tiresome enough and what lizzie will do with his latin i cannot think but that can be only her concern  and winifred is sharp enough but she never pays attention three minutes together i could not undertake her i should do her harm and myself too  i am rather of your opinion so far said lady merton but you have said nothing against dora  dora said helen yes she has always been tolerably good but she knows nearly as much as i do  lizzie says she knows the reasons of a multiplication sum and i am sure i do not  perhaps you might learn by studying with her aaid lady merton  yes lizzie says she has learnt a great deal from teaching the children said helen but then she had a better foundation than most people  you know she used to do her lessons with papa and he always made her learn everything quite perfect and took care she should really understand each step she took so that she knows more about grammar and arithmetic and all the latitude and longitude puzzling part of geography than i doa great deal more  i am sorry to find there is some objection to all the lessons of all the children said lady merton  i suppose i might help in some said helen but then i have very little time i have to draw and to practise and to read french and italian and history to mamma and to write exercises but then mamma has not always leisure to hear me and it is very unsatisfactory to go on learning all alone at dykelands there were fanny and jane  i should not have thought a person with four sisters need complain of having to learn alone said her aunt  no more should i said helen but if you were here always you would see how it is lizzie is always busy with the children and learns her german and latin no one knows when or how by getting up early and reading while she is dressing or while the children are learning  she picks up knowledge as nobody else can and kate will only practise or read to mamma and she is so desultory and unsettled that i cannot go on with her as i used before i went to dykelands and dorai see i ought to take to her but i am afraid to do soi do not like it  so it appears said lady merton  i should think it the most delightful thing cried anne  you two are instances of the way in which people wish for the advantages they have not and undervalue those they have said lady merton smiling  advantages repeated helen  why do not you think it an advantage to have sisters said anne i wish you would give some of them to me if you do not  indeed said helen warmly i do value my sisters very much i am sure i am very fond of them  as long as they give you no trouble said lady merton  well said helen i see you may well think me a very poor selfish creature but i really do mean to try to improve  i will offer to undertake doras music lizzie does not understand that and it is often troublesome to mamma to find time to hear her practise and i think i should pay more attention to it than kate does sometimes  i think dora will play very well and i should like her to play duets with me  i am glad you can endure one of your sisters said anne laughing rather maliciously  pray say no more of that anne said helen it was only my foolish indolence that made me make such a speech  as helen finished speaking elizabeth came into the room looking rather weary but very blithe  i have been having a most delightful talk about the consecration with the girls said she hearing what they saw and what they thought of it  mary watson took her masters children up the hill to see the churchyard consecrated and the eldest little boythat fine blackeyed fellow you know helensaid he never could play at ball there again now the bishop had read the prayers there  i do really hope that girl will be of great use to those little things her mistress says no girl ever kept them in such good order before  i was going to compliment you on the good behaviour of your children at st austins lizzie said lady merton i thought i never saw a more well conducted party  ah some of our best children are gone to st austins said elizabeth i quite grudge them to mr somerville i hate the girls to get out of my sight  so do i said anne i am quite angry when our girls go out to service they will get such horrid placespublic houses or at best farm houses where they have a whole train of babies to look after and never go to church  and very few of the most respectable fathers and mothers care where their children go to service said elizabeth i am sure i often wish the children had no parents  in order that they may learn a childs first duty said lady merton  well but is it not vexatious aunt anne said elizabeth when there is a nice little girl learning very well in school but forgetting as soon as she is out of it her mother will not put herself one inch out of the way to keep her there regularly when the child goes to church continually the mother never comes at all or never kneels down when she is there  if you miss her at school on the sunday morning her mother has sent her to the shop and perhaps told her to tell a falsehood about it if her hand is clammy with lollipops or there is a perfume of peppermint all round her or down clatters a halfpenny in the middle of church it is all her fathers fault  oh except the clatter that last disaster never happens with us said anne the shop is not open on sunday  ah that is because uncle edward is happily the king of the parish said elizabeth it has the proper church and state government like dantes notion of the empire  but you cannot help the rest and we are still worse off and how can we expect the children to turn out well with such home treatment  no lizzie said lady merton you must not expect them to turn out well  o mamma mamma cried anne  what do you teach them for exclaimed helen  i see what you mean said elizabeth we can only cast our bread upon the waters we must look to the work and not to the present appearance  but aunt anne the worst is if they go wrong i must be afraid it is my fault that it is from some slip in my teaching some want of accordance between my example and my precept and no one can say that it is not so  no one on earth said her aunt solemnly and far better it is for you that you should teach in fear  i sometimes fancy said elizabeth that the girls would do better if we had the whole government of them but i know that is but fancy they are each in the place and among the temptations which will do them most good  but oh it is a melancholy thing to remember that of the girls whom i myself have watched through the school and out into the world there are but two on whom i can think with perfect satisfaction  taking a high standard of course said lady merton  oh yes and not reckoning many who i hope will do well like this one of whom i was talking but who have had no trial said elizabeth there are many very good ones now if they will but keep so  one of these girls that i was telling you of has shewn that she had right principle and firmness by her behaviour towards a bad fellowservant she is at miss maynards  and where is the other asked anne  in her grave said elizabeth  ah said helen i missed her today in the midst of her little class bending over them as she used to do and looking in their faces as if she saw the words come out of their mouths  do you mean the deaf girl with the speaking eyes said anne you wrote to tell me you had lost her  yes said elizabeth she it was whose example shewed me that an infirmity may be a blessing  her ear was shut to the noises of the world the strife of tongues and as her mother said she did not know what a bad word was only it was tuned to holy things  she always knew what was going on in church and by her eager attention learnt to do everything in school and when her deafness was increased by her fever and she could not hear her mothers and sisters voices she could follow the prayers papa read the delirium fled away from them oh it is a blessing and a privilege to have been near such a girl but thenthough the last thing she said was to desire her sisters to be good girls and keep to their church and schoolshe would have been the same have had the same mind without our teachingour mere schoolkeeping i mean  aunt anne you say you have kept school in your village for thirty years you were just in my situation the clergymans daughter so do tell me what effect your teaching has had as regards the children of your first set of girls  are they better managed at home than their mothers  more civilized and better kept at school otherwise much the same said lady merton  yes my experience is much the same as yours comparatively few of those i have watched from their childhood have done thoroughly well and their good conduct has been chiefly owing to their parents  some have improved and returned to do right perhaps partly in consequence of their early teaching  sad work sad work after all said elizabeth as she left the room to finish hearing the little ones and release mrs woodbourne  and yet said helen as the door closed no one is so happy at school as lizzie or delights more in the children or in devising pleasure for them  i never shall understand lizzie said anne with a kind of sigh who would have suspected her of such desponding feelings and i cannot believe it is so bad an affair  how can it be taking those dear little things fresh from their baptism training them with holy things almost always before them their minds not dissipated by all kinds of other learning like ours  i do not know that that is quite the best thing though in a degree it is unavoidable said her mother  so i was thinking said helen i think it must make religious knowledge like a mere lesson i know that is what lizzie dreads and they begin the bible before they can read it well  but can it can it really be so melancholy will all those brightfaced creatures who look so earnest and learn so well will they turn their backs upon all that is right all they know so well said poor anne almost ready to cry  o mamma do not tell me to think so  no no you need not my dear said lady merton it would be grievous and sinful indeed to say any such things of baptized christians trained up by the church  the more you love them and the more you hope for them the better  you will learn how to hope and how to fear as you grow older  but i have had as much experience as lizzie said anne i am but a month younger and school has been my sunday delight ever since i can remember mamma i think the abbeychurch people must be very badyou see they keep shop on sunday but then you spoke of our own people it must have been my own careless levity that has prevented me from feeling like lizzie but i cannot believe  you have not been the director of the school for the last few years as lizzie has said lady merton the girls under your own protection are younger their trial is hardly begun  i am afraid i shall be disheartened whenever i think of them said anne i wish you had not said all thisand yetperhapsif disappointment is really to come i had better be prepared for it  yes you may find this conversation useful anne said lady merton if it is only to shew you why i have always tried to teach you selfcontrol in your love of the school  i know i want selfcontrol when i let myself be so engrossed in it as to neglect other things said anne and i hope i do manage now not to shew more favour to the girls i like best than to the others but in what other way do you mean mamma  i mean that you must learn not to set your heart upon individual girls or plans which seem satisfactory at first said lady merton disappointment will surely be sent in some form or other to try your faith and love and if you do not learn to fear now that your hopes are high you will hardly have spirit enough left to persevere cheerfully when failure has taught you to mistrust yourself  i know that i must be disappointed if i build upon schemes or exertions of my own said anne but i should be very conceitedvery presumptuous i meanto do so and i hope i never shall  i cannot think how you or anybody who thinks like you can ever undertake to keep school said helen i never saw how awful a thing it is before not merely hearing lessons and punishing naughty children i am sure i dread it now i would have nothing to do with it if papa did not wish it and so make it my duty  nobody would teach the children at all if they thought like you helen said anne and then what would become of them  people who are not fit often do teach them and is not that worse than nothing said helen i should think irreverence and false doctrine worse than ignorance  certainly said lady merton and happy it is that as in your case helen the duty of obedience or some other equally plain teaches us when to take responsibility upon ourselves and when to shrink from it  i must say said anne i cannot recover from hearing mamma and lizzie talk of their little victims just in grays tone  no said lady merton i only say            if thou wouldst reap in love              first sow in holy fear     chapter xiii   on monday morning as soon as breakfast was over elizabeth and katherine went to the school to receive the pennyclub money and to change the lending library books  they were occupied in this manner for about half an hour and on their return elizabeth went to mrs woodbournes dressingroom to put away the money and to give her an account of her transactions while she was so employed her father came into the room with a newspaper in his hand  look here mildred said he laying it down on the table before his wife this is what walker has just brought me  mrs woodbourne glanced at the paragraph he pointed out and exclaimed o lizzie this is a sad thing  elizabeth advanced she grew giddy with dismay as she read as follows  on friday last a most interesting and instructive lecture on the rise and progress of the institution of chivalry was delivered at the mechanics institute in this city by augustus mills esq  this young gentleman from whose elegant talents and uncommon eloquence we should augur no ordinary career in whatever profession may be honoured with his attention enlarged upon the barbarous manners of the wild untutored hordes among whom the proud pageantry of pretended faith false honour and affected punctilio had its rise  he traced it through its gilded course of blood and carnage stripped of the fantastic and delusive mantle which romance delights to fling over its native deformity to the present time when the general civilization and protection enjoyed in this enlightened age has left nought but the grim shadow of the destructive form which harassed and menaced our trembling ancestors  we are happy to observe that increasing attendance at the mechanics institute of abbeychurch seems to prove that the benefits of education are becoming more fully appreciated by all classes  we observed last friday at the able lecture of mr mills among a numerous assemblage of the distinguished inhabitants and visitors of abbeychurch miss merton daughter of sir edward merton of merton hall baronet together with the fair and accomplished daughters of the rev h woodbourne our respected vicar  i shall certainly contradict it continued mr woodbourne while elizabeth was becoming sensible of the contents of the paragraph i did not care what higgins chose to any of my principles but this is a plain fact which may be believed if it is not contradicted  o mamma have not you told him said elizabeth faintly  what do you mean to say that this is true exclaimed mr woodbourne in a voice which sounded to elizabeth like a clap of thunder  indeed papa said she once looking up in his face and then bending her eyes on the ground while the colour in her checks grew deeper and deeper i am sorry to say that it is quite true that we did so very wrong and foolishly as to go  helen and lucy alone were sensible and strongminded enough to refuse to go  mr woodbourne paced rapidly up and down the room and elizabeth plainly saw that his displeasure was great  but mr woodbourne said her mamma she did not know that it was wrong  do you not remember that she was not at home at the time that socialist was here and i never told her of all that passed then you see it was entirely my fault  oh no no mamma do not say so said elizabeth it was entirely mine  i was led away by my foolish eagerness and selfwill i was bent on my own way and cast aside all warnings and now i see what mischief i have done  cannot you do anything to repair it papa cannot you say that it was all my doing my wilfulness my carelessness of warning my perverseness  i wish i had known it before said mr woodbourne i could at least have spoken to mr turner on saturday and prevented the mertons name from appearing  i did not tell you because i had no opportunity said mrs woodbourne lizzie came and told me all the instant she knew that she had done wrong but i thought it would harass you and you were so much occupied that i had better wait till all this bustle was over but she told me everything most candidly and would have come to you but that mr roberts was with you at the timemy dear lizzie do not distress yourself so much i am sure you have suffered a great deal  o mamma said elizabeth how can i ever suffer enough for such a tissue of illconduct you never will see how wrong it was in me  yet lizzie said her father kindly we may yet rejoice over the remembrance of this unpleasant affair if it has made you reflect upon the faults that have led to it  but what is any small advantage to my own character compared with the injury i have done said elizabeth i have made it appear as if you had granted the very last thing you would ever have thought of i have led kate and anne into disobedience  oh i have done more wrongly than i ever thought i could  at this moment katherine came into the room with some message for mrs woodbourne  come here kate said her father read this  katherine cast a frightened glance upon elizabeth who turned away from her  she read on and presently exclaimed fair and accomplished daughters dear me that is ourselves  then catching elizabeth by the arm she whispered does he know it  yes katherine said mr woodbourne sternly your sister has shewn a full conviction that she has done wrong a feeling of which i am sorry to see that you do not partake  indeed indeed papa cried katherine bursting into tears i am very sorry i should never have gone if it had not been for the others  no excuses if you please katherine said mr woodbourne i wish to hear exactly how it happened  first papa said elizabeth let me beg one thing of you do not tell mrs hazleby that harriet went with us for she could not know that it was wrong of us to go and she is very much afraid of her mothers anger  mr woodbourne made a sign of assent and elizabeth proceeded to give a full account of the indiscreet expedition taking the blame so entirely upon herself that although katherine was on the watch to contradict anything that might tell unfavourably for her she could not find a word to gainsayspeaking very highly of helen not attempting to make the slightest excuse or to plead her sorrow for what had happened as a means of averting her fathers displeasure and ending by asking permission to go to mrs turner the instant the hazlebys had left abbeychurch to tell her that the excursion had been entirely without mr woodbournes knowledge or consent  for said she that is the least i can do towards repairing what can never be repaired  i am not sure that that would be quite a wise measure my dear lizzie said mrs woodbourne  certainly not said mr woodbourne it would put lizzie in a very unsuitable situation and in great danger of being impertinent  yes said elizabeth i see that i do wrong whichever way i turn  come lizzie said her father i see that i cannot be as much displeased with you as you are with yourself  i believe you are sincerely sorry for what has passed and now we will do our best to make it useful to you and prevent it from having any of the bad consequences to my character which distress you so much  elizabeth was quite overcome by mr woodbournes kindness she sprung up threw her arms round his neck kissed him and taking one more look to see that his eyes no longer wore the expression which she dreaded she darted off to her own room to give a free course to the tears with which she had long been struggling  katherine who had been studying the newspaper all this time seeing elizabeths case so easily dismissed and not considering herself as nearly so much to blame now giggled out mamma did you ever see anyone so impertinent as this man  fair and accomplished daughters indeed was there ever anything so impertinent  yes katherine said mr woodbourne there is something far more impertinent in a young lady who thinks proper to defy my anger and to laugh at the consequences of her giddy disobedience  indeed papa said katherine i am very sorry but i am sure it was not disobedience  i did not know we were not to go  not when you had heard all that was said on the subject last year said mr woodbourne i am ashamed to see you resort to such a foolish subterfuge  i did not remember it said katherine i am sure i should never have gone if i had but lizzie was so bent upon it  again throwing the blame upon others said mr woodbourne your sister has set you a far better example  she forbore from saying what i believe she might have said with perfect truth that had you not chosen to forget my commands when they interfered with your fancies she would not have thought of going and this is the return which you make to her kindness  well sobbed katherine i never heard you say we should not go i do not remember it  you know mamma says i have a very bad memory  your memory is good enough for what pleases yourself said mr woodbourne you have been for some time past filling your head with vanity and gossipping without making the slightest attempt to improve yourself or strengthen your mind and this is the consequence however this you will remember if you please that it is my desire that you associate no more with that silly chattering girl miss turner than your sisters do  you know that i never approved of your making a friend of her but you did not choose to listen to any warnings  katherine well knew that her father had often objected to her frequently going to drink tea with the turners and had checked her for talking continually of her friend and anyone not bent on her own way would have thought these hints enough but as they were not given with a stern countenance or in a peremptory manner she had paid no attention to them  now she could not be brought to perceive what her fault really had been but only sobbed out something about its being very hard that she should have all the scolding when it was lizzies scheme not hers  again forgetting that she had been the original proposer of the expedition  pray my dear do not go on defending yourself said mrs woodbourne you see it does no good  but mamma whined katherine in such a tone that mr woodbourne could bear it no longer and ordered her instantly to leave the room and not to appear again till she could shew a little more submission she obeyed after a little more sobbing and entreating and as she closed the door behind her harriet came out of the opposite room  what is the matter whispered she has it all come out  yes it is in the paper and papa is very angry sighed katherine  is there anything about me asked harriet eagerly paying no regard to poor katherines woful appearance and streaming eyes  oh no nothing said katherine hastening away as mrs hazleby and lucy came into the passage  heyday what is all this about exclaimed the former encountering mr woodbourne as he came out of his wifes dressingroom what is the matter now  i believe your daughter can explain it better than i can answered mr woodbourne giving her the paper and walking away to his study as soon as he came to the bottom of the stairs  as soon as mrs hazleby found herself in the drawingroom she called upon her eldest daughter to explain to her the meaning of what she saw in the newspaper  why mamma harriet began you know miss merton and lizzie woodbourne care for nothing but history and all that stuff and do not mind what they do as long as they can talk talk talk of nothing else all day long  so they were at it the day you dined out and they had some question or other whether king arthurs round table were knights or not till at last kate said something about the institute and they were all set upon going though helen told them they had better not so out we went we walked all together to mrs turners and she took them  i suppose fido must have fallen into the river while they were at the institute  poor dear little fellow i dare say that was the way he was lost said mrs hazleby when once young people take that kind of nonsense into their head there is an end of anything else  well and how was it we never heard of it all this time  i think no one would wish to tell of it said harriet you would not have heard of it now if it had not been in the paper  well i hope miss lizzie will have enough of it said mrs hazleby it will open her papas eyes to all her conceit if anything will  i am sure it is time said harriet she thinks herself wiser than all the world one cannot speak a word for her  o harriet said lucy looking up from her work with some indignation in her eyes  i believe you think it all very grand lucy said her mother you care for nothing as long as you can dawdle about with helen  pray did you go to this fine place  no mamma said lucy  hm said mrs hazleby rather disappointed at losing an opportunity of scolding her  anne had gone to write a letter in her mothers room whilst elizabeth was busy  she had just finished it and was thinking of going to see whether anyone was ready to read in the schoolroom when rupert came in and making a low bow addressed her thus so miss nancy i congratulate you  what is the matter now said anne  pray anne said he did you ever experience the satisfaction of feeling how pleasant it is to see ones name in print  you were very near having something like that pleasure yourself said anne it was only your arrival on friday that saved the expense of an advertisement at the head of a column in the times     r m return return return to your sorrowing friends   pray be more speedy next time said rupert for then i shall be even with you  i am sure you have some wickedness in your head or all your speeches would not begin with pray said anne what do you mean  what i say answered rupert i have just read miss mertons name in the paper  some other miss merton you foolish boy said anne  no no yourself anne katherine merton daughter of sir edward said rupert  my dear rupert you do not mean it said anne somewhat alarmed  i saw it with my eyes said rupert  but where  in the abbeychurch reporter or whatever you call it  oh said anne looking relieved we are probably all there as having been at the consecration  the company there present are i believe honoured with due mention of sir edward merton and family said rupert but i am speaking of another part of the paper where miss merton is especially noted alone in her glory  in what paper did you say rupert said lady merton  the abbeychurch reporter said he  mr higginss paper said anne  o mamma i see it allthat horrible mechanics institute  why anne said her brother i thought you would be charmed with your celebrity  but where have you seen it rupert said anne poor lizzie has she heard it  mr walker came in just now in great dismay to shew it to mr woodbourne said rupert and they had a very long discussion on the best means of contradicting it to which i listened with gravity quite heroic i assure you considering all things  then my uncle carried it off to shew it to his wife and i came up to congratulate you  i am sure it is no subject of congratulation said anne where was papa all the time  gone to call on mr somerville said rupert  but i thought lizzie had told her father said lady merton  she told mrs woodbourne directly said anne but she could not get at my uncle and i suppose mrs woodbourne had not told him what an annoyance for them all  i hope mr woodbourne is not very much displeased  he was more inclined to laugh than to be angry said rupert and it is indeed a choice morceau worthy of augustus mills esquire himself i hope mr woodbourne will bring it downstairs that you may explain to me the rare part which describes the decrepid old giant chivalry sitting in his den unable to do any mischief only biting his nails at the passers by like the giant pope in the pilgrims progress  anne could not help laughing but rupert said she pray do not say too much about it in the evening  i am not at all sure that papa will not be very much displeased to see his name figuring in the paper as if he was a supporter of this horrid place  i wish as lizzie says that i had cut my head off before i went for it has really come to be something serious  papas name will seem to sanction their proceedings  my dear said lady merton you may comfort yourself by remembering that your papas character is too well known to be affected by such an assertion as this most people will not believe it and those who do can only think that his daughter is turning radical not himself  ay this is the first public decisive act of miss mertons life said rupert no wonder so much is made of it  but rupert said anne i only beg of you not to say anything about it to lizzie  you cut me off from everything diverting said rupert you are growing quite impertinent but i will punish you some day when you do not expect it  i do not care what you do when we are at home said anne i defy you to do your worst then only spare lizzie and me while we are here  spare lizzie indeed said rupert she does not want your protection she is able enough to take care of herself  i believe ruperts five wits generally go off halting from the sharp encounter of hers said lady merton  and therefore he wants to gain a shabby advantage over a wounded enemy said anne i give you up you recreant your name should have been oliver instead of rupert  there is an exemplification of the lecture said rupert impotent chivalry biting its nails with disdain and despite  well mamma said anne since chivalry is impotent i shall leave you to tame that foul monster with something else i will have no more to do with him  she went to fetch her work out of her bedroom but on seeing elizabeth there her pockethandkerchief in her hand and traces of tears on her face was hastily retreating when her cousin said come in and added so anne you have heard the murder is out  the mechanics institute you mean said anne not fido  not fido said elizabeth but the rest of the story is out i mean it is not known who killed cock robin and i do not suppose it ever will be but the mechanics institute affair is in the newspaper and it is off my mind for i have had it all out with papa  and anne he was so very kind that i do not know how to think of it  he made light of the annoyance to himself on purpose to console me andbut added she smiling while the tears came into her eyes again i must not talk of him or i shall go off into another cry and not be fit for the reading those unfortunate children have been waiting for so long  tell me are my eyes very unfit to be seen  not so very bad said anne  well i cannot help it if they are said elizabeth come down and let us read  they found helen alone in the schoolroom where she had been sitting ever since breakfasttime thinking that the penny club was occupying elizabeth most unusually long this morning  helen said elizabeth as she came into the room papa knows the whole story and i can see that he is as much pleased with your conduct as i am sure you deserve  all was explained in a few words  helen was now by no means inclined to triumph in her better judgement for while she had been waiting alone with her drawing she had been thinking over all that had passed since the unfortunate friday evening wondering that she could ever have believed that elizabeth was not overflowing with affection and feeling very sorry for the little expression of triumph which she had allowed to escape her in her illtemper on saturday  lizzie said she will you forgive me for that very unkind thing i said to you  elizabeth did not at first recollect what it was and when she did she only said nonsense helen i never consider what people say when they are cross any more than when they are drunk  anne was very much diverted by the idea of elizabeths experience of what drunken people said or of drunkenness and illtemper being allied and her merriment restored the spirits of her cousins and took off from what elizabeth called the awfulness of a grand pardoning scene  helen was then sent to summon the children to their lessons which were happily always supposed to begin later on a monday than on any other day of the week  the study door was open and as she passed by her father called her into the room  helen said he elizabeth tells me that you acted the part of a sensible and obedient girl the other evening and i am much pleased to hear it  helen stood for a few moments too much overcome with delight and surprise to be able to speak  mr woodbourne went on writing and she bounded upstairs with something more of a hop skip and jump than those steps had known from her foot since she had been an inhabitant of the nursery herself thinking what would he say if he knew that i only refused to go out of a spirit of opposition yet feeling the truth of what anne had said that her fathers praise rarely given and only when well earned was worth all the stauntons admiration fifty times over  when mrs woodbourne came down she advised helen not to call katherine saying that she thought it would be better for her to be left to herself so that she was seen no more till just before the hazlebys departed when she came down to take leave of them looking very pale her eyes very red and her voice nearly choking but still there was no appearance of submission about her  helen said lucy as they were standing in the window of the inner drawingroom i should like you to tell aunt mildred how very much i have enjoyed this visit  i wish you would tell her so yourself said helen i am sure you cannot be afraid of her lucy  oh no i am not afraid of her said lucy only i do not like to say this to her  it is putting myself too forward almost to say it to you even helen but i have been wishing all the time i have been here to thank her for having been so very kind as to mention me especially in her letter to papa  but have you really enjoyed your visit here said helen thinking how much she had felt for lucy on several occasions  oh indeed i have helen answered she to say nothing of the consecration such a sight as i may never see again in all my life and which must make everyone very happy who has anything to do with your papa and aunt mildred it has been a great treat to be with you all again and to see your uncle and aunt and miss merton  i hardly ever saw such a delightful person as miss merton so clever and so sensible and now i shall like to hear all you have to say about her in your letters  yes i suppose anne is clever and sensible said helen musingly  do not you think her so said lucy with some surprise  why yes i do not know said helen hesitating but then she does laugh so very much  lucy could not make any answer for at this moment her mother called her to make some arrangement about the luggage but she pondered a little on the proverb which declares that it is well to be merry and wise  mrs hazleby had been condoling with mr woodbourne upon his daughters misbehaviour and declaring that her dear girls would never dream of taking a single step without her permission but that learning was the ruin of young ladies  mr woodbourne listened to all this discourse very quietly without attempting any remark but as soon as the hazlebys had gone upstairs to put on their bonnets he said well i wish miss harriet joy of her conscience  i wish barbara had been more gentle with those girls replied mrs woodbourne with a sigh  and this was all that passed between the elders on the subject of the behaviour of miss harriet hazleby  mr woodbourne and rupert accompanied mrs hazleby and her daughters to the railroad station rupert shewing himself remarkably polite to mrs hazlebys pet baskets and saving lucy from carrying the largest and heaviest of them which generally fell to her share     chapter xiv   well said elizabeth drawing a long breath as she went out to walk with anne and helen there is the evenhanded justice of this world of the four delinquents of last friday there goes one with flying colours in all the glory of a successful deceit you anne who to say the best of you acted like a very great goose are considered as wise as ever i who led you all into the scrape with my eyes wilfully blinded am only pitied and comforted poor kitty who had less idea of what she was doing than any of us has had more crying and scolding than anybody else and lucy who behaved so welloh i cannot bear to think of her  it is a puzzle indeed said helen i mean as far as regards harriet and lucy  not really helen said elizabeth it is only a failure in story book justice  lucy is too noble a creature to be rewarded in a storybook fashion and as for harriet impunity like hers is in reality a greater punishment than all the reproof in the world  how could she sit by and listen to all that papa and mrs hazleby were saying said helen  how could she bear the glance of papas eye said elizabeth did you watch it  i thought i never saw it look so stern and yet that contemptible creature sat under it as contentedly as possible  oh it made me quite sick to watch her  are you quite sure that she knew whether my uncle was aware of her share in the matter said anne  she must have seen it in that glance or have been the most insensible creature upon earth said elizabeth  ah said anne i have some notion what that eye of your papas can be  you anne said elizabeth you do not mean that you could ever have done anything to make him look at you in that way  indeed i have said anne do not you remember  no indeed said elizabeth  however it was not quite so bad as this said anne  but do tell us what it was said elizabeth or i shall think it something uncommonly shocking  i never spoke of it since because i was too much ashamed said anne and it was very silly of me to do so now  but when was it said elizabeth  two years ago said anne when you were all staying at merton hall just before that nice nurserymaid of yours susan married our man evans  yes i remember said elizabeth but what has that to do with your crime whatever it may be  a great deal said anne do not you recollect our hunting all over the garden one day for winifred and dora and at last our asking old ambrose whether he had seen them  oh yes i think i do said elizabeth and he said that he had seen susan and the children go down the blind walk  then i said dora had talked of seeing a blackbirds nest there and he answered with a most comical look ah ha miss woodbourne i fancy they be twolegged blackbirds as susan is gone to see  why blackbirds have but two legs said helen looking mystified what did he mean  that is exactly what kate said said elizabeth but really i thought you were sharper helen  cannot you guess  not in the least said helen  that evans was clipping the hedges said anne  elizabeth and anne indulged in a good laugh at helen as much as at ambrose and presently elizabeth said well but anne where is your crime  oh i thought you had remembered and would spare me said anne  but we have not said elizabeth so now for it  then if i am to tell said anne do not you recollect that i began to tell rupert the story in the middle of dinner when all the servants were there  o anne i never fancied you such a goose said elizabeth  my delinquencies made very little impression on you then said anne i went on very fluently with the story till just as i had pronounced the words twolegged blackbirds i saw uncle woodbournes eye upon me as he sat just opposite with all its cold heavy sternness of expression and at the same moment i heard a strange suppressed snort behind my chair  poor creature said elizabeth but you certainly deserved it  i was ready to sink under the table said anne i did not dare to look up to papa or mamma and i have been very much obliged to mamma ever since for never alluding to that terrible dinner  it is a regular proof that fun is one of the most runaway horses in existence said elizabeth very charming when well curbed but if you give him the rein  yes i have been learning that by sad experience all my life said anne with a sigh  you will never be silly enough to give him up though said elizabeth  silly do you call it said helen  people think so differently on those matters said anne  yes but a spirit full of glee is what i think the most delightful thing in the world said elizabeth and so do you  yes in old age when its blitheness has been proved to be something beyond animal spirits said anne  and it is right that people should have animal spirits in their youth said elizabeth not grey heads on green shoulders like some people of my acquaintancedo not be affronted helen i dare say your head will grow greener all your life it is better today than it was on saturday morning  but the worst of it is said anne that i believe it is very silly of me but i am afraid uncle woodbourne has always thought me a most foolish girl ever since and i do not like the idea of it  who would said elizabeth i am afraid i cannot tell you what he thinks of your sense but of this i am sure that he must think you the choicest damsel of his acquaintance and wish his daughters were more like you  and there could not have been the same meaning in his eye when he looked at you as when he looked at harriet said helen  oh no i hope not said anne  and you understood it a little better than one who can only feel personal inconvenience said elizabeth but how can i blame harriet when i was the occasion of her fault it is a thing i can never bear to think of  as elizabeth said this they came to a shop where anne wished to buy some little presents for some children in the village at home who she said would value them all the more for not being the production of the town nearest them  they pursued their search for gay remnants of coloured prints little shawls and pictured pockethandkerchiefs into the new town and passed by mr higginss shop the window of which was adorned with all the worst caricatures which had found their way to abbeychurch the portraits of sundry radical leaders embossed within a halo of steelpens and a notice of a lecture on personal respectability to be given on the ensuing friday at the mechanics institute by the rev w pierce the dissenting preacher  mr higgins appeared at the shop door for the express purpose as it seemed of honouring miss merton and miss woodbourne each with a very low bow  there helen is my punishment said elizabeth since you are desirous of poetical justice upon me  not upon you said helen only upon harriet  harriet has lost fido said elizabeth  here rupert came to meet them and no more was said on the subject  rupert obeyed his sister tolerably well during most of the day though he was sorely tempted to ask elizabeth to send anne an abstract in shorthand of the lecture on personal respectability but he refrained for he was really fond of his cousin and very goodnatured excepting when his vanity was offended  anne however was in a continual fright for he delighted in tormenting her by going as near the dangerous subject as he dared and often when no one else thought there was any danger she knew by the expression of his eye that he had some spiteful allusion on his lips  besides he thought some of the speeches he had made in the morning too clever to be wasted on his mother and sister when his cousins were there to hear them and anne could not trust to his forbearance to keep them to himself all day so that she kept a strict watch upon him  in the evening however mr woodbourne called her and helen to play some psalm tunes from which he wanted to choose some for the church he spoke to her in a way which made her hope that he did not think her quite foolish but she would have been glad to stay and keep rupert in order  however she was rejoiced to hear elizabeth propose to him to play at chess and she saw them sit down very amicably  this proposal however proved rather unfortunate for elizabeth was victorious in the first battle the second was a drawn game and rupert lost the third just as he thought he was winning it from forgetting to move out the castles pawn after castling his king he could not bear to be conquered and pushed away the chessboard rather pettishly  good morning to you prince rupert said elizabeth triumphantly do you wish for any more  rupert made no answer but pulled the inkstand across the table opened the papercase and took up a pen  oh said elizabeth i suppose we may expect a treatise on the art of fortification salient angles and covered ways not forgetting the surrender of bristol  no reply but rupert scratched away very diligently with his pen the inkstand preventing elizabeth from seeing what he was about  anne said elizabeth leaning back and turning round i am thinking of making a collection of the heroes who could not bear to be beaten at chess beginning with charlemagnes paladins who regularly beat out each others brains with the silver chessboard then the black prince and philippe of burgundy  can you help me to any more  anne did not hear and rupert remained silent as ever and elizabeth determining to let him make himself as silly as he pleased took up her work and sewed on her braid very composedly  katherine had come down again at dinnertime and was working in silence  she had been standing by the piano but finding that no one asked her to play or took any notice of her she had come back to the table  dear me prince rupert said she looking over his shoulder what strange thing are you doing there  a slight sketch said he to be placed in lizzies album as a companion to a certain paragraph which i believe she has studied  rupert threw his penandink drawing down before elizabeth  it was really not badly done and she saw in a moment by the help of the names which he had scribbled below in his worst of all bad writing that it represented the giants pope and pagan as described in the pilgrims progress while close to pope was placed a delineation very like don quixote purporting to be the superannuated giant chivalry biting his nails at a dapper little personification of civil and religious liberty  a figure whose pointed head lame foot and stout walkingstick shewed him to be intended for sir walter scott was throwing over him an embroidered surcoat which a most striking and ludicrous likeness of mr augustus mills was pulling off at the other end and the scene was embellished by a ruined castle in the distance and a quantity of skulls and crossbones in the foreground  elizabeth could not but think it unkind of him to jest on this matter while her eyelids were still burning and heavy from the tears it had caused her to shed but she knew rupert well enough to be certain that it was only a sign that he was out of temper and had not yet conquered his old boyish love of teazing she put the paper into her basket saying in a low tone thank you rupert i shall keep it as a memorial of several things some of which may do me good but i fear it will always put me in mind that cavaliers of the present day would have little objection to such battles as i was speaking of even with women if this poor old gentleman did not retain a small degree of vitality  rupert was vexed both at being set down in a way he did not expect and because he was really sorry that his wounded selfconceit bad led him to do what he saw had mortified elizabeth more than he had intended  what is it what is it asked katherine  never mind kate said rupert  well but what fun is it persisted katherine  only downright nonsense said rupert looking down and unconsciously drawing very strange devices on the blotting paper unworthy the attention of so wise a lady  only the dry bones of an illnatured joke said lady merton who had seen all that passed from the other end of the table  she spoke so low as only to be heard by her son but elizabeth saw his colour deepen and as he rose and went to the piano she felt sorry for him and soon found an opportunity of reminding him that he had promised to draw something for edwards scrapbook and asked him if he would do so now  willingly said rupert but only on one condition lizzie  what said elizabeth  that you give me back that foolish thing said rupert fixing his eyes intently on the coach and horses which he was drawing  there it is said elizabeth restoring it to him  no no rupert do not tear it up it is the cleverest thing you ever drew sir walter is excellent  yet in spite of this commendation rupert had torn his performance into the smallest scraps before his sister came back to the table  anne had been in some anxiety ever since the conclusion of the games but sir edward and mr woodbourne were standing between her and the table so that she could neither see nor hear and when at length she had finished playing and was released she found rupert and elizabeth so quiet and so busy with their several employments that she greatly dreaded that all had not gone right  she bethought herself of the sketches rupert had made in scotland asked him to fetch them and by their help she contrived to restore the usual tone of conversation between the cousins so that the remainder of the evening passed away very pleasantly  when anne and elizabeth awoke the following morning anne said that she had remembered the evening before just when it was too late to do anything that the last sunday rupert had left his prayerbook behind him at st austins and as they were to set off on their journey homewards immediately after breakfast she asked elizabeth whether there would be time to walk to the new church and fetch it before breakfast  i think it would be a very pleasant walk in the freshness of the morning if you like to go said she  oh yes said elizabeth there is plenty of time and i should like the walk very much but really anne you spoil that idle boy in a terrible way  ah rupert is an only son said anne he has a right to be spoilt  then i hope that horace and edward will save each other from the same fate said elizabeth i do not like to see a sister made such a slave as you have been all your life  wait till horace and edward are at home in the holidays before you talk of slavery said anne there will be five slaves and two masters that will be all the difference  well are the male kind called barons in heraldry said elizabeth there is no denying that they are a lordly race but i think i would have sent mr rupert up the hill himself rather than go before breakfast with a days journey before me  suppose he would not go said anne  let him lose his prayerbook then said elizabeth  but if i had rather fetch it for him said anne  i can only answer that there are no slaves as willing as sisters said elizabeth  the two cousins had a pleasant morning walk up the hill enjoying the freshness of the morning air and watching the various symptoms of wakening in the town  they carried the keys of the church with them as no clerk had as yet been appointed and they were still in mr woodbournes possession so that it was not necessary to call anyone to open the doors for them  whilst anne was searching for the prayerbook elizabeth stood in the aisle her eyes fixed on the bright red cross in the centre window over the altar  the sunbeams were lighting it up gloriously and from it her gaze fell upon the table of commandments between it and the altar presently anne came and stood by her side in silence anne said elizabeth after a few minutes i will tell you what i have been thinking of  on the day when horace laid the first stone of this church two years ago something put me i am sorry to say into one of my old fits of ill temper  it was the last violent passion i ever was in i either learnt to control them or outgrew them  and now may this affair at the consecration be the last of my selfwill and selfconceit for indeed there is much that is fearfully wrong in me to be corrected before i can dare to think of the confirmation  perhaps we cannot take leave of elizabeth woodbourne at a better moment therefore we will say no more of her or of the other inhabitants of the vicarage but make a sudden transition to the conversation which anne had hoped to enjoy on the journey back to merton hall  she had told her father of nearly all her adventures had given fidos history more fully informed rupert of all that he had missed and was proceeding with an account of helen  really said she i have much more hope of her being happy at home than i had at first  i will answer for it that she will be happy enough said rupert she has been living on flummery for the last halfyear and you cannot expect her to be contented with muttonchops just at first  helen does not find so much fault with the muttonchops as with the pepper lizzie adds to them said anne  i should be sorry to live without pepper said rupert  i am not so sure of that said lady merton  at least you do not wish to have enough to choke you said anne you must have it in moderation  i think lizzie is learning moderation said lady merton she is acquiring more command of impulse and helen more command of feeling so that i think there is little danger of their not agreeing  is it not curious mamma said anne that we should have been talking of the necessity of selfcontrol just before we set out on this visit when i told you that line of burns was your motto and now we find that the want of it is the reason of all that was wrong between those two sisters  i wonder whether we could make out that any more of the follies we saw in this visit were caused by the same deficiency in anyone else  beginning at home said sir edward  of course papa said anne i know that my failure in selfcontrol has done mischief though i cannot tell how much  i laughed at the hazlebys continually in spite of mammas warning and encouraged lizzie to talk of them when i had better not have done so and i allowed myself to be led away by eagerness to hear that foolish lecture  i suppose i want control of spirits  and now having finished our own confession how merrily we begin upon our neighbours said rupert whom shall we dissect first  indeed rupert said anne i do not want to make the most of their faults i only wish to study their characters because i think it is a useful thing to do  now i do not see that kates faults are occasioned by want of selfcontrol do you think they are mamma  do you think that piece of thistledown possesses any selfcontrol said rupert  you mean that kate does not control her own conduct at all but is drifted about by every wind that blows said anne yes it was miss hazlebys influence that made her talk so much more of dress than usual and really seem sillier than i ever saw her before  and what do you say of the fair harriet herself said rupert  nothing said anne  and mrs hazleby is her daughter in a magnifying glass said rupert a glorious specimen of what you all may come to  and mrs woodbourne  oh i have nothing to do with the elders said anne but if you want me to find you a fault in her i shall say that she ought to control her unwillingness to correct people  and now we have discussed almost everyone  from which discussion said rupert it appears that of all the company at abbeychurch the sole possessor of that most estimable quality the root of all other excellencies isyour humble servant  on this unfortunate speech of poor ruperts father mother and sister all set up a shout of laughter which lasted till rupert began to feel somewhat enraged  oh i did not say that i had done with everybody said anne but perhaps whatever i might think i might not have presumed  o rupert said lady merton            could some fay the giftie gie us            to see oursels as others see us   mammas beloved burns justice again interrupted rupert  no no we do not mean to let our mouths be stopped said lady merton such a challenge must be answered  shew him no mercy anne said sir edward he likes pepper  pray rupert said anne what would you have been without selfcontrol if possessing such a quantity of it you still allowed so much spirit of mischief to domineer over you that you frightened dora out of her wits about winifred and tormented helen all the way to whistlefar and worst of all that you could not help writing that wicked poem and then pretending that it was mine why it was an outrage upon us all it would have been bad enough if the name had belonged to no one but when you knew that he was a real man  and that miss hazleby wrote his name on purpose that something of the kind might be done said rupert i gratified her beyond measure and then was so kind and disinterested as to give you the credit of it if you would have accepted it  you may be sure that she will shew the poem to her hero and tell him what a charming fellow that young rupert merton is  now just listen mamma said anne i begged of mr rupert not to write anything about fido in the conglomeration on saturday evening and because i did so he would write nothing on his own account but pretending to read my verses he brings out a horrible composition about a certain mr francis hollis who miss hazelby had been telling us had been the means of her going to an officers ball at hull and whom she had danced with  capital capital cried rupert i never heard all this i did not know how good my poem was i knew the truth by intuition  but having heard this made it all the worse for me said anne and mamma this dreadful doggerel  anne i declare cried rupert  and mamma this dreadful doggerel proceeded anne proposed to send fidos heart to this mr hollis and so put him in raptures with a gift from miss hazleby and fill his mind with visions of a surrogate and a wedding tour to harrogate  now was it not the most impertinent ungentlemanlike thing you ever heard of  how can you talk such nonsense anne said rupert do you think i should have written it if i had not known it would please her  i believe you would not have dared to behave in such a manner to lizzie or to anyone else who knew what was due to her said anne if miss hazleby is vain and vulgar she is still a woman and ought to be respected as such  rupert laughed rather provokingly it is just as i say said anne now is it not mamma  oh yes anne said rupert perfectly right you have caught helens sententious wisdom exactly i have no doubt that such were the thoughts which passed through her mind while she sat like propriety personified wondering how you could have so little sense of decorum as to laugh at anything so impudent  i know i ought not to have laughed said anne that was one of the occasions when i did not exert sufficient selfcontrol  but there was really very little to laugh at it was quite an old joke  rupert had disposed of fidos heart long before but he is so fond of his own wit that he never knows when we have had enough of a joke  i could tell you of something much worse anne said lady merton which quite proves the truth of what you say  rupert coloured made an exclamation about something in the road and seemed so much discomposed by this hint that anne forbore to ask any questions  rupert fitted himself to a t that we must say for him said sir edward  what do you mean papa said anne  there is another word which begins with selfcon said lady merton which suits him remarkably well  ah ha cried anne  at any rate cried rupert vigorously do not make it appear as if i were the only individual with a tolerable opinion of my own advantageswhen helen looks like the picture of offended dignity if you presume to say a syllable contrary to some of her opinions or in disparagement of dear dykelands and kate thinks herself the most lovely creature upon earth and the only useful person in the house and harriet believes no one her equal in the art of fascination and mrs woodbourne thinks no children come within a mile of hers in beauty and excellence and lizzie  i am sure few people are more humbleminded than lizzie interrupted anne indignantly  what when she would take no ones advice but her own if it were to save her life said rupert  but she thinks everyone better than herself and makes no parade either of her talents or of her usefulness said anne  still she has a pretty high opinion of her own judgement said rupert  well she may said anne  when it leads her to go to mechanics institutes said rupert that is the reason anne respects her so much  i advise you to throw no stones at her sir said sir edward it would be well if some people of my acquaintance were as upright in acknowledging deficiencies in themselves as she is  besides i cannot see that helen is conceited said anne if she was she would not be made unhappy by other peoples criticisms  helen wants a just estimate of herself said lady merton she cares more for what people say of what she does than whether it is good in itself  but anne said sir edward why do not you claim to be the only person in the world devoid of conceit  because i am conceited in all the ways which rupert has mentioned said anne i believe myself witty and wise and amiable and useful and agreeable and i do not like taking advice and i am very angry when my friends are abused and i do believe i think i have the most exquisite brother in the world and besides if i said i was not conceited it would be the best possible proof of the contrarybut mamma there is a person whom we have not mentioned who has no conceit and plenty of selfcontrol  do you mean little dora said lady merton  no not dora though i am pretty much of mrs woodbournes opinion respecting her said anne i meant one who is always overlooked miss lucy hazleby  she may have every virtue upon earth for aught i know said rupert i can only testify that she has un grand talent pour le silence  i only know her from what my cousins told me said anne they seem to have a great respect for her though helen is the only person she ever seems to talk to  i never could make her speak three words to me  she has a fine countenance and very sweet expression certainly said lady merton  poor girl said sir edward she blushes so much that it was almost painful to look at her  you seem to be utterly deficient in proofs of her excellence said rupert you will leave her a blank page at last  pages are not always blank when you see nothing on them said lady merton characters may be brought out by the fire  yes mamma the fire of temptation said anne and i have heard lucy tried by her mothers violence and she never concealed any part of the truth as far as only regarded herself even to avoid those terrible unjust reproofs and put herself forward to bear her sisters share of blame and she was firm in turning back from the mechanics institute when her sister scolded her  firmness which in so timid a person proved that she had more selfcontrol than any of you said sir edward  then let us wind up the history of our visit in a moral style said anne and call it a lesson on selfcontrol and selfconceit  nonsense said rupert do you think that if anyone read its history they would learn any such lesson unless you told them beforehand  perhaps not said sir edward as you have not learnt it from your whole life  no said lady merton that lesson is not to be learnt by anyone who is not on the watch for it  so we conclude with mammas wisdom said rupert  and ruperts folly said anne     the end
