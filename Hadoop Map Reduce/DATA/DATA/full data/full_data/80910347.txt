to hampshire     chapter i how the black sheep came forth from the fold   the great bell of beaulieu was ringing far away through the forest might be heard its musical clangor and swell peatcutters on blackdown and fishers upon the exe heard the distant throbbing rising and falling upon the sultry summer air it was a common sound in those partsas common as the chatter of the jays and the booming of the bittern yet the fishers and the peasants raised their heads and looked questions at each other for the angelus had already gone and vespers was still far off why should the great bell of beaulieu toll when the shadows were neither short nor long  all round the abbey the monks were trooping in under the long greenpaved avenues of gnarled oaks and of lichened beeches the whiterobed brothers gathered to the sound from the vineyard and the vinepress from the bouvary or oxfarm from the marlpits and salterns even from the distant ironworks of sowley and the outlying grange of st leonards they had all turned their steps homewards it had been no sudden call a swift messenger had the night before sped round to the outlying dependencies of the abbey and had left the summons for every monk to be back in the cloisters by the third hour after noontide so urgent a message had not been issued within the memory of old laybrother athanasius who had cleaned the abbey knocker since the year after the battle of bannockburn  a stranger who knew nothing either of the abbey or of its immense resources might have gathered from the appearance of the brothers some conception of the varied duties which they were called upon to perform and of the busy widespread life which centred in the old monastery as they swept gravely in by twos and by threes with bended heads and muttering lips there were few who did not bear upon them some signs of their daily toil here were two with wrists and sleeves all spotted with the ruddy grape juice there again was a bearded brother with a broadheaded axe and a bundle of faggots upon his shoulders while beside him walked another with the shears under his arm and the white wool still clinging to his whiter gown a long straggling troop bore spades and mattocks while the two rearmost of all staggered along under a huge basket o freshcaught carp for the morrow was friday and there were fifty platters to be filled and as many sturdy trenchermen behind them of all the throng there was scarce one who was not laborstained and weary for abbot berghersh was a hard man to himself and to others  meanwhile in the broad and lofty chamber set apart for occasions of import the abbot himself was pacing impatiently backwards and forwards with his long white nervous hands clasped in front of him his thin thoughtworn features and sunken haggard cheeks bespoke one who had indeed beaten down that inner foe whom every man must face but had none the less suffered sorely in the contest in crushing his passions he had wellnigh crushed himself yet frail as was his person there gleamed out ever and anon from under his drooping brows a flash of fierce energy which recalled to mens minds that he came of a fighting stock and that even now his twinbrother sir bartholomew berghersh was one of the most famous of those stern warriors who had planted the cross of st george before the gates of paris with lips compressed and clouded brow he strode up and down the oaken floor the very genius and impersonation of asceticism while the great bell still thundered and clanged above his head at last the uproar died away in three last measured throbs and ere their echo had ceased the abbot struck a small gong which summoned a laybrother to his presence  have the brethren come he asked in the anglofrench dialect used in religious houses  they are here the other answered with his eyes cast down and his hands crossed upon his chest  all  two and thirty of the seniors and fifteen of the novices most holy father brother mark of the spicarium is sore smitten with a fever and could not come he said that  it boots not what he said fever or no he should have come at my call his spirit must be chastened as must that of many more in this abbey you yourself brother francis have twice raised your voice so it hath come to my ears when the reader in the refectory hath been dealing with the lives of gods most blessed saints what hast thou to say  the laybrother stood meek and silent with his arms still crossed in front of him  one thousand aves and as many credos said standing with arms outstretched before the shrine of the virgin may help thee to remember that the creator hath given us two ears and but one mouth as a token that there is twice the work for the one as for the other where is the master of the novices  he is without most holy father  send him hither  the sandalled feet clattered over the wooden floor and the ironbound door creaked upon its hinges in a few moments it opened again to admit a short square monk with a heavy composed face and an authoritative manner  you have sent for me holy father  yes brother jerome i wish that this matter be disposed of with as little scandal as may be and yet it is needful that the example should be a public one the abbot spoke in latin now as a language which was more fitted by its age and solemnity to convey the thoughts of two high dignitaries of the order  it would perchance be best that the novices be not admitted suggested the master this mention of a woman may turn their minds from their pious meditations to worldly and evil thoughts  woman woman groaned the abbot well has the holy chrysostom termed them radix malorum from eve downwards what good hath come from any of them who brings the plaint  it is brother ambrose  a holy and devout young man  a light and a pattern to every novice  let the matter be brought to an issue then according to our oldtime monastic habit bid the chancellor and the subchancellor lead in the brothers according to age together with brother john the accused and brother ambrose the accuser  and the novices  let them bide in the north alley of the cloisters stay bid the subchancellor send out to them thomas the lector to read unto them from the gesta beati benedicti it may save them from foolish and pernicious babbling  the abbot was left to himself once more and bent his thin gray face over his illuminated breviary so he remained while the senior monks filed slowly and sedately into the chamber seating themselves upon the long oaken benches which lined the wall on either side at the further end in two high chairs as large as that of the abbot though hardly as elaborately carved sat the master of the novices and the chancellor the latter a broad and portly priest with dark mirthful eyes and a thick outgrowth of crisp black hair all round his tonsured head between them stood a lean whitefaced brother who appeared to be ill at ease shifting his feet from side to side and tapping his chin nervously with the long parchment roll which he held in his hand the abbot from his point of vantage looked down on the two long lines of faces placid and sunbrowned for the most part with the large bovine eyes and unlined features which told of their easy unchanging existence then he turned his eager fiery gaze upon the palefaced monk who faced him  this plaint is thine as i learn brother ambrose said he may the holy benedict patron of our house be present this day and aid us in our findings how many counts are there  three most holy father the brother answered in a low and quavering voice  have you set them forth according to rule  they are here set down most holy father upon a cantle of sheepskin  let the sheepskin be handed to the chancellor bring in brother john and let him hear the plaints which have been urged against him  at this order a laybrother swung open the door and two other laybrothers entered leading between them a young novice of the order he was a man of huge stature darkeyed and redheaded with a peculiar halfhumorous halfdefiant expression upon his bold wellmarked features his cowl was thrown back upon his shoulders and his gown unfastened at the top disclosed a round sinewy neck ruddy and corded like the bark of the fir thick muscular arms covered with a reddish down protruded from the wide sleeves of his habit while his white shirt looped up upon one side gave a glimpse of a huge knotty leg scarred and torn with the scratches of brambles with a bow to the abbot which had in it perhaps more pleasantry than reverence the novice strode across to the carved priedieu which had been set apart for him and stood silent and erect with his hand upon the gold bell which was used in the private orisons of the abbots own household his dark eyes glanced rapidly over the assembly and finally settled with a grim and menacing twinkle upon the face of his accuser  the chancellor rose and having slowly unrolled the parchmentscroll proceeded to read it out in a thick and pompous voice while a subdued rustle and movement among the brothers bespoke the interest with which they followed the proceedings  charges brought upon the second thursday after the feast of the assumption in the year of our lord thirteen hundred and sixtysix against brother john formerly known as hordle john or john of hordle but now a novice in the holy monastic order of the cistercians read upon the same day at the abbey of beaulieu in the presence of the most reverend abbot berghersh and of the assembled order  the charges against the said brother john are the following namely to wit  first that on the abovementioned feast of the assumption small beer having been served to the novices in the proportion of one quart to each four the said brother john did drain the pot at one draught to the detriment of brother paul brother porphyry and brother ambrose who could scarce eat their nonemeat of salted stockfish on account of their exceeding dryness  at this solemn indictment the novice raised his hand and twitched his lip while even the placid senior brothers glanced across at each other and coughed to cover their amusement the abbot alone sat gray and immutable with a drawn face and a brooding eye  item that having been told by the master of the novices that he should restrict his food for two days to a single threepound loaf of bran and beans for the greater honoring and glorifying of st monica mother of the holy augustine he was heard by brother ambrose and others to say that he wished twenty thousand devils would fly away with the said monica mother of the holy augustine or any other saint who came between a man and his meat item that upon brother ambrose reproving him for this blasphemous wish he did hold the said brother face downwards over the piscatorium or fishpond for a space during which the said brother was able to repeat a pater and four aves for the better fortifying of his soul against impending death  there was a buzz and murmur among the whitefrocked brethren at this grave charge but the abbot held up his long quivering hand what then said he  item that between nones and vespers on the feast of james the less the said brother john was observed upon the brockenhurst road near the spot which is known as hatchetts pond in converse with a person of the other sex being a maiden of the name of mary sowley the daughter of the kings verderer item that after sundry japes and jokes the said brother john did lift up the said mary sowley and did take carry and convey her across a stream to the infinite relish of the devil and the exceeding detriment of his own soul which scandalous and wilful falling away was witnessed by three members of our order  a dead silence throughout the room with a rolling of heads and upturning of eyes bespoke the pious horror of the community  the abbot drew his gray brows low over his fiercely questioning eyes  who can vouch for this thing he asked  that can i answered the accuser so too can brother porphyry who was with me and brother mark of the spicarium who hath been so much stirred and inwardly troubled by the sight that he now lies in a fever through it  and the woman asked the abbot did she not break into lamentation and woe that a brother should so demean himself  nay she smiled sweetly upon him and thanked him i can vouch it and so can brother porphyry  canst thou cried the abbot in a high tempestuous tone canst thou so hast forgotten that the fiveandthirtieth rule of the order is that in the presence of a woman the face should be ever averted and the eyes cast down hast forgot it i say if your eyes were upon your sandals how came ye to see this smile of which ye prate a week in your cells false brethren a week of ryebread and lentils with double lauds and double matins may help ye to remembrance of the laws under which ye live  at this sudden outflame of wrath the two witnesses sank their faces on to their chests and sat as men crushed the abbot turned his angry eyes away from them and bent them upon the accused who met his searching gaze with a firm and composed face  what hast thou to say brother john upon these weighty things which are urged against you  little enough good father little enough said the novice speaking english with a broad west saxon drawl the brothers who were english to a man pricked up their ears at the sound of the homely and yet unfamiliar speech but the abbot flushed red with anger and struck his hand upon the oaken arm of his chair  what talk is this he cried is this a tongue to be used within the walls of an old and wellfamed monastery but grace and learning have ever gone hand in hand and when one is lost it is needless to look for the other  i know not about that said brother john i know only that the words come kindly to my mouth for it was the speech of my fathers before me under your favor i shall either use it now or hold my peace  the abbot patted his foot and nodded his head as one who passes a point but does not forget it  for the matter of the ale continued brother john i had come in hot from the fields and had scarce got the taste of the thing before mine eye lit upon the bottom of the pot it may be too that i spoke somewhat shortly concerning the bran and the beans the same being poor provender and unfitted for a man of my inches it is true also that i did lay my hands upon this jackfool of a brother ambrose though as you can see i did him little scathe as regards the maid too it is true that i did heft her over the stream she having on her hosen and shoon whilst i had but my wooden sandals which could take no hurt from the water i should have thought shame upon my manhood as well as my monkhood if i had held back my hand from her he glanced around as he spoke with the halfamused look which he had worn during the whole proceedings  there is no need to go further said the abbot he has confessed to all it only remains for me to portion out the punishment which is due to his evil conduct  he rose and the two long lines of brothers followed his example looking sideways with scared faces at the angry prelate  john of hordle he thundered you have shown yourself during the two months of your novitiate to be a recreant monk and one who is unworthy to wear the white garb which is the outer symbol of the spotless spirit that dress shall therefore be stripped from thee and thou shalt be cast into the outer world without benefit of clerkship and without lot or part in the graces and blessings of those who dwell under the care of the blessed benedict thou shalt come back neither to beaulieu nor to any of the granges of beaulieu and thy name shall be struck off the scrolls of the order  the sentence appeared a terrible one to the older monks who had become so used to the safe and regular life of the abbey that they would have been as helpless as children in the outer world from their pious oasis they looked dreamily out at the desert of life a place full of stormings and strivingscomfortless restless and overshadowed by evil the young novice however appeared to have other thoughts for his eyes sparkled and his smile broadened it needed but that to add fresh fuel to the fiery mood of the prelate  so much for thy spiritual punishment he cried but it is to thy grosser feelings that we must turn in such natures as thine and as thou art no longer under the shield of holy church there is the less difficulty ho there laybrothersfrancis naomi josephseize him and bind his arms drag him forth and let the foresters and the porters scourge him from the precincts  as these three brothers advanced towards him to carry out the abbots direction the smile faded from the novices face and he glanced right and left with his fierce brown eyes like a bull at a baiting then with a sudden deepchested shout he tore up the heavy oaken priedieu and poised it to strike taking two steps backward the while that none might take him at a vantage  by the black rood of waltham he roared if any knave among you lays a fingerend upon the edge of my gown i will crush his skull like a filbert with his thick knotted arms his thundering voice and his bristle of red hair there was something so repellent in the man that the three brothers flew back at the very glare of him and the two rows of white monks strained away from him like poplars in a tempest the abbot only sprang forward with shining eyes but the chancellor and the master hung upon either arm and wrested him back out of dangers way  he is possessed of a devil they shouted run brother ambrose brother joachim call hugh of the mill and woodman wat and raoul with his arbalest and bolts tell them that we are in fear of our lives run run for the love of the virgin  but the novice was a strategist as well as a man of action springing forward he hurled his unwieldy weapon at brother ambrose and as desk and monk clattered on to the floor together he sprang through the open door and down the winding stair sleepy old brother athanasius at the porters cell had a fleeting vision of twinkling feet and flying skirts but before he had time to rub his eyes the recreant had passed the lodge and was speeding as fast as his sandals could patter along the lyndhurst road    chapter ii how alleyne edricson came out into the world   never had the peaceful atmosphere of the old cistercian house been so rudely ruffled never had there been insurrection so sudden so short and so successful yet the abbot berghersh was a man of too firm a grain to allow one bold outbreak to imperil the settled order of his great household in a few hot and bitter words he compared their false brothers exit to the expulsion of our first parents from the garden and more than hinted that unless a reformation occurred some others of the community might find themselves in the same evil and perilous case having thus pointed the moral and reduced his flock to a fitting state of docility he dismissed them once more to their labors and withdrew himself to his own private chamber there to seek spiritual aid in the discharge of the duties of his high office  the abbot was still on his knees when a gentle tapping at the door of his cell broke in upon his orisons  rising in no very good humor at the interruption he gave the word to enter but his look of impatience softened down into a pleasant and paternal smile as his eyes fell upon his visitor  he was a thinfaced yellowhaired youth rather above the middle size comely and well shapen with straight lithe figure and eager boyish features his clear pensive gray eyes and quick delicate expression spoke of a nature which had unfolded far from the boisterous joys and sorrows of the world yet there was a set of the mouth and a prominence of the chin which relieved him of any trace of effeminacy impulsive he might be enthusiastic sensitive with something sympathetic and adaptive in his disposition but an observer of natures tokens would have confidently pledged himself that there was native firmness and strength underlying his gentle monkbred ways  the youth was not clad in monastic garb but in lay attire though his jerkin cloak and hose were all of a sombre hue as befitted one who dwelt in sacred precincts a broad leather strap hanging from his shoulder supported a scrip or satchel such as travellers were wont to carry in one hand he grasped a thick staff pointed and shod with metal while in the other he held his coif or bonnet which bore in its front a broad pewter medal stamped with the image of our lady of rocamadour  art ready then fair son said the abbot this is indeed a day of comings and of goings it is strange that in one twelve hours the abbey should have cast off its foulest weed and should now lose what we are fain to look upon as our choicest blossom  you speak too kindly father the youth answered if i had my will i should never go forth but should end my days here in beaulieu it hath been my home as far back as my mind can carry me and it is a sore thing for me to have to leave it  life brings many a cross said the abbot gently who is without them your going forth is a grief to us as well as to yourself but there is no help i had given my foreword and sacred promise to your father edric the franklin that at the age of twenty you should be sent out into the world to see for yourself how you liked the savor of it seat thee upon the settle alleyne for you may need rest ere long  the youth sat down as directed but reluctantly and with diffidence the abbot stood by the narrow window and his long black shadow fell slantwise across the rushstrewn floor  twenty years ago he said your father the franklin of minstead died leaving to the abbey three hides of rich land in the hundred of malwood and leaving to us also his infant son on condition that we should rear him until he came to mans estate this he did partly because your mother was dead and partly because your elder brother now socman of minstead had already given sign of that fierce and rude nature which would make him no fit companion for you it was his desire and request however that you should not remain in the cloisters but should at a ripe age return into the world  but father interrupted the young man it is surely true that i am already advanced several degrees in clerkship  yes fair son but not so far as to bar you from the garb you now wear or the life which you must now lead you have been porter  yes father  exorcist  yes father  reader  yes father  acolyte  yes father  but have sworn no vow of constancy or chastity  no father  then you are free to follow a worldly life but let me hear ere you start what gifts you take away with you from beaulieu some i already know there is the playing of the citole and the rebeck our choir will be dumb without you you carve too  the youths pale face flushed with the pride of the skilled workman yes holy father he answered thanks to good brother bartholomew i carve in wood and in ivory and can do something also in silver and in bronze from brother francis i have learned to paint on vellum on glass and on metal with a knowledge of those pigments and essences which can preserve the color against damp or a biting air brother luke hath given me some skill in damask work and in the enamelling of shrines tabernacles diptychs and triptychs for the rest i know a little of the making of covers the cutting of precious stones and the fashioning of instruments  a goodly list truly cried the superior with a smile what clerk of cambrig or of oxenford could say as much but of thy readinghast not so much to show there i fear  no father it hath been slight enough yet thanks to our good chancellor i am not wholly unlettered i have read ockham bradwardine and other of the schoolmen together with the learned duns scotus and the book of the holy aquinas  but of the things of this world what have you gathered from your reading from this high window you may catch a glimpse over the wooden point and the smoke of bucklershard of the mouth of the exe and the shining sea now i pray you alleyne if a man were to take a ship and spread sail across yonder waters where might he hope to arrive  the youth pondered and drew a plan amongst the rushes with the point of his staff holy father said he he would come upon those parts of france which are held by the kings majesty but if he trended to the south he might reach spain and the barbary states to his north would be flanders and the country of the eastlanders and of the muscovites  true and how if after reaching the kings possessions he still journeyed on to the eastward  he would then come upon that part of france which is still in dispute and he might hope to reach the famous city of avignon where dwells our blessed father the prop of christendom  and then  then he would pass through the land of the almains and the great roman empire and so to the country of the huns and of the lithuanian pagans beyond which lies the great city of constantine and the kingdom of the unclean followers of mahmoud  and beyond that fair son  beyond that is jerusalem and the holy land and the great river which hath its source in the garden of eden  and then  nay good father i cannot tell methinks the end of the world is not far from there  then we can still find something to teach thee alleyne said the abbot complaisantly know that many strange nations lie betwixt there and the end of the world there is the country of the amazons and the country of the dwarfs and the country of the fair but evil women who slay with beholding like the basilisk beyond that again is the kingdom of prester john and of the great cham these things i know for very sooth for i had them from that pious christian and valiant knight sir john de mandeville who stopped twice at beaulieu on his way to and from southampton and discoursed to us concerning what he had seen from the readers desk in the refectory until there was many a good brother who got neither bit nor sup so stricken were they by his strange tales  i would fain know father asked the young man what there may be at the end of the world  there are some things replied the abbot gravely into which it was never intended that we should inquire but you have a long road before you whither will you first turn  to my brothers at minstead if he be indeed an ungodly and violent man there is the more need that i should seek him out and see whether i cannot turn him to better ways  the abbot shook his head the socman of minstead hath earned an evil name over the country side he said if you must go to him see at least that he doth not turn you from the narrow path upon which you have learned to tread but you are in gods keeping and godward should you ever look in danger and in trouble above all shun the snares of women for they are ever set for the foolish feet of the young kneel down my child and take an old mans blessing  alleyne edricson bent his head while the abbot poured out his heartfelt supplication that heaven would watch over this young soul now going forth into the darkness and danger of the world it was no mere form for either of them to them the outside life of mankind did indeed seem to be one of violence and of sin beset with physical and still more with spiritual danger heaven too was very near to them in those days gods direct agency was to be seen in the thunder and the rainbow the whirlwind and the lightning to the believer clouds of angels and confessors and martyrs armies of the sainted and the saved were ever stooping over their struggling brethren upon earth raising encouraging and supporting them it was then with a lighter heart and a stouter courage that the young man turned from the abbots room while the latter following him to the stairhead finally commended him to the protection of the holy julian patron of travellers  underneath in the porch of the abbey the monks had gathered to give him a last godspeed many had brought some parting token by which he should remember them there was brother bartholomew with a crucifix of rare carved ivory and brother luke with a whitebacked psalter adorned with golden bees and brother francis with the slaying of the innocents most daintily set forth upon vellum all these were duly packed away deep in the travellers scrip and above them old pippinfaced brother athanasius had placed a parcel of simnel bread and rammel cheese with a small flask of the famous bluesealed abbey wine so amid handshakings and laughings and blessings alleyne edricson turned his back upon beaulieu  at the turn of the road he stopped and gazed back there was the widespread building which he knew so well the abbots house the long church the cloisters with their line of arches all bathed and mellowed in the evening sun there too was the broad sweep of the river exe the old stone well the canopied niche of the virgin and in the centre of all the cluster of whiterobed figures who waved their hands to him a sudden mist swam up before the young mans eyes and he turned away upon his journey with a heavy heart and a choking throat    chapter iii how hordle john cozened the fuller of lymington   it is not however in the nature of things that a lad of twenty with young life glowing in his veins and all the wide world before him should spend his first hours of freedom in mourning for what he had left long ere alleyne was out of sound of the beaulieu bells he was striding sturdily along swinging his staff and whistling as merrily as the birds in the thicket it was an evening to raise a mans heart the sun shining slantwise through the trees threw delicate traceries across the road with bars of golden light between away in the distance before and behind the green boughs now turning in places to a coppery redness shot their broad arches across the track the still summer air was heavy with the resinous smell of the great forest here and there a tawny brook prattled out from among the underwood and lost itself again in the ferns and brambles upon the further side save the dull piping of insects and the sough of the leaves there was silence everywherethe sweet restful silence of nature  and yet there was no want of lifethe whole wide wood was full of it now it was a lithe furtive stoat which shot across the path upon some fell errand of its own then it was a wild cat which squatted upon the outlying branch of an oak and peeped at the traveller with a yellow and dubious eye once it was a wild sow which scuttled out of the bracken with two young sounders at her heels and once a lordly red staggard walked daintily out from among the tree trunks and looked around him with the fearless gaze of one who lived under the kings own high protection alleyne gave his staff a merry flourish however and the red deer bethought him that the king was far off so streaked away from whence he came  the youth had now journeyed considerably beyond the furthest domains of the abbey he was the more surprised therefore when on coming round a turn in the path he perceived a man clad in the familiar garb of the order and seated in a clump of heather by the roadside alleyne had known every brother well but this was a face which was new to hima face which was very red and puffed working this way and that as though the man were sore perplexed in his mind once he shook both hands furiously in the air and twice he sprang from his seat and hurried down the road when he rose however alleyne observed that his robe was much too long and loose for him in every direction trailing upon the ground and bagging about his ankles so that even with trussedup skirts he could make little progress he ran once but the long gown clogged him so that he slowed down into a shambling walk and finally plumped into the heather once more  young friend said he when alleyne was abreast of him i fear from thy garb that thou canst know little of the abbey of beaulieu  then you are in error friend the clerk answered for i have spent all my days within its walls  hast so indeed cried he then perhaps canst tell me the name of a great loathly lump of a brother wi freckled face an a hand like a spade his eyes were black an his hair was red an his voice like the parish bull i trow that there cannot be two alike in the same cloisters  that surely can be no other than brother john said alleyne i trust he has done you no wrong that you should be so hot against him  wrong quotha cried the other jumping out of the heather wrong why he hath stolen every plack of clothing off my back if that be a wrong and hath left me here in this sorry frock of white falding so that i have shame to go back to my wife lest she think that i have donned her old kirtle harrow and alas that ever i should have met him  but how came this asked the young clerk who could scarce keep from laughter at the sight of the hot little man so swathed in the great white cloak  it came in this way he said sitting down once more i was passing this way hoping to reach lymington ere nightfall when i came on this redheaded knave seated even where we are sitting now i uncovered and louted as i passed thinking that he might be a holy man at his orisons but he called to me and asked me if i had heard speak of the new indulgence in favor of the cistercians not i i answered then the worse for thy soul said he and with that he broke into a long tale how that on account of the virtues of the abbot berghersh it had been decreed by the pope that whoever should wear the habit of a monk of beaulieu for as long as he might say the seven psalms of david should be assured of the kingdom of heaven when i heard this i prayed him on my knees that he would give me the use of his gown which after many contentions he at last agreed to do on my paying him three marks towards the regilding of the image of laurence the martyr having stripped his robe i had no choice but to let him have the wearing of my good leathern jerkin and hose for as he said it was chilling to the blood and unseemly to the eye to stand frockless whilst i made my orisons he had scarce got them on and it was a sore labor seeing that my inches will scarce match my girthhe had scarce got them on i say and i not yet at the end of the second psalm when he bade me do honor to my new dress and with that set off down the road as fast as feet would carry him for myself i could no more run than if i had been sown in a sack so here i sit and here i am like to sit before i set eyes upon my clothes again  nay friend take it not so sadly said alleyne clapping the disconsolate one upon the shoulder canst change thy robe for a jerkin once more at the abbey unless perchance you have a friend near at hand  that have i he answered and close but i care not to go nigh him in this plight for his wife hath a gibing tongue and will spread the tale until i could not show my face in any market from fordingbridge to southampton but if you fair sir out of your kind charity would be pleased to go a matter of two bowshots out of your way you would do me such a service as i could scarce repay  with all my heart said alleyne readily  then take this pathway on the left i pray thee and then the deertrack which passes on the right you will then see under a great beechtree the hut of a charcoalburner give him my name good sir the name of peter the fuller of lymington and ask him for a change of raiment that i may pursue my journey without delay there are reasons why he would be loth to refuse me  alleyne started off along the path indicated and soon found the loghut where the burner dwelt he was away faggotcutting in the forest but his wife a ruddy bustling dame found the needful garments and tied them into a bundle while she busied herself in finding and folding them alleyne edricson stood by the open door looking in at her with much interest and some distrust for he had never been so nigh to a woman before she had round red arms a dress of some sober woollen stuff and a brass brooch the size of a cheesecake stuck in the front of it  peter the fuller she kept repeating marry come up if i were peter the fullers wife i would teach him better than to give his clothes to the first knave who asks for them but he was always a poor fond silly creature was peter though we are beholden to him for helping to bury our second son wat who was a prentice to him at lymington in the year of the black death but who are you young sir  i am a clerk on my road from beaulieu to minstead  aye indeed hast been brought up at the abbey then i could read it from thy reddened cheek and downcast eye hast learned from the monks i trow to fear a woman as thou wouldst a lazarhouse out upon them that they should dishonor their own mothers by such teaching a pretty world it would be with all the women out of it  heaven forfend that such a thing should come to pass said alleyne  amen and amen but thou art a pretty lad and the prettier for thy modest ways it is easy to see from thy cheek that thou hast not spent thy days in the rain and the heat and the wind as my poor wat hath been forced to do  i have indeed seen little of life good dame  wilt find nothing in it to pay for the loss of thy own freshness here are the clothes and peter can leave them when next he comes this way holy virgin see the dust upon thy doublet it were easy to see that there is no woman to tend to thee sothat is better now buss me boy  alleyne stooped and kissed her for the kiss was the common salutation of the age and as erasmus long afterwards remarked more used in england than in any other country yet it sent the blood to his temples again and he wondered as he turned away what the abbot berghersh would have answered to so frank an invitation he was still tingling from this new experience when he came out upon the highroad and saw a sight which drove all other thoughts from his mind  some way down from where he had left him the unfortunate peter was stamping and raving tenfold worse than before now however instead of the great white cloak he had no clothes on at all save a short woollen shirt and a pair of leather shoes far down the road a longlegged figure was running with a bundle under one arm and the other hand to his side like a man who laughs until he is sore  see him yelled peter look to him you shall be my witness he shall see winchester jail for this see where he goes with my cloak under his arm  who then cried alleyne  who but that cursed brother john he hath not left me clothes enough to make a gallybagger the double thief hath cozened me out of my gown  stay though my friend it was his gown objected alleyne  it boots not he hath them allgown jerkin hosen and all gramercy to him that he left me the shirt and the shoon i doubt not that he will be back for them anon  but how came this asked alleyne openeyed with astonishment  are those the clothes for dear charitys sake give them to me not the pope himself shall have these from me though he sent the whole college of cardinals to ask it how came it why you had scarce gone ere this loathly john came running back again and when i oped mouth to reproach him he asked me whether it was indeed likely that a man of prayer would leave his own godly raiment in order to take a laymans jerkin he had he said but gone for a while that i might be the freer for my devotions on this i plucked off the gown and he with much show of haste did begin to undo his points but when i threw his frock down he clipped it up and ran off all untrussed leaving me in this sorry plight he laughed so the while like a great croaking frog that i might have caught him had my breath not been as short as his legs were long  the young man listened to this tale of wrong with all the seriousness that he could maintain but at the sight of the pursy redfaced man and the dignity with which he bore him the laughter came so thick upon him that he had to lean up against a treetrunk the fuller looked sadly and gravely at him but finding that he still laughed he bowed with much mock politeness and stalked onwards in his borrowed clothes alleyne watched him until he was small in the distance and then wiping the tears from his eyes he set off briskly once more upon his journey    chapter iv how the bailiff of southampton slew the two masterless men   the road along which he travelled was scarce as populous as most other roads in the kingdom and far less so than those which lie between the larger towns yet from time to time alleyne met other wayfarers and more than once was overtaken by strings of pack mules and horsemen journeying in the same direction as himself once a begging friar came limping along in a brown habit imploring in a most dolorous voice to give him a single groat to buy bread wherewith to save himself from impending death alleyne passed him swiftly by for he had learned from the monks to have no love for the wandering friars and besides there was a great halfgnawed mutton bone sticking out of his pouch to prove him a liar swiftly as he went however he could not escape the curse of the four blessed evangelists which the mendicant howled behind him so dreadful are his execrations that the frightened lad thrust his fingers into his earholes and ran until the fellow was but a brown smirch upon the yellow road  further on at the edge of the woodland he came upon a chapman and his wife who sat upon a fallen tree he had put his pack down as a table and the two of them were devouring a great pasty and washing it down with some drink from a stone jar the chapman broke a rough jest as he passed and the woman called shrilly to alleyne to come and join them on which the man turning suddenly from mirth to wrath began to belabor her with his cudgel alleyne hastened on lest he make more mischief and his heart was heavy as lead within him look where he would he seemed to see nothing but injustice and violence and the hardness of man to man  but even as he brooded sadly over it and pined for the sweet peace of the abbey he came on an open space dotted with holly bushes where was the strangest sight that he had yet chanced upon near to the pathway lay a long clump of greenery and from behind this there stuck straight up into the air four human legs clad in particolored hosen yellow and black strangest of all was when a brisk tune struck suddenly up and the four legs began to kick and twitter in time to the music walking on tiptoe round the bushes he stood in amazement to see two men bounding about on their heads while they played the one a viol and the other a pipe as merrily and as truly as though they were seated in a choir alleyne crossed himself as he gazed at this unnatural sight and could scarce hold his ground with a steady face when the two dancers catching sight of him came bouncing in his direction a spears length from him they each threw a somersault into the air and came down upon their feet with smirking faces and their hands over their hearts  a guerdona guerdon my knight of the staring eyes cried one  a gift my prince shouted the other any trifle will servea purse of gold or even a jewelled goblet  alleyne thought of what he had read of demoniac possessionthe jumpings the twitchings the wild talk it was in his mind to repeat over the exorcism proper to such attacks but the two burst out alaughing at his scared face and turning on to their heads once more clapped their heels in derision  hast never seen tumblers before asked the elder a blackbrowed swarthy man as brown and supple as a hazel twig why shrink from us then as though we were the spawn of the evil one  why shrink my honeybird why so afeard my sweet cinnamon exclaimed the other a loosejointed lanky youth with a dancing roguish eye  truly sirs it is a new sight to me the clerk answered when i saw your four legs above the bush i could scarce credit my own eyes why is it that you do this thing  a dry question to answer cried the younger coming back on to his feet a most husky question my fair bird but how a flask a flaskby all that is wonderful he shot out his hand as he spoke and plucking alleynes bottle out of his scrip he deftly knocked the neck off and poured the half of it down his throat the rest he handed to his comrade who drank the wine and then to the clerks increasing amazement made a show of swallowing the bottle with such skill that alleyne seemed to see it vanish down his throat a moment later however he flung it over his head and caught it bottom downwards upon the calf of his left leg  we thank you for the wine kind sir said he and for the ready courtesy wherewith you offered it touching your question we may tell you that we are strollers and jugglers who having performed with much applause at winchester fair are now on our way to the great michaelmas market at ringwood as our art is a very fine and delicate one however we cannot let a day go by without exercising ourselves in it to which end we choose some quiet and sheltered spot where we may break our journey here you find us and we cannot wonder that you who are new to tumbling should be astounded since many great barons earls marshals and knight who have wandered as far as the holy land are of one mind in saying that they have never seen a more noble or gracious performance if you will be pleased to sit upon that stump we will now continue our exercise  alleyne sat down willingly as directed with two great bundles on either side of him which contained the strollers dressesdoublets of flamecolored silk and girdles of leather spangled with brass and tin the jugglers were on their heads once more bounding about with rigid necks playing the while in perfect time and tune it chanced that out of one of the bundles there stuck the end of what the clerk saw to be a cittern so drawing it forth he tuned it up and twanged a harmony to the merry lilt which the dancers played on that they dropped their own instruments and putting their hands to the ground they hopped about faster and faster ever shouting to him to play more briskly until at last for very weariness all three had to stop  well played sweet poppet cried the younger hast a rare touch on the strings  how knew you the tune asked the other  i knew it not i did but follow the notes i heard  both opened their eyes at this and stared at alleyne with as much amazement as he had shown at them  you have a fine trick of ear then said one we have long wished to meet such a man wilt join us and jog on to ringwood thy duties shall be light and thou shalt have twopence a day and meat for supper every night  with as much beer as you can put away said the other and a flask of gascon wine on sabbaths  nay it may not be i have other work to do i have tarried with you over long quoth alleyne and resolutely set forth upon his journey once more they ran behind him some little way offering him first fourpence and then sixpence a day but he only smiled and shook his head until at last they fell away from him looking back he saw that the smaller had mounted on the youngers shoulders and that they stood so some ten feet high waving their adieus to him he waved back to them and then hastened on the lighter of heart for having fallen in with these strange men of pleasure  alleyne had gone no great distance for all the many small passages that had befallen him yet to him used as he was to a life of such quiet that the failure of a brewing or the altering of an anthem had seemed to be of the deepest import the quick changing play of the lights and shadows of life was strangely startling and interesting a gulf seemed to divide this brisk uncertain existence from the old steady round of work and of prayer which he had left behind him the few hours that had passed since he saw the abbey tower stretched out in his memory until they outgrew whole months of the stagnant life of the cloister as he walked and munched the soft bread from his scrip it seemed strange to him to feel that it was still warm from the ovens of beaulieu  when he passed penerley where were three cottages and a barn he reached the edge of the tree country and found the great barren heath of blackdown stretching in front of him all pink with heather and bronzed with the fading ferns on the left the woods were still thick but the road edged away from them and wound over the open the sun lay low in the west upon a purple cloud whence it threw a mild chastening light over the wild moorland and glittered on the fringe of forest turning the withered leaves into flakes of dead gold the brighter for the black depths behind them to the seeing eye decay is as fair as growth and death as life the thought stole into alleynes heart as he looked upon the autumnal country side and marvelled at its beauty he had little time to dwell upon it however for there were still six good miles between him and the nearest inn he sat down by the roadside to partake of his bread and cheese and then with a lighter scrip he hastened upon his way  there appeared to be more wayfarers on the down than in the forest first he passed two dominicans in their long black dresses who swept by him with downcast looks and pattering lips without so much as a glance at him then there came a gray friar or minorite with a good paunch upon him walking slowly and looking about him with the air of a man who was at peace with himself and with all men he stopped alleyne to ask him whether it was not true that there was a hostel somewhere in those parts which was especially famous for the stewing of eels the clerk having made answer that he had heard the eels of sowley well spoken of the friar sucked in his lips and hurried forward close at his heels came three laborers walking abreast with spade and mattock over their shoulders they sang some rude chorus right tunefully as they walked but their english was so coarse and rough that to the ears of a cloisterbred man it sounded like a foreign and barbarous tongue one of them carried a young bittern which they had caught upon the moor and they offered it to alleyne for a silver groat very glad he was to get safely past them for with their bristling red beards and their fierce blue eyes they were uneasy men to bargain with upon a lonely moor  yet it is not always the burliest and the wildest who are the most to be dreaded the workers looked hungrily at him and then jogged onwards upon their way in slow lumbering saxon style a worse man to deal with was a woodenlegged cripple who came hobbling down the path so weak and so old to all appearance that a child need not stand in fear of him yet when alleyne had passed him of a sudden out of pure devilment he screamed out a curse at him and sent a jagged flint stone hurtling past his ear so horrid was the causeless rage of the crooked creature that the clerk came over a cold thrill and took to his heels until he was out of shot from stone or word it seemed to him that in this country of england there was no protection for a man save that which lay in the strength of his own arm and the speed of his own foot in the cloisters he had heard vague talk of the lawthe mighty law which was higher than prelate or baron yet no sign could he see of it what was the benefit of a law written fair upon parchment he wondered if there were no officers to enforce it as it fell out however he had that very evening ere the sun had set a chance of seeing how stern was the grip of the english law when it did happen to seize the offender  a mile or so out upon the moor the road takes a very sudden dip into a hollow with a peatcolored stream running swiftly down the centre of it to the right of this stood and stands to this day an ancient barrow or burying mound covered deeply in a bristle of heather and bracken alleyne was plodding down the slope upon one side when he saw an old dame coming towards him upon the other limping with weariness and leaning heavily upon a stick when she reached the edge of the stream she stood helpless looking to right and to left for some ford where the path ran down a great stone had been fixed in the centre of the brook but it was too far from the bank for her aged and uncertain feet twice she thrust forward at it and twice she drew back until at last giving up in despair she sat herself down by the brink and wrung her hands wearily there she still sat when alleyne reached the crossing  come mother quoth he it is not so very perilous a passage  alas good youth she answered i have a humor in the eyes and though i can see that there is a stone there i can by no means be sure as to where it lies  that is easily amended said he cheerily and picking her lightly up for she was much worn with time he passed across with her he could not but observe however that as he placed her down her knees seemed to fail her and she could scarcely prop herself up with her staff  you are weak mother said he hast journeyed far i wot  from wiltshire friend said she in a quavering voice three days have i been on the road i go to my son who is one of the kings regarders at brockenhurst he has ever said that he would care for me in mine old age  and rightly too mother since you cared for him in his youth but when have you broken fast  at lyndenhurst but alas my money is at an end and i could but get a dish of branporridge from the nunnery yet i trust that i may be able to reach brockenhurst tonight where i may have all that heart can desire for oh sir but my son is a fine man with a kindly heart of his own and it is as good as food to me to think that he should have a doublet of lincoln green to his back and be the kings own paid man  it is a long road yet to brockenhurst said alleyne but here is such bread and cheese as i have left and here too is a penny which may help you to supper may god be with you  may god be with you young man she cried may he make your heart as glad as you have made mine she turned away still mumbling blessings and alleyne saw her short figure and her long shadow stumbling slowly up the slope  he was moving away himself when his eyes lit upon a strange sight and one which sent a tingling through his skin out of the tangled scrub on the old overgrown barrow two human faces were looking out at him the sinking sun glimmered full upon them showing up every line and feature the one was an oldish man with a thin beard a crooked nose and a broad red smudge from a birthmark over his temple the other was a negro a thing rarely met in england at that day and rarer still in the quiet southland parts alleyne had read of such folk but had never seen one before and could scarce take his eyes from the fellows broad pouting lip and shining teeth even as he gazed however the two came writhing out from among the heather and came down towards him with such a guilty slinking carriage that the clerk felt that there was no good in them and hastened onwards upon his way  he had not gained the crown of the slope when he heard a sudden scuffle behind him and a feeble voice bleating for help looking round there was the old dame down upon the roadway with her red whimple flying on the breeze while the two rogues black and white stooped over her wresting away from her the penny and such other poor trifles as were worth the taking at the sight of her thin limbs struggling in weak resistance such a glow of fierce anger passed over alleyne as set his head in a whirl dropping his scrip he bounded over the stream once more and made for the two villains with his staff whirled over his shoulder and his gray eyes blazing with fury  the robbers however were not disposed to leave their victim until they had worked their wicked will upon her the black man with the womans crimson scarf tied round his swarthy head stood forward in the centre of the path with a long dullcolored knife in his hand while the other waving a ragged cudgel cursed at alleyne and dared him to come on his blood was fairly aflame however and he needed no such challenge dashing at the black man he smote at him with such good will that the other let his knife tinkle into the roadway and hopped howling to a safer distance the second rogue however made of sterner stuff rushed in upon the clerk and clipped him round the waist with a grip like a bear shouting the while to his comrade to come round and stab him in the back at this the negro took heart of grace and picking up his dagger again he came stealing with prowling step and murderous eye while the two swayed backwards and forwards staggering this way and that in the very midst of the scuffle however whilst alleyne braced himself to feel the cold blade between his shoulders there came a sudden scurry of hoofs and the black man yelled with terror and ran for his life through the heather the man with the birthmark too struggled to break away and alleyne heard his teeth chatter and felt his limbs grow limp to his hand at this sign of coming aid the clerk held on the tighter and at last was able to pin his man down and glanced behind him to see where all the noise was coming from  down the slanting road there was riding a big burly man clad in a tunic of purple velvet and driving a great black horse as hard as it could gallop he leaned well over its neck as he rode and made a heaving with his shoulders at every bound as though he were lifting the steed instead of it carrying him in the rapid glance alleyne saw that he had white doeskin gloves a curling white feather in his flat velvet cap and a broad gold embroidered baldric across his bosom behind him rode six others two and two clad in sober brown jerkins with the long yellow staves of their bows thrusting out from behind their right shoulders down the hill they thundered over the brook and up to the scene of the contest  here is one said the leader springing down from his reeking horse and seizing the white rogue by the edge of his jerkin this is one of them i know him by that devils touch upon his brow where are your cords peterkin so bind him hand and foot his last hour has come and you young man who may you be  i am a clerk sir travelling from beaulieu  a clerk cried the other art from oxenford or from cambridge hast thou a letter from the chancellor of thy college giving thee a permit to beg let me see thy letter he had a stern square face with bushy side whiskers and a very questioning eye  i am from beaulieu abbey and i have no need to beg said alleyne who was all of a tremble now that the ruffle was over  the better for thee the other answered dost know who i am  no sir i do not  i am the lawnodding his head solemnly i am the law of england and the mouthpiece of his most gracious and royal majesty edward the third  alleyne louted low to the kings representative truly you came in good time honored sir said he a moment later and they would have slain me  but there should be another one cried the man in the purple coat there should be a black man a shipman with st anthonys fire and a black man who had served him as cookthose are the pair that we are in chase of  the black man fled over to that side said alleyne pointing towards the barrow  he could not have gone far sir bailiff cried one of the archers unslinging his bow he is in hiding somewhere for he knew well black paynim as he is that our horses four legs could outstrip his two  then we shall have him said the other it shall never be said whilst i am bailiff of southampton that any waster riever drawlatch or murtherer came scathless away from me and my posse leave that rogue lying now stretch out in line my merry ones with arrow on string and i shall show you such sport as only the king can give you on the left howett and thomas of redbridge upon the right so beat high and low among the heather and a pot of wine to the lucky marksman  as it chanced however the searchers had not far to seek the negro had burrowed down into his hidingplace upon the barrow where he might have lain snug enough had it not been for the red gear upon his head as he raised himself to look over the bracken at his enemies the staring color caught the eye of the bailiff who broke into a long screeching whoop and spurred forward sword in hand seeing himself discovered the man rushed out from his hidingplace and bounded at the top of his speed down the line of archers keeping a good hundred paces to the front of them the two who were on either side of alleyne bent their bows as calmly as though they were shooting at the popinjay at the village fair  seven yards windage hal said one whose hair was streaked with gray  five replied the other letting loose his string alleyne gave a gulp in his throat for the yellow streak seemed to pass through the man but he still ran forward  seven you jackfool growled the first speaker and his bow twanged like a harpstring the black man sprang high up into the air and shot out both his arms and his legs coming down all asprawl among the heather right under the blade bone quoth the archer sauntering forward for his arrow  the old hound is the best when all is said quoth the bailiff of southampton as they made back for the roadway that means a quart of the best malmsey in southampton this very night matthew atwood art sure that he is dead  dead as pontius pilate worshipful sir  it is well now as to the other knave there are trees and to spare over yonder but we have scarce leisure to make for them draw thy sword thomas of redbridge and hew me his head from his shoulders  a boon gracious sir a boon cried the condemned man  what then asked the bailiff  i will confess to my crime it was indeed i and the black cook both from the ship la rose de gloire of southampton who did set upon the flanders merchant and rob him of his spicery and his mercery for which as we well know you hold a warrant against us  there is little merit in this confession quoth the bailiff sternly thou hast done evil within my bailiwick and must die  but sir urged alleyne who was white to the lips at these bloody doings he hath not yet come to trial  young clerk said the bailiff you speak of that of which you know nothing it is true that he hath not come to trial but the trial hath come to him he hath fled the law and is beyond its pale touch not that which is no concern of thine but what is this boon rogue which you would crave  i have in my shoe most worshipful sir a strip of wood which belonged once to the bark wherein the blessed paul was dashed up against the island of melita i bought it for two rose nobles from a shipman who came from the levant the boon i crave is that you will place it in my hands and let me die still grasping it in this manner not only shall my own eternal salvation be secured but thine also for i shall never cease to intercede for thee  at the command of the bailiff they plucked off the fellows shoe and there sure enough at the side of the instep wrapped in a piece of fine sendall lay a long dark splinter of wood the archers doffed caps at the sight of it and the bailiff crossed himself devoutly as he handed it to the robber  if it should chance he said that through the surpassing merits of the blessed paul your sinstained soul should gain a way into paradise i trust that you will not forget that intercession which you have promised bear in mind too that it is herward the bailiff for whom you pray and not herward the sheriff who is my uncles son now thomas i pray you dispatch for we have a long ride before us and sun has already set  alleyne gazed upon the scenethe portly velvetclad official the knot of hardfaced archers with their hands to the bridles of their horses the thief with his arms trussed back and his doublet turned down upon his shoulders by the side of the track the old dame was standing fastening her red whimple once more round her head even as he looked one of the archers drew his sword with a sharp whirr of steel and stept up to the lost man the clerk hurried away in horror but ere he had gone many paces he heard a sudden sullen thump with a choking whistling sound at the end of it a minute later the bailiff and four of his men rode past him on their journey back to southampton the other two having been chosen as gravediggers as they passed alleyne saw that one of the men was wiping his swordblade upon the mane of his horse a deadly sickness came over him at the sight and sitting down by the wayside he burst out weeping with his nerves all in a jangle it was a terrible world thought he and it was hard to know which were the most to be dreaded the knaves or the men of the law    chapter v how a strange company gathered at the pied merlin   the night had already fallen and the moon was shining between the rifts of ragged drifting clouds before alleyne edricson footsore and weary from the unwonted exercise found himself in front of the forest inn which stood upon the outskirts of lyndhurst the building was long and low standing back a little from the road with two flambeaux blazing on either side of the door as a welcome to the traveller from one window there thrust forth a long pole with a bunch of greenery tied to the end of ita sign that liquor was to be sold within as alleyne walked up to it he perceived that it was rudely fashioned out of beams of wood with twinkling lights all over where the glow from within shone through the chinks the roof was poor and thatched but in strange contrast to it there ran all along under the eaves a line of wooden shields most gorgeously painted with chevron bend and saltire and every heraldic device by the door a horse stood tethered the ruddy glow beating strongly upon his brown head and patient eyes while his body stood back in the shadow  alleyne stood still in the roadway for a few minutes reflecting upon what he should do it was he knew only a few miles further to minstead where his brother dwelt on the other hand he had never seen this brother since childhood and the reports which had come to his ears concerning him were seldom to his advantage by all accounts he was a hard and a bitter man  it might be an evil start to come to his door so late and claim the shelter of his roof better to sleep here at this inn and then travel on to minstead in the morning if his brother would take him in well and good  he would bide with him for a time and do what he might to serve him if on the other hand he should have hardened his heart against him he could only go on his way and do the best he might by his skill as a craftsman and a scrivener at the end of a year he would be free to return to the cloisters for such had been his fathers bequest a monkish upbringing one year in the world after the age of twenty and then a free selection one way or the otherit was a strange course which had been marked out for him such as it was however he had no choice but to follow it and if he were to begin by making a friend of his brother he had best wait until morning before he knocked at his dwelling  the rude plank door was ajar but as alleyne approached it there came from within such a gust of rough laughter and clatter of tongues that he stood irresolute upon the threshold summoning courage however and reflecting that it was a public dwelling in which he had as much right as any other man he pushed it open and stepped into the common room  though it was an autumn evening and somewhat warm a huge fire of heaped billets of wood crackled and sparkled in a broad open grate some of the smoke escaping up a rude chimney but the greater part rolling out into the room so that the air was thick with it and a man coming from without could scarce catch his breath on this fire a great cauldron bubbled and simmered giving forth a rich and promising smell seated round it were a dozen or so folk of all ages and conditions who set up such a shout as alleyne entered that he stood peering at them through the smoke uncertain what this riotous greeting might portend  a rouse a rouse cried one rough looking fellow in a tattered jerkin one more round of mead or ale and the score to the last comer  tis the law of the pied merlin shouted another ho there dame eliza here is fresh custom come to the house and not a drain for the company  i will take your orders gentles i will assuredly take your orders the landlady answered bustling in with her hands full of leathern drinkingcups what is it that you drink then beer for the lads of the forest mead for the gleeman strong waters for the tinker and wine for the rest it is an old custom of the house young sir it has been the use at the pied merlin this many a year back that the company should drink to the health of the last comer is it your pleasure to humor it  why good dame said alleyne i would not offend the customs of your house but it is only sooth when i say that my purse is a thin one as far as two pence will go however i shall be right glad to do my part  plainly said and bravely spoken my suckling friar roared a deep voice and a heavy hand fell upon alleynes shoulder looking up he saw beside him his former cloister companion the renegade monk hordle john  by the thorn of glastonbury ill days are coming upon beaulieu said he here they have got rid in one day of the only two men within their wallsfor i have had mine eyes upon thee youngster and i know that for all thy babyface there is the making of a man in thee then there is the abbot too i am no friend of his nor he of mine but he has warm blood in his veins he is the only man left among them the others what are they  they are holy men alleyne answered gravely  holy men holy cabbages holy beanpods what do they do but live and suck in sustenance and grow fat if that be holiness i could show you hogs in this forest who are fit to head the calendar think you it was for such a life that this good arm was fixed upon my shoulder or that head placed upon your neck there is work in the world man and it is not by hiding behind stone walls that we shall do it  why then did you join the brothers asked alleyne  a fair enough question but it is as fairly answered i joined them because margery alspaye of bolder married crooked thomas of ringwood and left a certain john of hordle in the cold for that he was a ranting roving blade who was not to be trusted in wedlock that was why being fond and hotheaded i left the world and that is why having had time to take thought i am right glad to find myself back in it once more ill betide the day that ever i took off my yeomans jerkin to put on the white gown  whilst he was speaking the landlady came in again bearing a broad platter upon which stood all the beakers and flagons charged to the brim with the brown ale or the ruby wine behind her came a maid with a high pile of wooden plates and a great sheaf of spoons one of which she handed round to each of the travellers two of the company who were dressed in the weatherstained green doublet of foresters lifted the big pot off the fire and a third with a huge pewter ladle served out a portion of steaming collops to each guest alleyne bore his share and his alemug away with him to a retired trestle in the corner where he could sup in peace and watch the strange scene which was so different to those silent and wellordered meals to which he was accustomed  the room was not unlike a stable the low ceiling smokeblackened and dingy was pierced by several square trapdoors with roughhewn ladders leading up to them the walls of bare unpainted planks were studded here and there with great wooden pins placed at irregular intervals and heights from which hung overtunics wallets whips bridles and saddles over the fireplace were suspended six or seven shields of wood with coatsofarms rudely daubed upon them which showed by their varying degrees of smokiness and dirt that they had been placed there at different periods there was no furniture save a single long dresser covered with coarse crockery and a number of wooden benches and trestles the legs of which sank deeply into the soft clay floor while the only light save that of the fire was furnished by three torches stuck in sockets on the wall which flickered and crackled giving forth a strong resinous odor all this was novel and strange to the cloisterbred youth but most interesting of all was the motley circle of guests who sat eating their collops round the blaze they were a humble group of wayfarers such as might have been found that night in any inn through the length and breadth of england but to him they represented that vague world against which he had been so frequently and so earnestly warned it did not seem to him from what he could see of it to be such a very wicked place after all  three or four of the men round the fire were evidently underkeepers and verderers from the forest sunburned and bearded with the quick restless eye and lithe movements of the deer among which they lived close to the corner of the chimney sat a middleaged gleeman clad in a faded garb of norwich cloth the tunic of which was so outgrown that it did not fasten at the neck and at the waist his face was swollen and coarse and his watery protruding eyes spoke of a life which never wandered very far from the winepot a gilt harp blotched with many stains and with two of its strings missing was tucked under one of his arms while with the other he scooped greedily at his platter next to him sat two other men of about the same age one with a trimming of fur to his coat which gave him a dignity which was evidently dearer to him than his comfort for he still drew it round him in spite of the hot glare of the faggots the other clad in a dirty russet suit with a long sweeping doublet had a cunning foxy face with keen twinkling eyes and a peaky beard next to him sat hordle john and beside him three other rough unkempt fellows with tangled beards and matted hairfree laborers from the adjoining farms where small patches of freehold property had been suffered to remain scattered about in the heart of the royal demesne the company was completed by a peasant in a rude dress of undyed sheepskin with the oldfashioned galligaskins about his legs and a gayly dressed young man with striped cloak jagged at the edges and particolored hosen who looked about him with high disdain upon his face and held a blue smellingflask to his nose with one hand while he brandished a busy spoon with the other in the corner a very fat man was lying all asprawl upon a truss snoring stertorously and evidently in the last stage of drunkenness  that is wat the limner quoth the landlady sitting down beside alleyne and pointing with the ladle to the sleeping man that is he who paints the signs and the tokens alack and alas that ever i should have been fool enough to trust him now young man what manner of a bird would you suppose a pied merlin to bethat being the proper sign of my hostel  why said alleyne a merlin is a bird of the same form as an eagle or a falcon i can well remember that learned brother bartholomew who is deep in all the secrets of nature pointed one out to me as we walked together near vinney ridge  a falcon or an eagle quotha and pied that is of two several colors so any man would say except this barrel of lies he came to me look you saying that if i would furnish him with a gallon of ale wherewith to strengthen himself as he worked and also the pigments and a board he would paint for me a noble pied merlin which i might hang along with the blazonry over my door i poor simple fool gave him the ale and all that he craved leaving him alone too because he said that a mans mind must be left untroubled when he had great work to do when i came back the gallon jar was empty and he lay as you see him with the board in front of him with this sorry device she raised up a panel which was leaning against the wall and showed a rude painting of a scraggy and angular fowl with very long legs and a spotted body  was that she asked like the bird which thou hast seen  alleyne shook his head smiling  no nor any other bird that ever wagged a feather it is most like a plucked pullet which has died of the spotted fever and scarlet too what would the gentles sir nicholas boarhunte or sir bernard brocas of roche court say if they saw such a thingor perhaps even the kings own majesty himself who often has ridden past this way and who loves his falcons as he loves his sons it would be the downfall of my house  the matter is not past mending said alleyne i pray you good dame to give me those three pigmentpots and the brush and i shall try whether i cannot better this painting  dame eliza looked doubtfully at him as though fearing some other stratagem but as he made no demand for ale she finally brought the paints and watched him as he smeared on his background talking the while about the folk round the fire  the four forest lads must be jogging soon she said they bide at emery down a mile or more from here yeomen prickers they are who tend to the kings hunt the gleeman is called floyting will he comes from the north country but for many years he hath gone the round of the forest from southampton to christchurch he drinks much and pays little but it would make your ribs crackle to hear him sing the jest of hendy tobias mayhap he will sing it when the ale has warmed him  who are those next to him asked alleyne much interested he of the fur mantle has a wise and reverent face  he is a seller of pills and salves very learned in humors and rheums and fluxes and all manner of ailments he wears as you perceive the vernicle of sainted luke the first physician upon his sleeve may good st thomas of kent grant that it may be long before either i or mine need his help he is here tonight for herbergage as are the others except the foresters his neighbor is a toothdrawer that bag at his girdle is full of the teeth that he drew at winchester fair i warrant that there are more sound ones than sorry for he is quick at his work and a trifle dim in the eye the lusty man next him with the red head i have not seen before the four on this side are all workers three of them in the service of the bailiff of sir baldwin redvers and the other he with the sheepskin is as i hear a villein from the midlands who hath run from his master his year and day are wellnigh up when he will be a free man  and the other asked alleyne in a whisper he is surely some very great man for he looks as though he scorned those who were about him  the landlady looked at him in a motherly way and shook her head you have had no great truck with the world she said or you would have learned that it is the small men and not the great who hold their noses in the air look at those shields upon my wall and under my eaves each of them is the device of some noble lord or gallant knight who hath slept under my roof at one time or another yet milder men or easier to please i have never seen eating my bacon and drinking my wine with a merry face and paying my score with some courteous word or jest which was dearer to me than my profit those are the true gentles but your chapman or your bearward will swear that there is a lime in the wine and water in the ale and fling off at the last with a curse instead of a blessing this youth is a scholar from cambrig where men are wont to be blown out by a little knowledge and lose the use of their hands in learning the laws of the romans but i must away to lay down the beds so may the saints keep you and prosper you in your undertaking  thus left to himself alleyne drew his panel of wood where the light of one of the torches would strike full upon it and worked away with all the pleasure of the trained craftsman listening the while to the talk which went on round the fire the peasant in the sheepskins who had sat glum and silent all evening had been so heated by his flagon of ale that he was talking loudly and angrily with clenched hands and flashing eyes  sir humphrey tennant of ashby may till his own fields for me he cried the castle has thrown its shadow upon the cottage over long for three hundred years my folk have swinked and sweated day in and day out to keep the wine on the lords table and the harness on the lords back let him take off his plates and delve himself if delving must be done  a proper spirit my fair son said one of the free laborers i would that all men were of thy way of thinking  he would have sold me with his acres the other cried in a voice which was hoarse with passion the man the woman and their litterso ran the words of the dotard bailiff never a bullock on the farm was sold more lightly ha he may wake some black night to find the flames licking about his earsfor fire is a good friend to the poor man and i have seen a smoking heap of ashes where over night there stood just such another castlewick as ashby  this is a lad of mettle shouted another of the laborers he dares to give tongue to what all men think are we not all from adams loins all with flesh and blood and with the same mouth that must needs have food and drink where all this difference then between the ermine cloak and the leathern tunic if what they cover is the same  aye jenkin said another our foeman is under the stole and the vestment as much as under the helmet and plate of proof we have as much to fear from the tonsure as from the hauberk strike at the noble and the priest shrieks strike at priest and the noble lays his hand upon glaive they are twin thieves who live upon our labor  it would take a clever man to live upon thy labor hugh remarked one of the foresters seeing that the half of thy time is spent in swilling mead at the pied merlin  better that than stealing the deer that thou art placed to guard like some folk i know  if you dare open that swines mouth against me shouted the woodman ill crop your ears for you before the hangman has the doing of it thou longjawed lackbrain  nay gentles gentles cried dame eliza in a singsong heedless voice which showed that such bickerings were nightly things among her guests no brawling or brabbling gentles take heed to the good name of the house  besides if it comes to the cropping of ears there are other folk who may say their say quoth the third laborer we are all freemen and i trow that a yeomans cudgel is as good as a foresters knife by st anselm it would be an evil day if we had to bend to our masters servants as well as to our masters  no man is my master save the king the woodman answered who is there save a false traitor who would refuse to serve the english king  i know not about the english king said the man jenkin what sort of english king is it who cannot lay his tongue to a word of english you mind last year when he came down to malwood with his inner marshal and his outer marshal his justiciar his seneschal and his four and twenty guardsmen one noontide i was by franklin swintons gate when up he rides with a yeoman pricker at his heels ouvre he cried ouvre or some such word making signs for me to open the gate and then merci as though he were adrad of me and you talk of an english king  i do not marvel at it cried the cambrig scholar speaking in the high drawling voice which was common among his class it is not a tongue for men of sweet birth and delicate upbringing it is a foul snorting snarling manner of speech for myself i swear by the learned polycarp that i have most ease with hebrew and after that perchance with arabian  i will not hear a word said against old king ned cried hordle john in a voice like a bull what if he is fond of a bright eye and a saucy face i know one of his subjects who could match him at that if he cannot speak like an englishman i trow that he can fight like an englishman and he was hammering at the gates of paris while alehouse topers were grutching and grumbling at home  this loud speech coming from a man of so formidable an appearance somewhat daunted the disloyal party and they fell into a sullen silence which enabled alleyne to hear something of the talk which was going on in the further corner between the physician the toothdrawer and the gleeman  a raw rat the man of drugs was saying that is what it is ever my use to order for the plaguea raw rat with its paunch cut open  might it not be broiled most learned sir asked the toothdrawer a raw rat sounds a most sorry and cheerless dish  not to be eaten cried the physician in high disdain why should any man eat such a thing  why indeed asked the gleeman taking a long drain at his tankard  it is to be placed on the sore or swelling for the rat mark you being a foulliving creature hath a natural drawing or affinity for all foul things so that the noxious humors pass from the man into the unclean beast  would that cure the black death master asked jenkin  aye truly would it my fair son  then i am right glad that there were none who knew of it the black death is the best friend that ever the common folk had in england  how that then asked hordle john  why friend it is easy to see that you have not worked with your hands or you would not need to ask when half the folk in the country were dead it was then that the other half could pick and choose who they would work for and for what wage that is why i say that the murrain was the best friend that the borel folk ever had  true jenkin said another workman but it is not all good that is brought by it either we well know that through it cornland has been turned into pasture so that flocks of sheep with perchance a single shepherd wander now where once a hundred men had work and wage  there is no great harm in that remarked the toothdrawer for the sheep give many folk their living there is not only the herd but the shearer and brander and then the dresser the curer the dyer the fuller the webster the merchant and a score of others  if it come to that said one of the foresters the tough meat of them will wear folks teeth out and there is a trade for the man who can draw them  a general laugh followed this sally at the dentists expense in the midst of which the gleeman placed his battered harp upon his knee and began to pick out a melody upon the frayed strings  elbow room for floyting will cried the woodmen twang us a merry lilt  aye aye the lasses of lancaster one suggested  or st simeon and the devil  or the jest of hendy tobias  to all these suggestions the jongleur made no response but sat with his eye fixed abstractedly upon the ceiling as one who calls words to his mind then with a sudden sweep across the strings he broke out into a song so gross and so foul that ere he had finished a verse the pureminded lad sprang to his feet with the blood tingling in his face  how can you sing such things he cried you too an old man who should be an example to others  the wayfarers all gazed in the utmost astonishment at the interruption  by the holy dicon of hampole our silent clerk has found his tongue said one of the woodmen what is amiss with the song then how has it offended your babyship  a milder and better mannered song hath never been heard within these walls cried another what sort of talk is this for a public inn  shall it be a litany my good clerk shouted a third or would a hymn be good enough to serve  the jongleur had put down his harp in high dudgeon am i to be preached to by a child he cried staring across at alleyne with an inflamed and angry countenance is a hairless infant to raise his tongue against me when i have sung in every fair from tweed to trent and have twice been named aloud by the high court of the minstrels at beverley i shall sing no more tonight  nay but you will so said one of the laborers hi dame eliza bring a stoup of your best to will to clear his throat go forward with thy song and if our girlfaced clerk does not love it he can take to the road and go whence he came  nay but not too last broke in hordle john there are two words in this matter it may be that my little comrade has been over quick in reproof he having gone early into the cloisters and seen little of the rough ways and words of the world yet there is truth in what he says for as you know well the song was not of the cleanest i shall stand by him therefore and he shall neither be put out on the road nor shall his ears be offended indoors  indeed your high and mighty grace sneered one of the yeomen have you in sooth so ordained  by the virgin said a second i think that you may both chance to find yourselves upon the road before long  and so belabored as to be scarce able to crawl along it cried a third  nay i shall go i shall go said alleyne hurriedly as hordle john began to slowly roll up his sleeve and bare an arm like a leg of mutton i would not have you brawl about me  hush lad he whispered i count them not a fly they may find they have more tow on their distaff than they know how to spin stand thou clear and give me space  both the foresters and the laborers had risen from their bench and dame eliza and the travelling doctor had flung themselves between the two parties with soft words and soothing gestures when the door of the pied merlin was flung violently open and the attention of the company was drawn from their own quarrel to the newcomer who had burst so unceremoniously upon them    chapter vi how samkin aylward wagered his featherbed   he was a middlesized man of most massive and robust build with an arching chest and extraordinary breadth of shoulder his shaven face was as brown as a hazelnut tanned and dried by the weather with harsh wellmarked features which were not improved by a long white scar which stretched from the corner of his left nostril to the angle of the jaw his eyes were bright and searching with something of menace and of authority in their quick glitter and his mouth was firmset and hard as befitted one who was wont to set his face against danger a straight sword by his side and a painted longbow jutting over his shoulder proclaimed his profession while his scarred brigandine of chainmail and his dinted steel cap showed that he was no holiday soldier but one who was even now fresh from the wars a white surcoat with the lion of st george in red upon the centre covered his broad breast while a sprig of newplucked broom at the side of his headgear gave a touch of gayety and grace to his grim warworn equipment  ha he cried blinking like an owl in the sudden glare good even to you comrades hola a woman by my soul and in an instant he had clipped dame eliza round the waist and was kissing her violently his eye happening to wander upon the maid however he instantly abandoned the mistress and danced off after the other who scurried in confusion up one of the ladders and dropped the heavy trapdoor upon her pursuer he then turned back and saluted the landlady once more with the utmost relish and satisfaction  la petite is frightened said he ah cest lamour lamour curse this trick of french which will stick to my throat i must wash it out with some good english ale by my hilt camarades there is no drop of french blood in my body and i am a true english bowman samkin aylward by name and i tell you mes amis that it warms my very heartroots to set my feet on the dear old land once more when i came off the galley at hythe this very day i down on my bones and i kissed the good brown earth as i kiss thee now ma belle for it was eight long years since i had seen it the very smell of it seemed life to me but where are my six rascals hola there en avant  at the order six men dressed as common drudges marched solemnly into the room each bearing a huge bundle upon his head they formed in military line while the soldier stood in front of them with stern eyes checking off their several packages  number onea french featherbed with the two counterpanes of white sendall said he  here worthy sir answered the first of the bearers laying a great package down in the corner  number twoseven ells of red turkey cloth and nine ells of cloth of gold put it down by the other good dame i prythee give each of these men a bottrine of wine or a jack of ale threea full piece of white genoan velvet with twelve ells of purple silk thou rascal there is dirt on the hem thou hast brushed it against some wall coquin  not i most worthy sir cried the carrier shrinking away from the fierce eyes of the bowman  i say yes dog by the three kings i have seen a man gasp out his last breath for less had you gone through the pain and unease that i have done to earn these things you would be at more care i swear by my ten fingerbones that there is not one of them that hath not cost its weight in french blood fouran incenseboat a ewer of silver a gold buckle and a cope worked in pearls i found them camarades at the church of st denis in the harrying of narbonne and i took them away with me lest they fall into the hands of the wicked fivea cloak of fur turned up with minever a gold goblet with stand and cover and a box of rosecolored sugar see that you lay them together sixa box of monies three pounds of limousine goldwork a pair of boots silver tagged and lastly a store of naping linen so the tally is complete here is a groat apiece and you may go  go whither worthy sir asked one of the carriers  whither to the devil if ye will what is it to me now ma belle to supper a pair of cold capons a mortress of brawn or what you will with a flask or two of the right gascony i have crowns in my pouch my sweet and i mean to spend them bring in wine while the food is dressing buvons my brave lads you shall each empty a stoup with me  here was an offer which the company in an english inn at that or any other date are slow to refuse the flagons were regathered and came back with the white foam dripping over their edges two of the woodmen and three of the laborers drank their portions off hurriedly and trooped off together for their homes were distant and the hour late the others however drew closer leaving the place of honor to the right of the gleeman to the freehanded newcomer he had thrown off his steel cap and his brigandine and had placed them with his sword his quiver and his painted longbow on the top of his varied heap of plunder in the corner now with his thick and somewhat bowed legs stretched in front of the blaze his green jerkin thrown open and a great quart pot held in his corded fist he looked the picture of comfort and of goodfellowship his hardset face had softened and the thick crop of crisp brown curls which had been hidden by his helmet grew low upon his massive neck he might have been forty years of age though hard toil and harder pleasure had left their grim marks upon his features alleyne had ceased painting his pied merlin and sat brush in hand staring with open eyes at a type of man so strange and so unlike any whom he had met men had been good or had been bad in his catalogue but here was a man who was fierce one instant and gentle the next with a curse on his lips and a smile in his eye what was to be made of such a man as that  it chanced that the soldier looked up and saw the questioning glance which the young clerk threw upon him he raised his flagon and drank to him with a merry flash of his white teeth  a toi mon garcon he cried hast surely never seen a manatarms that thou shouldst stare so  i never have said alleyne frankly though i have oft heard talk of their deeds  by my hilt cried the other if you were to cross the narrow sea you would find them as thick as bees at a teehole couldst not shoot a bolt down any street of bordeaux i warrant but you would pink archer squire or knight there are more breastplates than gaberdines to be seen i promise you  and where got you all these pretty things asked hordle john pointing at the heap in the corner  where there is as much more waiting for any brave lad to pick it up where a good man can always earn a good wage and where he need look upon no man as his paymaster but just reach his hand out and help himself aye it is a goodly and a proper life and here i drink to mine old comrades and the saints be with them arouse all together me enfants under pain of my displeasure to sir claude latour and the white company  sir claude latour and the white company shouted the travellers draining off their goblets  well quaffed mes braves it is for me to fill your cups again since you have drained them to my dear lads of the white jerkin hola mon ange bring wine and ale how runs the old stave          well drink all together         to the gray goose feather         and the land where the gray goose flew  he roared out the catch in a harsh unmusical voice and ended with a shout of laughter i trust that i am a better bowman than a minstrel said he  methinks i have some remembrance of the lilt remarked the gleeman running his fingers over the strings hoping that it will give thee no offence most holy sirwith a vicious snap at alleyneand with the kind permit of the company i will even venture upon it  many a time in the after days alleyne edricson seemed to see that scene for all that so many which were stranger and more stirring were soon to crowd upon him the fat redfaced gleeman the listening group the archer with upraised finger beating in time to the music and the huge sprawling figure of hordle john all thrown into red light and black shadow by the flickering fire in the centrememory was to come often lovingly back to it at the time he was lost in admiration at the deft way in which the jongleur disguised the loss of his two missing strings and the lusty hearty fashion in which he trolled out his little ballad of the outland bowmen which ran in some such fashion as this            what of the bow             the bow was made in england         of true wood of yew wood           the wood of english bows             so men who are free             love the old yew tree         and the land where the yew tree grows            what of the cord             the cord was made in england         a rough cord a tough cord           a cord that bowmen love             so well drain our jacks             to the english flax         and the land where the hemp was wove            what of the shaft             the shaft was cut in england         a long shaft a strong shaft           barbed and trim and true             so well drink all together             to the gray goose feather         and the land where the gray goose flew            what of the men             the men were bred in england         the bowmanthe yeoman           the lads of dale and fell             heres to youand to you             to the hearts that are true         and the land where the true hearts dwell  well sung by my hilt shouted the archer in high delight many a night have i heard that song both in the old wartime and after in the days of the white company when black simon of norwich would lead the stave and four hundred of the best bowmen that ever drew string would come roaring in upon the chorus i have seen old john hawkwood the same who has led half the company into italy stand laughing in his beard as he heard it until his plates rattled again but to get the full smack of it ye must yourselves be english bowmen and be far off upon an outland soil  whilst the song had been singing dame eliza and the maid had placed a board across two trestles and had laid upon it the knife the spoon the salt the tranchoir of bread and finally the smoking dish which held the savory supper the archer settled himself to it like one who had known what it was to find good food scarce but his tongue still went as merrily as his teeth  it passes me he cried how all you lusty fellows can bide scratching your backs at home when there are such doings over the seas look at mewhat have i to do it is but the eye to the cord the cord to the shaft and the shaft to the mark there is the whole song of it it is but what you do yourselves for pleasure upon a sunday evening at the parish village butts  and the wage asked a laborer  you see what the wage brings he answered i eat of the best and i drink deep i treat my friend and i ask no friend to treat me i clap a silk gown on my girls back never a knights lady shall be better betrimmed and betrinketed how of all that mon garcon and how of the heap of trifles that you can see for yourselves in yonder corner they are from the south french every one upon whom i have been making war by my hilt camarades i think that i may let my plunder speak for itself  it seems indeed to be a goodly service said the toothdrawer  tete bleu yes indeed then there is the chance of a ransom why look you in the affair at brignais some four years back when the companies slew james of bourbon and put his army to the sword there was scarce a man of ours who had not count baron or knight peter karsdale who was but a common country lout newly brought over with the english fleas still hopping under his doublet laid his great hands upon the sieur amaury de chatonville who owns half picardy and had five thousand crowns out of him with his horse and harness tis true that a french wench took it all off peter as quick as the frenchman paid it but what then by the twang of string it would be a bad thing if money was not made to be spent and how better than on womaneh ma belle  it would indeed be a bad thing if we had not our brave archers to bring wealth and kindly customs into the country quoth dame eliza on whom the soldiers free and open ways had made a deep impression  a toi ma cherie said he with his hand over his heart hola there is la petite peeping from behind the door a toi aussi ma petite mon dieu but the lass has a good color  there is one thing fair sir said the cambridge student in his piping voice which i would fain that you would make more clear as i understand it there was peace made at the town of bretigny some six years back between our most gracious monarch and the king of the french this being so it seems most passing strange that you should talk so loudly of war and of companies when there is no quarrel between the french and us  meaning that i lie said the archer laying down his knife  may heaven forfend cried the student hastily magna est veritas sed rara which means in the latin tongue that archers are all honorable men i come to you seeking knowledge for it is my trade to learn  i fear that you are yet a prentice to that trade quoth the soldier for there is no child over the water but could answer what you ask know then that though there may be peace between our own provinces and the french yet within the marches of france there is always war for the country is much divided against itself and is furthermore harried by bands of flayers skinners brabacons tardvenus and the rest of them when every mans grip is on his neighbors throat and every fivesouspiece of a baron is marching with tuck of drum to fight whom he will it would be a strange thing if five hundred brave english boys could not pick up a living now that sir john hawkwood hath gone with the east anglian lads and the nottingham woodmen into the service of the marquis of montferrat to fight against the lord of milan there are but ten score of us left yet i trust that i may be able to bring some back with me to fill the ranks of the white company by the tooth of peter it would be a bad thing if i could not muster many a hamptonshire man who would be ready to strike in under the red flag of st george and the more so if sir nigel loring of christchurch should don hauberk once more and take the lead of us  ah you would indeed be in luck then quoth a woodman for it is said that setting aside the prince and mayhap good old sir john chandos there was not in the whole army a man of such tried courage  it is sooth every word of it the archer answered i have seen him with these two eyes in a stricken field and never did man carry himself better mon dieu yes ye would not credit it to look at him or to hearken to his soft voice but from the sailing from orwell down to the foray to paris and that is clear twenty years there was not a skirmish onfall sally bushment escalado or battle but sir nigel was in the heart of it i go now to christchurch with a letter to him from sir claude latour to ask him if he will take the place of sir john hawkwood and there is the more chance that he will if i bring one or two likely men at my heels what say you woodman wilt leave the bucks to loose a shaft at a nobler mark  the forester shook his head i have wife and child at emery down quoth he i would not leave them for such a venture  you then young sir asked the archer  nay i am a man of peace said alleyne edricson besides i have other work to do  peste growled the soldier striking his flagon on the board until the dishes danced again what in the name of the devil hath come over the folk why sit ye all moping by the fireside like crows round a dead horse when there is mans work to be done within a few short leagues of ye out upon you all as a set of laggards and hangbacks by my hilt i believe that the men of england are all in france already and that what is left behind are in sooth the women dressed up in their paltocks and hosen  archer quoth hordle john you have lied more than once and more than twice for which and also because i see much in you to dislike i am sorely tempted to lay you upon your back  by my hilt then i have found a man at last shouted the bowman and fore god you are a better man than i take you for if you can lay me on my back mon garcon i have won the ram more times than there are toes to my feet and for seven long years i have found no man in the company who could make my jerkin dusty  we have had enough bobance and boasting said hordle john rising and throwing off his doublet i will show you that there are better men left in england than ever went thieving to france  pasques dieu cried the archer loosening his jerkin and eyeing his foeman over with the keen glance of one who is a judge of manhood i have only once before seen such a body of a man by your leave my redheaded friend i should be right sorry to exchange buffets with you and i will allow that there is no man in the company who would pull against you on a rope so let that be a salve to your pride on the other hand i should judge that you have led a life of ease for some months back and that my muscle is harder than your own i am ready to wager upon myself against you if you are not afeard  afeard thou lurden growled big john i never saw the face yet of the man that i was afeard of come out and we shall see who is the better man  but the wager  i have nought to wager come out for the love and the lust of the thing  nought to wager cried the soldier why you have that which i covet above all things it is that big body of thine that i am after see now mon garcon i have a french featherbed there which i have been at pains to keep these years back i had it at the sacking of issodun and the king himself hath not such a bed if you throw me it is thine but if i throw you then you are under a vow to take bow and bill and hie with me to france there to serve in the white company as long as we be enrolled  a fair wager cried all the travellers moving back their benches and trestles so as to give fair field for the wrestlers  then you may bid farewell to your bed soldier said hordle john  nay i shall keep the bed and i shall have you to france in spite of your teeth and you shall live to thank me for it how shall it be then mon enfant collar and elbow or closelock or catch how you can  to the devil with your tricks said john opening and shutting his great red hands stand forth and let me clip thee  shalt clip me as best you can then quoth the archer moving out into the open space and keeping a most wary eye upon his opponent he had thrown off his green jerkin and his chest was covered only by a pink silk jupon or undershirt cut low in the neck and sleeveless hordle john was stripped from his waist upwards and his huge body with his great muscles swelling out like the gnarled roots of an oak towered high above the soldier the other however though near a foot shorter was a man of great strength and there was a gloss upon his white skin which was wanting in the heavier limbs of the renegade monk he was quick on his feet too and skilled at the game so that it was clear from the poise of head and shine of eye that he counted the chances to be in his favor it would have been hard that night through the whole length of england to set up a finer pair in face of each other  big john stood waiting in the centre with a sullen menacing eye and his red hair in a bristle while the archer paced lightly and swiftly to the right and the left with crooked knee and hands advanced then with a sudden dash so swift and fierce that the eye could scarce follow it he flew in upon his man and locked his leg round him it was a grip that between men of equal strength would mean a fall but hordle john tore him off from him as he might a rat and hurled him across the room so that his head cracked up against the wooden wall  ma foi cried the bowman passing his fingers through his curls you were not far from the featherbed then mon gar a little more and this good hostel would have a new window  nothing daunted he approached his man once more but this time with more caution than before with a quick feint he threw the other off his guard and then bounding upon him threw his legs round his waist and his arms round his bullneck in the hope of bearing him to the ground with the sudden shock with a bellow of rage hordle john squeezed him limp in his huge arms and then picking him up cast him down upon the floor with a force which might well have splintered a bone or two had not the archer with the most perfect coolness clung to the others forearms to break his fall as it was he dropped upon his feet and kept his balance though it sent a jar through his frame which set every joint acreaking he bounded back from his perilous foeman but the other heated by the bout rushed madly after him and so gave the practised wrestler the very vantage for which he had planned as big john flung himself upon him the archer ducked under the great red hands that clutched for him and catching his man round the thighs hurled him over his shoulderhelped as much by his own mad rush as by the trained strength of the heave to alleynes eye it was as if john had taken unto himself wings and flown as he hurtled through the air with giant limbs revolving the lads heart was in his mouth for surely no man ever yet had such a fall and came scathless out of it in truth hardy as the man was his neck had been assuredly broken had he not pitched head first on the very midriff of the drunken artist who was slumbering so peacefully in the corner all unaware of these stirring doings the luckless limner thus suddenly brought out from his dreams sat up with a piercing yell while hordle john bounded back into the circle almost as rapidly as he had left it  one more fall by all the saints he cried throwing out his arms  not i quoth the archer pulling on his clothes i have come well out of the business i would sooner wrestle with the great bear of navarre  it was a trick cried john  aye was it by my ten fingerbones it is a trick that will add a proper man to the ranks of the company  oh for that said the other i count it not a fly for i had promised myself a good hour ago that i should go with thee since the life seems to be a goodly and proper one yet i would fain have had the featherbed  i doubt it not mon ami quoth the archer going back to his tankard here is to thee lad and may we be good comrades to each other but hola what is it that ails our friend of the wrathful face  the unfortunate limner had been sitting up rubbing himself ruefully and staring about with a vacant gaze which showed that he knew neither where he was nor what had occurred to him suddenly however a flash of intelligence had come over his sodden features and he rose and staggered for the door ware the ale he said in a hoarse whisper shaking a warning finger at the company oh holy virgin ware the ale and slapping his hands to his injury he flitted off into the darkness amid a shout of laughter in which the vanquished joined as merrily as the victor the remaining forester and the two laborers were also ready for the road and the rest of the company turned to the blankets which dame eliza and the maid had laid out for them upon the floor alleyne weary with the unwonted excitements of the day was soon in a deep slumber broken only by fleeting visions of twittering legs cursing beggars black robbers and the many strange folk whom he had met at the pied merlin    chapter vii how the three comrades journeyed through the woodlands   at early dawn the country inn was all alive for it was rare indeed that an hour of daylight would be wasted at a time when lighting was so scarce and dear indeed early as it was when dame eliza began to stir it seemed that others could be earlier still for the door was ajar and the learned student of cambridge had taken himself off with a mind which was too intent upon the high things of antiquity to stoop to consider the fourpence which he owed for bed and board it was the shrill outcry of the landlady when she found her loss and the clucking of the hens which had streamed in through the open door that first broke in upon the slumbers of the tired wayfarers  once afoot it was not long before the company began to disperse a sleek mule with red trappings was brought round from some neighboring shed for the physician and he ambled away with much dignity upon his road to southampton the toothdrawer and the gleeman called for a cup of small ale apiece and started off together for ringwood fair the old jongleur looking very yellow in the eye and swollen in the face after his overnight potations the archer however who had drunk more than any man in the room was as merry as a grig and having kissed the matron and chased the maid up the ladder once more he went out to the brook and came back with the water dripping from his face and hair  hola my man of peace he cried to alleyne whither are you bent this morning  to minstead quoth he my brother simon edricson is socman there and i go to bide with him for a while i prythee let me have my score good dame  score indeed cried she standing with upraised hands in front of the panel on which alleyne had worked the night before say rather what it is that i owe to thee good youth aye this is indeed a pied merlin and with a leveret under its claws as i am a living woman by the rood of waltham but thy touch is deft and dainty  and see the red eye of it cried the maid  aye and the open beak  and the ruffled wing added hordle john  by my hilt cried the archer it is the very bird itself  the young clerk flushed with pleasure at this chorus of praise rude and indiscriminate indeed and yet so much heartier and less grudging than any which he had ever heard from the critical brother jerome or the shortspoken abbot there was it would seem great kindness as well as great wickedness in this world of which he had heard so little that was good his hostess would hear nothing of his paying either for bed or for board while the archer and hordle john placed a hand upon either shoulder and led him off to the board where some smoking fish a dish of spinach and a jug of milk were laid out for their breakfast  i should not be surprised to learn mon camarade said the soldier as he heaped a slice of fish upon alleynes tranchoir of bread that you could read written things since you are so ready with your brushes and pigments  it would be shame to the good brothers of beaulieu if i could not he answered seeing that i have been their clerk this ten years back  the bowman looked at him with great respect think of that said he and you with not a hair to your face and a skin like a girl i can shoot three hundred and fifty paces with my little popper there and four hundred and twenty with the great warbow yet i can make nothing of this nor read my own name if you were to set sam aylward up against me in the whole company there was only one man who could read and he fell down a well at the taking of ventadour which proves what the thing is not suited to a soldier though most needful to a clerk  i can make some show at it said big john though i was scarce long enough among the monks to catch the whole trick of it  here then is something to try upon quoth the archer pulling a square of parchment from the inside of his tunic it was tied securely with a broad band of purple silk and firmly sealed at either end with a large red seal john pored long and earnestly over the inscription upon the back with his brows bent as one who bears up against great mental strain  not having read much of late he said i am loth to say too much about what this may be some might say one thing and some another just as one bowman loves the yew and a second will not shoot save with the ash to me by the length and the look of it i should judge this to be a verse from one of the psalms  the bowman shook his head it is scarce likely he said that sir claude latour should send me all the way across seas with nought more weighty than a psalmverse you have clean overshot the butts this time mon camarade give it to the little one i will wager my featherbed that he makes more sense of it  why it is written in the french tongue said alleyne and in a right clerkly hand this is how it runs a le moult puissant et moult honorable chevalier sir nigel loring de christchurch de son tres fidele ami sir claude latour capitaine de la compagnie blanche chatelain de biscar grand seigneur de montchateau vavaseur de le renomme gaston comte de foix tenant les droits de la haute justice de la milieu et de la basse which signifies in our speech to the very powerful and very honorable knight sir nigel loring of christchurch from his very faithful friend sir claude latour captain of the white company chatelain of biscar grand lord of montchateau and vassal to the renowned gaston count of foix who holds the rights of the high justice the middle and the low  look at that now cried the bowman in triumph that is just what he would have said  i can see now that it is even so said john examining the parchment again though i scarce understand this high middle and low  by my hilt you would understand it if you were jacques bonhomme the low justice means that you may fleece him and the middle that you may torture him and the high that you may slay him that is about the truth of it but this is the letter which i am to take and since the platter is clean it is time that we trussed up and were afoot you come with me mon gros jean and as to you little one where did you say that you journeyed  to minstead  ah yes i know this forest country well though i was born myself in the hundred of easebourne in the rape of chichester hard by the village of midhurst yet i have not a word to say against the hampton men for there are no better comrades or truer archers in the whole company than some who learned to loose the string in these very parts we shall travel round with you to minstead lad seeing that it is little out of our way  i am ready said alleyne right pleased at the thought of such company upon the road  so am not i i must store my plunder at this inn since the hostess is an honest woman hola ma cherie i wish to leave with you my goldwork my velvet my silk my feather bed my incenseboat my ewer my naping linen and all the rest of it i take only the money in a linen bag and the box of rose colored sugar which is a gift from my captain to the lady loring wilt guard my treasure for me  it shall be put in the safest loft good archer come when you may you shall find it ready for you  now there is a true friend cried the bowman taking her hand there is a bonne amie english land and english women say i and french wine and french plunder i shall be back anon mon ange i am a lonely man my sweeting and i must settle some day when the wars are over and done mayhap you and iah mechante mechante there is la petite peeping from behind the door now john the sun is over the trees you must be brisker than this when the bugleman blows bows and bills  i have been waiting this time back said hordle john gruffly  then we must be off adieu ma vie the two livres shall settle the score and buy some ribbons against the next kermesse do not forget sam aylward for his heart shall ever be thine aloneand thine ma petite so marchons and may st julian grant us as good quarters elsewhere  the sun had risen over ashurst and denny woods and was shining brightly though the eastern wind had a sharp flavor to it and the leaves were flickering thickly from the trees in the high street of lyndhurst the wayfarers had to pick their way for the little town was crowded with the guardsmen grooms and yeomen prickers who were attached to the kings hunt the king himself was staying at castle malwood but several of his suite had been compelled to seek such quarters as they might find in the wooden or wattleanddaub cottages of the village here and there a small escutcheon peeping from a glassless window marked the nights lodging of knight or baron these coatsofarms could be read where a scroll would be meaningless and the bowman like most men of his age was well versed in the common symbols of heraldry  there is the saracens head of sir bernard brocas quoth he i saw him last at the ruffle at poictiers some ten years back when he bore himself like a man he is the master of the kings horse and can sing a right jovial stave though in that he cannot come nigh to sir john chandos who is first at the board or in the saddle three martlets on a field azure that must be one of the luttrells by the crescent upon it it should be the second son of old sir hugh who had a bolt through his ankle at the intaking of romorantin he having rushed into the fray ere his squire had time to clasp his solleret to his greave there too is the hackle which is the old device of the de brays i have served under sir thomas de bray who was as jolly as a pie and a lusty swordsman until he got too fat for his harness  so the archer gossiped as the three wayfarers threaded their way among the stamping horses the busy grooms and the knots of pages and squires who disputed over the merits of their masters horses and deerhounds as they passed the old church which stood upon a mound at the lefthand side of the village street the door was flung open and a stream of worshippers wound down the sloping path coming from the morning mass all chattering like a cloud of jays alleyne bent knee and doffed hat at the sight of the open door but ere he had finished an ave his comrades were out of sight round the curve of the path and he had to run to overtake them  what he said not one word of prayer before gods own open house how can ye hope for his blessing upon the day  my friend said hordle john i have prayed so much during the last two months not only during the day but at matins lauds and the like when i could scarce keep my head upon my shoulders for nodding that i feel that i have somewhat overprayed myself  how can a man have too much religion cried alleyne earnestly it is the one thing that availeth a man is but a beast as he lives from day to day eating and drinking breathing and sleeping it is only when he raises himself and concerns himself with the immortal spirit within him that he becomes in very truth a man bethink ye how sad a thing it would be that the blood of the redeemer should be spilled to no purpose  bless the lad if he doth not blush like any girl and yet preach like the whole college of cardinals cried the archer  in truth i blush that any one so weak and so unworthy as i should try to teach another that which he finds it so passing hard to follow himself  prettily said mon garcon touching that same slaying of the redeemer it was a bad business a good padre in france read to us from a scroll the whole truth of the matter the soldiers came upon him in the garden in truth these apostles of his may have been holy men but they were of no great account as menatarms there was one indeed sir peter who smote out like a true man but unless he is belied he did but clip a varlets ear which was no very knightly deed by these ten fingerbones had i been there with black simon of norwich and but one score picked men of the company we had held them in play could we do no more we had at least filled the false knight sir judas so full of english arrows that he would curse the day that ever he came on such an errand  the young clerk smiled at his companions earnestness had he wished help he said he could have summoned legions of archangels from heaven so what need had he of your poor bow and arrow besides bethink you of his own wordsthat those who live by the sword shall perish by the sword  and how could man die better asked the archer if i had my wish it would be to fall sonot mark you in any mere skirmish of the company but in a stricken field with the great lion banner waving over us and the red oriflamme in front amid the shouting of my fellows and the twanging of the strings but let it be sword lance or bolt that strikes me down for i should think it shame to die from an iron ball from the firecrake or bombard or any such unsoldierly weapon which is only fitted to scare babes with its foolish noise and smoke  i have heard much even in the quiet cloisters of these new and dreadful engines quoth alleyne it is said though i can scarce bring myself to believe it that they will send a ball twice as far as a bowman can shoot his shaft and with such force as to break through armor of proof  true enough my lad but while the armorer is thrusting in his devilsdust and dropping his ball and lighting his flambeau i can very easily loose six shafts or eight maybe so he hath no great vantage after all yet i will not deny that at the intaking of a town it is well to have good store of bombards i am told that at calais they made dints in the wall that a man might put his head into but surely comrades some one who is grievously hurt hath passed along this road before us  all along the woodland track there did indeed run a scattered straggling trail of bloodmarks sometimes in single drops and in other places in broad ruddy gouts smudged over the dead leaves or crimsoning the white flint stones  it must be a stricken deer said john  nay i am woodman enough to see that no deer hath passed this way this morning and yet the blood is fresh but hark to the sound  they stood listening all three with sidelong heads through the silence of the great forest there came a swishing whistling sound mingled with the most dolorous groans and the voice of a man raised in a high quavering kind of song the comrades hurried onwards eagerly and topping the brow of a small rising they saw upon the other side the source from which these strange noises arose  a tall man much stooped in the shoulders was walking slowly with bended head and clasped hands in the centre of the path he was dressed from head to foot in a long white linen cloth and a high white cap with a red cross printed upon it his gown was turned back from his shoulders and the flesh there was a sight to make a man wince for it was all beaten to a pulp and the blood was soaking into his gown and trickling down upon the ground behind him walked a smaller man with his hair touched with gray who was clad in the same white garb he intoned a long whining rhyme in the french tongue and at the end of every line he raised a thick cord all jagged with pellets of lead and smote his companion across the shoulders until the blood spurted again even as the three wayfarers stared however there was a sudden change for the smaller man having finished his song loosened his own gown and handed the scourge to the other who took up the stave once more and lashed his companion with all the strength of his bare and sinewy arm so alternately beating and beaten they made their dolorous way through the beautiful woods and under the amber arches of the fading beechtrees where the calm strength and majesty of nature might serve to rebuke the foolish energies and misspent strivings of mankind  such a spectacle was new to hordle john or to alleyne edricson but the archer treated it lightly as a common matter enough  these are the beating friars otherwise called the flagellants quoth he i marvel that ye should have come upon none of them before for across the water they are as common as gallybaggers i have heard that there are no english among them but that they are from france italy and bohemia en avant camarades that we may have speech with them  as they came up to them alleyne could hear the doleful dirge which the beater was chanting bringing down his heavy whip at the end of each line while the groans of the sufferer formed a sort of dismal chorus it was in old french and ran somewhat in this way          or avant entre nous tous freres         battons nos charognes bien fort         en remembrant la grant misere         de dieu et sa piteuse mort         qui fut pris en la gent amere         et vendus et trais a tort         et bastu sa chair vierge et dere         au nom de ce battons plus fort  then at the end of the verse the scourge changed hands and the chanting began anew  truly holy fathers said the archer in french as they came abreast of them you have beaten enough for today the road is all spotted like a shambles at martinmas why should ye mishandle yourselves thus  cest pour vos pechespour vos peches they droned looking at the travellers with sad lacklustre eyes and then bent to their bloody work once more without heed to the prayers and persuasions which were addressed to them finding all remonstrance useless the three comrades hastened on their way leaving these strange travellers to their dreary task  mort dieu cried the bowman there is a bucketful or more of my blood over in france but it was all spilled in hot fight and i should think twice before i drew it drop by drop as these friars are doing by my hilt our young one here is as white as a picardy cheese what is amiss then mon cher  it is nothing alleyne answered my life has been too quiet i am not used to such sights  ma foi the other cried i have never yet seen a man who was so stout of speech and yet so weak of heart  not so friend quoth big john it is not weakness of heart for i know the lad well his heart is as good as thine or mine but he hath more in his pate than ever you will carry under that tin pot of thine and as a consequence he can see farther into things so that they weigh upon him more  surely to any man it is a sad sight said alleyne to see these holy men who have done no sin themselves suffering so for the sins of others saints are they if in this age any may merit so high a name  i count them not a fly cried hordle john for who is the better for all their whipping and yowling they are like other friars i trow when all is done let them leave their backs alone and beat the pride out of their hearts  by the three kings there is sooth in what you say remarked the archer besides methinks if i were le bon dieu it would bring me little joy to see a poor devil cutting the flesh off his bones and i should think that he had but a small opinion of me that he should hope to please me by such provostmarshal work no by my hilt i should look with a more loving eye upon a jolly archer who never harmed a fallen foe and never feared a hale one  doubtless you mean no sin said alleyne if your words are wild it is not for me to judge them can you not see that there are other foes in this world besides frenchmen and as much glory to be gained in conquering them would it not be a proud day for knight or squire if he could overthrow seven adversaries in the lists yet here are we in the lists of life and there come the seven black champions against us sir pride sir covetousness sir lust sir anger sir gluttony sir envy and sir sloth let a man lay those seven low and he shall have the prize of the day from the hands of the fairest queen of beauty even from the virginmother herself it is for this that these men mortify their flesh and to set us an example who would pamper ourselves overmuch i say again that they are gods own saints and i bow my head to them  and so you shall mon petit replied the archer i have not heard a man speak better since old dom bertrand died who was at one time chaplain to the white company he was a very valiant man but at the battle of brignais he was spitted through the body by a hainault manatarms for this we had an excommunication read against the man when next we saw our holy father at avignon but as we had not his name and knew nothing of him save that he rode a dapplegray roussin i have feared sometimes that the blight may have settled upon the wrong man  your company has been then to bow knee before our holy father the pope urban the prop and centre of christendom asked alleyne much interested perchance you have yourself set eyes upon his august face  twice i saw him said the archer he was a lean little rat of a man with a scab on his chin the first time we had five thousand crowns out of him though he made much ado about it the second time we asked ten thousand but it was three days before we could come to terms and i am of opinion myself that we might have done better by plundering the palace his chamberlain and cardinals came forth as i remember to ask whether we would take seven thousand crowns with his blessing and a plenary absolution or the ten thousand with his solemn ban by bell book and candle we were all of one mind that it was best to have the ten thousand with the curse but in some way they prevailed upon sir john so that we were blest and shriven against our will perchance it is as well for the company were in need of it about that time  the pious alleyne was deeply shocked by this reminiscence involuntarily he glanced up and around to see if there were any trace of those opportune levinflashes and thunderbolts which in the acta sanctorum were wont so often to cut short the loose talk of the scoffer the autumn sun streamed down as brightly as ever and the peaceful red path still wound in front of them through the rustling yellowtinted forest nature seemed to be too busy with her own concerns to heed the dignity of an outraged pontiff yet he felt a sense of weight and reproach within his breast as though he had sinned himself in giving ear to such words the teachings of twenty years cried out against such license it was not until he had thrown himself down before one of the many wayside crosses and had prayed from his heart both for the archer and for himself that the dark cloud rolled back again from his spirit    chapter viii the three friends   his companions had passed on whilst he was at his orisons but his young blood and the fresh morning air both invited him to a scamper his staff in one hand and his scrip in the other with springy step and floating locks he raced along the forest path as active and as graceful as a young deer he had not far to go however for on turning a corner he came on a roadside cottage with a wooden fencework around it where stood big john and aylward the bowman staring at something within as he came up with them he saw that two little lads the one about nine years of age and the other somewhat older were standing on the plot in front of the cottage each holding out a round stick in their left hands with their arms stiff and straight from the shoulder as silent and still as two small statues they were pretty blueeyed yellowhaired lads well made and sturdy with bronzed skins which spoke of a woodland life  here are young chips from an old bow stave cried the soldier in great delight this is the proper way to raise children by my hilt i could not have trained them better had i the ordering of it myself  what is it then asked hordle john they stand very stiff and i trust that they have not been struck so  nay they are training their left arms that they may have a steady grasp of the bow so my own father trained me and six days a week i held out his walkingstaff till my arm was heavy as lead hola mes enfants how long will you hold out  until the sun is over the great limetree good master the elder answered  what would ye be then woodmen verderers  nay soldiers they cried both together  by the beard of my father but ye are whelps of the true breed why so keen then to be soldiers  that we may fight the scots they answered daddy will send us to fight the scots  and why the scots my pretty lads we have seen french and spanish galleys no further away than southampton but i doubt that it will be some time before the scots find their way to these parts  our business is with the scots quoth the elder for it was the scots who cut off daddys string fingers and his thumbs  aye lads it was that said a deep voice from behind alleynes shoulder looking round the wayfarers saw a gaunt bigboned man with sunken cheeks and a sallow face who had come up behind them he held up his two hands as he spoke and showed that the thumbs and two first fingers had been torn away from each of them  ma foi camarade cried aylward who hath served thee in so shameful a fashion  it is easy to see friend that you were born far from the marches of scotland quoth the stranger with a bitter smile north of humber there is no man who would not know the handiwork of devil douglas the black lord james  and how fell you into his hands asked john  i am a man of the north country from the town of beverley and the wapentake of holderness he answered there was a day when from trent to tweed there was no better marksman than robin heathcot yet as you see he hath left me as he hath left many another poor border archer with no grip for bill or bow yet the king hath given me a living here in the southlands and please god these two lads of mine will pay off a debt that hath been owing over long what is the price of daddys thumbs boys  twenty scottish lives they answered together  and for the fingers  half a score  when they can bend my warbow and bring down a squirrel at a hundred paces i send them to take service under johnny copeland the lord of the marches and governor of carlisle by my soul i would give the rest of my fingers to see the douglas within arrowflight of them  may you live to see it quoth the bowman and hark ye mes enfants take an old soldiers rede and lay your bodies to the bow drawing from hip and thigh as much as from arm learn also i pray you to shoot with a dropping shaft for though a bowman may at times be called upon to shoot straight and fast yet it is more often that he has to do with a townguard behind a wall or an arbalestier with his mantlet raised when you cannot hope to do him scathe unless your shaft fall straight upon him from the clouds i have not drawn string for two weeks but i may be able to show ye how such shots should be made he loosened his longbow slung his quiver round to the front and then glanced keenly round for a fitting mark there was a yellow and withered stump some way off seen under the drooping branches of a lofty oak the archer measured the distance with his eye and then drawing three shafts he shot them off with such speed that the first had not reached the mark ere the last was on the string each arrow passed high over the oak and of the three two stuck fair into the stump while the third caught in some wandering puff of wind was driven a foot or two to one side  good cried the north countryman hearken to him lads he is a master bowman your dad says amen to every word he says  by my hilt said aylward if i am to preach on bowmanship the whole long day would scarce give me time for my sermon we have marksmen in the company who will notch with a shaft every crevice and joint of a manatarms harness from the clasp of his bassinet to the hinge of his greave but with your favor friend i must gather my arrows again for while a shaft costs a penny a poor man can scarce leave them sticking in wayside stumps we must then on our road again and i hope from my heart that you may train these two young goshawks here until they are ready for a cast even at such a quarry as you speak of  leaving the thumbless archer and his brood the wayfarers struck through the scattered huts of emery down and out on to the broad rolling heath covered deep in ferns and in heather where droves of the halfwild black forest pigs were rooting about amongst the hillocks the woods about this point fall away to the left and the right while the road curves upwards and the wind sweeps keenly over the swelling uplands the broad strips of bracken glowed red and yellow against the black peaty soil and a queenly doe who grazed among them turned her white front and her great questioning eyes towards the wayfarers alleyne gazed in admiration at the supple beauty of the creature but the archers fingers played with his quiver and his eyes glistened with the fell instinct which urges a man to slaughter  tete dieu he growled were this france or even guienne we should have a fresh haunch for our nonemeat law or no law i have a mind to loose a bolt at her  i would break your stave across my knee first cried john laying his great hand upon the bow what man i am forestborn and i know what comes of it in our own township of hordle two have lost their eyes and one his skin for this very thing on my troth i felt no great love when i first saw you but since then i have conceived over much regard for you to wish to see the verderers flayer at work upon you  it is my trade to risk my skin growled the archer but none the less he thrust his quiver over his hip again and turned his face for the west  as they advanced the path still tended upwards running from heath into copses of holly and yew and so back into heath again it was joyful to hear the merry whistle of blackbirds as they darted from one clump of greenery to the other now and again a peaty amber colored stream rippled across their way with ferny overgrown banks where the blue kingfisher flitted busily from side to side or the gray and pensive heron swollen with trout and dignity stood ankledeep among the sedges chattering jays and loud woodpigeons flapped thickly overhead while ever and anon the measured tapping of natures carpenter the great green woodpecker sounded from each wayside grove on either side as the path mounted the long sweep of country broadened and expanded sloping down on the one side through yellow forest and brown moor to the distant smoke of lymington and the blue misty channel which lay alongside the skyline while to the north the woods rolled away grove topping grove to where in the furthest distance the white spire of salisbury stood out hard and clear against the cloudless sky to alleyne whose days had been spent in the lowlying coastland the eager upland air and the wide free countryside gave a sense of life and of the joy of living which made his young blood tingle in his veins even the heavy john was not unmoved by the beauty of their road while the bowman whistled lustily or sang snatches of french love songs in a voice which might have scared the most stouthearted maiden that ever hearkened to serenade  i have a liking for that north countryman he remarked presently he hath good power of hatred couldst see by his cheek and eye that he is as bitter as verjuice i warm to a man who hath some gall in his liver  ah me sighed alleyne would it not be better if he had some love in his heart  i would not say nay to that by my hilt i shall never be said to be traitor to the little king let a man love the sex pasques dieu they are made to be loved les petites from whimple down to shoestring i am right glad mon garcon to see that the good monks have trained thee so wisely and so well  nay i meant not worldly love but rather that his heart should soften towards those who have wronged him  the archer shook his head a man should love those of his own breed said he but it is not nature that an englishborn man should love a scot or a frenchman ma foi you have not seen a drove of nithsdale raiders on their galloway nags or you would not speak of loving them i would as soon take beelzebub himself to my arms i fear mon gar that they have taught thee but badly at beaulieu for surely a bishop knows more of what is right and what is ill than an abbot can do and i myself with these very eyes saw the bishop of lincoln hew into a scottish hobeler with a battleaxe which was a passing strange way of showing him that he loved him  alleyne scarce saw his way to argue in the face of so decided an opinion on the part of a high dignitary of the church you have borne arms against the scots then he asked  why man i first loosed string in battle when i was but a lad younger by two years than you at nevilles cross under the lord mowbray later i served under the warden of berwick that very john copeland of whom our friend spake the same who held the king of scots to ransom ma foi it is rough soldiering and a good school for one who would learn to be hardy and warwise  i have heard that the scots are good men of war said hordle john  for axemen and for spearmen i have not seen their match the archer answered they can travel too with bag of meal and gridiron slung to their swordbelt so that it is ill to follow them there are scant crops and few beeves in the borderland where a man must reap his grain with sickle in one fist and brown bill in the other on the other hand they are the sorriest archers that i have ever seen and cannot so much as aim with the arbalest to say nought of the longbow again they are mostly poor folk even the nobles among them so that there are few who can buy as good a brigandine of chainmail as that which i am wearing and it is ill for them to stand up against our own knights who carry the price of five scotch farms upon their chest and shoulders man for man with equal weapons they are as worthy and valiant men as could be found in the whole of christendom  and the french asked alleyne to whom the archers light gossip had all the relish that the words of the man of action have for the recluse  the french are also very worthy men we have had great good fortune in france and it hath led to much bobance and campfire talk but i have ever noticed that those who know the most have the least to say about it i have seen frenchmen fight both in open field in the intaking and the defending of towns or castlewicks in escalados camisades night forays bushments sallies outfalls and knightly spearrunnings their knights and squires lad are every whit as good as ours and i could pick out a score of those who ride behind du guesclin who would hold the lists with sharpened lances against the best men in the army of england on the other hand their common folk are so crushed down with gabelle and polltax and every manner of cursed tallage that the spirit has passed right out of them it is a fools plan to teach a man to be a cur in peace and think that he will be a lion in war fleece them like sheep and sheep they will remain if the nobles had not conquered the poor folk it is like enough that we should not have conquered the nobles  but they must be sorry folk to bow down to the rich in such a fashion said big john i am but a poor commoner of england myself and yet i know something of charters liberties franchises usages privileges customs and the like if these be broken then all men know that it is time to buy arrowheads  aye but the men of the law are strong in france as well as the men of war by my hilt i hold that a man has more to fear there from the inkpot of the one than from the iron of the other there is ever some cursed sheepskin in their strong boxes to prove that the rich man should be richer and the poor man poorer it would scarce pass in england but they are quiet folk over the water  and what other nations have you seen in your travels good sir asked alleyne edricson his young mind hungered for plain facts of life after the long course of speculation and of mysticism on which he had been trained  i have seen the low countryman in arms and i have nought to say against him heavy and slow is he by nature and is not to be brought into battle for the sake of a ladys eyelash or the twang of a minstrels string like the hotter blood of the south but ma foi lay hand on his woolbales or trifle with his velvet of bruges and out buzzes every stout burgher like bees from the teehole ready to lay on as though it were his one business in life by our lady they have shown the french at courtrai and elsewhere that they are as deft in wielding steel as in welding it  and the men of spain  they too are very hardy soldiers the more so as for many hundred years they have had to fight hard against the cursed followers of the black mahound who have pressed upon them from the south and still as i understand hold the fairer half of the country i had a turn with them upon the sea when they came over to winchelsea and the good queen with her ladies sat upon the cliffs looking down at us as if it had been joust or tourney by my hilt it was a sight that was worth the seeing for all that was best in england was out on the water that day we went forth in little ships and came back in great galleysfor of fifty tall ships of spain over two score flew the cross of st george ere the sun had set but now youngster i have answered you freely and i trow it is time what you answered me let things be plat and plain between us i am a man who shoots straight at his mark you saw the things i had with me at yonder hostel name which you will save only the box of rosecolored sugar which i take to the lady loring and you shall have it if you will but come with me to france  nay said alleyne i would gladly come with ye to france or where else ye will just to list to your talk and because ye are the only two friends that i have in the whole wide world outside of the cloisters but indeed it may not be for my duty is towards my brother seeing that father and mother are dead and he my elder besides when ye talk of taking me to france ye do not conceive how useless i should be to you seeing that neither by training nor by nature am i fitted for the wars and there seems to be nought but strife in those parts  that comes from my fools talk cried the archer for being a man of no learning myself my tongue turns to blades and targets even as my hand does know then that for every parchment in england there are twenty in france for every statue cut gem shrine carven screen or what else might please the eye of a learned clerk there are a good hundred to our one at the spoiling of carcasonne i have seen chambers stored with writing though not one man in our company could read them again in arles and nimes and other towns that i could name there are the great arches and fortalices still standing which were built of old by giant men who came from the south can i not see by your brightened eye how you would love to look upon these things come then with me and by these ten fingerbones there is not one of them which you shall not see  i should indeed love to look upon them alleyne answered but i have come from beaulieu for a purpose and i must be true to my service even as thou art true to thine  bethink you again mon ami quoth aylward that you might do much good yonder since there are three hundred men in the company and none who has ever a word of grace for them and yet the virgin knows that there was never a set of men who were in more need of it sickerly the one duty may balance the other your brother hath done without you this many a year and as i gather he hath never walked as far as beaulieu to see you during all that time so he cannot be in any great need of you  besides said john the socman of minstead is a byword through the forest from bramshaw hill to holmesley walk he is a drunken brawling perilous churl as you may find to your cost  the more reason that i should strive to mend him quoth alleyne there is no need to urge me friends for my own wishes would draw me to france and it would be a joy to me if i could go with you but indeed and indeed it cannot be so here i take my leave of you for yonder square tower amongst the trees upon the right must surely be the church of minstead and i may reach it by this path through the woods  well god be with thee lad cried the archer pressing alleyne to his heart i am quick to love and quick to hate and fore god i am loth to part  would it not be well said john that we should wait here and see what manner of greeting you have from your brother you may prove to be as welcome as the kings purveyor to the village dame  nay nay he answered ye must not bide for me for where i go i stay  yet it may be as well that you should know whither we go said the archer we shall now journey south through the woods until we come out upon the christchurch road and so onwards hoping tonight to reach the castle of sir william montacute earl of salisbury of which sir nigel loring is constable there we shall bide and it is like enough that for a month or more you may find us there ere we are ready for our viage back to france  it was hard indeed for alleyne to break away from these two new but hearty friends and so strong was the combat between his conscience and his inclinations that he dared not look round lest his resolution should slip away from him it was not until he was deep among the tree trunks that he cast a glance backwards when he found that he could still see them through the branches on the road above him the archer was standing with folded arms his bow jutting from over his shoulder and the sun gleaming brightly upon his headpiece and the links of his chainmail beside him stood his giant recruit still clad in the homespun and illfitting garments of the fuller of lymington with arms and legs shooting out of his scanty garb even as alleyne watched them they turned upon their heels and plodded off together upon their way    chapter ix how strange things befell in minstead wood   the path which the young clerk had now to follow lay through a magnificent forest of the very heaviest timber where the giant bowls of oak and of beech formed long aisles in every direction shooting up their huge branches to build the majestic arches of natures own cathedral beneath lay a broad carpet of the softest and greenest moss flecked over with fallen leaves but yielding pleasantly to the foot of the traveller the track which guided him was one so seldom used that in places it lost itself entirely among the grass to reappear as a reddish rut between the distant tree trunks it was very still here in the heart of the woodlands the gentle rustle of the branches and the distant cooing of pigeons were the only sounds which broke in upon the silence save that once alleyne heard afar off a merry call upon a hunting bugle and the shrill yapping of the hounds  it was not without some emotion that he looked upon the scene around him for in spite of his secluded life he knew enough of the ancient greatness of his own family to be aware that the time had been when they had held undisputed and paramount sway over all that tract of country his father could trace his pure saxon lineage back to that godfrey malf who had held the manors of bisterne and of minstead at the time when the norman first set mailed foot upon english soil the afforestation of the district however and its conversion into a royal demesne had clipped off a large section of his estate while other parts had been confiscated as a punishment for his supposed complicity in an abortive saxon rising the fate of the ancestor had been typical of that of his descendants during three hundred years their domains had gradually contracted sometimes through royal or feudal encroachment and sometimes through such gifts to the church as that with which alleynes father had opened the doors of beaulieu abbey to his younger son the importance of the family had thus dwindled but they still retained the old saxon manorhouse with a couple of farms and a grove large enough to afford pannage to a hundred pigssylva de centum porcis as the old family parchments describe it above all the owner of the soil could still hold his head high as the veritable socman of minsteadthat is as holding the land in free socage with no feudal superior and answerable to no man lower than the king knowing this alleyne felt some little glow of worldly pride as he looked for the first time upon the land with which so many generations of his ancestors had been associated he pushed on the quicker twirling his staff merrily and looking out at every turn of the path for some sign of the old saxon residence he was suddenly arrested however by the appearance of a wildlooking fellow armed with a club who sprang out from behind a tree and barred his passage he was a rough powerful peasant with cap and tunic of untanned sheepskin leather breeches and galligaskins round legs and feet  stand he shouted raising his heavy cudgel to enforce the order who are you who walk so freely through the wood whither would you go and what is your errand  why should i answer your questions my friend said alleyne standing on his guard  because your tongue may save your pate but where have i looked upon your face before  no longer ago than last night at the pied merlin the clerk answered recognizing the escaped serf who had been so outspoken as to his wrongs  by the virgin yes you were the little clerk who sat so mum in the corner and then cried fy on the gleeman what hast in the scrip  naught of any price  how can i tell that clerk let me see  not i  fool i could pull you limb from limb like a pullet what would you have hast forgot that we are alone far from all men how can your clerkship help you wouldst lose scrip and life too  i will part with neither without fight  a fight quotha a fight betwixt spurred cock and new hatched chicken thy fighting days may soon be over  hadst asked me in the name of charity i would have given freely cried alleyne as it stands not one farthing shall you have with my free will and when i see my brother the socman of minstead he will raise hue and cry from vill to vill from hundred to hundred until you are taken as a common robber and a scourge to the country  the outlaw sank his club the socmans brother he gasped now by the keys of peter i had rather that hand withered and tongue was palsied ere i had struck or miscalled you if you are the socmans brother you are one of the right side i warrant for all your clerkly dress  his brother i am said alleyne but if i were not is that reason why you should molest me on the kings ground  i give not the pip of an apple for king or for noble cried the serf passionately ill have i had from them and ill i shall repay them i am a good friend to my friends and by the virgin an evil foeman to my foes  and therefore the worst of foemen to thyself said alleyne but i pray you since you seem to know him to point out to me the shortest path to my brothers house  the serf was about to reply when the clear ringing call of a bugle burst from the wood close behind them and alleyne caught sight for an instant of the dun side and white breast of a lordly stag glancing swiftly betwixt the distant tree trunks a minute later came the shaggy deerhounds a dozen or fourteen of them running on a hot scent with nose to earth and tail in air as they streamed past the silent forest around broke suddenly into loud life with galloping of hoofs crackling of brushwood and the short sharp cries of the hunters close behind the pack rode a fourrier and a yeomanpricker whooping on the laggards and encouraging the leaders in the shrill halffrench jargon which was the language of venery and woodcraft alleyne was still gazing after them listening to the loud hykeabayard hykeapomers hykealebryt with which they called upon their favorite hounds when a group of horsemen crashed out through the underwood at the very spot where the serf and he were standing  the one who led was a man between fifty and sixty years of age warworn and weatherbeaten with a broad thoughtful forehead and eyes which shone brightly from under his fierce and overhung brows his beard streaked thickly with gray bristled forward from his chin and spoke of a passionate nature while the long finely cut face and firm mouth marked the leader of men his figure was erect and soldierly and he rode his horse with the careless grace of a man whose life had been spent in the saddle in common garb his masterful face and flashing eye would have marked him as one who was born to rule but now with his silken tunic powdered with golden fleursdelis his velvet mantle lined with the royal minever and the lions of england stamped in silver upon his harness none could fail to recognize the noble edward most warlike and powerful of all the long line of fighting monarchs who had ruled the anglonorman race alleyne doffed hat and bowed head at the sight of him but the serf folded his hands and leaned them upon his cudgel looking with little love at the knot of nobles and knightsinwaiting who rode behind the king  ha cried edward reining up for an instant his powerful black steed le cerf est passe non ici brocas tu parles anglais  the deer clowns said a hardvisaged swarthyfaced man who rode at the kings elbow if ye have headed it back it is as much as your ears are worth  it passed by the blighted beech there said alleyne pointing and the hounds were hard at its heels  it is well cried edward still speaking in french for though he could understand english he had never learned to express himself in so barbarous and unpolished a tongue by my faith sirs he continued half turning in his saddle to address his escort unless my woodcraft is sadly at fault it is a stag of six tines and the finest that we have roused this journey a golden st hubert to the man who is the first to sound the mort he shook his bridle as he spoke and thundered away his knights lying low upon their horses and galloping as hard as whip and spur would drive them in the hope of winning the kings prize away they drove down the long green gladebay horses black and gray riders clad in every shade of velvet fur or silk with glint of brazen horn and flash of knife and spear one only lingered the blackbrowed baron brocas who making a gambade which brought him within armsweep of the serf slashed him across the face with his ridingwhip doff dog doff he hissed when a monarch deigns to lower his eyes to such as youthen spurred through the underwood and was gone with a gleam of steel shoes and flutter of dead leaves  the villein took the cruel blow without wince or cry as one to whom stripes are a birthright and an inheritance his eyes flashed however and he shook his bony hand with a fierce wild gesture after the retreating figure  black hound of gascony he muttered evil the day that you and those like you set foot in free england i know thy kennel of rochecourt the night will come when i may do to thee and thine what you and your class have wrought upon mine and me may god smite me if i fail to smite thee thou french robber with thy wife and thy child and all that is under thy castle roof  forbear cried alleyne mix not gods name with these unhallowed threats and yet it was a cowards blow and one to stir the blood and loose the tongue of the most peaceful let me find some soothing simples and lay them on the weal to draw the sting  nay there is but one thing that can draw the sting and that the future may bring to me but clerk if you would see your brother you must on for there is a meeting today and his merry men will await him ere the shadows turn from west to east i pray you not to hold him back for it would be an evil thing if all the stout lads were there and the leader amissing i would come with you but sooth to say i am stationed here and may not move the path over yonder betwixt the oak and the thorn should bring you out into his nether field  alleyne lost no time in following the directions of the wild masterless man whom he left among the trees where he had found him his heart was the heavier for the encounter not only because all bitterness and wrath were abhorrent to his gentle nature but also because it disturbed him to hear his brother spoken of as though he were a chief of outlaws or the leader of a party against the state indeed of all the things which he had seen yet in the world to surprise him there was none more strange than the hate which class appeared to bear to class the talk of laborer woodman and villein in the inn had all pointed to the widespread mutiny and now his brothers name was spoken as though he were the very centre of the universal discontent in good truth the commons throughout the length and breadth of the land were heartweary of this fine game of chivalry which had been played so long at their expense so long as knight and baron were a strength and a guard to the kingdom they might be endured but now when all men knew that the great battles in france had been won by english yeomen and welsh stabbers warlike fame the only fame to which his class had ever aspired appeared to have deserted the plateclad horsemen the sports of the lists had done much in days gone by to impress the minds of the people but the plumed and unwieldy champion was no longer an object either of fear or of reverence to men whose fathers and brothers had shot into the press at crecy or poitiers and seen the proudest chivalry in the world unable to make head against the weapons of disciplined peasants power had changed hands the protector had become the protected and the whole fabric of the feudal system was tottering to a fall hence the fierce mutterings of the lower classes and the constant discontent breaking out into local tumult and outrage and culminating some years later in the great rising of tyler what alleyne saw and wondered at in hampshire would have appealed equally to the traveller in any other english county from the channel to the marches of scotland  he was following the track his misgivings increasing with every step which took him nearer to that home which he had never seen when of a sudden the trees began to thin and the sward to spread out onto a broad green lawn where five cows lay in the sunshine and droves of black swine wandered unchecked a brown forest stream swirled down the centre of this clearing with a rude bridge flung across it and on the other side was a second field sloping up to a long lowlying wooden house with thatched roof and open squares for windows alleyne gazed across at it with flushed cheeks and sparkling eyesfor this he knew must be the home of his fathers a wreath of blue smoke floated up through a hole in the thatch and was the only sign of life in the place save a great black hound which lay sleeping chained to the doorpost in the yellow shimmer of the autumn sunshine it lay as peacefully and as still as he had oft pictured it to himself in his dreams  he was roused however from his pleasant reverie by the sound of voices and two people emerged from the forest some little way to his right and moved across the field in the direction of the bridge the one was a man with yellow flowing beard and very long hair of the same tint drooping over his shoulders his dress of good norwich cloth and his assured bearing marked him as a man of position while the sombre hue of his clothes and the absence of all ornament contrasted with the flash and glitter which had marked the kings retinue by his side walked a woman tall and slight and dark with lithe graceful figure and clearcut composed features her jetblack hair was gathered back under a light pink coif her head poised proudly upon her neck and her step long and springy like that of some wild tireless woodland creature she held her left hand in front of her covered with a red velvet glove and on the wrist a little brown falcon very fluffy and bedraggled which she smoothed and fondled as she walked as she came out into the sunshine alleyne noticed that her light gown slashed with pink was all stained with earth and with moss upon one side from shoulder to hem he stood in the shadow of an oak staring at her with parted lips for this woman seemed to him to be the most beautiful and graceful creature that mind could conceive of such had he imagined the angels and such he had tried to paint them in the beaulieu missals but here there was something human were it only in the battered hawk and discolored dress which sent a tingle and thrill through his nerves such as no dream of radiant and stainless spirit had ever yet been able to conjure up good quiet uncomplaining mother nature long slighted and miscalled still bides her time and draws to her bosom the most errant of her children  the two walked swiftly across the meadow to the narrow bridge he in front and she a pace or two behind there they paused and stood for a few minutes face to face talking earnestly alleyne had read and had heard of love and of lovers such were these doubtlessthis goldenbearded man and the fair damsel with the cold proud face why else should they wander together in the woods or be so lost in talk by rustic streams and yet as he watched uncertain whether to advance from the cover or to choose some other path to the house he soon came to doubt the truth of this first conjecture the man stood tall and square blocking the entrance to the bridge and throwing out his hands as he spoke in a wild eager fashion while the deep tones of his stormy voice rose at times into accents of menace and of anger she stood fearlessly in front of him still stroking her bird but twice she threw a swift questioning glance over her shoulder as one who is in search of aid so moved was the young clerk by these mute appeals that he came forth from the trees and crossed the meadow uncertain what to do and yet loth to hold back from one who might need his aid so intent were they upon each other that neither took note of his approach until when he was close upon them the man threw his arm roughly round the damsels waist and drew her towards him she straining her lithe supple figure away and striking fiercely at him while the hooded hawk screamed with ruffled wings and pecked blindly in its mistresss defence bird and maid however had but little chance against their assailant who laughing loudly caught her wrist in one hand while he drew her towards him with the other  the best rose has ever the longest thorns said he quiet little one or you may do yourself a hurt must pay saxon toll on saxon land my proud maude for all your airs and graces  you boor she hissed you base underbred clod is this your care and your hospitality i would rather wed a branded serf from my fathers fields leave go i sayah good youth heaven has sent you make him loose me by the honor of your mother i pray you to stand by me and to make this knave loose me  stand by you i will and that blithely said alleyne surely sir you should take shame to hold the damsel against her will  the man turned a face upon him which was lionlike in its strength and in its wrath with his tangle of golden hair his fierce blue eyes and his large wellmarked features he was the most comely man whom alleyne had ever seen and yet there was something so sinister and so fell in his expression that child or beast might well have shrunk from him his brows were drawn his cheek flushed and there was a mad sparkle in his eyes which spoke of a wild untamable nature  young fool he cried holding the woman still to his side though every line of her shrinking figure spoke her abhorrence do you keep your spoon in your own broth i rede you to go on your way lest worse befall you this little wench has come with me and with me she shall bide  liar cried the woman and stooping her head she suddenly bit fiercely into the broad brown hand which held her he whipped it back with an oath while she tore herself free and slipped behind alleyne cowering up against him like the trembling leveret who sees the falcon poising for the swoop above him  stand off my land the man said fiercely heedless of the blood which trickled freely from his fingers what have you to do here by your dress you should be one of those cursed clerks who overrun the land like vile rats poking and prying into other mens concerns too caitiff to fight and too lazy to work by the rood if i had my will upon ye i should nail you upon the abbey doors as they hang vermin before their holes art neither man nor woman young shaveling get thee back to thy fellows ere i lay hands upon you for your foot is on my land and i may slay you as a common drawlatch  is this your land then gasped alleyne  would you dispute it dog would you wish by trick or quibble to juggle me out of these last acres know baseborn knave that you have dared this day to stand in the path of one whose race have been the advisers of kings and the leaders of hosts ere ever this vile crew of norman robbers came into the land or such halfblood hounds as you were let loose to preach that the thief should have his booty and the honest man should sin if he strove to win back his own  you are the socman of minstead  that am i and the son of edric the socman of the pure blood of godfrey the thane by the only daughter of the house of aluric whose forefathers held the whitehorse banner at the fatal fight where our shield was broken and our sword shivered i tell you clerk that my folk held this land from bramshaw wood to the ringwood road and by the soul of my father it will be a strange thing if i am to be bearded upon the little that is left of it begone i say and meddle not with my affair  if you leave me now whispered the woman then shame forever upon your manhood  surely sir said alleyne speaking in as persuasive and soothing a way as he could if your birth is gentle there is the more reason that your manners should be gentle too i am well persuaded that you did but jest with this lady and that you will now permit her to leave your land either alone or with me as a guide if she should need one through the wood as to birth it does not become me to boast and there is sooth in what you say as to the unworthiness of clerks but it is none the less true that i am as well born as you  dog cried the furious socman there is no man in the south who can say as much  yet can i said alleyne smiling for indeed i also am the son of edric the socman of the pure blood of godfrey the thane by the only daughter of aluric of brockenhurst surely dear brother he continued holding out his hand you have a warmer greeting than this for me there are but two boughs left upon this old old saxon trunk  his elder brother dashed his hand aside with an oath while an expression of malignant hatred passed over his passiondrawn features you are the young cub of beaulieu then said he i might have known it by the sleek face and the slavish manner too monkridden and craven in spirit to answer back a rough word thy father shaveling with all his faults had a mans heart and there were few who could look him in the eyes on the day of his anger but you look there rat on yonder field where the cows graze and on that other beyond and on the orchard hard by the church do you know that all these were squeezed out of your dying father by greedy priests to pay for your upbringing in the cloisters i the socman am shorn of my lands that you may snivel latin and eat bread for which you never did hands turn you rob me first and now you would come preaching and whining in search mayhap of another field or two for your priestly friends knave my dogs shall be set upon you but meanwhile stand out of my path and stop me at your peril as he spoke he rushed forward and throwing the lad to one side caught the womans wrist alleyne however as active as a young deerhound sprang to her aid and seized her by the other arm raising his ironshod staff as he did so  you may say what you will to me he said between his clenched teethit may be no better than i deserve but brother or no i swear by my hopes of salvation that i will break your arm if you do not leave hold of the maid  there was a ring in his voice and a flash in his eyes which promised that the blow would follow quick at the heels of the word for a moment the blood of the long line of hotheaded thanes was too strong for the soft whisperings of the doctrine of meekness and mercy he was conscious of a fierce wild thrill through his nerves and a throb of mad gladness at his heart as his real human self burst for an instant the bonds of custom and of teaching which had held it so long the socman sprang back looking to left and to right for some stick or stone which might serve him for weapon but finding none he turned and ran at the top of his speed for the house blowing the while upon a shrill whistle  come gasped the woman fly friend ere he come back  nay let him come cried alleyne i shall not budge a foot for him or his dogs  come come she cried tugging at his arm i know the man he will kill you come for the virgins sake or for my sake for i cannot go and leave you here  come then said he and they ran together to the cover of the woods as they gained the edge of the brushwood alleyne looking back saw his brother come running out of the house again with the sun gleaming upon his hair and his beard he held something which flashed in his right hand and he stooped at the threshold to unloose the black hound  this way the woman whispered in a low eager voice through the bushes to that forked ash do not heed me i can run as fast as you i trow now into the streamright in over ankles to throw the dog off though i think it is but a common cur like its master as she spoke she sprang herself into the shallow stream and ran swiftly up the centre of it with the brown water bubbling over her feet and her hand outstretched toward the clinging branches of bramble or sapling alleyne followed close at her heels with his mind in a whirl at this black welcome and sudden shifting of all his plans and hopes yet grave as were his thoughts they would still turn to wonder as he looked at the twinkling feet of his guide and saw her lithe figure bend this way and that dipping under boughs springing over stones with a lightness and ease which made it no small task for him to keep up with her at last when he was almost out of breath she suddenly threw herself down upon a mossy bank between two hollybushes and looked ruefully at her own dripping feet and bedraggled skirt  holy mary said she what shall i do mother will keep me to my chamber for a month and make me work at the tapestry of the nine bold knights she promised as much last week when i fell into wilverley bog and yet she knows that i cannot abide needlework  alleyne still standing in the stream glanced down at the graceful pinkandwhite figure the curve of ravenblack hair and the proud sensitive face which looked up frankly and confidingly at his own  we had best on he said he may yet overtake us  not so we are well off his land now nor can he tell in this great wood which way we have taken but youyou had him at your mercy why did you not kill him  kill him my brother  and why notwith a quick gleam of her white teeth he would have killed you i know him and i read it in his eyes had i had your staff i would have triedaye and done it too she shook her clenched white hand as she spoke and her lips tightened ominously  i am already sad in heart for what i have done said he sitting down on the bank and sinking his face into his hands god help meall that is worst in me seemed to come uppermost another instant and i had smitten him the son of my own mother the man whom i have longed to take to my heart alas that i should still be so weak  weak she exclaimed raising her black eyebrows i do not think that even my father himself who is a hard judge of manhood would call you that but it is as you may think sir a very pleasant thing for me to hear that you are grieved at what you have done and i can but rede that we should go back together and you should make your peace with the socman by handing back your prisoner it is a sad thing that so small a thing as a woman should come between two who are of one blood  simple alleyne opened his eyes at this little spurt of feminine bitterness nay lady said he that were worst of all what man would be so caitiff and thrall as to fail you at your need i have turned my brother against me and now alas i appear to have given you offence also with my clumsy tongue but indeed lady i am torn both ways and can scarce grasp in my mind what it is that has befallen  nor can i marvel at that said she with a little tinkling laugh you came in as the knight does in the jongleurs romances between dragon and damsel with small time for the asking of questions come she went on springing to her feet and smoothing down her rumpled frock let us walk through the shaw together and we may come upon bertrand with the horses if poor troubadour had not cast a shoe we should not have had this trouble nay i must have your arm for though i speak lightly now that all is happily over i am as frightened as my brave roland see how his chest heaves and his dear feathers all awrythe little knight who would not have his lady mishandled so she prattled on to her hawk while alleyne walked by her side stealing a glance from time to time at this queenly and wayward woman in silence they wandered together over the velvet turf and on through the broad minstead woods where the old lichendraped beeches threw their circles of black shadow upon the sunlit sward  you have no wish then to hear my story said she at last  if it pleases you to tell it me he answered  oh she cried tossing her head if it is of so little interest to you we had best let it bide  nay said he eagerly i would fain hear it  you have a right to know it if you have lost a brothers favor through it and yetah well you are as i understand a clerk so i must think of you as one step further in orders and make you my fatherconfessor know then that this man has been a suitor for my hand less as i think for my own sweet sake than because he hath ambition and had it on his mind that he might improve his fortunes by dipping into my fathers strong boxthough the virgin knows that he would have found little enough therein my father however is a proud man a gallant knight and tried soldier of the oldest blood to whom this mans churlish birth and low descentoh lackaday i had forgot that he was of the same strain as yourself  nay trouble not for that said alleyne we are all from good mother eve  streams may spring from one source and yet some be clear and some be foul quoth she quickly but to be brief over the matter my father would have none of his wooing nor in sooth would i on that he swore a vow against us and as he is known to be a perilous man with many outlaws and others at his back my father forbade that i should hawk or hunt in any part of the wood to the north of the christchurch road as it chanced however this morning my little roland here was loosed at a strongwinged heron and page bertrand and i rode on with no thoughts but for the sport until we found ourselves in minstead woods small harm then but that my horse troubadour trod with a tender foot upon a sharp stick rearing and throwing me to the ground see to my gown the third that i have befouled within the week woe worth me when agatha the tirewoman sets eyes upon it  and what then lady asked alleyne  why then away ran troubadour for belike i spurred him in falling and bertrand rode after him as hard as hoofs could bear him when i rose there was the socman himself by my side with the news that i was on his land but with so many courteous words besides and such gallant bearing that he prevailed upon me to come to his house for shelter there to wait until the page return by the grace of the virgin and the help of my patron st magdalen i stopped short ere i reached his door though as you saw he strove to hale me up to it and thenahhhhshe shivered and chattered like one in an aguefit  what is it cried alleyne looking about in alarm  nothing friend nothing i was but thinking how i bit into his hand sooner would i bite living toad or poisoned snake oh i shall loathe my lips forever but youhow brave you were and how quick how meek for yourself and how bold for a stranger if i were a man i should wish to do what you have done  it was a small thing he answered with a tingle of pleasure at these sweet words of praise but youwhat will you do  there is a great oak near here and i think that bertrand will bring the horses there for it is an old huntingtryst of ours then hey for home and no more hawking today a twelvemile gallop will dry feet and skirt  but your father  not one word shall i tell him you do not know him but i can tell you he is not a man to disobey as i have disobeyed him he would avenge me it is true but it is not to him that i shall look for vengeance some day perchance in joust or in tourney knight may wish to wear my colors and then i shall tell him that if he does indeed crave my favor there is wrong unredressed and the wronger the socman of minstead so my knight shall find a venture such as bold knights love and my debt shall be paid and my father none the wiser and one rogue the less in the world say is not that a brave plan  nay lady it is a thought which is unworthy of you how can such as you speak of violence and of vengeance are none to be gentle and kind none to be piteous and forgiving alas it is a hard cruel world and i would that i had never left my abbey cell to hear such words from your lips is as though i heard an angel of grace preaching the devils own creed  she started from him as a young colt who first feels the bit gramercy for your rede young sir she said with a little curtsey as i understand your words you are grieved that you ever met me and look upon me as a preaching devil why my father is a bitter man when he is wroth but hath never called me such a name as that it may be his right and duty but certes it is none of thine so it would be best since you think so lowly of me that you should take this path to the left while i keep on upon this one for it is clear that i can be no fit companion for you so saying with downcast lids and a dignity which was somewhat marred by her bedraggled skirt she swept off down the muddy track leaving alleyne standing staring ruefully after her he waited in vain for some backward glance or sign of relenting but she walked on with a rigid neck until her dress was only a white flutter among the leaves then with a sunken head and a heavy heart he plodded wearily down the other path wroth with himself for the rude and uncouth tongue which had given offence where so little was intended  he had gone some way lost in doubt and in selfreproach his mind all tremulous with a thousand newfound thoughts and fears and wonderments when of a sudden there was a light rustle of the leaves behind him and glancing round there was this graceful swiftfooted creature treading in his very shadow with her proud head bowed even as his wasthe picture of humility and repentance  i shall not vex you nor even speak she said but i would fain keep with you while we are in the wood  nay you cannot vex me he answered all warm again at the very sight of her it was my rough words which vexed you but i have been thrown among men all my life and indeed with all the will i scarce know how to temper my speech to a ladys ear  then unsay it cried she quickly say that i was right to wish to have vengeance on the socman  nay i cannot do that he answered gravely  then who is ungentle and unkind now she cried in triumph how stern and cold you are for one so young art surely no mere clerk but bishop or cardinal at the least shouldst have crozier for staff and mitre for cap well well for your sake i will forgive the socman and take vengeance on none but on my own wilful self who must needs run into dangers path so will that please you sir  there spoke your true self said he and you will find more pleasure in such forgiveness than in any vengeance  she shook her head as if by no means assured of it and then with a sudden little cry which had more of surprise than of joy in it here is bertrand with the horses  down the glade there came a little greenclad page with laughing eyes and long curls floating behind him he sat perched on a high bay horse and held on to the bridle of a spirited black palfrey the hides of both glistening from a long run  i have sought you everywhere dear lady maude said he in a piping voice springing down from his horse and holding the stirrup troubadour galloped as far as holmhill ere i could catch him i trust that you have had no hurt or scath he shot a questioning glance at alleyne as he spoke  no bertrand said she thanks to this courteous stranger and now sir she continued springing into her saddle it is not fit that i leave you without a word more clerk or no you have acted this day as becomes a true knight king arthur and all his table could not have done more it may be that as some small return my father or his kin may have power to advance your interest he is not rich but he is honored and hath great friends tell me what is your purpose and see if he may not aid it  alas lady i have now no purpose i have but two friends in the world and they have gone to christchurch where it is likely i shall join them  and where is christchurch  at the castle which is held by the brave knight sir nigel loring constable to the earl of salisbury  to his surprise she burst out alaughing and spurring her palfrey dashed off down the glade with her page riding behind her not one word did she say but as she vanished amid the trees she half turned in her saddle and waved a last greeting long time he stood half hoping that she might again come back to him but the thud of the hoofs had died away and there was no sound in all the woods but the gentle rustle and dropping of the leaves at last he turned away and made his way back to the highroadanother person from the lighthearted boy who had left it a short three hours before    chapter x how hordle john found a man whom he might follow   if he might not return to beaulieu within the year and if his brothers dogs were to be set upon him if he showed face upon minstead land then indeed he was adrift upon earth north south east and westhe might turn where he would but all was equally chill and cheerless the abbot had rolled ten silver crowns in a lettuceleaf and hid them away in the bottom of his scrip but that would be a sorry support for twelve long months in all the darkness there was but the one bright spot of the sturdy comrades whom he had left that morning if he could find them again all would be well the afternoon was not very advanced for all that had befallen him when a man is afoot at cockcrow much may be done in the day if he walked fast he might yet overtake his friends ere they reached their destination he pushed on therefore now walking and now running as he journeyed he bit into a crust which remained from his beaulieu bread and he washed it down by a draught from a woodland stream  it was no easy or light thing to journey through this great forest which was some twenty miles from east to west and a good sixteen from bramshaw woods in the north to lymington in the south alleyne however had the good fortune to fall in with a woodman axe upon shoulder trudging along in the very direction that he wished to go with his guidance he passed the fringe of bolderwood walk famous for old ash and yew through mark ash with its giant beechtrees and on through the knightwood groves where the giant oak was already a great tree but only one of many comely brothers they plodded along together the woodman and alleyne with little talk on either side for their thoughts were as far asunder as the poles the peasants gossip had been of the hunt of the bracken of the grayheaded kites that had nested in wood fidley and of the great catch of herring brought back by the boats of pitts deep the clerks mind was on his brother on his futureabove all on this strange fierce melting beautiful woman who had broken so suddenly into his life and as suddenly passed out of it again so distrait was he and so random his answers that the woodman took to whistling and soon branched off upon the track to burley leaving alleyne upon the main christchurch road  down this he pushed as fast as he might hoping at every turn and rise to catch sight of his companions of the morning from vinney ridge to rhinefield walk the woods grow thick and dense up to the very edges of the track but beyond the country opens up into broad duncolored moors flecked with clumps of trees and topping each other in long low curves up to the dark lines of forest in the furthest distance clouds of insects danced and buzzed in the golden autumn light and the air was full of the piping of the songbirds long glinting dragonflies shot across the path or hung tremulous with gauzy wings and gleaming bodies once a whitenecked sea eagle soared screaming high over the travellers head and again a flock of brown bustards popped up from among the bracken and blundered away in their clumsy fashion half running half flying with strident cry and whirr of wings  there were folk too to be met upon the roadbeggars and couriers chapmen and tinkerscheery fellows for the most part with a rough jest and homely greeting for each other and for alleyne near shotwood he came upon five seamen on their way from poole to southamptonrude redfaced men who shouted at him in a jargon which he could scarce understand and held out to him a great pot from which they had been drinkingnor would they let him pass until he had dipped pannikin in and taken a mouthful which set him coughing and choking with the tears running down his cheeks further on he met a sturdy blackbearded man mounted on a brown horse with a rosary in his right hand and a long twohanded sword jangling against his stirrupiron by his black robe and the eightpointed cross upon his sleeve alleyne recognized him as one of the knights hospitallers of st john of jerusalem whose presbytery was at baddesley he held up two fingers as he passed with a benedic fili mi whereat alleyne doffed hat and bent knee looking with much reverence at one who had devoted his life to the overthrow of the infidel poor simple lad he had not learned yet that what men are and what men profess to be are very wide asunder and that the knights of st john having come into large part of the riches of the illfated templars were very much too comfortable to think of exchanging their palace for a tent or the cellars of england for the thirsty deserts of syria yet ignorance may be more precious than wisdom for alleyne as he walked on braced himself to a higher life by the thought of this others sacrifice and strengthened himself by his example which he could scarce have done had he known that the hospitallers mind ran more upon malmsey than on mamelukes and on venison rather than victories  as he pressed on the plain turned to woods once more in the region of wilverley walk and a cloud swept up from the south with the sun shining through the chinks of it a few great drops came pattering loudly down and then in a moment the steady swish of a brisk shower with the dripping and dropping of the leaves alleyne glancing round for shelter saw a thick and lofty hollybush so hollowed out beneath that no house could have been drier under this canopy of green two men were already squatted who waved their hands to alleyne that he should join them as he approached he saw that they had five dried herrings laid out in front of them with a great hunch of wheaten bread and a leathern flask full of milk but instead of setting to at their food they appeared to have forgot all about it and were disputing together with flushed faces and angry gestures it was easy to see by their dress and manner that they were two of those wandering students who formed about this time so enormous a multitude in every country in europe the one was long and thin with melancholy features while the other was fat and sleek with a loud voice and the air of a man who is not to be gainsaid  come hither good youth he cried come hither vultus ingenui puer heed not the face of my good coz here foenum habet in cornu as don horace has it but i warrant him harmless for all that  stint your bulls bellowing exclaimed the other if it come to horace i have a line in my mind loquaces si sapiathow doth it run the english ot being that a man of sense should ever avoid a great talker that being so if all were men of sense then thou wouldst be a lonesome man coz  alas dicon i fear that your logic is as bad as your philosophy or your divinityand god wot it would be hard to say a worse word than that for it for hark ye granting propter argumentum that i am a talker then the true reasoning runs that since all men of sense should avoid me and thou hast not avoided me but art at the present moment eating herrings with me under a hollybush ergo you are no man of sense which is exactly what i have been dinning into your long ears ever since i first clapped eyes on your sunken chops  tut tut cried the other your tongue goes like the clapper of a millwheel sit down here friend and partake of this herring understand first however that there are certain conditions attached to it  i had hoped said alleyne falling into the humor of the twain that a tranchoir of bread and a draught of milk might be attached to it  hark to him hark to him cried the little fat man it is even thus dicon wit lad is a catching thing like the itch or the sweating sickness i exude it round me it is an aura i tell you coz that no man can come within seventeen feet of me without catching a spark look at your own case a duller man never stepped and yet within the week you have said three things which might pass and one thing the day we left fordingbridge which i should not have been ashamed of myself  enough rattlepate enough said the other the milk you shall have and the bread also friend together with the herring but you must hold the scales between us  if he hold the herring he holds the scales my sapient brother cried the fat man but i pray you good youth to tell us whether you are a learned clerk and if so whether you have studied at oxenford or at paris  i have some small stock of learning alleyne answered picking at his herring but i have been at neither of these places i was bred amongst the cistercian monks at beaulieu abbey  pooh pooh they cried both together what sort of an upbringing is that  non cuivis contingit adire corinthum quoth alleyne  come brother stephen he hath some tincture of letters said the melancholy man more hopefully he may be the better judge since he hath no call to side with either of us now attention friend and let your ears work as well as your nether jaw judex damnaturyou know the old saw here am i upholding the good fame of the learned duns scotus against the foolish quibblings and poor silly reasonings of willie ockham  while i quoth the other loudly do maintain the good sense and extraordinary wisdom of that most learned william against the crackbrained fantasies of the muddy scotchman who hath hid such little wit as he has under so vast a pile of words that it is like one drop of gascony in a firkin of ditchwater solomon his wisdom would not suffice to say what the rogue means  certes stephen hapgood his wisdom doth not suffice cried the other it is as though a mole cried out against the morning star because he could not see it but our dispute friend is concerning the nature of that subtle essence which we call thought for i hold with the learned scotus that thought is in very truth a thing even as vapor or fumes or many other substances which our gross bodily eyes are blind to for look you that which produces a thing must be itself a thing and if a mans thought may produce a written book then must thought itself be a material thing even as the book is have i expressed it do i make it plain  whereas i hold shouted the other with my revered preceptor doctor praeclarus et excellentissimus that all things are but thought for when thought is gone i prythee where are the things then here are trees about us and i see them because i think i see them but if i have swooned or sleep or am in wine then my thought having gone forth from me lo the trees go forth also how now coz have i touched thee on the raw  alleyne sat between them munching his bread while the twain disputed across his knees leaning forward with flushed faces and darting hands in all the heat of argument never had he heard such jargon of scholastic philosophy such finedrawn distinctions such crossfire of major and minor proposition syllogism attack and refutation question clattered upon answer like a sword on a buckler the ancients the fathers of the church the moderns the scriptures the arabians were each sent hurtling against the other while the rain still dripped and the dark hollyleaves glistened with the moisture at last the fat man seemed to weary of it for he set to work quietly upon his meal while his opponent as proud as the rooster who is left unchallenged upon the midden crowed away in a last long burst of quotation and deduction suddenly however his eyes dropped upon his food and he gave a howl of dismay  you double thief he cried you have eaten my herrings and i without bite or sup since morning  that quoth the other complacently was my final argument my crowning effort or peroratio as the orators have it for coz since all thoughts are things you have but to think a pair of herrings and then conjure up a pottle of milk wherewith to wash them down  a brave piece of reasoning cried the other and i know of but one reply to it on which leaning forward he caught his comrade a rousing smack across his rosy cheek nay take it not amiss he said since all things are but thoughts then that also is but a thought and may be disregarded  this last argument however by no means commended itself to the pupil of ockham who plucked a great stick from the ground and signified his dissent by smiting the realist over the pate with it by good fortune the wood was so light and rotten that it went to a thousand splinters but alleyne thought it best to leave the twain to settle the matter at their leisure the more so as the sun was shining brightly once more looking back down the poolstrewn road he saw the two excited philosophers waving their hands and shouting at each other but their babble soon became a mere drone in the distance and a turn in the road hid them from his sight  and now after passing holmesley walk and the wooton heath the forest began to shred out into scattered belts of trees with gleam of cornfield and stretch of pastureland between here and there by the wayside stood little knots of wattleanddaub huts with shockhaired laborers lounging by the doors and redcheeked children sprawling in the roadway back among the groves he could see the high gable ends and thatched roofs of the franklins houses on whose fields these men found employment or more often a thick dark column of smoke marked their position and hinted at the coarse plenty within by these signs alleyne knew that he was on the very fringe of the forest and therefore no great way from christchurch the sun was lying low in the west and shooting its level rays across the long sweep of rich green country glinting on the whitefleeced sheep and throwing long shadows from the red kine who waded kneedeep in the juicy clover right glad was the traveller to see the high tower of christchurch priory gleaming in the mellow evening light and gladder still when on rounding a corner he came upon his comrades of the morning seated astraddle upon a fallen tree they had a flat space before them on which they alternately threw little square pieces of bone and were so intent upon their occupation that they never raised eye as he approached them he observed with astonishment as he drew near that the archers bow was on johns back the archers sword by johns side and the steel cap laid upon the treetrunk between them  mort de ma vie aylward shouted looking down at the dice never had i such cursed luck a murrain on the bones i have not thrown a good main since i left navarre a one and a three en avant camarade  four and three cried hordle john counting on his great fingers that makes seven ho archer i have thy cap now have at thee for thy jerkin  mon dieu he growled i am like to reach christchurch in my shirt then suddenly glancing up hola by the splendor of heaven here is our cher petit now by my ten finger bones this is a rare sight to mine eyes he sprang up and threw his arms round alleynes neck while john no less pleased but more backward and saxon in his habits stood grinning and bobbing by the wayside with his newly won steel cap stuck wrong side foremost upon his tangle of red hair  hast come to stop cried the bowman patting alleyne all over in his delight shall not get away from us again  i wish no better said he with a pringling in the eyes at this hearty greeting  well said lad cried big john we three shall to the wars together and the devil may fly away with the abbot of beaulieu but your feet and hosen are all besmudged hast been in the water or i am the more mistaken  i have in good sooth alleyne answered and then as they journeyed on their way he told them the many things that had befallen him his meeting with the villein his sight of the king his coming upon his brother with all the tale of the black welcome and of the fair damsel they strode on either side each with an ear slanting towards him but ere he had come to the end of his story the bowman had spun round upon his heel and was hastening back the way they had come breathing loudly through his nose  what then asked alleyne trotting after him and gripping at his jerkin  i am back for minstead lad  and why in the name of sense  to thrust a handful of steel into the socman what hale a demoiselle against her will and then loose dogs at his own brother let me go  nenny nenny cried alleyne laughing there was no scath done come back friendand so by mingled pushing and entreaties they got his head round for christchurch once more yet he walked with his chin upon his shoulder until catching sight of a maiden by a wayside well the smiles came back to his face and peace to his heart  but you said alleyne there have been changes with you also why should not the workman carry his tools where are bow and sword and capand why so warlike john  it is a game which friend aylward hath been ateaching of me  and i found him an overapt pupil grumbled the bowman he hath stripped me as though i had fallen into the hands of the tardvenus but by my hilt you must render them back to me camarade lest you bring discredit upon my mission and i will pay you for them at armorers prices  take them back man and never heed the pay said john i did but wish to learn the feel of them since i am like to have such trinkets hung to my own girdle for some years to come  ma foi he was born for a free companion cried aylward he hath the very trick of speech and turn of thought i take them back then and indeed it gives me unease not to feel my yewstave tapping against my leg bone but see mes garcons on this side of the church rises the square and darkling tower of earl salisburys castle and even from here i seem to see on yonder banner the red roebuck of the montacutes  red upon white said alleyne shading his eyes but whether roebuck or no is more than i could vouch how black is the great tower and how bright the gleam of arms upon the wall see below the flag how it twinkles like a star  aye it is the steel headpiece of the watchman remarked the archer but we must on if we are to be there before the drawbridge rises at the vespers bugle for it is likely that sir nigel being so renowned a soldier may keep hard discipline within the walls and let no man enter after sundown so saying he quickened his pace and the three comrades were soon close to the straggling and broadspread town which centered round the noble church and the frowning castle  it chanced on that very evening that sir nigel loring having supped before sunset as was his custom and having himself seen that pommers and cadsand his two warhorses with the thirteen hacks the five jennets my ladys three palfreys and the great dapplegray roussin had all their needs supplied had taken his dogs for an evening breather sixty or seventy of them large and small smooth and shaggydeerhound boarhound bloodhound wolfhound mastiff alaun talbot lurcher terrier spanielsnapping yelling and whining with score of lolling tongues and waving tails came surging down the narrow lane which leads from the twynham kennels to the bank of avon two russetclad varlets with loud halloo and cracking whips walked thighdeep amid the swarm guiding controlling and urging behind came sir nigel himself with lady loring upon his arm the pair walking slowly and sedately as befitted both their age and their condition while they watched with a smile in their eyes the scrambling crowd in front of them they paused however at the bridge and leaning their elbows upon the stonework they stood looking down at their own faces in the glassy stream and at the swift flash of speckled trout against the tawny gravel  sir nigel was a slight man of poor stature with soft lisping voice and gentle ways so short was he that his wife who was no very tall woman had the better of him by the breadth of three fingers his sight having been injured in his early wars by a basketful of lime which had been emptied over him when he led the earl of derbys stormers up the breach at bergerac he had contracted something of a stoop with a blinking peering expression of face his age was six and forty but the constant practice of arms together with a cleanly life had preserved his activity and endurance unimpaired so that from a distance he seemed to have the slight limbs and swift grace of a boy his face however was tanned of a dull yellow tint with a leathery poreless look which spoke of rough outdoor doings and the little pointed beard which he wore in deference to the prevailing fashion was streaked and shot with gray his features were small delicate and regular with clearcut curving nose and eyes which jutted forward from the lids his dress was simple and yet spruce a flandrish hat of beevor bearing in the band the token of our lady of embrun was drawn low upon the left side to hide that ear which had been partly shorn from his head by a flemish manatarms in a camp broil before tournay his cotehardie or tunic and trunkhosen were of a purple plum color with long weepers which hung from either sleeve to below his knees his shoes were of red leather daintily pointed at the toes but not yet prolonged to the extravagant lengths which the succeeding reign was to bring into fashion a goldembroidered belt of knighthood encircled his loins with his arms five roses gules on a field argent cunningly worked upon the clasp so stood sir nigel loring upon the bridge of avon and talked lightly with his lady  and certes had the two visages alone been seen and the stranger been asked which were the more likely to belong to the bold warrior whose name was loved by the roughest soldiery of europe he had assuredly selected the ladys her face was large and square and red with fierce thick brows and the eyes of one who was accustomed to rule taller and broader than her husband her flowing gown of sendall and furlined tippet could not conceal the gaunt and ungraceful outlines of her figure it was the age of martial women the deeds of black agnes of dunbar of lady salisbury and of the countess of montfort were still fresh in the public minds with such examples before them the wives of the english captains had become as warlike as their mates and ordered their castles in their absence with the prudence and discipline of veteran seneschals right easy were the montacutes of their castle of twynham and little had they to dread from roving galley or french squadron while lady mary loring had the ordering of it yet even in that age it was thought that though a lady might have a soldiers heart it was scarce as well that she should have a soldiers face there were men who said that of all the stern passages and daring deeds by which sir nigel loring had proved the true temper of his courage not the least was his wooing and winning of so forbidding a dame  i tell you my fair lord she was saying that it is no fit training for a demoiselle hawks and hounds rotes and citoles singing a french rondel or reading the gestes de doon de mayence as i found her yesternight pretending sleep the artful with the corner of the scroll thrusting forth from under her pillow lent her by father christopher of the priory forsooththat is ever her answer how shall all this help her when she has castle of her own to keep with a hundred mouths all agape for beef and beer  true my sweet bird true answered the knight picking a comfit from his gold drageoir the maid is like the young filly which kicks heels and plunges for very lust of life give her time dame give her time  well i know that my father would have given me not time but a good hazelstick across my shoulders ma foi i know not what the world is coming to when young maids may flout their elders i wonder that you do not correct her my fair lord  nay my hearts comfort i never raised hand to woman yet and it would be a passing strange thing if i began on my own flesh and blood it was a womans hand which cast this lime into mine eyes and though i saw her stoop and might well have stopped her ere she threw i deemed it unworthy of my knighthood to hinder or balk one of her sex  the hussy cried lady loring clenching her broad right hand i would i had been at the side of her  and so would i since you would have been the nearer me my own but i doubt not that you are right and that maudes wings need clipping which i may leave in your hands when i am gone for in sooth this peaceful life is not for me and were it not for your gracious kindness and loving care i could not abide it a week i hear that there is talk of warlike muster at bordeaux once more and by st paul it would be a new thing if the lions of england and the red pile of chandos were to be seen in the field and the roses of loring were not waving by their side  now woe worth me but i feared it cried she with the color all struck from her face i have noted your absent mind your kindling eye your trying and riveting of old harness consider my sweet lord that you have already won much honor that we have seen but little of each other that you bear upon your body the scar of over twenty wounds received in i know not how many bloody encounters have you not done enough for honor and the public cause  my lady when our liege lord the king at three score years and my lord chandos at threescore and ten are blithe and ready to lay lance in rest for englands cause it would ill beseem me to prate of service done it is sooth that i have received seven and twenty wounds there is the more reason that i should be thankful that i am still long of breath and sound in limb i have also seen some bickering and scuffling six great land battles i count with four upon sea and seven and fifty onfalls skirmishes and bushments i have held two and twenty towns and i have been at the intaking of thirtyone surely then it would be bitter shame to me and also to you since my fame is yours that i should now hold back if a mans work is to be done besides bethink you how low is our purse with bailiff and reeve ever croaking of empty farms and wasting lands were it not for this constableship which the earl of salisbury hath bestowed upon us we could scarce uphold the state which is fitting to our degree therefore my sweeting there is the more need that i should turn to where there is good pay to be earned and brave ransoms to be won  ah my dear lord quoth she with sad weary eyes i thought that at last i had you to mine own self even though your youth had been spent afar from my side yet my voice as i know well should speed you on to glory and renown not hold you back when fame is to be won yet what can i say for all men know that your valor needs the curb and not the spur it goes to my heart that you should ride forth now a mere knight bachelor when there is no noble in the land who hath so good a claim to the square pennon save only that you have not the money to uphold it  and whose fault that my sweet bird said he  no fault my fair lord but a virtue for how many rich ransoms have you won and yet have scattered the crowns among page and archer and varlet until in a week you had not as much as would buy food and forage it is a most knightly largesse and yet withouten money how can man rise  dirt and dross cried he  what matter rise or fall so that duty be done and honor gained banneret or bachelor square pennon or forked i would not give a denier for the difference and the less since sir john chandos chosen flower of english chivalry is himself but a humble knight but meanwhile fret not thyself my hearts dove for it is like that there may be no war waged and we must await the news but here are three strangers and one as i take it a soldier fresh from service it is likely that he may give us word of what is stirring over the water  lady loring glancing up saw in the fading light three companions walking abreast down the road all gray with dust and stained with travel yet chattering merrily between themselves he in the midst was young and comely with boyish open face and bright gray eyes which glanced from right to left as though he found the world around him both new and pleasing to his right walked a huge redheaded man with broad smile and merry twinkle whose clothes seemed to be bursting and splitting at every seam as though he were some lusty chick who was breaking bravely from his shell on the other side with his knotted hand upon the young mans shoulder came a stout and burly archer brown and fierce eyed with sword at belt and long yellow yewstave peeping over his shoulder hard face battered head piece dinted brigandine with faded red lion of st george ramping on a discolored ground all proclaimed as plainly as words that he was indeed from the land of war he looked keenly at sir nigel as he approached and then plunging his hand under his breastplate he stepped up to him with a rough uncouth bow to the lady  your pardon fair sir said he but i know you the moment i clap eyes on you though in sooth i have seen you oftener in steel than in velvet i have drawn string besides you at la rochederrien romorantin maupertuis nogent auray and other places  then good archer i am right glad to welcome you to twynham castle and in the stewards room you will find provant for yourself and comrades to me also your face is known though mine eyes play such tricks with me that i can scarce be sure of my own squire rest awhile and you shall come to the hall anon and tell us what is passing in france for i have heard that it is likely that our pennons may flutter to the south of the great spanish mountains ere another year be passed  there was talk of it in bordeaux answered the archer and i saw myself that the armorers and smiths were as busy as rats in a wheatrick but i bring you this letter from the valiant gascon knight sir claude latour and to you lady he added after a pause i bring from him this box of red sugar of narbonne with every courteous and knightly greeting which a gallant cavalier may make to a fair and noble dame  this little speech had cost the blunt bowman much pains and planning but he might have spared his breath for the lady was quite as much absorbed as her lord in the letter which they held between them a hand on either corner spelling it out very slowly with drawn brows and muttering lips as they read it alleyne who stood with hordle john a few paces back from their comrade saw the lady catch her breath while the knight laughed softly to himself  you see dear heart said he that they will not leave the old dog in his kennel when the game is afoot and what of this white company archer  ah sir you speak of dogs cried aylward but there are a pack of lusty hounds who are ready for any quarry if they have but a good huntsman to halloo them on sir we have been in the wars together and i have seen many a brave following but never such a set of woodland boys as this they do but want you at their head and who will bar the way to them  pardieu said sir nigel if they are all like their messenger they are indeed men of whom a leader may be proud your name good archer  sam aylward sir of the hundred of easebourne and the rape of chichester  and this giant behind you  he is big john of hordle a forest man who hath now taken service in the company  a proper figure of a man atarms said the little knight why man you are no chicken yet i warrant him the stronger man see to that great stone from the coping which hath fallen upon the bridge four of my lazy varlets strove this day to carry it hence i would that you two could put them to shame by budging it though i fear that i overtask you for it is of a grievous weight  he pointed as he spoke to a huge roughhewn block which lay by the roadside deep sunken from its own weight in the reddish earth the archer approached it rolling back the sleeves of his jerkin but with no very hopeful countenance for indeed it was a mighty rock john however put him aside with his left hand and stooping over the stone he plucked it singlehanded from its soft bed and swung it far into the stream there it fell with mighty splash one jagged end peaking out above the surface while the waters bubbled and foamed with farcircling eddy  good lack cried sir nigel and good lack cried his lady while john stood laughing and wiping the caked dirt from his fingers  i have felt his arms round my ribs said the bowman and they crackle yet at the thought of it this other comrade of mine is a right learned clerk for all that he is so young hight alleyne the son of edric brother to the socman of minstead  young man quoth sir nigel sternly if you are of the same way of thought as your brother you may not pass under portcullis of mine  nay fair sir cried aylward hastily i will be pledge for it that they have no thought in common for this very day his brother hath set his dogs upon him and driven him from his lands  and are you too of the white company asked sir nigel hast had small experience of war if i may judge by your looks and bearing  i would fain to france with my friends here alleyne answered but i am a man of peacea reader exorcist acolyte and clerk  that need not hinder quoth sir nigel  no fair sir cried the bowman joyously why i myself have served two terms with arnold de cervolles he whom they called the archpriest by my hilt i have seen him ere now with monks gown trussed to his knees over his sandals in blood in the forefront of the battle yet ere the last string had twanged he would be down on his four bones among the stricken and have them all houseled and shriven as quick as shelling peas ma foi there were those who wished that he would have less care for their souls and a little more for their bodies  it is well to have a learned clerk in every troop said sir nigel by st paul there are men so caitiff that they think more of a scriveners pen than of their ladys smile and do their devoir in hopes that they may fill a line in a chronicle or make a tag to a jongleurs romance i remember well that at the siege of retters there was a little sleek fat clerk of the name of chaucer who was so apt at rondel sirvente or tonson that no man dare give back a foot from the walls lest he find it all set down in his rhymes and sung by every underling and varlet in the camp but my souls bird you hear me prate as though all were decided when i have not yet taken counsel either with you or with my lady mother let us to the chamber while these strangers find such fare as pantry and cellar may furnish  the night air strikes chill said the lady and turned down the road with her hand upon her lords arm the three comrades dropped behind and followed aylward much the lighter for having accomplished his mission alleyne full of wonderment at the humble bearing of so renowned a captain and john loud with snorts and sneers which spoke his disappointment and contempt  what ails the man asked aylward in surprise  i have been cozened and bejaped quoth he gruffly  by whom sir samson the strong  by thee sir balaam the false prophet  by my hilt cried the archer i though i be not balaam yet i hold converse with the very creature that spake to him what is amiss then and how have i played you false  why marry did you not say and alleyne here will be my witness that if i would hie to the wars with you you would place me under a leader who was second to none in all england for valor yet here you bring me to a shred of a man peaky and illnourished with eyes like a moulting owl who must needs forsooth take counsel with his mother ere he buckle sword to girdle  is that where the shoe galls cried the bowman and laughed aloud i will ask you what you think of him three months hence if we be all alive for sure i am that  aylwards words were interrupted by an extraordinary hubbub which broke out that instant some little way down the street in the direction of the priory there was deepmouthed shouting of men frightened shrieks of women howling and barking of curs and over all a sullen thunderous rumble indescribably menacing and terrible round the corner of the narrow street there came rushing a brace of whining dogs with tails tucked under their legs and after them a whitefaced burgher with outstretched hands and widespread fingers his hair all abristle and his eyes glinting back from one shoulder to the other as though some great terror were at his very heels fly my lady fly he screeched and whizzed past them like bolt from bow while close behind came lumbering a huge black bear with red tongue lolling from his mouth and a broken chain jangling behind him to right and left the folk flew for arch and doorway hordle john caught up the lady loring as though she had been a feather and sprang with her into an open porch while aylward with a whirl of french oaths plucked at his quiver and tried to unsling his bow alleyne all unnerved at so strange and unwonted a sight shrunk up against the wall with his eyes fixed upon the frenzied creature which came bounding along with ungainly speed looking the larger in the uncertain light its huge jaws agape with blood and slaver trickling to the ground sir nigel alone unconscious to all appearance of the universal panic walked with unfaltering step up the centre of the road a silken handkerchief in one hand and his gold comfitbox in the other it sent the blood cold through alleynes veins to see that as they came togetherthe man and the beastthe creature reared up with eyes ablaze with fear and hate and whirled its great paws above the knight to smite him to the earth he however blinking with puckered eyes reached up his kerchief and flicked the beast twice across the snout with it ah saucy saucy quoth he with gentle chiding on which the bear uncertain and puzzled dropped its four legs to earth again and waddling back was soon swathed in ropes by the bearward and a crowd of peasants who had been in close pursuit  a scared man was the keeper for having chained the brute to a stake while he drank a stoup of ale at the inn it had been baited by stray curs until in wrath and madness it had plucked loose the chain and smitten or bitten all who came in its path most scared of all was he to find that the creature had come nigh to harm the lord and lady of the castle who had power to place him in the stretchneck or to have the skin scourged from his shoulders yet when he came with bowed head and humble entreaty for forgiveness he was met with a handful of small silver from sir nigel whose dame however was less charitably disposed being much ruffled in her dignity by the manner in which she had been hustled from her lords side  as they passed through the castle gate john plucked at aylwards sleeve and the two fell behind  i must crave your pardon comrade said he bluntly i was a fool not to know that a little rooster may be the gamest i believe that this man is indeed a leader whom we may follow    chapter xi how a young shepherd had a perilous flock   black was the mouth of twynham castle though a pair of torches burning at the further end of the gateway cast a red glare over the outer bailey and sent a dim ruddy flicker through the roughhewn arch rising and falling with fitful brightness over the door the travellers could discern the escutcheon of the montacutes a roebuck gules on a field argent flanked on either side by smaller shields which bore the red roses of the veteran constable as they passed over the drawbridge alleyne marked the gleam of arms in the embrasures to right and left and they had scarce set foot upon the causeway ere a hoarse blare burst from a bugle and with screech of hinge and clank of chain the ponderous bridge swung up into the air drawn by unseen hands at the same instant the huge portcullis came rattling down from above and shut off the last fading light of day sir nigel and his lady walked on in deep talk while a fat understeward took charge of the three comrades and led them to the buttery where beef bread and beer were kept ever in readiness for the wayfarer after a hearty meal and a dip in the trough to wash the dust from them they strolled forth into the bailey where the bowman peered about through the darkness at wall and at keep with the carping eyes of one who has seen something of sieges and is not likely to be satisfied to alleyne and to john however it appeared to be as great and as stout a fortress as could be built by the hands of man  erected by sir balwin de redvers in the old fighting days of the twelfth century when men thought much of war and little of comfort castle twynham had been designed as a stronghold pure and simple unlike those later and more magnificent structures where warlike strength had been combined with the magnificence of a palace from the time of the edwards such buildings as conway or caernarvon castles to say nothing of royal windsor had shown that it was possible to secure luxury in peace as well as security in times of trouble sir nigels trust however still frowned above the smoothflowing waters of the avon very much as the stern race of early anglonormans had designed it there were the broad outer and inner bailies not paved but sown with grass to nourish the sheep and cattle which might be driven in on sign of danger all round were high and turreted walls with at the corner a bare squarefaced keep gaunt and windowless rearing up from a lofty mound which made it almost inaccessible to an assailant against the baileywalls were rows of frail wooden houses and leaning sheds which gave shelter to the archers and menatarms who formed the garrison the doors of these humble dwellings were mostly open and against the yellow glare from within alleyne could see the bearded fellows cleaning their harness while their wives would come out for a gossip with their needlework in their hands and their long black shadows streaming across the yard the air was full of the clack of their voices and the merry prattling of children in strange contrast to the flash of arms and constant warlike challenge from the walls above  methinks a company of school lads could hold this place against an army quoth john  and so say i said alleyne  nay there you are wide of the clout the bowman said gravely by my hilt i have seen a stronger fortalice carried in a summer evening i remember such a one in picardy with a name as long as a gascons pedigree it was when i served under sir robert knolles before the days of the company and we came by good plunder at the sacking of it i had myself a great silver bowl with two goblets and a plastron of spanish steel pasques dieu there are some fine women over yonder mort de ma vie see to that one in the doorway i will go speak to her but whom have we here  is there an archer here hight sam aylward asked a gaunt manatarms clanking up to them across the courtyard  my name friend quoth the bowman  then sure i have no need to tell thee mine said the other  by the rood if it is not black simon of norwich cried aylward a mon coeur camarade a mon coeur ah but i am blithe to see thee the two fell upon each other and hugged like bears  and where from old blood and bones asked the bowman  i am in service here tell me comrade is it sooth that we shall have another fling at these frenchmen it is so rumored in the guardroom and that sir nigel will take the field once more  it is like enough mon gar as things go  now may the lord be praised cried the other this very night will i set apart a golden ouche to be offered on the shrine of my namesaint i have pined for this aylward as a young maid pines for her lover  art so set on plunder then is the purse so light that there is not enough for a rouse i have a bag at my belt camarade and you have but to put your fist into it for what you want it was ever share and share between us  nay friend it is not the frenchmans gold but the frenchmans blood that i would have i should not rest quiet in the grave coz if i had not another turn at them for with us in france it has ever been fair and honest wara shut fist for the man but a bended knee for the woman but how was it at winchelsea when their galleys came down upon it some few years back i had an old mother there lad who had come down thither from the midlands to be the nearer her son they found her afterwards by her own hearthstone thrust through by a frenchmans bill my second sister my brothers wife and her two children they were but ashheaps in the smoking ruins of their house i will not say that we have not wrought great scath upon france but women and children have been safe from us and so old friend my heart is hot within me and i long to hear the old battlecry again and by gods truth if sir nigel unfurls his pennon here is one who will be right glad to feel the saddleflaps under his knees  we have seen good work together old wardog quoth aylward and by my hilt we may hope to see more ere we die but we are more like to hawk at the spanish woodcock than at the french heron though certes it is rumored that du guesclin with all the best lances of france have taken service under the lions and towers of castile but comrade it is in my mind that there is some small matter of dispute still open between us  fore god it is sooth cried the other i had forgot it the provostmarshal and his men tore us apart when last we met  on which friend we vowed that we should settle the point when next we came together hast thy sword i see and the moon throws glimmer enough for such old nightbirds as we on guard mon gar i have not heard clink of steel this month or more  out from the shadow then said the other drawing his sword a vow is a vow and not lightly to be broken  a vow to the saints cried alleyne is indeed not to be set aside but this is a devils vow and simple clerk as i am i am yet the mouthpiece of the true church when i say that it were mortal sin to fight on such a quarrel what shall two grown men carry malice for years and fly like snarling curs at each others throats  no malice my young clerk no malice quoth black simon i have not a bitter drop in my heart for mine old comrade but the quarrel as he hath told you is still open and unsettled fall on aylward  not whilst i can stand between you cried alleyne springing before the bowman it is shame and sin to see two christian englishmen turn swords against each other like the frenzied bloodthirsty paynim  and what is more said hordle john suddenly appearing out of the buttery with the huge board upon which the pastry was rolled if either raise sword i shall flatten him like a shrovetide pancake by the black rood i shall drive him into the earth like a nail into a door rather than see you do scath to each other  fore god this is a strange way of preaching peace cried black simon you may find the scath yourself my lusty friend if you raise your great cudgel to me i had as lief have the castle drawbridge drop upon my pate  tell me aylward said alleyne earnestly with his hands outstretched to keep the pair asunder what is the cause of quarrel that we may see whether honorable settlement may not be arrived at  the bowman looked down at his feet and then up at the moons parbleu he cried the cause of quarrel why mon petit it was years ago in limousin and how can i bear in mind what was the cause of it simon there hath it at the end of his tongue  not i in troth replied the other i have had other things to think of there was some sort of bickering over dice or wine or was it a woman coz  pasques dieu but you have nicked it cried aylward it was indeed about a woman and the quarrel must go forward for i am still of the same mind as before  what of the woman then asked simon may the murrain strike me if i can call to mind aught about her  it was la blanche rose maid at the sign of the trois corbeaux at limoges bless her pretty heart why mon gar i loved her  so did a many quoth simon i call her to mind now on the very day that we fought over the little hussy she went off with evan ap price a longlegged welsh dagsman they have a hostel of their own now somewhere on the banks of the garonne where the landlord drinks so much of the liquor that there is little left for the customers  so ends our quarrel then said aylward sheathing his sword a welsh dagsman i faith cetait mauvais gout camarade and the more so when she had a jolly archer and a lusty manatarms to choose from  true old lad and it is as well that we can compose our differences honorably for sir nigel had been out at the first clash of steel and he hath sworn that if there be quarrelling in the garrison he would smite the right hand from the broilers you know him of old and that he is like to be as good as his word  mortdieu yes but there are ale mead and wine in the buttery and the steward a merry rogue who will not haggle over a quart or two buvons mon gar for it is not every day that two old friends come together  the old soldiers and hordle john strode off together in all good fellowship alleyne had turned to follow them when he felt a touch upon his shoulder and found a young page by his side  the lord loring commands said the boy that you will follow me to the great chamber and await him there  but my comrades  his commands were for you alone  alleyne followed the messenger to the east end of the courtyard where a broad flight of steps led up to the doorway of the main hall the outer wall of which is washed by the waters of the avon as designed at first no dwelling had been allotted to the lord of the castle and his family but the dark and dismal basement story of the keep a more civilized or more effeminate generation however had refused to be pent up in such a cellar and the hall with its neighboring chambers had been added for their accommodation up the broad steps alleyne went still following his boyish guide until at the folding oak doors the latter paused and ushered him into the main hall of the castle  on entering the room the clerk looked round but seeing no one he continued to stand his cap in his hand examining with the greatest interest a chamber which was so different to any to which he was accustomed the days had gone by when a noblemans hall was but a barnlike rushstrewn enclosure the common lounge and eatingroom of every inmate of the castle the crusaders had brought back with them experiences of domestic luxuries of damascus carpets and rugs of aleppo which made them impatient of the hideous bareness and want of privacy which they found in their ancestral strongholds still stronger however had been the influence of the great french war for however well matched the nations might be in martial exercises there could be no question but that our neighbors were infinitely superior to us in the arts of peace a stream of returning knights of wounded soldiers and of unransomed french noblemen had been for a quarter of a century continually pouring into england every one of whom exerted an influence in the direction of greater domestic refinement while shiploads of french furniture from calais rouen and other plundered towns had supplied our own artisans with models on which to shape their work hence in most english castles and in castle twynham among the rest chambers were to be found which would seem to be not wanting either in beauty or in comfort  in the great stone fireplace a log fire was spurting and crackling throwing out a ruddy glare which with the four bracketlamps which stood at each corner of the room gave a bright and lightsome air to the whole apartment above was a wreathwork of blazonry extending up to the carved and corniced oaken roof while on either side stood the high canopied chairs placed for the master of the house and for his most honored guest the walls were hung all round with most elaborate and brightly colored tapestry representing the achievements of sir bevis of hampton and behind this convenient screen were stored the tables dormant and benches which would be needed for banquet or high festivity the floor was of polished tiles with a square of red and black diapered flemish carpet in the centre and many settees cushions folding chairs and carved bancals littered all over it at the further end was a long black buffet or dresser thickly covered with gold cups silver salvers and other such valuables all this alleyne examined with curious eyes but most interesting of all to him was a small ebony table at his very side on which by the side of a chessboard and the scattered chessmen there lay an open manuscript written in a right clerkly hand and set forth with brave flourishes and devices along the margins in vain alleyne bethought him of where he was and of those laws of good breeding and decorum which should restrain him those colored capitals and black even lines drew his hand down to them as the loadstone draws the needle until almost before he knew it he was standing with the romance of garin de montglane before his eyes so absorbed in its contents as to be completely oblivious both of where he was and why he had come there  he was brought back to himself however by a sudden little ripple of quick feminine laughter aghast he dropped the manuscript among the chessmen and stared in bewilderment round the room it was as empty and as still as ever again he stretched his hand out to the romance and again came that roguish burst of merriment he looked up at the ceiling back at the closed door and round at the stiff folds of motionless tapestry of a sudden however he caught a quick shimmer from the corner of a highbacked bancal in front of him and shifting a pace or two to the side saw a white slender hand which held a mirror of polished silver in such a way that the concealed observer could see without being seen he stood irresolute uncertain whether to advance or to take no notice but even as he hesitated the mirror was whipped in and a tall and stately young lady swept out from behind the oaken screen with a dancing light of mischief in her eyes alleyne started with astonishment as he recognized the very maiden who had suffered from his brothers violence in the forest she no longer wore her gay ridingdress however but was attired in a long sweeping robe of black velvet of bruges with delicate tracery of white lace at neck and at wrist scarce to be seen against her ivory skin beautiful as she had seemed to him before the lithe charm of her figure and the proud free grace of her bearing were enhanced now by the rich simplicity of her attire  ah you start said she with the same sidelong look of mischief and i cannot marvel at it didst not look to see the distressed damosel again oh that i were a minstrel that i might put it into rhyme with the whole romancethe luckless maid the wicked socman and the virtuous clerk so might our fame have gone down together for all time and you be numbered with sir percival or sir galahad or all the other rescuers of oppressed ladies  what i did said alleyne was too small a thing for thanks and yet if i may say it without offence it was too grave and near a matter for mirth and raillery i had counted on my brothers love but god has willed that it should be otherwise it is a joy to me to see you again lady and to know that you have reached home in safety if this be indeed your home  yes in sooth castle twynham is my home and sir nigel loring my father i should have told you so this morning but you said that you were coming thither so i bethought me that i might hold it back as a surprise to you oh dear but it was brave to see you she cried bursting out alaughing once more and standing with her hand pressed to her side and her halfclosed eyes twinkling with amusement you drew back and came forward with your eyes upon my book there like the mouse who sniffs the cheese and yet dreads the trap  i take shame said alleyne that i should have touched it  nay it warmed my very heart to see it so glad was i that i laughed for very pleasure my fine preacher can himself be tempted then thought i he is not made of another clay to the rest of us  god help me i am the weakest of the weak groaned alleyne i pray that i may have more strength  and to what end she asked sharply if you are as i understand to shut yourself forever in your cell within the four walls of an abbey then of what use would it be were your prayer to be answered  the use of my own salvation  she turned from him with a pretty shrug and wave is that all she said then you are no better than father christopher and the rest of them your own your own ever your own my father is the kings man and when he rides into the press of fight he is not thinking ever of the saving of his own poor body he recks little enough if he leave it on the field why then should you who are soldiers of the spirit be ever moping or hiding in cell or in cave with minds full of your own concerns while the world which you should be mending is going on its way and neither sees nor hears you were ye all as thoughtless of your own souls as the soldier is of his body ye would be of more avail to the souls of others  there is sooth in what you say lady alleyne answered and yet i scarce can see what you would have the clergy and the church to do  i would have them live as others and do mens work in the world preaching by their lives rather than their words i would have them come forth from their lonely places mix with the borel folks feel the pains and the pleasures the cares and the rewards the temptings and the stirrings of the common people let them toil and swinken and labor and plough the land and take wives to themselves  alas alas cried alleyne aghast you have surely sucked this poison from the man wicliffe of whom i have heard such evil things  nay i know him not i have learned it by looking from my own chamber window and marking these poor monks of the priory their weary life their profitless round i have asked myself if the best which can be done with virtue is to shut it within high walls as though it were some savage creature if the good will lock themselves up and if the wicked will still wander free then alas for the world  alleyne looked at her in astonishment for her cheek was flushed her eyes gleaming and her whole pose full of eloquence and conviction yet in an instant she had changed again to her old expression of merriment leavened with mischief  wilt do what i ask said she  what is it lady  oh most ungallant clerk a true knight would never have asked but would have vowed upon the instant tis but to bear me out in what i say to my father  in what  in saying if he ask that it was south of the christchurch road that i met you i shall be shut up with the tirewomen else and have a week of spindle and bodkin when i would fain be galloping troubadour up wilverley walk or loosing little roland at the vinney ridge herons  i shall not answer him if he ask  not answer but he will have an answer nay but you must not fail me or it will go ill with me  but lady cried poor alleyne in great distress how can i say that it was to the south of the road when i know well that it was four miles to the north  you will not say it  surely you will not too when you know that it is not so  oh i weary of your preaching she cried and swept away with a toss of her beautiful head leaving alleyne as cast down and ashamed as though he had himself proposed some infamous thing she was back again in an instant however in another of her varying moods  look at that my friend said she if you had been shut up in abbey or in cell this day you could not have taught a wayward maiden to abide by the truth is it not so what avail is the shepherd if he leaves his sheep  a sorry shepherd said alleyne humbly but here is your noble father  and you shall see how worthy a pupil i am father i am much beholden to this young clerk who was of service to me and helped me this very morning in minstead woods four miles to the north of the christchurch road where i had no call to be you having ordered it otherwise all this she reeled off in a loud voice and then glanced with sidelong questioning eyes at alleyne for his approval  sir nigel who had entered the room with a silveryhaired old lady upon his arm stared aghast at this sudden outburst of candor  maude maude said he shaking his head it is more hard for me to gain obedience from you than from the ten score drunken archers who followed me to guienne yet hush little one for your fair ladymother will be here anon and there is no need that she should know it we will keep you from the provostmarshal this journey away to your chamber sweeting and keep a blithe face for she who confesses is shriven and now fair mother he continued when his daughter had gone sit you here by the fire for your blood runs colder than it did alleyne edricson i would have a word with you for i would fain that you should take service under me and here in good time comes my lady without whose counsel it is not my wont to decide aught of import but indeed it was her own thought that you should come  for i have formed a good opinion of you and can see that you are one who may be trusted said the lady loring and in good sooth my dear lord hath need of such a one by his side for he recks so little of himself that there should be one there to look to his needs and meet his wants you have seen the cloisters it were well that you should see the world too ere you make choice for life between them  it was for that very reason that my father willed that i should come forth into the world at my twentieth year said alleyne  then your father was a man of good counsel said she and you cannot carry out his will better than by going on this path where all that is noble and gallant in england will be your companions  you can ride asked sir nigel looking at the youth with puckered eyes  yes i have ridden much at the abbey  yet there is a difference betwixt a friars hack and a warriors destrier you can sing and play  on citole flute and rebeck  good you can read blazonry  indifferent well  then read this quoth sir nigel pointing upwards to one of the many quarterings which adorned the wall over the fireplace  argent alleyne answered a fess azure charged with three lozenges dividing three mullets sable over all on an escutcheon of the first a jambe gules  a jambe gules erased said sir nigel shaking his head solemnly yet it is not amiss for a monkbred man i trust that you are lowly and serviceable  i have served all my life my lord  canst carve too  i have carved two days a week for the brethren  a model truly wilt make a squire of squires but tell me i pray canst curl hair  no my lord but i could learn  it is of import said he for i love to keep my hair well ordered seeing that the weight of my helmet for thirty years hath in some degree frayed it upon the top he pulled off his velvet cap of maintenance as he spoke and displayed a pate which was as bald as an egg and shone bravely in the firelight you see said he whisking round and showing one little strip where a line of scattered hairs like the last survivors in some fatal field still barely held their own against the fate which had fallen upon their comrades these locks need some little oiling and curling for i doubt not that if you look slantwise at my head when the light is good you will yourself perceive that there are places where the hair is sparse  it is for you also to bear the purse said the lady for my sweet lord is of so free and gracious a temper that he would give it gayly to the first who asked alms of him all these things with some knowledge of venerie and of the management of horse hawk and hound with the grace and hardihood and courtesy which are proper to your age will make you a fit squire for sir nigel loring  alas lady alleyne answered i know well the great honor that you have done me in deeming me worthy to wait upon so renowned a knight yet i am so conscious of my own weakness that i scarce dare incur duties which i might be so illfitted to fulfil  modesty and a humble mind said she are the very first and rarest gifts in page or squire your words prove that you have these and all the rest is but the work of use and time but there is no call for haste rest upon it for the night and let your orisons ask for guidance in the matter we knew your father well and would fain help his son though we have small cause to love your brother the socman who is forever stirring up strife in the county  we can scare hope said nigel to have all ready for our start before the feast of st luke for there is much to be done in the time you will have leisure therefore if it please you to take service under me in which to learn your devoir bertrand my daughters page is hot to go but in sooth he is over young for such rough work as may be before us  and i have one favor to crave from you added the lady of the castle as alleyne turned to leave their presence you have as i understand much learning which you have acquired at beaulieu  little enough lady compared with those who were my teachers  yet enough for my purpose i doubt not for i would have you give an hour or two a day whilst you are with us in discoursing with my daughter the lady maude for she is somewhat backward i fear and hath no love for letters save for these poor fond romances which do but fill her empty head with dreams of enchanted maidens and of errant cavaliers father christopher comes over after nones from the priory but he is stricken with years and slow of speech so that she gets small profit from his teaching i would have you do what you can with her and with agatha my young tirewoman and with dorothy pierpont  and so alleyne found himself not only chosen as squire to a knight but also as squire to three damosels which was even further from the part which he had thought to play in the world yet he could but agree to do what he might and so went forth from the castle hall with his face flushed and his head in a whirl at the thought of the strange and perilous paths which his feet were destined to tread    chapter xii how alleyne learned more than he could teach   and now there came a time of stir and bustle of furbishing of arms and clang of hammer from all the southland counties fast spread the tidings from thorpe to thorpe and from castle to castle that the old game was afoot once more and the lions and lilies to be in the field with the early spring great news this for that fierce old country whose trade for a generation had been war her exports archers and her imports prisoners for six years her sons had chafed under an unwonted peace now they flew to their arms as to their birthright the old soldiers of crecy of nogent and of poictiers were glad to think that they might hear the wartrumpet once more and gladder still were the hot youth who had chafed for years under the martial tales of their sires to pierce the great mountains of the south to fight the tamers of the fiery moors to follow the greatest captain of the age to find sunny cornfields and vineyards when the marches of picardy and normandy were as rare and bleak as the jedburgh forestshere was a golden prospect for a race of warriors from sea to sea there was stringing of bows in the cottage and clang of steel in the castle  nor did it take long for every stronghold to pour forth its cavalry and every hamlet its footmen through the late autumn and the early winter every road and country lane resounded with nakir and trumpet with the neigh of the warhorse and the clatter of marching men from the wrekin in the welsh marches to the cotswolds in the west or butser in the south there was no hilltop from which the peasant might not have seen the bright shimmer of arms the toss and flutter of plume and of pensil from byepath from woodland clearing or from winding moorside track these little rivulets of steel united in the larger roads to form a broader stream growing ever fuller and larger as it approached the nearest or most commodious seaport and there all day and day after day there was bustle and crowding and labor while the great ships loaded up and one after the other spread their white pinions and darted off to the open sea amid the clash of cymbals and rolling of drums and lusty shouts of those who went and of those who waited from orwell to the dart there was no port which did not send forth its little fleet gay with streamer and bunting as for a joyous festival thus in the season of the waning days the might of england put forth on to the waters  in the ancient and populous county of hampshire there was no lack of leaders or of soldiers for a service which promised either honor or profit in the north the saracens head of the brocas and the scarlet fish of the de roches were waving over a strong body of archers from holt woolmer and harewood forests de borhunte was up in the east and sir john de montague in the west sir luke de ponynges sir thomas west sir maurice de bruin sir arthur lipscombe sir walter ramsey and stout sir oliver buttesthorn were all marching south with levies from andover arlesford odiham and winchester while from sussex came sir john clinton sir thomas cheyne and sir john fallislee with a troop of picked menatarms making for their port at southampton greatest of all the musters however was that of twynham castle for the name and the fame of sir nigel loring drew towards him the keenest and boldest spirits all eager to serve under so valiant a leader archers from the new forest and the forest of bere billmen from the pleasant country which is watered by the stour the avon and the itchen young cavaliers from the ancient hampshire houses all were pushing for christchurch to take service under the banner of the five scarlet roses  and now could sir nigel have shown the bachelles of land which the laws of rank required he might well have cut his forked pennon into a square banner and taken such a following into the field as would have supported the dignity of a banneret but poverty was heavy upon him his land was scant his coffers empty and the very castle which covered him the holding of another sore was his heart when he saw rare bowmen and warhardened spearmen turned away from his gates for the lack of the money which might equip and pay them yet the letter which aylward had brought him gave him powers which he was not slow to use in it sir claude latour the gascon lieutenant of the white company assured him that there remained in his keeping enough to fit out a hundred archers and twenty menatarms which joined to the three hundred veteran companions already in france would make a force which any leader might be proud to command carefully and sagaciously the veteran knight chose out his men from the swarm of volunteers many an anxious consultation he held with black simon sam aylward and other of his more experienced followers as to who should come and who should stay by all saints day however ere the last leaves had fluttered to earth in the wilverley and holmesley glades he had filled up his full numbers and mustered under his banner as stout a following of hampshire foresters as ever twanged their warbows twenty menatarms too well mounted and equipped formed the cavalry of the party while young peter terlake of fareham and walter ford of botley the martial sons of martial sires came at their own cost to wait upon sir nigel and to share with alleyne edricson the duties of his squireship  yet even after the enrolment there was much to be done ere the party could proceed upon its way for armor swords and lances there was no need to take much forethought for they were to be had both better and cheaper in bordeaux than in england with the longbow however it was different yew staves indeed might be got in spain but it was well to take enough and to spare with them then three spare cords should be carried for each bow with a great store of arrowheads besides the brigandines of chain mail the wadded steel caps and the brassarts or armguards which were the proper equipment of the archer above all the women for miles round were hard at work cutting the white surcoats which were the badge of the company and adorning them with the red lion of st george upon the centre of the breast when all was completed and the muster called in the castle yard the oldest soldier of the french wars was fain to confess that he had never looked upon a better equipped or more warlike body of men from the old knight with his silk jupon sitting his great black warhorse in the front of them to hordle john the giant recruit who leaned carelessly upon a huge black bowstave in the rear of the six score fully half had seen service before while a fair sprinkling were men who had followed the wars all their lives and had a hand in those battles which had made the whole world ring with the fame and the wonder of the island infantry  six long weeks were taken in these preparations and it was close on martinmas ere all was ready for a start nigh two months had alleyne edricson been in castle twynhammonths which were fated to turn the whole current of his life to divert it from that dark and lonely bourne towards which it tended and to guide it into freer and more sunlit channels already he had learned to bless his father for that wise provision which had made him seek to know the world ere he had ventured to renounce it  for it was a different place from that which he had picturedvery different from that which he had heard described when the master of the novices held forth to his charges upon the ravening wolves who lurked for them beyond the peaceful folds of beaulieu there was cruelty in it doubtless and lust and sin and sorrow but were there not virtues to atone robust positive virtues which did not shrink from temptation which held their own in all the rough blasts of the workaday world how colorless by contrast appeared the sinlessness which came from inability to sin the conquest which was attained by flying from the enemy monkbred as he was alleyne had native shrewdness and a mind which was young enough to form new conclusions and to outgrow old ones he could not fail to see that the men with whom he was thrown in contact roughtongued fierce and quarrelsome as they were were yet of deeper nature and of more service in the world than the oxeyed brethren who rose and ate and slept from years end to years end in their own narrow stagnant circle of existence abbot berghersh was a good man but how was he better than this kindly knight who lived as simple a life held as lofty and inflexible an ideal of duty and did with all his fearless heart whatever came to his hand to do in turning from the service of the one to that of the other alleyne could not feel that he was lowering his aims in life true that his gentle and thoughtful nature recoiled from the grim work of war yet in those days of martial orders and militant brotherhoods there was no gulf fixed betwixt the priest and the soldier the man of god and the man of the sword might without scandal be united in the same individual why then should he a mere clerk have scruples when so fair a chance lay in his way of carrying out the spirit as well as the letter of his fathers provision much struggle it cost him anxious spiritquestionings and midnight prayings with many a doubt and a misgiving but the issue was that ere he had been three days in castle twynham he had taken service under sir nigel and had accepted horse and harness the same to be paid for out of his share of the profits of the expedition henceforth for seven hours a day he strove in the tiltyard to qualify himself to be a worthy squire to so worthy a knight young supple and active with all the pent energies from years of pure and healthy living it was not long before he could manage his horse and his weapon well enough to earn an approving nod from critical menatarms or to hold his own against terlake and ford his fellowservitors  but were there no other considerations which swayed him from the cloisters towards the world so complex is the human spirit that it can itself scarce discern the deep springs which impel it to action yet to alleyne had been opened now a side of life of which he had been as innocent as a child but one which was of such deep import that it could not fail to influence him in choosing his path a woman in monkish precepts had been the embodiment and concentration of what was dangerous and evila focus whence spread all that was to be dreaded and avoided so defiling was their presence that a true cistercian might not raise his eyes to their face or touch their fingertips under ban of church and fear of deadly sin yet here day after day for an hour after nones and for an hour before vespers he found himself in close communion with three maidens all young all fair and all therefore doubly dangerous from the monkish standpoint yet he found that in their presence he was conscious of a quick sympathy a pleasant ease a ready response to all that was most gentle and best in himself which filled his soul with a vague and newfound joy  and yet the lady maude loring was no easy pupil to handle an older and more worldwise man might have been puzzled by her varying moods her sudden prejudices her quick resentment at all constraint and authority did a subject interest her was there space in it for either romance or imagination she would fly through it with her subtle active mind leaving her two fellowstudents and even her teacher toiling behind her on the other hand were there dull patience needed with steady toil and strain of memory no single fact could by any driving be fixed in her mind alleyne might talk to her of the stories of old gods and heroes of gallant deeds and lofty aims or he might hold forth upon moon and stars and let his fancy wander over the hidden secrets of the universe and he would have a rapt listener with flushed cheeks and eloquent eyes who could repeat after him the very words which had fallen from his lips but when it came to almagest and astrolabe the counting of figures and reckoning of epicycles away would go her thoughts to horse and hound and a vacant eye and listless face would warn the teacher that he had lost his hold upon his scholar then he had but to bring out the old romance book from the priory with befingered cover of sheepskin and gold letters upon a purple ground to entice her wayward mind back to the paths of learning  at times too when the wild fit was upon her she would break into pertness and rebel openly against alleynes gentle firmness yet he would jog quietly on with his teachings taking no heed to her mutiny until suddenly she would be conquered by his patience and break into selfrevilings a hundred times stronger than her fault demanded it chanced however that on one of these mornings when the evil mood was upon her agatha the young tirewoman thinking to please her mistress began also to toss her head and make tart rejoinder to the teachers questions in an instant the lady maude had turned upon her two blazing eyes and a face which was blanched with anger  you would dare said she you would dare the frightened tirewoman tried to excuse herself but my fair lady she stammered what have i done i have said no more than i heard  you would dare repeated the lady in a choking voice you a graceless baggage a foolish lackbrain with no thought above the hemming of shifts and he so kindly and hendy and longsuffering you wouldha you may well flee the room  she had spoken with a rising voice and a clasping and opening of her long white fingers so that it was no marvel that ere the speech was over the skirts of agatha were whisking round the door and the click of her sobs to be heard dying swiftly away down the corridor  alleyne stared openeyed at this tigress who had sprung so suddenly to his rescue there is no need for such anger he said mildly the maids words have done me no scath it is you yourself who have erred  i know it she cried i am a most wicked woman but it is bad enough that one should misuse you ma foi i will see that there is not a second one  nay nay no one has misused me he answered but the fault lies in your hot and bitter words you have called her a baggage and a lackbrain and i know not what  and you are he who taught me to speak the truth she cried now i have spoken it and yet i cannot please you lackbrain she is and lackbrain i shall call her  such was a sample of the sudden janglings which marred the peace of that little class as the weeks passed however they became fewer and less violent as alleynes firm and constant nature gained sway and influence over the lady maude and yet sooth to say there were times when he had to ask himself whether it was not the lady maude who was gaining sway and influence over him if she were changing so was he in drawing her up from the world he was day by day being himself dragged down towards it in vain he strove and reasoned with himself as to the madness of letting his mind rest upon sir nigels daughter what was hea younger son a penniless clerk a squire unable to pay for his own harnessthat he should dare to raise his eyes to the fairest maid in hampshire so spake reason but in spite of all her voice was ever in his ears and her image in his heart stronger than reason stronger than cloister teachings stronger than all that might hold him back was that old old tyrant who will brook no rival in the kingdom of youth  and yet it was a surprise and a shock to himself to find how deeply she had entered into his life how completely those vague ambitions and yearnings which had filled his spiritual nature centred themselves now upon this thing of earth he had scarce dared to face the change which had come upon him when a few sudden chance words showed it all up hard and clear like a lightning flash in the darkness  he had ridden over to poole one november day with his fellowsquire peter terlake in quest of certain yewstaves from wat swathling the dorsetshire armorer the day for their departure had almost come and the two youths spurred it over the lonely downs at the top of their speed on their homeward course for evening had fallen and there was much to be done peter was a hard wiry brown faced countrybred lad who looked on the coming war as the schoolboy looks on his holidays this day however he had been sombre and mute with scarce a word a mile to bestow upon his comrade  tell me alleyne edricson he broke out suddenly as they clattered along the winding track which leads over the bournemouth hills has it not seemed to you that of late the lady maude is paler and more silent than is her wont  it may be so the other answered shortly  and would rather sit distrait by her oriel than ride gayly to the chase as of old methinks alleyne it is this learning which you have taught her that has taken all the life and sap from her it is more than she can master like a heavy spear to a light rider  her ladymother has so ordered it said alleyne  by our lady and withouten disrespect quoth terlake it is in my mind that her ladymother is more fitted to lead a company to a storming than to have the upbringing of this tender and milkwhite maid hark ye lad alleyne to what i never told man or woman yet i love the fair lady maude and would give the last drop of my hearts blood to serve her he spoke with a gasping voice and his face flushed crimson in the moonlight  alleyne said nothing but his heart seemed to turn to a lump of ice in his bosom  my father has broad acres the other continued from fareham creek to the slope of the portsdown hill there is filling of granges hewing of wood malting of grain and herding of sheep as much as heart could wish and i the only son sure am i that sir nigel would be blithe at such a match  but how of the lady asked alleyne with dry lips  ah lad there lies my trouble it is a toss of the head and a droop of the eyes if i say one word of what is in my mind twere as easy to woo the snowdame that we shaped last winter in our castle yard i did but ask her yesternight for her green veil that i might bear it as a token or lambrequin upon my helm but she flashed out at me that she kept it for a better man and then all in a breath asked pardon for that she had spoke so rudely yet she would not take back the words either nor would she grant the veil has it seemed to thee alleyne that she loves any one  nay i cannot say said alleyne with a wild throb of sudden hope in his heart  i have thought so and yet i cannot name the man indeed save myself and walter ford and you who are half a clerk and father christopher of the priory and bertrand the page who is there whom she sees  i cannot tell quoth alleyne shortly and the two squires rode on again each intent upon his own thoughts  next day at morning lesson the teacher observed that his pupil was indeed looking pale and jaded with listless eyes and a weary manner he was heavyhearted to note the grievous change in her  your mistress i fear is ill agatha he said to the tirewoman when the lady maude had sought her chamber  the maid looked aslant at him with laughing eyes it is not an illness that kills quoth she  pray god not he cried but tell me agatha what it is that ails her  methinks that i could lay my hand upon another who is smitten with the same trouble said she with the same sidelong look canst not give a name to it and thou so skilled in leechcraft  nay save that she seems aweary  well bethink you that it is but three days ere you will all be gone and castle twynham be as dull as the priory is there not enough there to cloud a ladys brow  in sooth yes he answered i had forgot that she is about to lose her father  her father cried the tirewoman with a little trill of laughter oh simple simple and she was off down the passage like arrow from bow while alleyne stood gazing after her betwixt hope and doubt scarce daring to put faith in the meaning which seemed to underlie her words    chapter xiii how the white company set forth to the wars   st lukes day had come and had gone and it was in the season of martinmas when the oxen are driven in to the slaughter that the white company was ready for its journey loud shrieked the brazen bugles from keep and from gateway and merry was the rattle of the wardrum as the men gathered in the outer bailey with torches to light them for the morn had not yet broken alleyne from the window of the armory looked down upon the strange scenethe circles of yellow flickering light the lines of stern and bearded faces the quick shimmer of arms and the lean heads of the horses in front stood the bowmen ten deep with a fringe of underofficers who paced hither and thither marshalling the ranks with curt precept or short rebuke behind were the little clump of steelclad horsemen their lances raised with long pensils drooping down the oaken shafts so silent and still were they that they might have been metalsheathed statues were it not for the occasional quick impatient stamp of their chargers or the rattle of chamfron against neckplates as they tossed and strained a spears length in front of them sat the spare and longlimbed figure of black simon the norwich fighting man his fierce deeplined face framed in steel and the silk guidon marked with the five scarlet roses slanting over his right shoulder all round in the edge of the circle of the light stood the castle servants the soldiers who were to form the garrison and little knots of women who sobbed in their aprons and called shrilly to their namesaints to watch over the wat or will or peterkin who had turned his hand to the work of war  the young squire was leaning forward gazing at the stirring and martial scene when he heard a short quick gasp at his shoulder and there was the lady maude with her hand to her heart leaning up against the wall slender and fair like a halfplucked lily her face was turned away from him but he could see by the sharp intake of her breath that she was weeping bitterly  alas alas he cried all unnerved at the sight why is it that you are so sad lady  it is the sight of these brave men she answered and to think how many of them go and how few are like to find their way back i have seen it before when i was a little maid in the year of the princes great battle i remember then how they mustered in the bailey even as they do now and my ladymother holding me in her arms at this very window that i might see the show  please god you will see them all back ere another year be out said he  she shook her head looking round at him with flushed cheeks and eyes that sparkled in the lamplight oh but i hate myself for being a woman she cried with a stamp of her little foot what can i do that is good here i must bide and talk and sew and spin and spin and sew and talk ever the same dull round with nothing at the end of it and now you are going too who could carry my thoughts out of these gray walls and raise my mind above tapestry and distaffs what can i do i am of no more use or value than that broken bowstave  you are of such value to me he cried in a whirl of hot passionate words that all else has become nought you are my heart my life my one and only thought oh maude i cannot live without you i cannot leave you without a word of love all is changed to me since i have known you i am poor and lowly and all unworthy of you but if great love may weigh down such defects then mine may do it give me but one word of hope to take to the wars with mebut one ah you shrink you shudder my wild words have frightened you  twice she opened her lips and twice no sound came from them at last she spoke in a hard and measured voice as one who dare not trust herself to speak too freely  this is over sudden she said it is not so long since the world was nothing to you you have changed once perchance you may change again  cruel he cried who hath changed me  and then your brother she continued with a little laugh disregarding his question methinks this hath become a family custom amongst the edricsons nay i am sorry i did not mean a jibe but indeed alleyne this hath come suddenly upon me and i scarce know what to say  say some word of hope however distantsome kind word that i may cherish in my heart  nay alleyne it were a cruel kindness and you have been too good and true a friend to me that i should use you despitefully there cannot be a closer link between us it is madness to think of it were there no other reasons it is enough that my father and your brother would both cry out against it  my brother what has he to do with it and your father  come alleyne was it not you who would have me act fairly to all men and certes to my father amongst them  you say truly he cried you say truly but you do not reject me maude you give me some ray of hope i do not ask pledge or promise say only that i am not hateful to youthat on some happier day i may hear kinder words from you  her eyes softened upon him and a kind answer was on her lips when a hoarse shout with the clatter of arms and stamping of steeds rose up from the bailey below at the sound her face set her eyes sparkled and she stood with flushed cheek and head thrown backa womans body with a soul of fire  my father hath gone down she cried your place is by his side nay look not at me alleyne it is no time for dallying win my fathers love and all may follow it is when the brave soldier hath done his devoir that he hopes for his reward farewell and may god be with you she held out her white slim hand to him but as he bent his lips over it she whisked away and was gone leaving in his outstretched hand the very green veil for which poor peter terlake had craved in vain again the hoarse cheering burst out from below and he heard the clang of the rising portcullis pressing the veil to his lips he thrust it into the bosom of his tunic and rushed as fast as feet could bear him to arm himself and join the muster  the raw morning had broken ere the hot spiced ale had been served round and the last farewell spoken a cold wind blew up from the sea and ragged clouds drifted swiftly across the sky  the christchurch townsfolk stood huddled about the bridge of avon the women pulling tight their shawls and the men swathing themselves in their gaberdines while down the winding path from the castle came the van of the little army their feet clanging on the hard frozen road first came black simon with his banner bestriding a lean and powerful dapplegray charger as hard and wiry and warwise as himself after him riding three abreast were nine menatarms all picked soldiers who had followed the french wars before and knew the marches of picardy as they knew the downs of their native hampshire they were armed to the teeth with lance sword and mace with square shields notched at the upper righthand corner to serve as a spearrest for defence each man wore a coat of interlaced leathern thongs strengthened at the shoulder elbow and upper arm with slips of steel greaves and kneepieces were also of leather backed by steel and their gauntlets and shoes were of iron plates craftily jointed so with jingle of arms and clatter of hoofs they rode across the bridge of avon while the burghers shouted lustily for the flag of the five roses and its gallant guard  close at the heels of the horses came twoscore archers bearded and burly their round targets on their backs and their long yellow bows the most deadly weapon that the wit of man had yet devised thrusting forth from behind their shoulders from each mans girdle hung sword or axe according to his humor and over the right hip there jutted out the leathern quiver with its bristle of goose pigeon and peacock feathers behind the bowmen strode two trumpeters blowing upon nakirs and two drummers in particolored clothes after them came twentyseven sumpter horses carrying tentpoles cloth spare arms spurs wedges cooking kettles horseshoes bags of nails and the hundred other things which experience had shown to be needful in a harried and hostile country a white mule with red trappings led by a varlet carried sir nigels own napery and table comforts then came twoscore more archers ten more menatarms and finally a rear guard of twenty bowmen with big john towering in the front rank and the veteran aylward marching by the side his battered harness and faded surcoat in strange contrast with the snowwhite jupons and shining brigandines of his companions a quick crossfire of greetings and questions and rough west saxon jests flew from rank to rank or were bandied about betwixt the marching archers and the gazing crowd  hola gaffer higginson cried aylward as he spied the portly figure of the village innkeeper no more of thy nutbrown mon gar we leave it behind us  by st paul no cried the other you take it with you devil a drop have you left in the great kilderkin it was time for you to go  if your cask is leer i warrant your purse is full gaffer shouted hordle john see that you lay in good store of the best for our homecoming  see that you keep your throat whole for the drinking of it archer cried a voice and the crowd laughed at the rough pleasantry  if you will warrant the beer i will warrant the throat said john composedly  close up the ranks cried aylward en avant mes enfants ah by my finger bones there is my sweet mary from the priory mill ma foi but she is beautiful adieu mary ma cherie mon coeur est toujours a toi brace your belt watkins man and swing your shoulders as a free companion should by my hilt your jerkins will be as dirty as mine ere you clap eyes on hengistbury head again  the company had marched to the turn of the road ere sir nigel loring rode out from the gateway mounted on pommers his great black warhorse whose ponderous footfall on the wooden drawbridge echoed loudly from the gloomy arch which spanned it sir nigel was still in his velvet dress of peace with flat velvet cap of maintenance and curling ostrich feather clasped in a golden brooch to his three squires riding behind him it looked as though he bore the birds egg as well as its feather for the back of his bald pate shone like a globe of ivory he bore no arms save the long and heavy sword which hung at his saddlebow but terlake carried in front of him the high wiverncrested bassinet ford the heavy ash spear with swallowtail pennon while alleyne was entrusted with the emblazoned shield the lady loring rode her palfrey at her lords bridlearm for she would see him as far as the edge of the forest and ever and anon she turned her hardlined face up wistfully to him and ran a questioning eye over his apparel and appointments  i trust that there is nothing forgot she said beckoning to alleyne to ride on her further side i trust him to you edricson hosen shirts cyclas and underjupons are in the brown basket on the left side of the mule his wine he takes hot when the nights are cold malvoisie or vernage with as much spice as would cover the thumbnail see that he hath a change if he come back hot from the tilting there is goosegrease in a box if the old scars ache at the turn of the weather let his blankets be dry and  nay my hearts life the little knight interrupted trouble not now about such matters why so pale and wan edricson is it not enow to make a mans heart dance to see this noble company such valiant menatarms such lusty archers by st paul i would be ill to please if i were not blithe to see the red roses flying at the head of so noble a following  the purse i have already given you edricson continue the lady there are in it twentythree marks one noble three shillings and fourpence which is a great treasure for one man to carry and i pray you to bear in mind edricson that he hath two pair of shoes those of red leather for common use and the others with golden toechains which he may wear should he chance to drink wine with the prince or with chandos  my sweet bird said sir nigel i am right loth to part from you but we are now at the fringe of the forest and it is not right that i should take the chatelaine too far from her trust  but oh my dear lord she cried with a trembling lip let me bide with you for one furlong furtheror one and a half perhaps you may spare me this out of the weary miles that you will journey along  come then my hearts comfort he answered but i must crave a gage from thee it is my custom dearling and hath been since i have first known thee to proclaim by herald in such camps townships or fortalices as i may chance to visit that my ladylove being beyond compare the fairest and sweetest in christendom i should deem it great honor and kindly condescension if any cavalier would run three courses against me with sharpened lances should he chance to have a lady whose claim he was willing to advance i pray you then my fair dove that you will vouchsafe to me one of those doeskin gloves that i may wear it as the badge of her whose servant i shall ever be  alack and alas for the fairest and sweetest she cried fair and sweet i would fain be for your dear sake my lord but old i am and ugly and the knights would laugh should you lay lance in rest in such a cause  edricson quoth sir nigel you have young eyes and mine are somewhat bedimmed should you chance to see a knight laugh or smile or even look you arch his brows or purse his mouth or in any way show surprise that i should uphold the lady mary you will take particular note of his name his coatarmor and his lodging your glove my lifes desire  the lady mary loring slipped her hand from her yellow leather gauntlet and he lifting it with dainty reverence bound it to the front of his velvet cap  it is with mine other guardian angels quoth he pointing at the saints medals which hung beside it and now my dearest you have come far enow may the virgin guard and prosper thee one kiss he bent down from his saddle and then striking spurs into his horses sides he galloped at top speed after his men with his three squires at his heels half a mile further where the road topped a hill they looked back and the lady mary on her white palfrey was still where they had left her a moment later they were on the downward slope and she had vanished from their view    chapter xiv how sir nigel sought for a wayside venture   for a time sir nigel was very moody and downcast with bent brows and eyes upon the pommel of his saddle edricson and terlake rode behind him in little better case while ford a careless and lighthearted youth grinned at the melancholy of his companions and flourished his lords heavy spear making a point to right and a point to left as though he were a paladin contending against a host of assailants sir nigel happened however to turn himself in his saddleford instantly became as stiff and as rigid as though he had been struck with a palsy the four rode alone for the archers had passed a curve in the road though alleyne could still hear the heavy clump clump of their marching or catch a glimpse of the sparkle of steel through the tangle of leafless branches  ride by my side friends i entreat of you said the knight reining in his steed that they might come abreast of him for since it hath pleased you to follow me to the wars it were well that you should know how you may best serve me i doubt not terlake that you will show yourself a worthy son of a valiant father and you ford of yours and you edricson that you are mindful of the oldtime house from which all men know that you are sprung and first i would have you bear very steadfastly in mind that our setting forth is by no means for the purpose of gaining spoil or exacting ransom though it may well happen that such may come to us also we go to france and from thence i trust to spain in humble search of a field in which we may win advancement and perchance some small share of glory for this purpose i would have you know that it is not my wont to let any occasion pass where it is in any way possible that honor may be gained i would have you bear this in mind and give great heed to it that you may bring me word of all cartels challenges wrongs tyrannies infamies and wronging of damsels nor is any occasion too small to take note of for i have known such trifles as the dropping of a gauntlet or the flicking of a breadcrumb when well and properly followed up lead to a most noble spearrunning but edricson do i not see a cavalier who rides down yonder road amongst the nether shaw it would be well perchance that you should give him greeting from me and should he be of gentle blood it may be that he would care to exchange thrusts with me  why my lord quoth ford standing in his stirrups and shading his eyes it is old hob davidson the fat miller of milton  ah so it is indeed said sir nigel puckering his cheeks but wayside ventures are not to be scorned for i have seen no finer passages than are to be had from such chance meetings when cavaliers are willing to advance themselves i can well remember that two leagues from the town of rheims i met a very valiant and courteous cavalier of france with whom i had gentle and most honorable contention for upwards of an hour it hath ever grieved me that i had not his name for he smote upon me with a mace and went upon his way ere i was in condition to have much speech with him but his arms were an allurion in chief above a fess azure i was also on such an occasion thrust through the shoulder by lyon de montcourt whom i met on the high road betwixt libourne and bordeaux i met him but the once but i have never seen a man for whom i bear a greater love and esteem and so also with the squire le bourg capillet who would have been a very valiant captain had he lived  he is dead then asked alleyne edricson  alas it was my ill fate to slay him in a bickering which broke out in a field near the township of tarbes i cannot call to mind how the thing came about for it was in the year of the princes ride through languedoc when there was much fine skirmishing to be had at barriers by st paul i do not think that any honorable cavalier could ask for better chance of advancement than might be had by spurring forth before the army and riding to the gateways of narbonne or bergerac or mont giscar where some courteous gentleman would ever be at wait to do what he might to meet your wish or ease you of your vow such a one at ventadour ran three courses with me betwixt daybreak and sunrise to the great exaltation of his lady  and did you slay him also my lord asked ford with reverence  i could never learn for he was carried within the barrier and as i had chanced to break the bone of my leg it was a great unease for me to ride or even to stand yet by the goodness of heaven and the pious intercession of the valiant st george i was able to sit my charger in the ruffle of poictiers which was no very long time afterwards but what have we here a very fair and courtly maiden or i mistake  it was indeed a tall and buxom country lass with a basket of spinachleaves upon her head and a great slab of bacon tucked under one arm she bobbed a frightened curtsey as sir nigel swept his velvet hat from his head and reined up his great charger  god be with thee fair maiden said he  god guard thee my lord she answered speaking in the broadest west saxon speech and balancing herself first on one foot and then on the other in her bashfulness  fear not my fair damsel said sir nigel but tell me if perchance a poor and most unworthy knight can in any wise be of service to you should it chance that you have been used despitefully it may be that i may obtain justice for you  lawk no kind sir she answered clutching her bacon the tighter as though some design upon it might be hid under this knightly offer i be the milking wench o fairmer arnold and he be as kind a maister as heart could wish  it is well said he and with a shake of the bridle rode on down the woodland path i would have you bear in mind he continued to his squires that gentle courtesy is not as is the base use of so many false knights to be shown only to maidens of high degree for there is no woman so humble that a true knight may not listen to her tale of wrong but here comes a cavalier who is indeed in haste perchance it would be well that we should ask him whither he rides for it may be that he is one who desires to advance himself in chivalry  the bleak hard windswept road dipped down in front of them into a little valley and then writhing up the heathy slope upon the other side lost itself among the gaunt pinetrees far away between the black lines of trunks the quick glitter of steel marked where the company pursued its way to the north stretched the tree country but to the south between two swelling downs a glimpse might be caught of the cold gray shimmer of the sea with the white fleck of a galley sail upon the distant skyline just in front of the travellers a horseman was urging his steed up the slope driving it on with whip and spur as one who rides for a set purpose as he clattered up alleyne could see that the roan horse was gray with dust and flecked with foam as though it had left many a mile behind it the rider was a sternfaced man hard of mouth and dry of eye with a heavy sword clanking at his side and a stiff white bundle swathed in linen balanced across the pommel of his saddle  the kings messenger he bawled as he came up to them the messenger of the king clear the causeway for the kings own man  not so loudly friend quoth the little knight reining his horse half round to bar the path i have myself been the kings man for thirty years or more but i have not been wont to halloo about it on a peaceful highway  i ride in his service cried the other and i carry that which belongs to him you bar my path at your peril  yet i have known the kings enemies claim to ride in his same said sir nigel the foul fiend may lurk beneath a garment of light we must have some sign or warrant of your mission  then must i hew a passage cried the stranger with his shoulder braced round and his hand upon his hilt i am not to be stopped on the kings service by every gadabout  should you be a gentleman of quarterings and coatarmor lisped sir nigel i shall be very blithe to go further into the matter with you if not i have three very worthy squires any one of whom would take the thing upon himself and debate it with you in a very honorable way  the man scowled from one to the other and his hand stole away from his sword  you ask me for a sign he said here is a sign for you since you must have one as he spoke he whirled the covering from the object in front of him and showed to their horror that it was a newlysevered human leg by gods tooth he continued with a brutal laugh you ask me if i am a man of quarterings and it is even so for i am officer to the verderers court at lyndhurst this thievish leg is to hang at milton and the other is already at brockenhurst as a sign to all men of what comes of being overfond of venison pasty  faugh cried sir nigel pass on the other side of the road fellow and let us have the wind of you we shall trot our horses my friends across this pleasant valley for by our lady a breath of gods fresh air is right welcome after such a sight  we hoped to snare a falcon said he presently but we netted a carrioncrow ma foi but there are men whose hearts are tougher than a boars hide for me i have played the old game of war since ever i had hair on my chin and i have seen ten thousand brave men in one day with their faces to the sky but i swear by him who made me that i cannot abide the work of the butcher  and yet my fair lord said edricson there has from what i hear been much of such devils work in france  too much too much he answered but i have ever observed that the foremost in the field are they who would scorn to mishandle a prisoner by st paul it is not they who carry the breach who are wont to sack the town but the laggard knaves who come crowding in when a way has been cleared for them but what is this among the trees  it is a shrine of our lady said terlake and a blind beggar who lives by the alms of those who worship there  a shrine cried the knight then let us put up an orison pulling off his cap and clasping his hands he chanted in a shrill voice benedictus dominus deus meus qui docet manus meas ad proelium et digitos meos ad bellum a strange figure he seemed to his three squires perched on his huge horse with his eyes upturned and the wintry sun shimmering upon his bald head it is a noble prayer he remarked putting on his hat again and it was taught to me by the noble chandos himself but how fares it with you father methinks that i should have ruth upon you seeing that i am myself like one who looks through a horn window while his neighbors have the clear crystal yet by st paul there is a long stride between the man who hath a horn casement and him who is walled in on every hand  alas fair sir cried the blind old man i have not seen the blessed blue of heaven this twoscore years since a levin flash burned the sight out of my head  you have been blind to much that is goodly and fair quoth sir nigel but you have also been spared much that is sorry and foul this very hour our eyes have been shocked with that which would have left you unmoved but by st paul we must on or our company will think that they have lost their captain somewhat early in the venture throw the man my purse edricson and let us go  alleyne lingering behind bethought him of the lady lorings counsel and reduced the noble gift which the knight had so freely bestowed to a single penny which the beggar with many mumbled blessings thrust away into his wallet then spurring his steed the young squire rode at the top of his speed after his companions and overtook them just at the spot where the trees fringe off into the moor and the straggling hamlet of hordle lies scattered on either side of the winding and deeplyrutted track the company was already wellnigh through the village but as the knight and his squires closed up upon them they heard the clamor of a strident voice followed by a roar of deepchested laughter from the ranks of the archers another minute brought them up with the rearguard where every man marched with his beard on his shoulder and a face which was agrin with merriment by the side of the column walked a huge redheaded bowman with his hands thrown out in argument and expostulation while close at his heels followed a little wrinkled woman who poured forth a shrill volley of abuse varied by an occasional thwack from her stick given with all the force of her body though she might have been beating one of the forest trees for all the effect that she seemed likely to produce  i trust aylward said sir nigel gravely as he rode up that this doth not mean that any violence hath been offered to women if such a thing happened i tell you that the man shall hang though he were the best archer that ever wore brassart  nay my fair lord aylward answered with a grin it is violence which is offered to a man he comes from hordle and this is his mother who hath come forth to welcome him  you rammucky lurden she was howling with a blow between each catch of her breath you shammocking yaping overlong goodfornought i will teach thee i will baste thee aye by my faith  whist mother said john looking back at her from the tail of his eye i go to france as an archer to give blows and to take them  to france quotha cried the old dame bide here with me and i shall warrant you more blows than you are like to get in france if blows be what you seek you need not go further than hordle  by my hilt the good dame speaks truth said aylward it seems to be the very home of them  what have you to say you cleanshaved galleybeggar cried the fiery dame turning upon the archer can i not speak with my own son but you must let your tongue clack a soldier quotha and never a hair on his face i have seen a better soldier with pap for food and swaddling clothes for harness  stand to it aylward cried the archers amid a fresh burst of laughter  do not thwart her comrade said big john she hath a proper spirit for her years and cannot abide to be thwarted it is kindly and homely to me to hear her voice and to feel that she is behind me but i must leave you now mother for the way is overrough for your feet but i will bring you back a silken gown if there be one in france or spain and i will bring jinny a silver penny so goodbye to you and god have you in his keeping whipping up the little woman he lifted her lightly to his lips and then taking his place in the ranks again marched on with the laughing company  that was ever his way she cried appealing to sir nigel who reined up his horse and listened with the greatest courtesy he would jog on his own road for all that i could do to change him first he must be a monk forsooth and all because a wench was wise enough to turn her back on him then he joins a rascally crew and must needs trapse off to the wars and me with no one to bait the fire if i be out or tend the cow if i be home yet i have been a good mother to him three hazel switches a day have i broke across his shoulders and he takes no more notice than you have seen him today  doubt not that he will come back to you both safe and prosperous my fair dame quoth sir nigel meanwhile it grieves me that as i have already given my purse to a beggar up the road i  nay my lord said alleyne i still have some moneys remaining  then i pray you to give them to this very worthy woman he cantered on as he spoke while alleyne having dispensed two more pence left the old dame standing by the furthest cottage of hordle with her shrill voice raised in blessings instead of revilings  there were two crossroads before they reached the lymington ford and at each of then sir nigel pulled up his horse and waited with many a curvet and gambade craning his neck this way and that to see if fortune would send him a venture crossroads had as he explained been rare places for knightly spearrunnings and in his youth it was no uncommon thing for a cavalier to abide for weeks at such a point holding gentle debate with all comers to his own advancement and the great honor of his lady the times were changed however and the forest tracks wound away from them deserted and silent with no trample of warhorse or clang of armor which might herald the approach of an adversaryso that sir nigel rode on his way disconsolate at the lymington river they splashed through the ford and lay in the meadows on the further side to eat the bread and salt meat which they carried upon the sumpter horses then ere the sun was on the slope of the heavens they had deftly trussed up again and were swinging merrily upon their way two hundred feet moving like two  there is a third crossroad where the track from boldre runs down to the old fishing village of pitts deep down this as they came abreast of it there walked two men the one a pace or two behind the other the cavaliers could not but pull up their horses to look at them for a stranger pair were never seen journeying together the first was a misshapen squalid man with cruel cunning eyes and a shock of tangled red hair bearing in his hands a small unpainted cross which he held high so that all men might see it he seemed to be in the last extremity of fright with a face the color of clay and his limbs all ashake as one who hath an ague behind him with his toe ever rasping upon the others heels there walked a very stern blackbearded man with a hard eye and a set mouth he bore over his shoulder a great knotted stick with three jagged nails stuck in the head of it and from time to time he whirled it up in the air with a quivering arm as though he could scarce hold back from dashing his companions brains out so in silence they walked under the spread of the branches on the grassgrown path from boldre  by st paul quoth the knight but this is a passing strange sight and perchance some very perilous and honorable venture may arise from it i pray you edricson to ride up to them and to ask them the cause of it  there was no need however for him to move for the twain came swiftly towards them until they were within a spears length when the man with the cross sat himself down sullenly upon a tussock of grass by the wayside while the other stood beside him with his great cudgel still hanging over his head so intent was he that he raised his eyes neither to knight nor squires but kept them ever fixed with a savage glare upon his comrade  i pray you friend said sir nigel to tell us truthfully who you are and why you follow this man with such bitter enmity  so long as i am within the pale of the kings law the stranger answered i cannot see why i should render account to every passing wayfarer  you are no very shrewd reasoner fellow quoth the knight for if it be within the law for you to threaten him with your club then it is also lawful for me to threaten you with my sword  the man with the cross was down in an instant on his knees upon the ground with hands clasped above him and his face shining with hope for dear christs sake my fair lord he cried in a crackling voice i have at my belt a bag with a hundred rose nobles and i will give it to you freely if you will but pass your sword through this mans body  how you foul knave exclaimed sir nigel hotly do you think that a cavaliers arm is to be bought like a packmans ware by st paul i have little doubt that this fellow hath some very good cause to hold you in hatred  indeed my fair sir you speak sooth quoth he with the club while the other seated himself once more by the wayside for this man is peter peterson a very noted rieve drawlatch and murtherer who has wrought much evil for many years in the parts about winchester it was but the other day upon the feasts of the blessed simon and jude that he slew my younger brother william in bere forestfor which by the black thorn of glastonbury i shall have his hearts blood though i walk behind him to the further end of earth  but if this be indeed so asked sir nigel why is it that you have come with him so far through the forest  because i am an honest englishman and will take no more than the law allows for when the deed was done this foul and base wretch fled to sanctuary at st cross and i as you may think after him with all the posse the prior however hath so ordered that while he holds this cross no man may lay hand upon him without the ban of church which heaven forfend from me or mine yet if for an instant he lay the cross aside or if he fail to journey to pitts deep where it is ordered that he shall take ship to outland parts or if he take not the first ship or if until the ship be ready he walk not every day into the sea as far as his loins then he becomes outlaw and i shall forthwith dash out his brains  at this the man on the ground snarled up at him like a rat while the other clenched his teeth and shook his club and looked down at him with murder in his eyes knight and squire gazed from rogue to avenger but as it was a matter which none could mend they tarried no longer but rode upon their way alleyne looking back saw that the murderer had drawn bread and cheese from his scrip and was silently munching it with the protecting cross still hugged to his breast while the other black and grim stood in the sunlit road and threw his dark shadow athwart him    chapter xv how the yellow cog sailed forth from lepe   that night the company slept at st leonards in the great monastic barns and spicariumground well known both to alleyne and to john for they were almost within sight of the abbey of beaulieu a strange thrill it gave to the young squire to see the wellremembered white dress once more and to hear the measured tolling of the deep vespers bell at early dawn they passed across the broad sluggish reedgirt streammen horses and baggage in the flat ferry bargesand so journeyed on through the fresh morning air past exbury to lepe topping the heathy down they came of a sudden full in sight of the old seaporta cluster of houses a trail of blue smoke and a bristle of masts to right and left the long blue curve of the solent lapped in a fringe of foam upon the yellow beach some way out from the town a line of pessoners creyers and other small craft were rolling lazily on the gentle swell further out still lay a great merchantship high ended deep waisted painted of a canary yellow and towering above the fishingboats like a swan among ducklings  by st paul said the knight our good merchant of southampton hath not played us false for methinks i can see our ship down yonder he said that she would be of great size and of a yellow shade  by my hilt yes muttered aylward she is yellow as a kites claw and would carry as many men as there are pips in a pomegranate  it is as well remarked terlake for methinks my fair lord that we are not the only ones who are waiting a passage to gascony mine eye catches at times a flash and sparkle among yonder houses which assuredly never came from shipmans jacket or the gaberdine of a burgher  i can also see it said alleyne shading his eyes with his hand and i can see menatarms in yonder boats which ply betwixt the vessel and the shore but methinks that we are very welcome here for already they come forth to meet us  a tumultuous crowd of fishermen citizens and women had indeed swarmed out from the northern gate and approached them up the side of the moor waving their hands and dancing with joy as though a great fear had been rolled back from their minds at their head rode a very large and solemn man with a long chin and a drooping lip he wore a fur tippet round his neck and a heavy gold chain over it with a medallion which dangled in front of him  welcome most puissant and noble lord he cried doffing his bonnet to black simon i have heard of your lordships valiant deeds and in sooth they might be expected from your lordships face and bearing is there any small matter in which i may oblige you  since you ask me said the manatarms i would take it kindly if you could spare a link or two of the chain which hangs round your neck  what the corporation chain cried the other in horror the ancient chain of the township of lepe this is but a sorry jest sir nigel  what the plague did you ask me for then said simon but if it is sir nigel loring with whom you would speak that is he upon the black horse  the mayor of lepe gazed with amazement on the mild face and slender frame of the famous warrior  your pardon my gracious lord he cried you see in me the mayor and chief magistrate of the ancient and powerful town of lepe i bid you very heartily welcome and the more so as you are come at a moment when we are sore put to it for means of defence  ha cried sir nigel pricking up his ears  yes my lord for the town being very ancient and the walls as old as the town it follows that they are very ancient too but there is a certain villainous and bloodthirsty norman pirate hight tetenoire who with a genoan called tito caracci commonly known as spadebeard hath been a mighty scourge upon these coasts indeed my lord they are very cruel and blackhearted men graceless and ruthless and if they should come to the ancient and powerful town of lepe then  then goodbye to the ancient and powerful town of lepe quoth ford whose lightness of tongue could at times rise above his awe of sir nigel  the knight however was too much intent upon the matter in hand to give heed to the flippancy of his squire have you then cause he asked to think that these men are about to venture an attempt upon you  they have come in two great galleys answered the mayor with two bank of oars on either side and great store of engines of war and of menatarms at weymouth and at portland they have murdered and ravished yesterday morning they were at cowes and we saw the smoke from the burning crofts today they lie at their ease near freshwater and we fear much lest they come upon us and do us a mischief  we cannot tarry said sir nigel riding towards the town with the mayor upon his left side the prince awaits us at bordeaux and we may not be behind the general muster yet i will promise you that on our way we shall find time to pass freshwater and to prevail upon these rovers to leave you in peace  we are much beholden to you cried the mayor but i cannot see my lord how without a warship you may venture against these men with your archers however you might well hold the town and do them great scath if they attempt to land  there is a very proper cog out yonder said sir nigel it would be a very strange thing if any ship were not a warship when it had such men as these upon her decks certes we shall do as i say and that no later than this very day  my lord said a roughhaired darkfaced man who walked by the knights other stirrup with his head sloped to catch all that he was saying by your leave i have no doubt that you are skilled in land fighting and the marshalling of lances but by my soul you will find it another thing upon the sea i am the mastershipman of this yellow cog and my name is goodwin hawtayne i have sailed since i was as high as this staff and i have fought against these normans and against the genoese as well as the scotch the bretons the spanish and the moors i tell you sir that my ship is over light and over frail for such work and it will but end in our having our throats cut or being sold as slaves to the barbary heathen  i also have experienced one or two gentle and honorable ventures upon the sea quoth sir nigel and i am right blithe to have so fair a task before us i think good mastershipman that you and i may win great honor in this matter and i can see very readily that you are a brave and stout man  i like it not said the other sturdily in gods name i like it not and yet goodwin hawtayne is not the man to stand back when his fellows are for pressing forward by my soul be it sink or swim i shall turn her beak into freshwater bay and if good master witherton of southampton like not my handling of his ship then he may find another mastershipman  they were close by the old north gate of the little town and alleyne half turning in his saddle looked back at the motley crowd who followed the bowmen and menatarms had broken their ranks and were intermingled with the fishermen and citizens whose laughing faces and hearty gestures bespoke the weight of care from which this welcome arrival had relieved them here and there among the moving throng of dark jerkins and of white surcoats were scattered dashes of scarlet and blue the whimples or shawls of the women aylward with a fishing lass on either arm was vowing constancy alternately to her on the right and her on the left while big john towered in the rear with a little chubby maiden enthroned upon his great shoulder her soft white arm curled round his shining headpiece so the throng moved on until at the very gate it was brought to a stand by a wondrously fat man who came darting forth from the town with rage in every feature of his rubicund face  how now sir mayor he roared in a voice like a bull how now sir mayor how of the clams and the scallops  by our lady my sweet sir oliver cried the mayor i have had so much to think of with these wicked villains so close upon us that it had quite gone out of my head  words words shouted the other furiously am i to be put off with words i say to you again how of the clams and scallops  my fair sir you flatter me cried the mayor i am a peaceful trader and i am not wont to be so shouted at upon so small a matter  small shrieked the other small clams and scallops ask me to your table to partake of the dainty of the town and when i come a barren welcome and a bare board where is my spearbearer  nay sir oliver sir oliver cried sir nigel laughing  let your anger be appeased since instead of this dish you come upon an old friend and comrade  by st martin of tours shouted the fat knight his wrath all changed in an instant to joy if it is not my dear little game rooster of the garonne ah my sweet coz i am right glad to see you what days we have seen together  aye by my faith cried sir nigel with sparkling eyes we have seen some valiant men and we have shown our pennons in some noble skirmishes by st paul we have had great joys in france  and sorrows also quoth the other i have some sad memories of the land can you recall that which befell us at libourne  nay i cannot call to mind that we ever so much as drew sword at the place  man man cried sir oliver your mind still runs on nought but blades and bassinets hast no space in thy frame for the softer joys ah even now i can scarce speak of it unmoved so noble a pie such tender pigeons and sugar in the gravy instead of salt you were by my side that day as were sir claude latour and the lord of pommers  i remember it said sir nigel laughing and how you harried the cook down the street and spoke of setting fire to the inn by st paul most worthy mayor my old friend is a perilous man and i rede you that you compose your difference with him on such terms as you may  the clams and scallops shall be ready within the hour the mayor answered i had asked sir oliver buttesthorn to do my humble board the honor to partake at it of the dainty upon which we take some little pride but in sooth this alarm of pirates hath cast such a shadow on my wits that i am like one distrait but i trust sir nigel that you will also partake of nonemeat with me  i have overmuch to do sir nigel answered for we must be aboard horse and man as early as we may how many do you muster sir oliver  three and forty the forty are drunk and the three are but indifferent sober i have them all safe upon the ship  they had best find their wits again for i shall have work for every man of them ere the sun set it is my intention if it seems good to you to try a venture against these norman and genoese rovers  they carry caviare and certain very noble spices from the levant aboard of ships from genoa quoth sir oliver we may come to great profit through the business i pray you mastershipman that when you go on board you pour a helmetful of seawater over any of my rogues whom you may see there  leaving the lusty knight and the mayor of lepe sir nigel led the company straight down to the waters edge where long lines of flat lighters swiftly bore them to their vessel horse after horse was slung by main force up from the barges and after kicking and plunging in empty air was dropped into the deep waist of the yellow cog where rows of stalls stood ready for their safe keeping englishmen in those days were skilled and prompt in such matters for it was so not long before that edward had embarked as many as fifty thousand men in the port of orwell with their horses and their baggage all in the space of fourandtwenty hours so urgent was sir nigel on the shore and so prompt was goodwin hawtayne on the cog that sir oliver buttesthorn had scarce swallowed his last scallop ere the peal of the trumpet and clang of nakir announced that all was ready and the anchor drawn in the last boat which left the shore the two commanders sat together in the sheets a strange contrast to one another while under the feet of the rowers was a litter of huge stones which sir nigel had ordered to be carried to the cog these once aboard the ship set her broad mainsail purple in color and with a golden st christopher bearing christ upon his shoulder in the centre of it the breeze blew the sail bellied over heeled the portly vessel and away she plunged through the smooth blue rollers amid the clang of the minstrels on her poop and the shouting of the black crowd who fringed the yellow beach to the left lay the green island of wight with its long low curving hills peeping over each others shoulders to the skyline to the right the wooded hampshire coast as far as eye could reach above a steelblue heaven with a wintry sun shimmering down upon them and enough of frost to set the breath asmoking  by st paul said sir nigel gayly as he stood upon the poop and looked on either side of him it is a land which is very well worth fighting for and it were pity to go to france for what may be had at home did you not spy a crooked man upon the beach  nay i spied nothing grumbled sir oliver for i was hurried down with a clam stuck in my gizzard and an untasted goblet of cyprus on the board behind me  i saw him my fair lord said terlake an old man with one shoulder higher than the other  tis a sign of good fortune quoth sir nigel our path was also crossed by a woman and by a priest so all should be well with us what say you edricson  i cannot tell my fair lord the romans of old were a very wise people yet certes they placed their faith in such matters so too did the greeks and divers other ancient peoples who were famed for their learning yet of the moderns there are many who scoff at all omens  there can be no manner of doubt about it said sir oliver buttesthorn i can well remember that in navarre one day it thundered on the left out of a cloudless sky we knew that ill would come of it nor had we long to wait only thirteen days after a haunch of prime venison was carried from my very tent door by the wolves and on the same day two flasks of old vernage turned sour and muddy  you may bring my harness from below said sir nigel to his squires and also i pray you bring up sir olivers and we shall don it here ye may then see to your own gear for this day you will i hope make a very honorable entrance into the field of chivalry and prove yourselves to be very worthy and valiant squires and now sir oliver as to our dispositions would it please you that i should order them or will you  you my cockerel you by our lady i am no chicken but i cannot claim to know as much of war as the squire of sir walter manny settle the matter to your own liking  you shall fly your pennon upon the fore part then and i upon the poop for foreguard i shall give you your own forty men with twoscore archers twoscore men with my own menatarms and squires will serve as a poopguard ten archers with thirty shipmen under the master may hold the waist while ten lie aloft with stones and arbalests how like you that  good by my faith good but here comes my harness and i must to work for i cannot slip into it as i was wont when first i set my face to the wars  meanwhile there had been bustle and preparation in all parts of the great vessel the archers stood in groups about the decks newstringing their bows and testing that they were firm at the nocks among them moved aylward and other of the older soldiers with a few whispered words of precept here and of warning there  stand to it my hearts of gold said the old bowman as he passed from knot to knot by my hilt we are in luck this journey bear in mind the old saying of the company  what is that aylward cried several leaning on their bows and laughing at him  tis the masterbowyers rede every bow well bent every shaft well sent every stave well nocked every string well locked there with that jingle in his head a bracer on his left hand a shooting glove on his right and a farthingsworth of wax in his girdle what more doth a bowman need  it would not be amiss said hordle john if under his girdle he had tour farthingsworth of wine  work first wine afterwards mon camarade but it is time that we took our order for methinks that between the needle rocks and the alum cliffs yonder i can catch a glimpse of the topmasts of the galleys hewett cook johnson cunningham your men are of the poopguard thornbury walters hackett baddlesmere you are with sir oliver on the forecastle simon you bide with your lords banner but ten men must go forward  quietly and promptly the men took their places lying flat upon their faces on the deck for such was sir nigels order near the prow was planted sir olivers spear with his armsa boars head gules upon a field of gold close by the stern stood black simon with the pennon of the house of loring in the waist gathered the southampton mariners hairy and burly men with their jerkins thrown off their waists braced tight swords mallets and poleaxes in their hands their leader goodwin hawtayne stood upon the poop and talked with sir nigel casting his eye up sometimes at the swelling sail and then glancing back at the two seamen who held the tiller  pass the word said sir nigel that no man shall stand to arms or draw his bowstring until my trumpeter shall sound it would be well that we should seem to be a merchantship from southampton and appear to flee from them  we shall see them anon said the mastershipman ha said i not so there they lie the watersnakes in freshwater bay and mark the reek of smoke from yonder point where they have been at their devils work see how their shallops pull from the land they have seen us and called their men aboard now they draw upon the anchor see them like ants upon the forecastle they stoop and heave like handy ship men but my fair lord these are no niefs i doubt but we have taken in hand more than we can do each of these ships is a galeasse and of the largest and swiftest make  i would i had your eyes said sir nigel blinking at the pirate galleys they seem very gallant ships and i trust that we shall have much pleasance from our meeting with them it would be well to pass the word that we should neither give nor take quarter this day have you perchance a priest or friar aboard this ship master hawtayne  no my fair lord  well well it is no great matter for my company for they were all houseled and shriven ere we left twynham castle and father christopher of the priory gave me his word that they were as fit to march to heaven as to gascony but my mind misdoubts me as to these winchester men who have come with sir oliver for they appear to be a very ungodly crew pass the word that the men kneel and that the underofficers repeat to them the pater the ave and the credo  with a clank of arms the rough archers and seamen took to their knees with bent heads and crossed hands listening to the hoarse mutter from the fileleaders it was strange to mark the hush so that the lapping of the water the straining of the sail and the creaking of the timbers grew louder of a sudden upon the ear many of the bowmen had drawn amulets and relics from their bosoms while he who possessed some more than usually sanctified treasure passed it down the line of his comrades that all might kiss and reap the virtue  the yellow cog had now shot out from the narrow waters of the solent and was plunging and rolling on the long heave of the open channel the wind blew freshly from the east with a very keen edge to it and the great sail bellied roundly out laying the vessel over until the water hissed beneath her lee bulwarks broad and ungainly she floundered from wave to wave dipping her round bows deeply into the blue rollers and sending the white flakes of foam in a spatter over her decks on her larboard quarter lay the two dark galleys which had already hoisted sail and were shooting out from freshwater bay in swift pursuit their double line of oars giving them a vantage which could not fail to bring them up with any vessel which trusted to sails alone high and bluff the english cog long black and swift the pirate galleys like two fierce lean wolves which have seen a lordly and unsuspecting stag walk past their forest lair  shall we turn my fair lord or shall we carry on asked the mastershipman looking behind him with anxious eyes  nay we must carry on and play the part of the helpless merchant  but your pennons they will see that we have two knights with us  yet it would not be to a knights honor or good name to lower his pennon let them be and they will think that we are a wineship for gascony or that we bear the woolbales of some mercer of the staple ma foi but they are very swift they swoop upon us like two goshawks on a heron is there not some symbol or device upon their sails  that on the right said edricson appears to have the head of an ethiop upon it  tis the badge of tetenoire the norman cried a seamanmariner i have seen it before when he harried us at winchelsea he is a wondrous large and strong man with no ruth for man woman or beast they say that he hath the strength of six and certes he hath the crimes of six upon his soul see now to the poor souls who swing at either end of his yardarm  at each end of the yard there did indeed hang the dark figure of a man jolting and lurching with hideous jerkings of its limbs at every plunge and swoop of the galley  by st paul said sir nigel and by the help of st george and our lady it will be a very strange thing if our blackheaded friend does not himself swing thence ere he be many hours older but what is that upon the other galley  it is the red cross of genoa this spadebeard is a very noted captain and it is his boast that there are no seamen and no archers in the world who can compare with those who serve the doge boccanegra  that we shall prove said goodwin hawtayne but it would be well ere they close with us to raise up the mantlets and pavises as a screen against their bolts he shouted a hoarse order and his seamen worked swiftly and silently heightening the bulwarks and strengthening them the three ships anchors were at sir nigels command carried into the waist and tied to the mast with twenty feet of cable between each under the care of four seamen eight others were stationed with leather waterbags to quench any firearrows which might come aboard while others were sent up the mast to lie along the yard and drop stones or shoot arrows as the occasion served  let them be supplied with all that is heavy and weighty in the ship said sir nigel  then we must send them up sir oliver buttesthorn quoth ford  the knight looked at him with a face which struck the smile from his lips no squire of mine he said shall ever make jest of a belted knight and yet he added his eyes softening i know that it is but a boys mirth with no sting in it yet i should ill do my part towards your father if i did not teach you to curb your tongueplay  they will lay us aboard on either quarter my lord cried the master see how they stretch out from each other the norman hath a mangonel or a trabuch upon the forecastle see they bend to the levers they are about to loose it  aylward cried the knight pick your three trustiest archers and see if you cannot do something to hinder their aim methinks they are within long arrow flight  seventeen score paces said the archer running his eye backwards and forwards by my ten fingerbones it would be a strange thing if we could not notch a mark at that distance here watkin of sowley arnold long williams let us show the rogues that they have english bowmen to deal with  the three archers named stood at the further end of the poop balancing themselves with feet widely spread and bows drawn until the heads of the clothyard arrows were level with the centre of the stave you are the surer watkin said aylward standing by them with shaft upon string do you take the rogue with the red coif you two bring down the man with the headpiece and i will hold myself ready if you miss ma foi they are about to loose her shoot mes garcons or you will be too late  the throng of pirates had cleared away from the great wooden catapult leaving two of their number to discharge it one in a scarlet cap bent over it steadying the jagged rock which was balanced on the spoonshaped end of the long wooden lever the other held the loop of the rope which would release the catch and send the unwieldy missile hurtling through the air so for an instant they stood showing hard and clear against the white sail behind them the next redcap had fallen across the stone with an arrow between his ribs and the other struck in the leg and in the throat was writhing and spluttering upon the ground as he toppled backwards he had loosed the spring and the huge beam of wood swinging round with tremendous force cast the corpse of his comrade so close to the english ship that its mangled and distorted limbs grazed their very stern as to the stone it glanced off obliquely and fell midway between the vessels a roar of cheering and of laughter broke from the rough archers and seamen at the sight answered by a yell of rage from their pursuers  lie low mes enfants cried aylward motioning with his left hand they will learn wisdom they are bringing forward shield and mantlet we shall have some pebbles about our ears ere long    chapter xvi how the yellow cog fought the two rover galleys   the three vessels had been sweeping swiftly westwards the cog still well to the front although the galleys were slowly drawing in upon either quarter to the left was a hard skyline unbroken by a sail the island already lay like a cloud behind them while right in front was st albans head with portland looming mistily in the farthest distance alleyne stood by the tiller looking backwards the fresh wind full in his teeth the crisp winter air tingling on his face and blowing his yellow curls from under his bassinet his cheeks were flushed and his eyes shining for the blood of a hundred fighting saxon ancestors was beginning to stir in his veins  what was that he asked as a hissing sharpdrawn voice seemed to whisper in his ear the steersman smiled and pointed with his foot to where a short heavy crossbow quarrel stuck quivering in the boards at the same instant the man stumbled forward upon his knees and lay lifeless upon the deck a bloodstained feather jutting out from his back as alleyne stooped to raise him the air seemed to be alive with the sharp zipzip of the bolts and he could hear them pattering on the deck like apples at a treeshaking  raise two more mantlets by the pooplanthorn said sir nigel quietly  and another man to the tiller cried the mastershipman  keep them in play aylward with ten of your men the knight continued and let ten of sir olivers bowmen do as much for the genoese i have no mind as yet to show them how much they have to fear from us  ten picked shots under aylward stood in line across the broad deck and it was a lesson to the young squires who had seen nothing of war to note how orderly and how cool were these old soldiers how quick the command and how prompt the carrying out ten moving like one their comrades crouched beneath the bulwarks with many a rough jest and many a scrap of criticism or advice higher wat higher put thy body into it will forget not the wind hal so ran the muttered chorus while high above it rose the sharp twanging of the strings the hiss of the shafts and the short draw your arrow nick your arrow shoot wholly together from the masterbowman  and now both mangonels were at work from the galleys but so covered and protected that save at the moment of discharge no glimpse could be caught of them a huge brown rock from the genoese sang over their heads and plunged sullenly into the slope of a wave another from the norman whizzed into the waist broke the back of a horse and crashed its way through the side of the vessel two others flying together tore a great gap in the st christopher upon the sail and brushed three of sir olivers menatarms from the forecastle the mastershipman looked at the knight with a troubled face  they keep their distance from us said he our archery is overgood and they will not close what defence can we make against the stones  i think i may trick them the knight answered cheerfully and passed his order to the archers instantly five of them threw up their hands and fell prostrate upon the deck one had already been slain by a bolt so that there were but four upon their feet  that should give them heart said sir nigel eyeing the galleys which crept along on either side with a slow measured swing of their great oars the water swirling and foaming under their sharp stems  they still hold aloof cried hawtayne  then down with two more shouted their leader that will do ma foi but they come to our lure like chicks to the fowler to your arms men the pennon behind me and the squires round the pennon stand fast with the anchors in the waist and be ready for a cast now blow out the trumpets and may gods benison be with the honest men  as he spoke a roar of voices and a roll of drums came from either galley and the water was lashed into spray by the hurried beat of a hundred oars down they swooped one on the right one on the left the sides and shrouds black with men and bristling with weapons in heavy clusters they hung upon the forecastle all ready for a springfaces white faces brown faces yellow and faces black fair norsemen swarthy italians fierce rovers from the levant and fiery moors from the barbary states of all hues and countries and marked solely by the common stamp of a wildbeast ferocity rasping up on either side with oars trailing to save them from snapping they poured in a living torrent with horrid yell and shrill whoop upon the defenceless merchantman  but wilder yet was the cry and shriller still the scream when there rose up from the shadow of those silent bulwarks the long lines of the english bowmen and the arrows whizzed in a deadly sleet among the unprepared masses upon the pirate decks from the higher sides of the cog the bowmen could shoot straight down at a range which was so short as to enable a clothyard shaft to pierce through mailcoats or to transfix a shield though it were an inch thick of toughened wood one moment alleyne saw the galleys poop crowded with rushing figures waving arms exultant faces the next it was a bloodsmeared shambles with bodies piled three deep upon each other the living cowering behind the dead to shelter themselves from that sudden stormblast of death on either side the seamen whom sir nigel had chosen for the purpose had cast their anchors over the side of the galleys so that the three vessels locked in an iron grip lurched heavily forward upon the swell  and now set in a fell and fierce fight one of a thousand of which no chronicler has spoken and no poet sung through all the centuries and over all those southern waters nameless men have fought in nameless places their sole monuments a protected coast and an unravaged countryside  fore and aft the archers had cleared the galleys decks but from either side the rovers had poured down into the waist where the seamen and bowmen were pushed back and so mingled with their foes that it was impossible for their comrades above to draw string to help them it was a wild chaos where axe and sword rose and fell while englishman norman and italian staggered and reeled on a deck which was cumbered with bodies and slippery with blood the clang of blows the cries of the stricken the short deep shout of the islanders and the fierce whoops of the rovers rose together in a deafening tumult while the breath of the panting men went up in the wintry air like the smoke from a furnace the giant tetenoire towering above his fellows and clad from head to foot in plate of proof led on his boarders waving a huge mace in the air with which he struck to the deck every man who approached him on the other side spadebeard a dwarf in height but of great breadth of shoulder and length of arm had cut a road almost to the mast with threescore genoese menatarms close at his heels between these two formidable assailants the seamen were being slowly wedged more closely together until they stood back to back under the mast with the rovers raging upon every side of them  but help was close at hand sir oliver buttesthorn with his menatarms had swarmed down from the forecastle while sir nigel with his three squires black simon aylward hordle john and a score more threw themselves from the poop and hurled themselves into the thickest of the fight alleyne as in duty bound kept his eyes fixed ever on his lord and pressed forward close at his heels often had he heard of sir nigels prowess and skill with all knightly weapons but all the tales that had reached his ears fell far short of the real quickness and coolness of the man it was as if the devil was in him for he sprang here and sprang there now thrusting and now cutting catching blows on his shield turning them with his blade stooping under the swing of an axe springing over the sweep of a sword so swift and so erratic that the man who braced himself for a blow at him might find him six paces off ere he could bring it down three pirates had fallen before him and he had wounded spadebeard in the neck when the norman giant sprang at him from the side with a slashing blow from his deadly mace sir nigel stooped to avoid it and at the same instant turned a thrust from the genoese swordsman but his foot slipping in a pool of blood he fell heavily to the ground alleyne sprang in front of the norman but his sword was shattered and he himself beaten to the ground by a second blow from the ponderous weapon ere the pirate chief could repeat it however johns iron grip fell upon his wrist and he found that for once he was in the hands of a stronger man than himself  fiercely he strove to disengage his weapon but hordle john bent his arm slowly back until with a sharp crack like a breaking stave it turned limp in his grasp and the mace dropped from the nerveless fingers in vain he tried to pluck it up with the other hand back and back still his foeman bent him until with a roar of pain and of fury the giant clanged his full length upon the boards while the glimmer of a knife before the bars of his helmet warned him that short would be his shrift if he moved  cowed and disheartened by the loss of their leader the normans had given back and were now streaming over the bulwarks on to their own galley dropping a dozen at a time on to her deck but the anchor still held them in its crooked claw and sir oliver with fifty men was hard upon their heels now too the archers had room to draw their bows once more and great stones from the yard of the cog came thundering and crashing among the flying rovers here and there they rushed with wild screams and curses diving under the sail crouching behind booms huddling into corners like rabbits when the ferrets are upon them as helpless and as hopeless they were stern days and if the honest soldier too poor for a ransom had no prospect of mercy upon the battlefield what ruth was there for sea robbers the enemies of humankind taken in the very deed with proofs of their crimes still swinging upon their yardarm  but the fight had taken a new and a strange turn upon the other side spadebeard and his men had given slowly back hard pressed by sir nigel aylward black simon and the poopguard foot by foot the italian had retreated his armor running blood at every joint his shield split his crest shorn his voice fallen away to a mere gasping and croaking yet he faced his foemen with dauntless courage dashing in springing back surefooted steadyhanded with a point which seemed to menace three at once beaten back on to the deck of his own vessel and closely followed by a dozen englishmen he disengaged himself from them ran swiftly down the deck sprang back into the cog once more cut the rope which held the anchor and was back in an instant among his crossbowmen at the same time the genoese sailors thrust with their oars against the side of the cog and a rapidly widening rift appeared between the two vessels  by st george cried ford we are cut off from sir nigel  he is lost gasped terlake come let us spring for it the two youths jumped with all their strength to reach the departing galley fords feet reached the edge of the bulwarks and his hand clutching a rope he swung himself on board terlake fell short crashed in among the oars and bounded off into the sea alleyne staggering to the side was about to hurl himself after him but hordle john dragged him back by the girdle  you can scarce stand lad far less jump said he see how the blood rips from your bassinet  my place is by the flag cried alleyne vainly struggling to break from the others hold  bide here man you would need wings ere you could reach sir nigels side  the vessels were indeed so far apart now that the genoese could use the full sweep of their oars and draw away rapidly from the cog  my god but it is a noble fight shouted big john clapping his hands they have cleared the poop and they spring into the waist well struck my lord well struck aylward see to black simon how he storms among the shipmen but this spadebeard is a gallant warrior he rallies his men upon the forecastle he hath slain an archer ha my lord is upon him look to it alleyne see to the whirl and glitter of it  by heaven sir nigel is down cried the squire  up roared john it was but a feint he bears him back he drives him to the side ah by our lady his sword is through him they cry for mercy down goes the red cross and up springs simon with the scarlet roses  the death of the genoese leader did indeed bring the resistance to an end amid a thunder of cheering from cog and from galleys the forked pennon fluttered upon the forecastle and the galley sweeping round came slowly back as the slaves who rowed it learned the wishes of their new masters  the two knights had come aboard the cog and the grapplings having been thrown off the three vessels now moved abreast through all the storm and rush of the fight alleyne had been aware of the voice of goodwin hawtayne the mastershipman with his constant hale the bowline veer the sheet and strange it was to him to see how swiftly the bloodstained sailors turned from the strife to the ropes and back now the cogs head was turned francewards and the shipman walked the deck a peaceful mastermariner once more  there is sad scath done to the cog sir nigel said he here is a hole in the side two ells across the sail split through the centre and the wood as bare as a friars poll in good sooth i know not what i shall say to master witherton when i see the itchen once more  by st paul it would be a very sorry thing if we suffered you to be the worse of this days work said sir nigel you shall take these galleys back with you and master witherton may sell them then from the moneys he shall take as much as may make good the damage and the rest he shall keep until our homecoming when every man shall have his share an image of silver fifteen inches high i have vowed to the virgin to be placed in her chapel within the priory for that she was pleased to allow me to come upon this spadebeard who seemed to me from what i have seen of him to be a very sprightly and valiant gentleman but how fares it with you edricson  it is nothing my fair lord said alleyne who had now loosened his bassinet which was cracked across by the normans blow even as he spoke however his head swirled round and he fell to the deck with the blood gushing from his nose and mouth  he will come to anon said the knight stooping over him and passing his fingers through his hair i have lost one very valiant and gentle squire this day i can ill afford to lose another how many men have fallen  i have pricked off the tally said aylward who had come aboard with his lord there are seven of the winchester men eleven seamen your squire young master terlake and nine archers  and of the others  they are all deadsave only the norman knight who stands behind you what would you that we should do with him  he must hang on his own yard said sir nigel it was my vow and must be done  the pirate leader had stood by the bulwarks a cord round his arms and two stout archers on either side at sir nigels words he started violently and his swarthy features blanched to a livid gray  how sir knight he cried in broken english que dites vous to hang le mort du chien to hang  it is my vow said sir nigel shortly from what i hear you thought little enough of hanging others  peasants base roturiers cried the other it is their fitting death mais le seigneur dandelys avec le sang des rois dans ses veins cest incroyable  sir nigel turned upon his heel while two seamen cast a noose over the pirates neck at the touch of the cord he snapped the bonds which bound him dashed one of the archers to the deck and seizing the other round the waist sprang with him into the sea  by my hilt he is gone cried aylward rushing to the side they have sunk together like a stone  i am right glad of it answered sir nigel for though it was against my vow to loose him i deem that he has carried himself like a very gentle and debonnaire cavalier    chapter xvii how the yellow cog crossed the bar of gironde   for two days the yellow cog ran swiftly before a northeasterly wind and on the dawn of the third the high land of ushant lay like a mist upon the shimmering skyline there came a plump of rain towards midday and the breeze died down but it freshened again before nightfall and goodwin hawtayne veered his sheet and held head for the south next morning they had passed belle isle and ran through the midst of a fleet of transports returning from guienne sir nigel loring and sir oliver buttesthorn at once hung their shields over the side and displayed their pennons as was the custom noting with the keenest interest the answering symbols which told the names of the cavaliers who had been constrained by ill health or wounds to leave the prince at so critical a time  that evening a great duncolored cloud banked up in the west and an anxious man was goodwin hawtayne for a third part of his crew had been slain and half the remainder were aboard the galleys so that with an injured ship he was little fit to meet such a storm as sweeps over those waters all night it blew in short fitful puffs heeling the great cog over until the water curled over her lee bulwarks as the wind still freshened the yard was lowered half way down the mast in the morning alleyne wretchedly ill and weak with his head still ringing from the blow which he had received crawled up upon deck waterswept and aslant it was preferable to the noisome rathaunted dungeons which served as cabins there clinging to the stout halliards of the sheet he gazed with amazement at the long lines of black waves each with its curling ridge of foam racing in endless succession from out the inexhaustible west a huge sombre cloud flecked with livid blotches stretched over the whole seaward skyline with long ragged streamers whirled out in front of it far behind them the two galleys labored heavily now sinking between the rollers until their yards were level with the waves and again shooting up with a reeling scooping motion until every spar and rope stood out hard against the sky on the left the lowlying land stretched in a dim haze rising here and there into a darker blur which marked the higher capes and headlands the land of france alleynes eyes shone as he gazed upon it the land of francethe very words sounded as the call of a bugle in the ears of the youth of england the land where their fathers had bled the home of chivalry and of knightly deeds the country of gallant men of courtly women of princely buildings of the wise the polished and the sainted there it lay so still and gray beneath the drifting wrackthe home of things noble and of things shamefulthe theatre where a new name might be made or an old one marred from his bosom to his lips came the crumpled veil and he breathed a vow that if valor and goodwill could raise him to his ladys side then death alone should hold him back from her his thoughts were still in the woods of minstead and the old armory of twynham castle when the hoarse voice of the mastershipman brought them back once more to the bay of biscay  by my troth young sir he said you are as long in the face as the devil at a christening and i cannot marvel at it for i have sailed these waters since i was as high as this whinyard and yet i never saw more sure promise of an evil night  nay i had other things upon my mind the squire answered  and so has every man cried hawtayne in an injured voice let the shipman see to it it is the mastershipmans affair put it all upon good master hawtayne never had i so much care since first i blew trumpet and showed cartel at the west gate of southampton  what is amiss then asked alleyne for the mans words were as gusty as the weather  amiss quotha here am i with but half my mariners and a hole in the ship where that twentydevil stone struck us big enough to fit the fat widow of northam through it is well enough on this tack but i would have you tell me what i am to do on the other we are like to have salt water upon us until we be found pickled like the herrings in an easterlings barrels  what says sir nigel to it  he is below pricking out the coatarmor of his mothers uncle pester me not with such small matters was all that i could get from him then there is sir oliver fry them in oil with a dressing of gascony quoth he and then swore at me because i had not been the cook walawa thought i mad master sober manso away forward to the archers harrow and alas but they were worse than the others  would they not help you then  nay they sat tway and tway at a board him that they call aylward and the great redheaded man who snapped the normans armbone and the black man from norwich and a score of others rattling their dice in an archers gauntlet for want of a box the ship can scarce last much longer my masters quoth i that is your business old swineshead cried the black galliard le diable temporte says aylward a five a four and the main shouted the big man with a voice like the flap of a sail hark to them now young sir and say if i speak not sooth  as he spoke there sounded high above the shriek of the gale and the straining of the timbers a gust of oaths with a roar of deepchested mirth from the gamblers in the forecastle  can i be of avail asked alleyne say the word and the thing is done if two hands may do it  nay nay your head i can see is still totty and i faith little head would you have had your bassinet not stood your friend all that may be done is already carried out for we have stuffed the gape with sails and corded it without and within yet when we bale our bowline and veer the sheet our lives will hang upon the breach remaining blocked see how yonder headland looms upon us through the mist we must tack within three arrow flights or we may find a rock through our timbers now st christopher be praised here is sir nigel with whom i may confer  i prythee that you will pardon me said the knight clutching his way along the bulwark i would not show lack of courtesy toward a worthy man but i was deep in a matter of some weight concerning which alleyne i should be glad of your rede it touches the question of dimidiation or impalement in the coat of mine uncle sir john leighton of shropshire who took unto wife the widow of sir henry oglander of nunwell the case has been much debated by pursuivants and kingsofarms but how is it with you master shipman  ill enough my fair lord the cog must go about anon and i know not how we may keep the water out of her  go call sir oliver said sir nigel and presently the portly knight made his way all astraddle down the slippery deck  by my soul mastershipman this passes all patience he cried wrathfully if this ship of yours must needs dance and skip like a clown at a kermesse then i pray you that you will put me into one of these galeasses i had but sat down to a flask of malvoisie and a mortress of brawn as is my use about this hour when there comes a cherking and i find my wine over my legs and the flask in my lap and then as i stoop to clip it there comes another cursed cherk and there is a mortress of brawn stuck fast to the nape of my neck at this moment i have two pages coursing after it from side to side like hounds behind a leveret never did living pig gambol more lightly but you have sent for me sir nigel  i would fain have your rede sir oliver for master hawtayne hath fears that when we veer there may come danger from the hole in our side  then do not veer quoth sir oliver hastily and now fair sir i must hasten back to see how my rogues have fared with the brawn  nay but this will scarce suffice cried the shipman if we do not veer we will be upon the rocks within the hour  then veer said sir oliver there is my rede and now sir nigel i must crave  at this instant however a startled shout rang out from two seamen upon the forecastle rocks they yelled stabbing into the air with their forefingers rocks beneath our very bows through the belly of a great black wave not one hundred paces to the front of them there thrust forth a huge jagged mass of brown stone which spouted spray as though it were some crouching monster while a dull menacing boom and roar filled the air  yare yare screamed goodwin hawtayne flinging himself upon the long pole which served as a tiller cut the halliard haul her over lay her two courses to the wind  over swung the great boom and the cog trembled and quivered within five spearlengths of the breakers  she can scarce draw clear cried hawtayne with his eyes from the sail to the seething line of foam may the holy julian stand by us and the thricesainted christopher  if there be such peril sir oliver quoth sir nigel it would be very knightly and fitting that we should show our pennons i pray you edricson that you will command my guidonbearer to put forward my banner  and sound the trumpets cried sir oliver in manus tuas domine i am in the keeping of james of compostella to whose shrine i shall make pilgrimage and in whose honor i vow that i will eat a carp each year upon his feastday mon dieu but the waves roar how is it with us now mastershipman  we draw we draw cried hawtayne with his eyes still fixed upon the foam which hissed under the very bulge of the side ah holy mother be with us now  as he spoke the cog rasped along the edge of the reef and a long white curling sheet of wood was planed off from her side from waist to poop by a jutting horn of the rock at the same instant she lay suddenly over the sail drew full and she plunged seawards amid the shoutings of the seamen and the archers  the virgin be praised cried the shipman wiping his brow for this shall bell swing and candle burn when i see southampton water once more cheerily my hearts pull yarely on the bowline  by my soul i would rather have a dry death quoth sir oliver though mort dieu i have eaten so many fish that it were but justice that the fish should eat me now i must back to the cabin for i have matters there which crave my attention  nay sir oliver you had best bide with us and still show your ensign sir nigel answered for if i understand the matter aright we have but turned from one danger to the other  good master hawtayne cried the boatswain rushing aft the water comes in upon us apace the waves have driven in the sail wherewith we strove to stop the hole as he spoke the seamen came swarming on to the poop and the forecastle to avoid the torrent which poured through the huge leak into the waist high above the roar of the wind and the clash of the sea rose the shrill halfhuman cries of the horses as they found the water rising rapidly around them  stop it from without cried hawtayne seizing the end of the wet sail with which the gap had been plugged speedily my hearts or we are gone swiftly they rove ropes to the corners and then rushing forward to the bows they lowered them under the keel and drew them tight in such a way that the sail should cover the outer face of the gap the force of the rush of water was checked by this obstacle but it still squirted plentifully from every side of it at the sides the horses were above the belly and in the centre a man from the poop could scarce touch the deck with a sevenfoot spear the cog lay lower in the water and the waves splashed freely over the weather bulwark  i fear that we can scarce bide upon this tack cried hawtayne and yet the other will drive us on the rocks  might we not haul down sail and wait for better times suggested sir nigel  nay we should drift upon the rocks thirty years have i been on the sea and never yet in greater straits yet we are in the hands of the saints  of whom cried sir oliver i look more particularly to st james of compostella who hath already befriended us this day and on whose feast i hereby vow that i shall eat a second carp if he will but interpose a second time  the wrack had thickened to seaward and the coast was but a blurred line two vague shadows in the offing showed where the galeasses rolled and tossed upon the great atlantic rollers hawtayne looked wistfully in their direction  if they would but lie closer we might find safety even should the cog founder you will bear me out with good master witherton of southampton that i have done all that a shipman might it would be well that you should doff camail and greaves sir nigel for by the black rood it is like enough that we shall have to swim for it  nay said the little knight it would be scarce fitting that a cavalier should throw off his harness for the fear of every puff of wind and puddle of water i would rather that my company should gather round me here on the poop where we might abide together whatever god may be pleased to send but certes master hawtayne for all that my sight is none of the best it is not the first time that i have seen that headland upon the left  the seaman shaded his eyes with his hand and gazed earnestly through the haze and spray suddenly he threw up his arms and shouted aloud in his joy  tis the point of la tremblade he cried i had not thought that we were as far as oleron the gironde lies before us and once over the bar and under shelter of the tour de cordouan all will be well with us veer again my hearts and bring her to try with the main course  the sail swung round once more and the cog battered and torn and wellnigh waterlogged staggered in for this haven of refuge a bluff cape to the north and a long spit to the south marked the mouth of the noble river with a lowlying island of silted sand in the centre all shrouded and curtained by the spume of the breakers a line of broken water traced the dangerous bar which in clear day and balmy weather has cracked the back of many a tall ship  there is a channel said hawtayne which was shown to me by the princes own pilot mark yonder tree upon the bank and see the tower which rises behind it if these two be held in a line even as we hold them now it may be done though our ship draws two good ells more than when she put forth  god speed you master hawtayne cried sir oliver twice have we come scathless out of peril and now for the third time i commend me to the blessed james of compostella to whom i vow  nay nay old friend whispered sir nigel you are like to bring a judgment upon us with these vows which no living man could accomplish have i not already heard you vow to eat two carp in one day and now you would venture upon a third  i pray you that you will order the company to lie down cried hawtayne who had taken the tiller and was gazing ahead with a fixed eye in three minutes we shall either be lost or in safety  archers and seamen lay flat upon the deck waiting in stolid silence for whatever fate might come hawtayne bent his weight upon the tiller and crouched to see under the bellying sail sir oliver and sir nigel stood erect with hands crossed in front of the poop down swooped the great cog into the narrow channel which was the portal to safety on either bow roared the shallow bar right ahead one small lane of black swirling water marked the pilots course but true was the eye and firm the hand which guided a dull scraping came from beneath the vessel quivered and shook at the waist at the quarter and behind sounded that grim roaring of the waters and with a plunge the yellow cog was over the bar and speeding swiftly up the broad and tranquil estuary of the gironde    chapter xviii how sir nigel loring put a patch upon his eye   it was on the morning of friday the eightandtwentieth day of november two days before the feast of st andrew that the cog and her two prisoners after a weary tacking up the gironde and the garonne dropped anchor at last in front of the noble city of bordeaux with wonder and admiration alleyne leaning over the bulwarks gazed at the forest of masts the swarm of boats darting hither and thither on the bosom of the broad curving stream and the gray crescentshaped city which stretched with many a tower and minaret along the western shore never had he in his quiet life seen so great a town nor was there in the whole of england save london alone one which might match it in size or in wealth here came the merchandise of all the fair countries which are watered by the garonne and the dordognethe cloths of the south the skins of guienne the wines of the medocto be borne away to hull exeter dartmouth bristol or chester in exchange for the wools and woolfels of england here too dwelt those famous smelters and welders who had made the bordeaux steel the most trusty upon earth and could give a temper to lance or to sword which might mean dear life to its owner alleyne could see the smoke of their forges reeking up in the clear morning air the storm had died down now to a gentle breeze which wafted to his ears the longdrawn stirring buglecalls which sounded from the ancient ramparts  hola mon petit said aylward coming up to where he stood thou art a squire now and like enough to win the golden spurs while i am still the masterbowman and masterbowman i shall bide i dare scarce wag my tongue so freely with you as when we tramped together past wilverley chase else i might be your guide now for indeed i know every house in bordeaux as a friar knows the beads on his rosary  nay aylward said alleyne laying his hand upon the sleeve of his companions frayed jerkin you cannot think me so thrall as to throw aside an old friend because i have had some small share of good fortune i take it unkind that you should have thought such evil of me  nay mon gar twas but a flight shot to see if the wind blew steady though i were a rogue to doubt it  why had i not met you aylward at the lynhurst inn who can say where i had now been certes i had not gone to twynham castle nor become squire to sir nigel nor met he paused abruptly and flushed to his hair but the bowman was too busy with his own thoughts to notice his young companions embarrassment  it was a good hostel that of the pied merlin he remarked by my ten finger bones when i hang bow on nail and change my brigandine for a tunic i might do worse than take over the dame and her business  i thought said alleyne that you were betrothed to some one at christchurch  to three aylward answered moodily to three i fear i may not go back to christchurch i might chance to see hotter service in hampshire than i have ever done in gascony but mark you now yonder lofty turret in the centre which stands back from the river and hath a broad banner upon the summit see the rising sun flashes full upon it and sparkles on the golden lions tis the royal banner of england crossed by the princes label there he dwells in the abbey of st andrew where he hath kept his court these years back beside it is the minster of the same saint who hath the town under his very special care  and how of yon gray turret on the left  tis the fane of st michael as that upon the right is of st remi there too above the poop of yonder nief you see the towers of saint croix and of pey berland mark also the mighty ramparts which are pierced by the three watergates and sixteen others to the landward side  and how is it good aylward that there comes so much music from the town i seem to hear a hundred trumpets all calling in chorus  it would be strange else seeing that all the great lords of england and of gascony are within the walls and each would have his trumpeter blow as loud as his neighbor lest it might be thought that his dignity had been abated ma foi they make as much louster as a scotch army where every man fills himself with girdlecakes and sits up all night to blow upon the toodlepipe see all along the banks how the pages water the horses and there beyond the town how they gallop them over the plain for every horse you see a belted knight hath herbergage in the town for as i learn the menatarms and archers have already gone forward to dax  i trust aylward said sir nigel coming upon deck that the men are ready for the land go tell them that the boats will be for them within the hour  the archer raised his hand in salute and hastened forward in the meantime sir oliver had followed his brother knight and the two paced the poop together sir nigel in his plumcolored velvet suit with flat cap of the same adorned in front with the lady lorings glove and girt round with a curling ostrich feather the lusty knight on the other hand was clad in the very latest mode with cotehardie doublet pourpoint courtpie and paltock of olivegreen picked out with pink and jagged at the edges a red chaperon or cap with long hanging cornette sat daintily on the back of his blackcurled head while his goldhued shoes were twisted up a la poulaine as though the toes were shooting forth a tendril which might hope in time to entwine itself around his massive leg  once more sir oliver said sir nigel looking shorewards with sparkling eyes do we find ourselves at the gate of honor the door which hath so often led us to all that is knightly and worthy there flies the princes banner and it would be well that we haste ashore and pay our obeisance to him the boats already swarm from the bank  there is a goodly hostel near the west gate which is famed for the stewing of spiced pullets remarked sir oliver we might take the edge of our hunger off ere we seek the prince for though his tables are gay with damask and silver he is no trencherman himself and hath no sympathy for those who are his betters  his betters  his betters before the tranchoir lad sniff not treason where none is meant i have seen him smile in his quiet way because i had looked for the fourth time towards the carving squire and indeed to watch him dallying with a little gobbet of bread or sipping his cup of thricewatered wine is enough to make a man feel shame at his own hunger yet war and glory my good friend though well enough in their way will not serve to tighten such a belt as clasps my waist  how read you that coat which hangs over yonder galley alleyne asked sir nigel  argent a bend vert between cotises dancette gules  it is a northern coat i have seen it in the train of the percies from the shields there is not one of these vessels which hath not knight or baron aboard i would mine eyes were better how read you this upon the left  argent and azure a barry wavy of six  ha it is the sign of the wiltshire stourtons and there beyond i see the red and silver of the worsleys of apuldercombe who like myself are of hampshire lineage close behind us is the moline cross of the gallant william molyneux and beside it the bloody chevrons of the norfork woodhouses with the amulets of the musgraves of westmoreland by st paul it would be a very strange thing if so noble a company were to gather without some notable deed of arms arising from it and here is our boat sir oliver so it seems best to me that we should go to the abbey with our squires leaving master hawtayne to have his own way in the unloading  the horses both of knights and squires were speedily lowered into a broad lighter and reached the shore almost as soon as their masters sir nigel bent his knee devoutly as he put foot on land and taking a small black patch from his bosom he bound it tightly over his left eye  may the blessed george and the memory of my sweet ladylove raise high my heart quoth he and as a token i vow that i will not take this patch from my eye until i have seen something of this country of spain and done such a small deed as it lies in me to do and this i swear upon the cross of my sword and upon the glove of my lady  in truth you take me back twenty years nigel quoth sir oliver as they mounted and rode slowly through the watergate after cadsand i deem that the french thought that we were an army of the blind for there was scarce a man who had not closed an eye for the greater love and honor of his lady yet it goes hard with you that you should darken one side when with both open you can scarce tell a horse from a mule in truth friend i think that you step over the line of reason in this matter  sir oliver buttesthorn said the little knight shortly i would have you to understand that blind as i am i can yet see the path of honor very clearly and that that is the road upon which i do not crave another mans guidance  by my soul said sir oliver you are as tart as verjuice this morning if you are bent upon a quarrel with me i must leave you to your humor and drop into the tete dor here for i marked a varlet pass the door who bare a smoking dish which had methought a most excellent smell  nenny nenny cried his comrade laying his hand upon his knee we have known each other over long to fall out oliver like two raw pages at their first epreuves you must come with me first to the prince and then back to the hostel though sure i am that it would grieve his heart that any gentle cavalier should turn from his board to a common tavern but is not that my lord delewar who waves to us ha my fair lord god and our lady be with you and there is sir robert cheney goodmorrow robert i am right glad to see you  the two knights walked their horses abreast while alleyne and ford with john norbury who was squire to sir oliver kept some paces behind them a spearslength in front of black simon and of the winchester guidonbearer norbury a lean silent man had been to those parts before and sat his horse with a rigid neck but the two young squires gazed eagerly to right or left and plucked each others sleeves to call attention to the many strange things on every side of them  see to the brave stalls cried alleyne see to the noble armor set forth and the costly taffetaand oh ford see to where the scrivener sits with the pigments and the inkhorns and the rolls of sheepskin as white as the beaulieu napery saw man ever the like before  nay man there are finer stalls in cheapside answered ford whose father had taken him to london on occasion of one of the smithfield joustings i have seen a silversmiths booth there which would serve to buy either side of this street but mark these houses alleyne how they thrust forth upon the top and see to the coatsofarms at every window and banner or pensil on the roof  and the churches cried alleyne the priory at christ church was a noble pile but it was cold and bare methinks by one of these with their frettings and their carvings and their traceries as though some great ivyplant of stone had curled and wantoned over the walls  and hark to the speech of the folk said ford was ever such a hissing and clacking i wonder that they have not wit to learn english now that they have come under the english crown by richard of hampole there are fair faces amongst them see the wench with the brown whimple out on you alleyne that you would rather gaze upon dead stone than on living flesh  it was little wonder that the richness and ornament not only of church and of stall but of every private house as well should have impressed itself upon the young squires the town was now at the height of its fortunes besides its trade and its armorers other causes had combined to pour wealth into it war which had wrought evil upon so many fair cities around had brought nought but good to this one as her french sisters decayed she increased for here from north and from east and from south came the plunder to be sold and the ransom money to be spent through all her sixteen landward gates there had set for many years a double tide of emptyhanded soldiers hurrying francewards and of enriched and laden bands who brought their spoils home the princes court too with its swarm of noble barons and wealthy knights many of whom in imitation of their master had brought their ladies and their children from england all helped to swell the coffers of the burghers now with this fresh influx of noblemen and cavaliers food and lodging were scarce to be had and the prince was hurrying forward his forces to dax in gascony to relieve the overcrowding of his capital  in front of the minster and abbey of st andrews was a large square crowded with priests soldiers women friars and burghers who made it their common centre for sightseeing and gossip amid the knot of noisy and gesticulating townsfolk many small parties of mounted knights and squires threaded their way towards the princes quarters where the huge ironclamped doors were thrown back to show that he held audience within twoscore archers stood about the gateway and beat back from time to time with their bowstaves the inquisitive and chattering crowd who swarmed round the portal two knights in full armor with lances raised and closed visors sat their horses on either side while in the centre with two pages to tend upon him there stood a noblefaced man in flowing purple gown who pricked off upon a sheet of parchment the style and title of each applicant marshalling them in their due order and giving to each the place and facility which his rank demanded his long white beard and searching eyes imparted to him an air of masterful dignity which was increased by his tabardlike vesture and the heraldic barret cap with triple plume which bespoke his office  it is sir william de pakington the princes own herald and scrivener whispered sir nigel as they pulled up amid the line of knights who waited admission ill fares it with the man who would venture to deceive him he hath by rote the name of every knight of france or of england and all the tree of his family with his kinships coatarmor marriages augmentations abatements and i know not what beside we may leave our horses here with the varlets and push forward with our squires  following sir nigels counsel they pressed on upon foot until they were close to the princes secretary who was in high debate with a young and foppish knight who was bent upon making his way past him  mackworth said the kingatarms it is in my mind young sir that you have not been presented before  nay it is but a day since i set foot in bordeaux but i feared lest the prince should think it strange that i had not waited upon him  the prince hath other things to think upon quoth sir william de pakington but if you be a mackworth you must be a mackworth of normanton and indeed i see now that your coat is sable and ermine  i am a mackworth of normanton the other answered with some uneasiness of manner  then you must be sir stephen mackworth for i learn that when old sir guy died he came in for the arms and the name the warcry and the profit  sir stephen is my elder brother and i am arthur the second son said the youth  in sooth and in sooth cried the kingatarms with scornful eyes and pray sir second son where is the cadency mark which should mark your rank dare you to wear your brothers coat without the crescent which should stamp you as his cadet away to your lodgings and come not nigh the prince until the armorer hath placed the true charge upon your shield as the youth withdrew in confusion sir williams keen eye singled out the five red roses from amid the overlapping shields and cloud of pennons which faced him  ha he cried there are charges here which are above counterfeit the roses of loring and the boars head of buttesthorn may stand back in peace but by my faith they are not to be held back in war welcome sir oliver sir nigel chandos will be glad to his very heartroots when he sees you this way my fair sirs your squires are doubtless worthy the fame of their masters down this passage sir oliver edricson ha one of the old strain of hampshire edricsons i doubt not and ford they are of a south saxon stock and of good repute there are norburys in cheshire and in wiltshire and also as i have heard upon the borders so my fair sirs and i shall see that you are shortly admitted  he had finished his professional commentary by flinging open a folding door and ushering the party into a broad hall which was filled with a great number of people who were waiting like themselves for an audience the room was very spacious lighted on one side by three arched and mullioned windows while opposite was a huge fireplace in which a pile of faggots was blazing merrily many of the company had crowded round the flames for the weather was bitterly cold but the two knights seated themselves upon a bancal with their squires standing behind them looking down the room alleyne marked that both floor and ceiling were of the richest oak the latter spanned by twelve arching beams which were adorned at either end by the lilies and the lions of the royal arms on the further side was a small door on each side of which stood menatarms from time to time an elderly man in black with rounded shoulders and a long white wand in his hand came softly forth from this inner room and beckoned to one or other of the company who doffed cap and followed him  the two knights were deep in talk when alleyne became aware of a remarkable individual who was walking round the room in their direction as he passed each knot of cavaliers every head turned to look after him and it was evident from the bows and respectful salutations on all sides that the interest which he excited was not due merely to his strange personal appearance he was tall and straight as a lance though of a great age for his hair which curled from under his velvet cap of maintenance was as white as the newfallen snow yet from the swing of his stride and the spring of his step it was clear that he had not yet lost the fire and activity of his youth his fierce hawklike face was clean shaven like that of a priest save for a long thin wisp of white moustache which drooped down half way to his shoulder that he had been handsome might be easily judged from his high aquiline nose and clearcut chin but his features had been so distorted by the seams and scars of old wounds and by the loss of one eye which had been torn from the socket that there was little left to remind one of the dashing young knight who had been fifty years ago the fairest as well as the boldest of the english chivalry yet what knight was there in that hall of st andrews who would not have gladly laid down youth beauty and all that he possessed to win the fame of this man for who could be named with chandos the stainless knight the wise councillor the valiant warrior the hero of crecy of winchelsea of poictiers of auray and of as many other battles as there were years to his life  ha my little heart of gold he cried darting forward suddenly and throwing his arms round sir nigel i heard that you were here and have been seeking you  my fair and dear lord said the knight returning the warriors embrace i have indeed come back to you for where else shall i go that i may learn to be a gentle and a hardy knight  by my troth said chandos with a smile it is very fitting that we should be companions nigel for since you have tied up one of your eyes and i have had the mischance to lose one of mine we have but a pair between us ah sir oliver you were on the blind side of me and i saw you not a wise woman hath made prophecy that this blind side will one day be the death of me we shall go in to the prince anon but in truth he hath much upon his hands for what with pedro and the king of majorca and the king of navarre who is no two days of the same mind and the gascon barons who are all chaffering for terms like so many hucksters he hath an uneasy part to play but how left you the lady loring  she was well my fair lord and sent her service and greetings to you  i am ever her knight and slave and your journey i trust that it was pleasant  as heart could wish we had sight of two rover galleys and even came to have some slight bickering with them  ever in lucks way nigel quoth sir john we must hear the tale anon but i deem it best that ye should leave your squires and come with me for howsoeer pressed the prince may be i am very sure that he would be loth to keep two old comradesinarms upon the further side of the door follow close behind me and i will forestall old sir william though i can scarce promise to roll forth your style and rank as is his wont so saying he led the way to the inner chamber the two companions treading close at his heels and nodding to right and left as they caught sight of familiar faces among the crowd    chapter xix how there was stir at the abbey of st andrews   the princes receptionroom although of no great size was fitted up with all the state and luxury which the fame and power of its owner demanded a high dais at the further end was roofed in by a broad canopy of scarlet velvet spangled with silver fleursdelis and supported at either corner by silver rods this was approached by four steps carpeted with the same material while all round were scattered rich cushions oriental mats and costly rugs of fur the choicest tapestries which the looms of arras could furnish draped the walls whereon the battles of judas maccabaeus were set forth with the jewish warriors in plate of proof with crest and lance and banderole as the naive artists of the day were wont to depict them a few rich settles and bancals choicely carved and decorated with glazed leather hangings of the sort termed or basane completed the furniture of the apartment save that at one side of the dais there stood a lofty perch upon which a cast of three solemn prussian gerfalcons sat hooded and jesseled as silent and motionless as the royal fowler who stood beside them  in the centre of the dais were two very high chairs with dorserets which arched forwards over the heads of the occupants the whole covered with lightblue silk thickly powdered with golden stars on that to the right sat a very tall and well formed man with red hair a livid face and a cold blue eye which had in it something peculiarly sinister and menacing he lounged back in a careless position and yawned repeatedly as though heartily weary of the proceedings stooping from time to time to fondle a shaggy spanish greyhound which lay stretched at his feet on the other throne there was perched bolt upright with prim demeanor as though he felt himself to be upon his good behavior a little round pippin faced person who smiled and bobbed to every one whose eye he chanced to meet between and a little in front of them on a humble charette or stool sat a slim dark young man whose quiet attire and modest manner would scarce proclaim him to be the most noted prince in europe a jupon of dark blue cloth tagged with buckles and pendants of gold seemed but a sombre and plain attire amidst the wealth of silk and ermine and gilt tissue of fustian with which he was surrounded he sat with his two hands clasped round his knee his head slightly bent and an expression of impatience and of trouble upon his clear wellchiselled features behind the thrones there stood two men in purple gowns with ascetic cleanshaven faces and half a dozen other high dignitaries and officeholders of aquitaine below on either side of the steps were forty or fifty barons knights and courtiers ranged in a triple row to the right and the left with a clear passage in the centre  there sits the prince whispered sir john chandos as they entered he on the right is pedro whom we are about to put upon the spanish throne the other is don james whom we purpose with the aid of god to help to his throne in majorca now follow me and take it not to heart if he be a little short in his speech for indeed his mind is full of many very weighty concerns  the prince however had already observed their entrance and springing to his feet he had advanced with a winning smile and the light of welcome in his eyes  we do not need your good offices as herald here sir john said he in a low but clear voice these valiant knights are very well known to me welcome to aquitaine sir nigel loring and sir oliver buttesthorn nay keep your knee for my sweet father at windsor i would have your hands my friends we are like to give you some work to do ere you see the downs of hampshire once more know you aught of spain sir oliver  nought my sire save that i have heard men say that there is a dish named an olla which is prepared there though i have never been clear in my mind as to whether it was but a ragout such as is to be found in the south or whether there is some seasoning such as fennel or garlic which is peculiar to spain  your doubts sir oliver shall soon be resolved answered the prince laughing heartily as did many of the barons who surrounded them his majesty here will doubtless order that you have this dish hotly seasoned when we are all safely in castile  i will have a hotly seasoned dish for some folk i know of answered don pedro with a cold smile  but my friend sir oliver can fight right hardily without either bite or sup remarked the prince did i not see him at poictiers when for two days we had not more than a crust of bread and a cup of foul water yet carrying himself most valiantly with my own eyes i saw him in the rout sweep the head from a knight of picardy with one blow of his sword  the rogue got between me and the nearest french victual wain muttered sir oliver amid a fresh titter from those who were near enough to catch his words  how many have you in your train asked the prince assuming a graver mien  i have forty menatarms sire said sir oliver  and i have one hundred archers and a score of lancers but there are two hundred men who wait for me on this side of the water upon the borders of navarre  and who are they sir nigel  they are a free company sire and they are called the white company  to the astonishment of the knight his words provoked a burst of merriment from the barons round in which the two kings and the prince were fain to join sir nigel blinked mildly from one to the other until at last perceiving a stout blackbearded knight at his elbow whose laugh rang somewhat louder than the others he touched him lightly upon the sleeve  perchance my fair sir he whispered there is some small vow of which i may relieve you might we not have some honorable debate upon the matter your gentle courtesy may perhaps grant me an exchange of thrusts  nay nay sir nigel cried the prince fasten not the offence upon sir robert briquet for we are one and all bogged in the same mire truth to say our ears have just been vexed by the doings of the same company and i have even now made vow to hang the man who held the rank of captain over it i little thought to find him among the bravest of my own chosen chieftains but the vow is now nought for as you have never seen your company it would be a fools act to blame you for their doings  my liege said sir nigel it is a very small matter that i should be hanged albeit the manner of death is somewhat more ignoble than i had hoped for on the other hand it would be a very grievous thing that you the prince of england and the flower of knighthood should make a vow whether in ignorance or no and fail to bring it to fulfilment  vex not your mind on that the prince answered smiling we have had a citizen from montauban here this very day who told us such a tale of sack and murder and pillage that it moved our blood but our wrath was turned upon the man who was in authority over them  my dear and honored master cried nigel in great anxiety i fear me much that in your gentleness of heart you are straining this vow which you have taken if there be so much as a shadow of a doubt as to the form of it it were a thousand times best  peace peace cried the prince impatiently i am very well able to look to my own vows and their performance we hope to see you both in the banquethall anon meanwhile you will attend upon us with our train he bowed and chandos plucking sir oliver by the sleeve led them both away to the back of the press of courtiers  why little coz he whispered you are very eager to have your neck in a noose by my soul had you asked as much from our new ally don pedro he had not baulked you between friends there is overmuch of the hangman in him and too little of the prince but indeed this white company is a rough band and may take some handling ere you find yourself safe in your captaincy  i doubt not with the help of st paul that i shall bring them to some order sir nigel answered but there are many faces here which are new to me though others have been before me since first i waited upon my dear master sir walter i pray you to tell me sir john who are these priests upon the dais  the one is the archbishop of bordeaux nigel and the other the bishop of agen  and the dark knight with graystreaked beard by my troth he seems to be a man of much wisdom and valor  he is sir william felton who with my unworthy self is the chief counsellor of the prince he being high steward and i the seneschal of aquitaine  and the knights upon the right beside don pedro  they are cavaliers of spain who have followed him in his exile the one at his elbow is fernando de castro who is as brave and true a man as heart could wish in front to the right are the gascon lords you may well tell them by their clouded brows for there hath been some illwill of late betwixt the prince and them the tall and burly man is the captal de buch whom i doubt not that you know for a braver knight never laid lance in rest that heavyfaced cavalier who plucks his skirts and whispers in his ear is lord oliver de clisson known also as the butcher he it is who stirs up strife and forever blows the dying embers into flame the man with the mole upon his cheek is the lord pommers and his two brothers stand behind him with the lord lesparre lord de rosem lord de mucident sir perducas dalbret the souldich de la trane and others further back are knights from quercy limousin saintonge poitou and aquitaine with the valiant sir guiscard dangle that is he in the rosecolored doublet with the ermine  and the knights upon this side  they are all englishmen some of the household and others who like yourself are captains of companies there is lord neville sir stephen cossington and sir matthew gourney with sir walter huet sir thomas banaster and sir thomas felton who is the brother of the high steward mark well the man with the high nose and flaxen beard who hath placed his hand upon the shoulder of the dark hardfaced cavalier in the ruststained jupon  aye by st paul observed sir nigel they both bear the print of their armor upon their coteshardies methinks they are men who breathe freer in a camp than a court  there are many of us who do that nigel said chandos and the head of the court is i dare warrant among them but of these two men the one is sir hugh calverley and the other is sir robert knolles  sir nigel and sir oliver craned their necks to have the clearer view of these famous warriors the one a chosen leader of free companies the other a man who by his fierce valor and energy had raised himself from the lowest ranks until he was second only to chandos himself in the esteem of the army  he hath no light hand in war hath sir robert said chandos if he passes through a country you may tell it for some years to come i have heard that in the north it is still the use to call a house which hath but the two gable ends left without walls or roof a knolles mitre  i have often heard of him said nigel and i have hoped to be so far honored as to run a course with him but hark sir john what is amiss with the prince  whilst chandos had been conversing with the two knights a continuous stream of suitors had been ushered in adventurers seeking to sell their swords and merchants clamoring over some grievance a ship detained for the carriage of troops or a tun of sweet wine which had the bottom knocked out by a troop of thirsty archers a few words from the prince disposed of each case and if the applicant liked not the judgment a quick glance from the princes dark eyes sent him to the door with the grievance all gone out of him the younger ruler had sat listlessly upon his stool with the two puppet monarchs enthroned behind him but of a sudden a dark shadow passed over his face and he sprang to his feet in one of those gusts of passion which were the single blot upon his noble and generous character  how now don martin de la carra he cried how now sirrah what message do you bring to us from our brother of navarre  the newcomer to whom this abrupt query had been addressed was a tall and exceedingly handsome cavalier who had just been ushered into the apartment his swarthy cheek and raven black hair spoke of the fiery south and he wore his long black cloak swathed across his chest and over his shoulders in a graceful sweeping fashion which was neither english nor french with stately steps and many profound bows he advanced to the foot of the dais before replying to the princes question  my powerful and illustrious master he began charles king of navarre earl of evreux count of champagne who also writeth himself overlord of bearn hereby sends his love and greetings to his dear cousin edward the prince of wales governor of aquitaine grand commander of  tush tush don martin interrupted the prince who had been beating the ground with his foot impatiently during this stately preamble we already know our cousins titles and style and certes we know our own to the point man and at once are the passes open to us or does your master go back from his word pledged to me at libourne no later than last michaelmas  it would ill become my gracious master sire to go back from promise given he does but ask some delay and certain conditions and hostages  conditions hostages is he speaking to the prince of england or is it to the bourgeois provost of some halfcaptured town conditions quotha he may find much to mend in his own condition ere long the passes are then closed to us  nay sire  they are open then  nay sire if you would but  enough enough don martin cried the prince it is a sorry sight to see so true a knight pleading in so false a cause we know the doings of our cousin charles we know that while with the right hand he takes our fifty thousand crowns for the holding of the passes open he hath his left outstretched to henry of trastamare or to the king of france all ready to take as many more for the keeping them closed i know our good charles and by my blessed namesaint the confessor he shall learn that i know him he sets his kingdom up to the best bidder like some scullion farrier selling a glandered horse he is  my lord cried don martin i cannot stand there to hear such words of my master did they come from other lips i should know better how to answer them  don pedro frowned and curled his lip but the prince smiled and nodded his approbation  your bearing and your words don martin are such i should have looked for in you he remarked you will tell the king your master that he hath been paid his price and that if he holds to his promise he hath my word for it that no scath shall come to his people nor to their houses or gear if however we have not his leave i shall come close at the heels of this message without his leave and bearing a key with me which shall open all that he may close he stooped and whispered to sir robert knolles and sir huge calverley who smiled as men well pleased and hastened from the room  our cousin charles has had experience of our friendship the prince continued and now by the saints he shall feel a touch of our displeasure i send now a message to our cousin charles which his whole kingdom may read let him take heed lest worse befall him where is my lord chandos ha sir john i commend this worthy knight to your care you will see that he hath refection and such a purse of gold as may defray his charges for indeed it is great honor to any court to have within it so noble and gentle a cavalier how say you sire he asked turning to the spanish refugee while the herald of navarre was conducted from the chamber by the old warrior  it is not our custom in spain to reward pertness in a messenger don pedro answered patting the head of his greyhound yet we have all heard the lengths to which your royal generosity runs  in sooth yes cried the king of majorca  who should know it better than we said don pedro bitterly since we have had to fly to you in our trouble as to the natural protector of all who are weak  nay nay as brothers to a brother cried the prince with sparkling eyes we doubt not with the help of god to see you very soon restored to those thrones from which you have been so traitorously thrust  when that happy day comes said pedro then spain shall be to you as aquitaine and be your project what it may you may ever count on every troop and every ship over which flies the banner of castile  and added the other upon every aid which the wealth and power of majorca can bestow  touching the hundred thousand crowns in which i stand your debtor continued pedro carelessly it can no doubt  not a word sire not a word cried the prince it is not now when you are in grief that i would vex your mind with such base and sordid matters i have said once and forever that i am yours with every bowstring of my army and every florin in my coffers  ah here is indeed a mirror of chivalry said don pedro i think sir fernando since the princes bounty is stretched so far that we may make further use of his gracious goodness to the extent of fifty thousand crowns good sir william felton here will doubtless settle the matter with you  the stout old english counsellor looked somewhat blank at this prompt acceptance of his masters bounty  if it please you sire he said the public funds are at their lowest seeing that i have paid twelve thousand men of the companies and the new taxesthe hearthtax and the winetaxnot yet come in if you could wait until the promised help from england comes  nay nay my sweet cousin cried don pedro had we known that your own coffers were so low or that this sorry sum could have weighed one way or the other we had been loth indeed  enough sire enough said the prince flushing with vexation if the public funds be indeed so backward sir william there is still i trust my own private credit which hath never been drawn upon for my own uses but is now ready in the cause of a friend in adversity go raise this money upon our own jewels if nought else may serve and see that it be paid over to don fernando  in security i offer cried don pedro  tush tush said the prince i am not a lombard sire your kingly pledge is my security without bond or seal but i have tidings for you my lords and lieges that our brother of lancaster is on his way for our capital with four hundred lances and as many archers to aid us in our venture when he hath come and when our fair consort is recovered in her health which i trust by the grace of god may be ere many weeks be past we shall then join the army at dax and set our banners to the breeze once more  a buzz of joy at the prospect of immediate action rose up from the group of warriors the prince smiled at the martial ardor which shone upon every face around him  it will hearten you to know he continued that i have sure advices that this henry is a very valiant leader and that he has it in his power to make such a stand against us as promises to give us much honor and pleasure of his own people he hath brought together as i learn some fifty thousand with twelve thousand of the french free companies who are as you know very valiant and expert menatarms it is certain also that the brave and worthy bertrand de guesclin hath ridden into france to the duke of anjou and purposes to take back with him great levies from picardy and brittany we hold bertrand in high esteem for he has oft before been at great pains to furnish us with an honorable encounter what think you of it my worthy captal he took you at cocherel and by my soul i you will have the chance now to pay that score  the gascon warrior winced a little at the allusion nor were his countrymen around him better pleased for on the only occasion when they had encountered the arms of france without english aid they had met with a heavy defeat  there are some who say sire said the burly de clisson that the score is already overpaid for that without gascon help bertrand had not been taken at auray nor had king john been overborne at poictiers  by heaven but this is too much cried an english nobleman methinks that gascony is too small a cock to crow so lustily  the smaller cock my lord audley may have the longer spur remarked the captal de buch  may have its comb clipped if it make overmuch noise broke in an englishman  by our lady of rocamadour cried the lord of mucident this is more than i can abide sir john charnell you shall answer to me for those words  freely my lord and when you will returned the englishman carelessly  my lord de clisson cried lord audley you look some what fixedly in my direction by gods soul i should be right glad to go further into the matter with you  and you my lord of pommers said sir nigel pushing his way to the front it is in my mind that we might break a lance in gentle and honorable debate over the question  for a moment a dozen challenges flashed backwards and forwards at this sudden bursting of the cloud which had lowered so long between the knights of the two nations furious and gesticulating the gascons white and cold and sneering the english while the prince with a half smile glanced from one party to the other like a man who loved to dwell upon a fiery scene and yet dreaded least the mischief go so far that he might find it beyond his control  friends friends he cried at last this quarrel must go no further the man shall answer to me be he gascon or english who carries it beyond this room i have overmuch need for your swords that you should turn them upon each other sir john charnell lord audley you do not doubt the courage of our friends of gascony  not i sire lord audley answered i have seen them fight too often not to know that they are very hardy and valiant gentlemen  and so say i quoth the other englishman but certes there is no fear of our forgetting it while they have a tongue in their heads  nay sir john said the prince reprovingly all peoples have their own use and customs there are some who might call us cold and dull and silent but you hear my lords of gascony that these gentlemen had no thought to throw a slur upon your honor or your valor so let all anger fade from your mind clisson captal de pommers i have your word  we are your subjects sire said the gascon barons though with no very good grace your words are our law  then shall we bury all cause of unkindness in a flagon of malvoisie said the prince cheerily ho there the doors of the banquethall i have been over long from my sweet spouse but i shall be back with you anon let the sewers serve and the minstrels play while we drain a cup to the brave days that are before us in the south he turned away accompanied by the two monarchs while the rest of the company with many a compressed lip and menacing eye filed slowly through the sidedoor to the great chamber in which the royal tables were set forth    chapter xx how alleyne won his place in an honorable guild   whilst the princes council was sitting alleyne and ford had remained in the outer hall where they were soon surrounded by a noisy group of young englishmen of their own rank all eager to hear the latest news from england  how is it with the old man at windsor asked one  and how with the good queen philippa  and how with dame alice perrers cried a third  the devil take your tongue wat shouted a tall young man seizing the last speaker by the collar and giving him an admonitory shake the prince would take your head off for those words  by gods coif wat would miss it but little said another it is as empty as a beggars wallet  as empty as an english squire coz cried the first speaker what a devil has become of the maitredestables and his sewers they have not put forth the trestles yet  mon dieu if a man could eat himself into knighthood humphrey you had been a banneret at the least observed another amid a burst of laughter  and if you could drink yourself in old leatherhead you had been first baron of the realm cried the aggrieved humphrey but how of england my lads of loring  i take it said ford that it is much as it was when you were there last save that perchance there is a little less noise there  and why less noise young solomon  ah that is for your wit to discover  pardieu here is a paladin come over with the hampshire mud still sticking to his shoes he means that the noise is less for our being out of the country  they are very quick in these parts said ford turning to alleyne  how are we to take this sir asked the ruffling squire  you may take it as it comes said ford carelessly  here is pertness cried the other  sir i honor your truthfulness said ford  stint it humphrey said the tall squire with a burst of laughter you will have little credit from this gentleman i perceive tongues are sharp in hampshire sir  and swords  hum we may prove that in two days time is the vepres du tournoi when we may see if your lance is as quick as your wit  all very well roger harcomb cried a burly bullnecked young man whose square shoulders and massive limbs told of exceptional personal strength you pass too lightly over the matter we are not to be so easily overcrowed the lord loring hath given his proofs but we know nothing of his squires save that one of them hath a railing tongue and how of you young sir bringing his heavy hand down on alleynes shoulder  and what of me young sir  ma foi this is my ladys page come over your cheek will be browner and your hand harder ere you see your mother again  if my hand is not hard it is ready  ready ready for what for the hem of my ladys train  ready to chastise insolence sir cried alleyne with hashing eyes  sweet little coz answered the burly squire such a dainty color such a mellow voice eyes of a bashful maid and hair like a three years babe voila he passed his thick fingers roughly through the youths crisp golden curls  you seek to force a quarrel sir said the young man white with anger  and what then  why you do it like a country boor and not like a gentle squire hast been ill bred and as ill taught i serve a master who could show you how such things should be done  and how would he do it o pink of squires  he would neither be loud nor would he be unmannerly but rather more gentle than is his wont he would say sir i should take it as an honor to do some small deed of arms against you not for mine own glory or advancement but rather for the fame of my lady and for the upholding of chivalry then he would draw his glove thus and throw it on the ground or if he had cause to think that he had to deal with a churl he might throw it in his faceas i do now  a buzz of excitement went up from the knot of squires as alleyne his gentle nature turned by this causeless attack into fiery resolution dashed his glove with all his strength into the sneering face of his antagonist from all parts of the hall squires and pages came running until a dense swaying crowd surrounded the disputants  your life for this said the bully with a face which was distorted with rage  if you can take it returned alleyne  good lad whispered ford stick to it close as wax  i shall see justice cried norbury sir olivers silent attendant  you brought it upon yourself john tranter said the tall squire who had been addressed as roger harcomb you must ever plague the newcomers but it were shame if this went further the lad hath shown a proper spirit  but a blow a blow cried several of the older squires there must be a finish to this  nay tranter first laid hand upon his head said harcomb how say you tranter the matter may rest where it stands  my name is known in these parts said tranter proudly i can let pass what might leave a stain upon another let him pick up his glove and say that he has done amiss  i would see him in the claws of the devil first whispered ford  you hear young sir said the peacemaker our friend will overlook the matter if you do but say that you have acted in heat and haste  i cannot say that answered alleyne  it is our custom young sir when new squires come amongst us from england to test them in some such way bethink you that if a man have a destrier or a new lance he will ever try it in time of peace lest in days of need it may fail him how much more then is it proper to test those who are our comrades in arms  i would draw out if it may honorably be done murmured norbury in alleynes ear the man is a noted swordsman and far above your strength  edricson came however of that sturdy saxon blood which is very slowly heated but once up not easily to be cooled the hint of danger which norbury threw out was the one thing needed to harden his resolution  i came here at the back of my master he said and i looked on every man here as an englishman and a friend this gentleman hath shown me a rough welcome and if i have answered him in the same spirit he has but himself to thank i will pick the glove up but certes i shall abide what i have done unless he first crave my pardon for what he hath said and done  tranter shrugged his shoulders you have done what you could to save him harcomb said he we had best settle at once  so say i cried alleyne  the council will not break up until the banquet remarked a grayhaired squire you have a clear two hours  and the place  the tiltingyard is empty at this hour  nay it must not be within the grounds of the court or it may go hard with all concerned if it come to the ears of the prince  but there is a quiet spot near the river said one youth we have but to pass through the abbey grounds along the armory wall past the church of st remi and so down the rue des apotres  en avant then cried tranter shortly and the whole assembly flocked out into the open air save only those whom the special orders of their masters held to their posts these unfortunates crowded to the small casements and craned their necks after the throng as far as they could catch a glimpse of them  close to the banks of the garonne there lay a little tract of green sward with the high wall of a priors garden upon one side and an orchard with a thick bristle of leafless appletrees upon the other the river ran deep and swift up to the steep bank but there were few boats upon it and the ships were moored far out in the centre of the stream here the two combatants drew their swords and threw off their doublets for neither had any defensive armor the duello with its stately etiquette had not yet come into vogue but rough and sudden encounters were as common as they must ever be when hotheaded youth goes abroad with a weapon strapped to its waist in such combats as well as in the more formal sports of the tiltingyard tranter had won a name for strength and dexterity which had caused norbury to utter his wellmeant warning on the other hand alleyne had used his weapons in constant exercise and practice for every day for many months and being by nature quick of eye and prompt of hand he might pass now as no mean swordsman a strangely opposed pair they appeared as they approached each other tranter dark and stout and stiff with hairy chest and corded arms alleyne a model of comeliness and grace with his golden hair and his skin as fair as a womans an unequal fight it seemed to most but there were a few and they the most experienced who saw something in the youths steady gray eye and wary step which left the issue open to doubt  hold sirs hold cried norbury ere a blow had been struck this gentleman hath a twohanded sword a good foot longer than that of our friend  take mine alleyne said ford  nay friends he answered i understand the weight and balance of mine own to work sir for our lord may need us at the abbey  tranters great sword was indeed a mighty vantage in his favor he stood with his feet close together his knees bent outwards ready for a dash inwards or a spring out the weapon he held straight up in front of him with blade erect so that he might either bring it down with a swinging blow or by a turn of the heavy blade he might guard his own head and body a further protection lay in the broad and powerful guard which crossed the hilt and which was furnished with a deep and narrow notch in which an expert swordsman might catch his foemans blade and by a quick turn of his wrist might snap it across alleyne on the other hand must trust for his defence to his quick eye and active footfor his sword though keen as a whetstone could make it was of a light and graceful build with a narrow sloping pommel and a tapering steel  tranter well knew his advantage and lost no time in putting it to use as his opponent walked towards him he suddenly bounded forward and sent in a whistling cut which would have severed the other in twain had he not sprung lightly back from it so close was it that the point ripped a gash in the jutting edge of his linen cyclas quick as a panther alleyne sprang in with a thrust but tranter who was as active as he was strong had already recovered himself and turned it aside with a movement of his heavy blade again he whizzed in a blow which made the spectators hold their breath and again alleyne very quickly and swiftly slipped from under it and sent back two lightning thrusts which the other could scarce parry so close were they to each other that alleyne had no time to spring back from the next cut which beat down his sword and grazed his forehead sending the blood streaming into his eyes and down his cheeks he sprang out beyond sword sweep and the pair stood breathing heavily while the crowd of young squires buzzed their applause  bravely struck on both sides cried roger harcomb you have both won honor from this meeting and it would be sin and shame to let it go further  you have done enough edricson said norbury  you have carried yourself well cried several of the older squires  for my part i have no wish to slay this young man said tranter wiping his heated brow  does this gentleman crave my pardon for having used me despitefully asked alleyne  nay not i  then stand on your guard sir with a clatter and dash the two blades met once more alleyne pressing in so as to keep within the full sweep of the heavy blade while tranter as continually sprang back to have space for one of his fatal cuts a threepartsparried blow drew blood from alleynes left shoulder but at the same moment he wounded tranter slightly upon the thigh next instant however his blade had slipped into the fatal notch there was a sharp cracking sound with a tinkling upon the ground and he found a splintered piece of steel fifteen inches long was all that remained to him of his weapon  your life is in my hands cried tranter with a bitter smile  nay nay he makes submission broke in several squires  another sword cried ford  nay sir said harcomb that is not the custom  throw down your hilt edricson cried norbury  never said alleyne do you crave my pardon sir  you are mad to ask it  then on guard again cried the young squire and sprang in with a fire and a fury which more than made up for the shortness of his weapon it had not escaped him that his opponent was breathing in short hoarse gasps like a man who is dizzy with fatigue now was the time for the purer living and the more agile limb to show their value back and back gave tranter ever seeking time for a last cut on and on came alleyne his jagged point now at his foemans face now at his throat now at his chest still stabbing and thrusting to pass the line of steel which covered him yet his experienced foeman knew well that such efforts could not be long sustained let him relax for one instant and his deathblow had come relax he must flesh and blood could not stand the strain already the thrusts were less fierce the foot less ready although there was no abatement of the spirit in the steady gray eyes tranter cunning and wary from years of fighting knew that his chance had come he brushed aside the frail weapon which was opposed to him whirled up his great blade sprang back to get the fairer sweepand vanished into the waters of the garonne  so intent had the squires both combatants and spectators been on the matter in hand that all thought of the steep bank and swift still stream had gone from their minds it was not until tranter giving back before the others fiery rush was upon the very brink that a general cry warned him of his danger that last spring which he hoped would have brought the fight to a bloody end carried him clear of the edge and he found himself in an instant eight feet deep in the icecold stream once and twice his gasping face and clutching fingers broke up through the still green water sweeping outwards in the swirl of the current in vain were swordsheaths applebranches and belts linked together thrown out to him by his companions alleyne had dropped his shattered sword and was standing trembling in every limb with his rage all changed in an instant to pity for the third time the drowning man came to the surface his hands full of green slimy waterplants his eyes turned in despair to the shore their glance fell upon alleyne and he could not withstand the mute appeal which he read in them in an instant he too was in the garonne striking out with powerful strokes for his late foeman  yet the current was swift and strong and good swimmer as he was it was no easy task which alleyne had set himself to clutch at tranter and to seize him by the hair was the work of a few seconds but to hold his head above water and to make their way out of the current was another matter for a hundred strokes he did not seem to gain an inch then at last amid a shout of joy and praise from the bank they slowly drew clear into more stagnant water at the instant that a rope made of a dozen swordbelts linked together by the buckles was thrown by ford into their very hands three pulls from eager arms and the two combatants dripping and pale were dragged up the bank and lay panting upon the grass  john tranter was the first to come to himself for although he had been longer in the water he had done nothing during that fierce battle with the current he staggered to his feet and looked down upon his rescuer who had raised himself upon his elbow and was smiling faintly at the buzz of congratulation and of praise which broke from the squires around him  i am much beholden to you sir said tranter though in no very friendly voice certes i should have been in the river now but for you for i was born in warwickshire which is but a dry county and there are few who swim in those parts  i ask no thanks alleyne answered shortly give me your hand to rise ford  the river has been my enemy said tranter but it hath been a good friend to you for it has saved your life this day  that is as it may be returned alleyne  but all is now well over quoth harcomb and no scath come of it which is more than i had at one time hoped for our young friend here hath very fairly and honestly earned his right to be craftsman of the honorable guild of the squires of bordeaux here is your doublet tranter  alas for my poor sword which lies at the bottom of the garonne said the squire  here is your pourpoint edricson cried norbury throw it over your shoulders that you may have at least one dry garment  and now away back to the abbey said several  one moment sirs cried alleyne who was leaning on fords shoulder with the broken sword which he had picked up still clutched in his right hand my ears may be somewhat dulled by the water and perchance what has been said has escaped me but i have not yet heard this gentleman crave pardon for the insults which he put upon me in the hall  what do you still pursue the quarrel asked tranter  and why not sir i am slow to take up such things but once afoot i shall follow it while i have life or breath  ma foi you have not too much of either for you are as white as marble said harcomb bluntly take my rede sir and let it drop for you have come very well out from it  nay said alleyne this quarrel is none of my making but now that i am here i swear to you that i shall never leave this spot until i have that which i have come for so ask my pardon sir or choose another glaive and to it again  the young squire was deadly white from his exertions both on the land and in the water soaking and stained with a smear of blood on his white shoulder and another on his brow there was still in his whole pose and set of face the trace of an inflexible resolution his opponents duller and more material mind quailed before the fire and intensity of a higher spiritual nature  i had not thought that you had taken it so amiss said he awkwardly it was but such a jest as we play upon each other and if you must have it so i am sorry for it  then i am sorry too quoth alleyne warmly and here is my hand upon it  and the nonemeat horn has blown three times quoth harcomb as they all streamed in chattering groups from the ground i know not what the princes maitredecuisine will say or think by my troth master ford your friend here is in need of a cup of wine for he hath drunk deeply of garonne water i had not thought from his fair face that he had stood to this matter so shrewdly  faith said ford this air of bordeaux hath turned our turtledove into a gamecock a milder or more courteous youth never came out of hampshire  his master also as i understand is a very mild and courteous gentleman remarked harcomb yet i do not think that they are either of them men with whom it is very safe to trifle    chapter xxi how agostino pisano risked his head   even the squires table at the abbey of st andrews at bordeaux was on a very sumptuous scale while the prince held his court there here first after the meagre fare of beaulieu and the stinted board of the lady loring alleyne learned the lengths to which luxury and refinement might be pushed roasted peacocks with the feathers all carefully replaced so that the bird lay upon the dish even as it had strutted in life boars heads with the tusks gilded and the mouth lined with silver foil jellies in the shape of the twelve apostles and a great pasty which formed an exact model of the kings new castle at windsorthese were a few of the strange dishes which faced him an archer had brought him a change of clothes from the cog and he had already with the elasticity of youth shaken off the troubles and fatigues of the morning a page from the inner banquetinghall had come with word that their master intended to drink wine at the lodgings of the lord chandos that night and that he desired his squires to sleep at the hotel of the half moon on the rue des apotres thither then they both set out in the twilight after the long course of juggling tricks and gleesinging with which the principal meal was concluded  a thin rain was falling as the two youths with their cloaks over their heads made their way on foot through the streets of the old town leaving their horses in the royal stables an occasional oil lamp at the corner of a street or in the portico of some wealthy burgher threw a faint glimmer over the shining cobblestones and the varied motley crowd who in spite of the weather ebbed and flowed along every highway in those scattered circles of dim radiance might be seen the whole busy panorama of life in a wealthy and martial city here passed the roundfaced burgher swollen with prosperity his sweeping darkclothed gaberdine flat velvet cap broad leather belt and dangling pouch all speaking of comfort and of wealth behind him his serving wench her blue whimple over her head and one hand thrust forth to bear the lanthorn which threw a golden bar of light along her masters path behind them a group of swaggering halfdrunken yorkshire dalesmen speaking a dialect which their own southland countrymen could scarce comprehend their jerkins marked with the pelican which showed that they had come over in the train of the northcountry stapletons the burgher glanced back at their fierce faces and quickened his step while the girl pulled her whimple closer round her for there was a meaning in their wild eyes as they stared at the purse and the maiden which men of all tongues could understand then came archers of the guard shrillvoiced women of the camp english pages with their fair skins and blue wondering eyes darkrobed friars lounging menatarms swarthy loudtongued gascon servingmen seamen from the river rude peasants of the medoc and becloaked and befeathered squires of the court all jostling and pushing in an everchanging manycolored stream while english french welsh basque and the varied dialects of gascony and guienne filled the air with their babel from time to time the throng would be burst asunder and a ladys horselitter would trot past tow  torchbearing archers walking in front of gascon baron or english knight as he sought his lodgings after the palace revels clatter of hoofs clinking of weapons shouts from the drunken brawlers and high laughter of women they all rose up like the mist from a marsh out of the crowded streets of the dimlit city  one couple out of the moving throng especially engaged the attention of the two young squires the more so as they were going in their own direction and immediately in front of them they consisted of a man and a girl the former very tall with rounded shoulders a limp of one foot and a large flat object covered with dark cloth under his arm his companion was young and straight with a quick elastic step and graceful bearing though so swathed in a black mantle that little could be seen of her face save a flash of dark eyes and a curve of raven hair the tall man leaned heavily upon her to take the weight off his tender foot while he held his burden betwixt himself and the wall cuddling it jealously to his side and thrusting forward his young companion to act as a buttress whenever the pressure of the crowd threatened to bear him away the evident anxiety of the man the appearance of his attendant and the joint care with which they defended their concealed possession excited the interest of the two young englishmen who walked within handtouch of them  courage child they heard the tall man exclaim in strange hybrid french if we can win another sixty paces we are safe  hold it safe father the other answered in the same soft mincing dialect we have no cause for fear  verily they are heathens and barbarians cried the man mad howling drunken barbarians forty more paces tita mia and i swear to the holy eloi patron of all learned craftsmen that i will never set foot over my door again until the whole swarm are safely hived in their camp of dax or wherever else they curse with their presence twenty more paces my treasure ah my god how they push and brawl get in their way tita mia put your little elbow bravely out set your shoulders squarely against them girl why should you give way to these mad islanders ah cospetto we are ruined and destroyed  the crowd had thickened in front so that the lame man and the girl had come to a stand several halfdrunken english archers attracted as the squires had been by their singular appearance were facing towards them and peering at them through the dim light  by the three kings cried one here is an old dotard shrew to have so goodly a crutch use the leg that god hath given you man and do not bear so heavily upon the wench  twenty devils fly away with him shouted another what how man are brave archers to go maidless while an old man uses one as a walkingstaff  come with me my honeybird cried a third plucking at the girls mantle  nay with me my hearts desire said the first by st george our life is short and we should be merry while we may may i never see chester bridge again if she is not a right winsome lass  what hath the old toad under his arm cried one of the others he hugs it to him as the devil hugged the pardoner  let us see old bag of bones let us see what it is that you have under your arm they crowded in upon him while he ignorant of their language could but clutch the girl with one hand and the parcel with the other looking wildly about in search of help  nay lads nay cried ford pushing back the nearest archer this is but scurvy conduct keep your hands off or it will be the worse for you  keep your tongue still or it will be the worse for you shouted the most drunken of the archers who are you to spoil sport  a raw squire new landed said another by st thomas of kent we are at the beck of our master but we are not to be ordered by every babe whose mother hath sent him as far as aquitaine  oh gentlemen cried the girl in broken french for dear christs sake stand by us and do not let these terrible men do us an injury  have no fears lady alleyne answered we shall see that all is well with you take your hand from the girls wrist you northcountry rogue  hold to her wat said a great blackbearded manatarms whose steel breastplate glimmered in the dusk keep your hands from your bodkins you two for that was my trade before you were born and by gods soul i will drive a handful of steel through you if you move a finger  thank god said alleyne suddenly as he spied in the lamplight a shock of blazing red hair which fringed a steel cap high above the heads of the crowd here is john and aylward too help us comrades for there is wrong being done to this maid and to the old man  hola mon petit said the old bowman pushing his way through the crowd with the huge forester at his heels what is all this then by the twang of string i think that you will have some work upon your hands if you are to right all the wrongs that you may see upon this side of the water it is not to be thought that a troop of bowmen with the wine buzzing in their ears will be as softspoken as so many young clerks in an orchard when you have been a year with the company you will think less of such matters but what is amiss here the provostmarshal with his archers is coming this way and some of you may find yourselves in the stretchneck if you take not heed  why it is old sam aylward of the white company shouted the manatarms why samkin what hath come upon thee i can call to mind the day when you were as roaring a blade as ever called himself a free companion by my soul from limoges to navarre who was there who would kiss a wench or cut a throat as readily as bowman aylward of hawkwoods company  like enough peter said aylward and by my hilt i may not have changed so much but it was ever a fair loose and a clear mark with me the wench must be willing or the man must be standing up against me else by these ten finger bones i either were safe enough for me  a glance at aylwards resolute face and at the huge shoulders of hordle john had convinced the archers that there was little to be got by violence the girl and the old man began to shuffle on in the crowd without their tormentors venturing to stop them ford and alleyne followed slowly behind them but aylward caught the latter by the shoulder  by my hilt camarade said he i hear that you have done great things at the abbey today but i pray you to have a care for it was i who brought you into the company and it would be a black day for me if aught were to befall you  nay aylward i will have a care  thrust not forward into danger too much mon petit in a little time your wrist will be stronger and your cut more shrewd there will be some of us at the rose de guienne tonight which is two doors from the hotel of the half moon so if you would drain a cup with a few simple archers you will be right welcome  alleyne promised to be there if his duties would allow and then slipping through the crowd he rejoined ford who was standing in talk with the two strangers who had now reached their own doorstep  brave young signor cried the tall man throwing his arms round alleyne how can we thank you enough for taking our parts against those horrible drunken barbarians what should we have done without you my tita would have been dragged away and my head would have been shivered into a thousand fragments  nay i scarce think that they would have mishandled you so said alleyne in surprise  ho ho cried he with a high crowing laugh it is not the head upon my shoulders that i think of cospetto no it is the head under my arm which you have preserved  perhaps the signori would deign to come under our roof father said the maiden if we bide here who knows that some fresh tumult may not break out  well said tita well said my girl i pray you sirs to honor my unworthy roof so far a light giacomo there are five steps up now two more so here we are at last in safety corpo di bacco i would not have given ten maravedi for my head when those children of the devil were pushing us against the wall tita mia you have been a brave girl and it was better that you should be pulled and pushed than that my head should be broken  yes indeed father said she earnestly  but those english ach take a goth a hun and a vandal mix them together and add a barbary rover then take this creature and make him drunkand you have an englishman my god i were ever such people upon earth what place is free from them i hear that they swarm in italy even as they swarm here everywhere you will find them except in heaven  dear father cried tita still supporting the angry old man as he limped up the curved oaken stair you must not forget that these good signori who have preserved us are also english  ah yes my pardon sirs come into my rooms here there are some who might find some pleasure in these paintings but i learn the art of war is the only art which is held in honor in your island  the lowroofed oakpanelled room into which he conducted them was brilliantly lit by four scented oil lamps against the walls upon the table on the floor and in every part of the chamber were great sheets of glass painted in the most brilliant colors ford and edricson gazed around them in amazement for never had they seen such magnificent works of art  you like them then the lame artist cried in answer to the look of pleasure and of surprise in their faces there are then some of you who have a taste for such trifling  i could not have believed it exclaimed alleyne what color what outlines see to this martyrdom of the holy stephen ford could you not yourself pick up one of these stones which lie to the hand of the wicked murtherers  and see this stag alleyne with the cross betwixt its horns by my faith i have never seen a better one at the forest of bere  and the green of this grasshow bright and clear why all the painting that i have seen is but childs play beside this this worthy gentleman must be one of those great painters of whom i have oft heard brother bartholomew speak in the old days at beaulieu  the dark mobile face of the artist shone with pleasure at the unaffected delight of the two young englishmen his daughter had thrown off her mantle and disclosed a face of the finest and most delicate italian beauty which soon drew fords eyes from the pictures in front of him alleyne however continued with little cries of admiration and of wonderment to turn from the walls to the table and yet again to the walls  what think you of this young sir asked the painter tearing off the cloth which concealed the flat object which he had borne beneath his arm it was a leafshaped sheet of glass bearing upon it a face with a halo round it so delicately outlined and of so perfect a tint that it might have been indeed a human face which gazed with sad and thoughtful eyes upon the young squire he clapped his hands with that thrill of joy which true art will ever give to a true artist  it is great he cried it is wonderful but i marvel sir that you should have risked a work of such beauty and value by bearing it at night through so unruly a crowd  i have indeed been rash said the artist some wine tita from the florence flask had it not been for you i tremble to think of what might have come of it see to the skin tint it is not to be replaced for paint as you will it is not once in a hundred times that it is not either burned too brown in the furnace or else the color will not hold and you get but a sickly white there you can see the very veins and the throb of thee blood yes diavolo if it had broken my heart would have broken too it is for the choir window in the church of st remi and we had gone my little helper and i to see if it was indeed of the size for the stonework night had fallen ere we finished and what could we do save carry it home as best we might but you young sir you speak as if you too knew something of the art  so little that i scarce dare speak of it in your presence alleyne answered i have been cloisterbred and it was no very great matter to handle the brush better than my brother novices  there are pigments brush and paper said the old artist i do not give you glass for that is another matter and takes much skill in the mixing of colors now i pray you to show me a touch of your art i thank you tita the venetian glasses cara mia and fill them to the brim a seat signor  while ford in his englishfrench was conversing with tita in her italian french the old man was carefully examining his precious head to see that no scratch had been left upon its surface when he glanced up again alleyne had with a few bold strokes of the brush tinted in a womans face and neck upon the white sheet in front of him  diavolo exclaimed the old artist standing with his head on one side you have power yes cospetto you have power it is the face of an angel  it is the face of the lady maude loring cried ford even more astonished  why on my faith it is not unlike her said alleyne in some confusion  ah a portrait so much the better young man i am agostino pisano the son of andrea pisano and i say again that you have power further i say that if you will stay with me i will teach you all the secrets of the glassstainers mystery the pigments and their thickening which will fuse into the glass and which will not the furnace and the glazingevery trick and method you shall know  i would be right glad to study under such a master said alleyne but i am sworn to follow my lord whilst this war lasts  war war cried the old italian ever this talk of war and the men that you hold to be greatwhat are they have i not heard their names soldiers butchers destroyers ah per bacco we have men in italy who are in very truth great you pull down you despoil but they build up they restore ah if you could but see my own dear pisa the duomo the cloisters of campo santo the high campanile with the mellow throb of her bells upon the warm italian air those are the works of great men and i have seen them with my own eyes these very eyes which look upon you i have seen andrea orcagna taddeo gaddi giottino stefano simone memmimen whose very colors i am not worthy to mix and i have seen the aged giotto and he in turn was pupil to cimabue before whom there was no art in italy for the greeks were brought to paint the chapel of the gondi at florence ah signori there are the real great men whose names will be held in honor when your soldiers are shown to have been the enemies of humankind  faith sir said ford there is something to say for the soldiers also for unless they be defended how are all these gentlemen whom you have mentioned to preserve the pictures which they have painted  and all these said alleyne have you indeed done them alland where are they to go  yes signor they are all from my hand some are as you see upon one sheet and some are in many pieces which may fasten together there are some who do but paint upon the glass and then by placing another sheet of glass upon the top and fastening it they keep the air from their painting yet i hold that the true art of my craft lies as much in the furnace as in the brush see this rose window which is from the model of the church of the holy trinity at vendome and this other of the finding of the grail which is for the apse of the abbey church time was when none but my countrymen could do these things but there is clement of chartres and others in france who are very worthy workmen but ah there is that ever shrieking brazen tongue which will not let us forget for one short hour that it is the arm of the savage and not the hand of the master which rules over the world  a stern clear bugle call had sounded close at hand to summon some following together for the night  it is a sign to us as well said ford i would fain stay here forever amid all these beautiful things staring hard at the blushing tita as he spokebut we must be back at our lords hostel ere he reach it amid renewed thanks and with promises to come again the two squires bade their leave of the old italian glassstainer and his daughter the streets were clearer now and the rain had stopped so they made their way quickly from the rue du roi in which their new friends dwelt to the rue des apotres where the hostel of the half moon was situated    chapter xxii how the bowmen held wassail at the rose de guienne   mon dieu alleyne saw you ever so lovely a face cried ford as they hurried along together so pure so peaceful and so beautiful  in sooth yes and the hue of the skin the most perfect that ever i saw marked you also how the hair curled round the brow it was wonder fine  those eyes too cried ford how clear and how tendersimple and yet so full of thought  if there was a weakness it was in the chin said alleyne  nay i saw none  it was well curved it is true  most daintily so  and yet  what then alleyne wouldst find flaw in the sun  well bethink you ford would not more power and expression have been put into the face by a long and noble beard  holy virgin cried ford the man is mad a beard on the face of little tita  tita who spoke of tita  who spoke of aught else  it was the picture of st remi man of which i have been discoursing  you are indeed cried ford laughing a goth hun and vandal with all the other hard names which the old man called us how could you think so much of a smear of pigments when there was such a picture painted by the good god himself in the very room with you but who is this  if it please you sirs said an archer running across to them aylward and others would be right glad to see you they are within here he bade me say to you that the lord loring will not need your service tonight as he sleeps with the lord chandos  by my faith said ford we do not need a guide to lead us to their presence as he spoke there came a roar of singing from the tavern upon the right with shouts of laughter and stamping of feet passing under a low door and down a stoneflagged passage they found themselves in a long narrow hall lit up by a pair of blazing torches one at either end trusses of straw had been thrown down along the walls and reclining on them were some twenty or thirty archers all of the company their steel caps and jacks thrown off their tunics open and their great limbs sprawling upon the clay floor at every mans elbow stood his leathern blackjack of beer while at the further end a hogshead with its end knocked in promised an abundant supply for the future behind the hogshead on a half circle of kegs boxes and rude settles sat aylward john black simon and three or four other leading men of the archers together with goodwin hawtayne the mastershipman who had left his yellow cog in the river to have a last rouse with his friends of the company ford and alleyne took their seats between aylward and black simon without their entrance checking in any degree the hubbub which was going on  ale mes camarades cried the bowman or shall it be wine nay but ye must have the one or the other here jacques thou limb of the devil bring a bottrine of the oldest vernage and see that you do not shake it hast heard the news  nay cried both the squires  that we are to have a brave tourney  a tourney  aye lads for the captal du buch hath sworn that he will find five knights from this side of the water who will ride over any five englishmen who ever threw leg over saddle and chandos hath taken up the challenge and the prince hath promised a golden vase for the man who carries himself best and all the court is in a buzz over it  why should the knights have all the sport growled hordle john could they not set up five archers for the honor of aquitaine and of gascony  or five menatarms said black simon  but who are the english knights asked hawtayne  there are three hundred and fortyone in the town said aylward and i hear that three hundred and forty cartels and defiances have already been sent in the only one missing being sir john ravensholme who is in his bed with the sweating sickness and cannot set foot to ground  i have heard of it from one of the archers of the guard cried a bowman from among the straw i hear that the prince wished to break a lance but that chandos would not hear of it for the game is likely to be a rough one  then there is chandos  nay the prince would not permit it he is to be marshal of the lists with sir william felton and the duc darmagnac the english will be the lord audley sir thomas percy sir thomas wake sir william beauchamp and our own very good lord and leader  hurrah for him and god be with him cried several it is honor to draw string in his service  so you may well say said aylward by my ten fingerbones if you march behind the pennon of the five roses you are like to see all that a good bowman would wish to see ha yes mes garcons you laugh but by my hilt you may not laugh when you find yourselves where he will take you for you can never tell what strange vow he may not have sworn to i see that he has a patch over his eye even as he had at poictiers there will come bloodshed of that patch or i am the more mistaken  how chanced it at poictiers good master aylward asked one of the young archers leaning upon his elbows with his eyes fixed respectfully upon the old bowmans rugged face  aye aylward tell us of it cried hordle john  here is to old samkin aylward shouted several at the further end of the room waving their blackjacks in the air  ask him said aylward modestly nodding towards black simon he saw more than i did and yet by the holy nails there was not very much that i did not see either  ah yes said simon shaking his head it was a great day i never hope to see such another there were some fine archers who drew their last shaft that day we shall never see better men aylward  by my hilt no there was little robby withstaff and andrew salblaster and wat alspaye who broke the neck of the german mon dieu what men they were take them how you would at long butts or short hoyles rounds or rovers better bowmen never twirled a shaft over their thumbnails  but the fight aylward the fight cried several impatiently  let me fill my jack first boys for it is a thirsty tale it was at the first fall of the leaf that the prince set forth and he passed through auvergne and berry and anjou and touraine in auvergne the maids are kind but the wines are sour in berry it is the women that are sour but the wines are rich anjou however is a very good land for bowmen for wine and women are all that heart could wish in touraine i got nothing save a broken pate but at vierzon i had a great good fortune for i had a golden pyx from the minster for which i afterwards got nine genoan janes from the goldsmith in the rue mont olive from thence we went to bourges were i had a tunic of flamecolored silk and a very fine pair of shoes with tassels of silk and drops of silver  from a stall aylward asked one of the young archers  nay from a mans feet lad i had reason to think that he might not need them again seeing that a thirtyinch shaft had feathered in his back  and what then aylward  on we went coz some six thousand of us until we came to issodun and there again a very great thing befell  a battle aylward  nay nay a greater thing than that there is little to be gained out of a battle unless one have the fortune to win a ransom at issodun i and three welshmen came upon a house which all others had passed and we had the profit of it to ourselves for myself i had a fine featherbeda thing which you will not see in a long days journey in england you have seen it alleyne and you john you will bear me out that it is a noble bed we put it on a sutlers mule and bore it after the army it was on my mind that i would lay it by until i came to start house of mine own and i have it now in a very safe place near lyndhurst  and what then masterbowman asked hawtayne by st christopher it is indeed a fair and goodly life which you have chosen for you gather up the spoil as a warsash man gathers lobsters without grace or favor from any man  you are right mastershipman said another of the older archers it is an old bowyers rede that the second feather of a fenny goose is better than the pinion of a tame one draw on old lad for i have come between you and the clout  on we went then said aylward after a long pull at his blackjack there were some six thousand of us with the prince and his knights and the featherbed upon a sutlers mule in the centre we made great havoc in touraine until we came into romorantin where i chanced upon a gold chain and two bracelets of jasper which were stolen from me the same day by a blackeyed wench from the ardennes mon dieu there are some folk who have no fear of domesday in them and no sign of grace in their souls for ever clutching and clawing at another mans chattels  but the battle aylward the battle cried several amid a burst of laughter  i come to it my young warpups well then the king of france had followed us with fifty thousand men and he made great haste to catch us but when he had us he scarce knew what to do with us for we were so drawn up among hedges and vineyards that they could not come nigh us save by one lane on both sides were archers menatarms and knights behind and in the centre the baggage with my featherbed upon a sutlers mule three hundred chosen knights came straight for it and indeed they were very brave men but such a drift of arrows met them that few came back then came the germans and they also fought very bravely so that one or two broke through the archers and came as far as the featherbed but all to no purpose then out rides our own little hothead with the patch over his eye and my lord audley with his four cheshire squires and a few others of like kidney and after them went the prince and chandos and then the whole throng of us with axe and sword for we had shot away our arrows ma foi it was a foolish thing for we came forth from the hedges and there was naught to guard the baggage had they ridden round behind us but all went well with us and the king was taken and little robby withstaff and i fell in with a wain with twelve firkins of wine for the kings own table and by my hilt if you ask me what happened after that i cannot answer you nor can little robby withstaff either  and next day  by my faith we did not tarry long but we hied back to bordeaux where we came in safety with the king of france and also the featherbed i sold my spoil mes garcons for as many goldpieces as i could hold in my hufken and for seven days i lit twelve wax candles upon the altar of st andrew for if you forget the blessed when things are well with you they are very likely to forget you when you have need of them i have a score of one hundred and nineteen pounds of wax against the holy andrew and as he was a very just man i doubt not that i shall have full weigh and measure when i have most need of it  tell me master aylward cried a young freshfaced archer at the further end of the room what was this great battle about  why you jackfool what would it be about save who should wear the crown of france  i thought that mayhap it might be as to who should have this featherbed of thine  if i come down to you silas i may lay my belt across your shoulders aylward answered amid a general shout of laughter but it is time young chickens went to roost when they dare cackle against their elders it is late simon  nay let us have another song  here is arnold of sowley will troll as good a stave as any man in the company  nay we have one here who is second to none said hawtayne laying his hand upon big johns shoulder i have heard him on the cog with a voice like the wave upon the shore i pray you friend to give us the bells of milton or if you will the franklins maid  hordle john drew the back of his hand across his mouth fixed his eyes upon the corner of the ceiling and bellowed forth in a voice which made the torches flicker the southland ballad for which he had been asked          the franklin he hath gone to roam         the franklins maid she bides at home         but she is cold and coy and staid         and who may win the franklins maid          there came a knight of high renown         in bassinet and ciclatoun         on bended knee full long he prayed         he might not win the franklins maid          there came a squire so debonair         his dress was rich his words were fair         he sweetly sang he deftly played         he could not win the franklins maid          there came a mercer wonderfine         with velvet cap and gaberdine         for all his ships for all his trade         he could not buy the franklins maid          there came an archer bold and true         with bracer guard and stave of yew         his purse was light his jerkin frayed         haro alas the franklins maid          oh some have laughed and some have cried         and some have scoured the countryside         but off they ride through wood and glade         the bowman and the franklins maid  a roar of delight from his audience with stamping of feet and beating of blackjacks against the ground showed how thoroughly the song was to their taste while john modestly retired into a quart pot which he drained in four giant gulps i sang that ditty in hordle alehouse ere i ever thought to be an archer myself quoth he  fill up your stoups cried black simon thrusting his own goblet into the open hogshead in front of him here is a last cup to the white company and every brave boy who walks behind the roses of loring  to the wood the flax and the ganders wing said an old grayheaded archer on the right  to a gentle loose and the king of spain for a mark at fourteen score cried another  to a bloody war shouted a fourth many to go and few to come  with the most gold to the best steel added a fifth  and a last cup to the maids of our heart cried aylward a steady hand and a true eye boys so let two quarts be a bowmans portion with shout and jest and snatch of song they streamed from the room and all was peaceful once more in the rose de guienne    chapter xxiii how england held the lists at bordeaux so used were the good burghers of bordeaux to martial display and knightly sport that an ordinary joust or tournament was an everyday matter with them the fame and brilliancy of the princes court had drawn the knightserrant and pursuivantsofarms from every part of europe in the long lists by the garonne on the landward side of the northern gate there had been many a strange combat when the teutonic knight fresh from the conquest of the prussian heathen ran a course against the knight of calatrava hardened by continual struggle against the moors or cavaliers from portugal broke a lance with scandinavian warriors from the further shore of the great northern ocean here fluttered many an outland pennon bearing symbol and blazonry from the banks of the danube the wilds of lithuania and the mountain strongholds of hungary for chivalry was of no clime and of no race nor was any land so wild that the fame and name of the prince had not sounded through it from border to border  great however was the excitement through town and district when it was learned that on the third wednesday in advent there would be held a passageatarms in which five knights of england would hold the lists against all comers the great concourse of noblemen and famous soldiers the national character of the contest and the fact that this was a last trial of arms before what promised to be an arduous and bloody war all united to make the event one of the most notable and brilliant that bordeaux had ever seen on the eve of the contest the peasants flocked in from the whole district of the medoc and the fields beyond the walls were whitened with the tents of those who could find no warmer lodging from the distant camp of dax too and from blaye bourge libourne st emilion castillon st macaire cardillac ryons and all the cluster of flourishing towns which look upon bordeaux as their mother there thronged an unceasing stream of horsemen and of footmen all converging upon the great city by the morning of the day on which the courses were to be run not less than eighty people had assembled round the lists and along the low grassy ridge which looks down upon the scene of the encounter  it was as may well be imagined no easy matter among so many noted cavaliers to choose out five on either side who should have precedence over their fellows a score of secondary combats had nearly arisen from the rivalries and bad blood created by the selection and it was only the influence of the prince and the efforts of the older barons which kept the peace among so many eager and fiery soldiers not till the day before the courses were the shields finally hung out for the inspection of the ladies and the heralds so that all men might know the names of the champions and have the opportunity to prefer any charge against them should there be stain upon them which should disqualify them from taking part in so noble and honorable a ceremony  sir hugh calverley and sir robert knolles had not yet returned from their raid into the marches of the navarre so that the english party were deprived of two of their most famous lances yet there remained so many good names that chandos and felton to whom the selection had been referred had many an earnest consultation in which every feat of arms and failure or success of each candidate was weighed and balanced against the rival claims of his companions lord audley of cheshire the hero of poictiers and loring of hampshire who was held to be the second lance in the army were easily fixed upon then of the younger men sir thomas percy of northumberland sir thomas wake of yorkshire and sir william beauchamp of gloucestershire were finally selected to uphold the honor of england on the other side were the veteran captal de buch and the brawny olivier de clisson with the free companion sir perducas dalbret the valiant lord of mucident and sigismond von altenstadt of the teutonic order the older soldiers among the english shook their heads as they looked upon the escutcheons of these famous warriors for they were all men who had spent their lives upon the saddle and bravery and strength can avail little against experience and wisdom of war  by my faith sir john said the prince as he rode through the winding streets on his way to the list i should have been glad to have splintered a lance today you have seen me hold a spear since i had strength to lift one and should know best whether i do not merit a place among this honorable company  there is no better seat and no truer lance sire said chandos but if i may say so without fear of offence it were not fitting that you should join in this debate  and why sir john  because sire it is not for you to take part with gascons against english or with english against gascons seeing that you are lord of both we are not too well loved by the gascons now and it is but the golden link of your princely coronet which holds us together if that be snapped i know not what would follow  snapped sir john cried the prince with an angry sparkle in his dark eyes what manner of talk is this you speak as though the allegiance of our people were a thing which might be thrown off or on like a falcons jessel  with a sorry hack one uses whip and spur sire said chandos but with a horse of blood and spirit a good cavalier is gentle and soothing coaxing rather than forcing these folk are strange people and you must hold their love even as you have it now for you will get from their kindness what all the pennons in your army could not wring from them  you are overgrave today john the prince answered we may keep such questions for our councilchamber but how now my brothers of spain and of majorca what think you of this challenge  i look to see some handsome joisting said don pedro who rode with the king of majorca upon the right of the prince while chandos was on the left by st james of compostella but these burghers would bear some taxing see to the broadcloth and velvet that the rogues bear upon their backs by my troth if they were my subjects they would be glad enough to wear falding and leather ere i had done with them but mayhap it is best to let the wool grow long ere you clip it  it is our pride the prince answered coldly that we rule over freemen and not slaves  every man to his own humor said pedro carelessly carajo there is a sweet face at yonder window don fernando i pray you to mark the house and to have the maid brought to us at the abbey  nay brother nay cried the prince impatiently i have had occasion to tell you more than once that things are not ordered in this way in aquitaine  a thousand pardons dear friend the spaniard answered quickly for a flush of anger had sprung to the dark cheek of the english prince you make my exile so like a home that i forget at times that i am not in very truth back in castile every land hath indeed its ways and manners but i promise you edward that when you are my guest in toledo or madrid you shall not yearn in vain for any commoners daughter on whom you may deign to cast your eye  your talk sire said the prince still more coldly is not such as i love to hear from your lips i have no taste for such amours as you speak of and i have sworn that my name shall be coupled with that of no woman save my ever dear wife  ever the mirror of true chivalry exclaimed pedro while james of majorca frightened at the stern countenance of their allpowerful protector plucked hard at the mantle of his brother exile  have a care cousin he whispered for the sake of the virgin have a care for you have angered him  pshaw fear not the other answered in the same low tone if i miss one stoop i will strike him on the next mark me else fair cousin he continued turning to the prince these be rare menatarms and lusty bowmen it would be hard indeed to match them  they have journeyed far sire but they have never yet found their match  nor ever will i doubt not i feel myself to be back upon my throne when i look at them but tell me dear coz what shall we do next when we have driven this bastard henry from the kingdom which he hath filched  we shall then compel the king of aragon to place our good friend and brother james of majorca upon the throne  noble and generous prince cried the little monarch  that done said king pedro glancing out of the corners of his eyes at the young conqueror we shall unite the forces of england of aquitaine of spain and of majorca it would be shame to us if we did not do some great deed with such forces ready to our hand  you say truly brother cried the prince his eyes kindling at the thought methinks that we could not do anything more pleasing to our lady than to drive the heathen moors out of the country  i am with you edward as true as hilt to blade but by st james we shall not let these moors make mock at us from over the sea we must take ship and thrust them from africa  by heaven yes cried the prince and it is the dream of my heart that our english pennons shall wave upon the mount of olives and the lions and lilies float over the holy city  and why not dear coz your bowmen have cleared a path to paris and why not to jerusalem once there your arms might rest  nay there is more to be done cried the prince carried away by the ambitious dream there is still the city of constantine to be taken and war to be waged against the soldan of damascus and beyond him again there is tribute to be levied from the cham of tartary and from the kingdom of cathay ha john what say you can we not go as far eastward as richard of the lion heart  old john will bide at home sire said the rugged soldier by my soul as long as i am seneschal of aquitaine i will find enough to do in guarding the marches which you have entrusted to me it would be a blithe day for the king of france when he heard that the seas lay between him and us  by my soul john said the prince i have never known you turn laggard before  the babbling hound sire is not always the first at the mort the old knight answered  nay my trueheart i have tried you too often not to know but by my soul i have not seen so dense a throng since the day that we brought king john down cheapside  it was indeed an enormous crowd which covered the whole vast plain from the line of vineyards to the river bank from the northern gate the prince and his companions looked down at a dark sea of heads brightened here and there by the colored hoods of the women or by the sparkling headpieces of archers and menatarms in the centre of this vast assemblage the lists seemed but a narrow strip of green marked out with banners and streamers while a gleam of white with a flutter of pennons at either end showed where the marquees were pitched which served as the dressingrooms of the combatants a path had been staked off from the city gate to the stands which had been erected for the court and the nobility down this amid the shouts of the enormous multitude the prince cantered with his two attendant kings his high officers of state and his long train of lords and ladies courtiers counsellors and soldiers with toss of plume and flash of jewel sheen of silk and glint of goldas rich and gallant a show as heart could wish the head of the cavalcade had reached the lists ere the rear had come clear of the city gate for the fairest and the bravest had assembled from all the broad lands which are watered by the dordogne and the garonne here rode darkbrowed cavaliers from the sunny south fiery soldiers from gascony graceful courtiers of limousin or saintonge and gallant young englishmen from beyond the seas here too were the beautiful brunettes of the gironde with eyes which outflashed their jewels while beside them rode their blonde sisters of england clear cut and aquiline swathed in swansdown and in ermine for the air was biting though the sun was bright slowly the long and glittering train wound into the lists until every horse had been tethered by the varlets in waiting and every lord and lady seated in the long stands which stretched rich in tapestry and velvet and blazoned arms on either side of the centre of the arena  the holders of the lists occupied the end which was nearest to the city gate there in front of their respective pavilions flew the martlets of audley the roses of loring the scarlet bars of wake the lion of the percies and the silver wings of the beauchamps each supported by a squire clad in hanging green stuff to represent so many tritons and bearing a huge conchshell in their left hands behind the tents the great warhorses armed at all points champed and reared while their masters sat at the doors of their pavilions with their helmets upon their knees chatting as to the order of the days doings the english archers and menatarms had mustered at that end of the lists but the vast majority of the spectators were in favor of the attacking party for the english had declined in popularity ever since the bitter dispute as to the disposal of the royal captive after the battle of poictiers hence the applause was by no means general when the heraldatarms proclaimed after a flourish of trumpets the names and styles of the knights who were prepared for the honor of their country and for the love of their ladies to hold the field against all who might do them the favor to run a course with them on the other hand a deafening burst of cheering greeted the rival herald who advancing from the other end of the lists rolled forth the wellknown titles of the five famous warriors who had accepted the defiance  faith john said the prince it sounds as though you were right ha my grace darmagnac it seems that our friends on this side will not grieve if our english champions lose the day  it may be so sire the gascon nobleman answered i have little doubt that in smithfield or at windsor an english crowd would favor their own countrymen  by my faith thats easily seen said the prince laughing for a few score english archers at yonder end are bellowing as though they would outshout the mighty multitude i fear that they will have little to shout over this tourney for my gold vase has small prospect of crossing the water what are the conditions john  they are to tilt singly not less than three courses sire and the victory to rest with that party which shall have won the greater number of courses each pair continuing till one or other have the vantage he who carries himself best of the victors hath the prize and he who is judged best of the other party hath a jewelled clasp shall i order that the nakirs sound sire  the prince nodded and the trumpets rang out while the champions rode forth one after the other each meeting his opponent in the centre of the lists sir william beauchamp went down before the practiced lance of the captal de buch sir thomas percy won the vantage over the lord of mucident and the lord audley struck sir perducas dalbret from the saddle the burly de clisson however restored the hopes of the attackers by beating to the ground sir thomas wake of yorkshire so far there was little to choose betwixt challengers and challenged  by saint james of santiago cried don pedro with a tinge of color upon his pale cheeks win who will this has been a most notable contest  who comes next for england john asked the prince in a voice which quivered with excitement  sir nigel loring of hampshire sire  ha he is a man of good courage and skilled in the use of all weapons  he is indeed sire but his eyes like my own are the worse for wars yet he can tilt or play his part at handstrokes as merrily as ever it was he sire who won the golden crown which queen philippa your royal mother gave to be jousted for by all the knights of england after the harrying of calais i have heard that at twynham castle there is a buffet which groans beneath the weight of his prizes  i pray that my vase may join them said the prince but here is the cavalier of germany and by my soul he looks like a man of great valor and hardiness let them run their full three courses for the issue is overgreat to hang upon one  as the prince spoke amid a loud flourish of trumpets and the shouting of the gascon party the last of the assailants rode gallantly into the lists he was a man of great size clad in black armor without blazonry or ornament of any kind for all worldly display was forbidden by the rules of the military brotherhood to which he belonged no plume or nobloy fluttered from his plain tilting salade and even his lance was devoid of the customary banderole a white mantle fluttered behind him upon the left side of which was marked the broad black cross picked out with silver which was the wellknown badge of the teutonic order mounted upon a horse as large as black and as forbidding as himself he cantered slowly forward with none of those prancings and gambades with which a cavalier was accustomed to show his command over his charger gravely and sternly he inclined his head to the prince and took his place at the further end of the arena  he had scarce done so before sir nigel rode out from the holders enclosure and galloping at full speed down the lists drew his charger up before the princes stand with a jerk which threw it back upon its haunches with white armor blazoned shield and plume of ostrichfeathers from his helmet he carried himself in so jaunty and joyous a fashion with tossing pennon and curveting charger that a shout of applause ran the full circle of the arena with the air of a man who hastes to a joyous festival he waved his lance in salute and reining the pawing horse round without permitting its forefeet to touch the ground he hastened back to his station  a great hush fell over the huge multitude as the two last champions faced each other a double issue seemed to rest upon their contest for their personal fame was at stake as well as their partys honor both were famous warriors but as their exploits had been performed in widely sundered countries they had never before been able to cross lances a course between such men would have been enough in itself to cause the keenest interest apart from its being the crisis which would decide who should be the victors of the day for a moment they waitedthe german sombre and collected sir nigel quivering in every fibre with eagerness and fiery resolution then amid a longdrawn breath from the spectators the glove fell from the marshals hand and the two steelclad horsemen met like a thunderclap in front of the royal stand the german though he reeled for an instant before the thrust of the englishman struck his opponent so fairly upon the vizor that the laces burst the plumed helmet flew to pieces and sir nigel galloped on down the lists with his bald head shimmering in the sunshine a thousand waving scarves and tossing caps announced that the first bout had fallen to the popular party  the hampshire knight was not a man to be disheartened by a reverse he spurred back to the pavilion and was out in a few instants with another helmet the second course was so equal that the keenest judges could not discern any vantage each struck fire from the others shield and each endured the jarring shock as though welded to the horse beneath him in the final bout however sir nigel struck his opponent with so true an aim that the point of the lance caught between the bars of his vizor and tore the front of his helmet out while the german aiming somewhat low and half stunned by the shock had the misfortune to strike his adversary upon the thigh a breach of the rules of the tiltingyard by which he not only sacrificed his chances of success but would also have forfeited his horse and his armor had the english knight chosen to claim them a roar of applause from the english soldiers with an ominous silence from the vast crowd who pressed round the barriers announced that the balance of victory lay with the holders already the ten champions had assembled in front of the prince to receive his award when a harsh bugle call from the further end of the lists drew all eyes to a new and unexpected arrival    chapter xxiv how a champion came forth from the east   the bordeaux lists were as has already been explained situated upon the plain near the river upon those great occasions when the tiltingground in front of the abbey of st andrews was deemed to be too small to contain the crowd on the eastern side of this plain the countryside sloped upwards thick with vines in summer but now ridged with the brown bare enclosures over the gently rising plain curved the white road which leads inland usually flecked with travellers but now with scarce a living form upon it so completely had the lists drained all the district of its inhabitants strange it was to see such a vast concourse of people and then to look upon that broad white empty highway which wound away bleak and deserted until it narrowed itself to a bare streak against the distant uplands  shortly after the contest had begun any one looking from the lists along this road might have remarked far away in the extreme distance two brilliant and sparkling points which glittered and twinkled in the bright shimmer of the winter sun within an hour these had become clearer and nearer until they might be seen to come from the reflection from the headpieces of two horsemen who were riding at the top of their speed in the direction of bordeaux another halfhour had brought them so close that every point of their bearing and equipment could be discerned the first was a knight in full armor mounted upon a brown horse with a white blaze upon breast and forehead he was a short man of great breadth of shoulder with vizor closed and no blazonry upon his simple white surcoat or plain black shield the other who was evidently his squire and attendant was unarmed save for the helmet upon his head but bore in his right hand a very long and heavy oaken spear which belonged to his master in his left hand the squire held not only the reins of his own horse but those of a great black warhorse fully harnessed which trotted along at his side thus the three horses and their two riders rode swiftly to the lists and it was the blare of the trumpet sounded by the squire as his lord rode into the arena which had broken in upon the prizegiving and drawn away the attention and interest of the spectators  ha john cried the prince craning his neck who is this cavalier and what is it that he desires  on my word sire replied chandos with the utmost surprise upon his face it is my opinion that he is a frenchman  a frenchman repeated don pedro and how can you tell that my lord chandos when he has neither coatarmor crest or blazonry  by his armor sire which is rounder at elbow and at shoulder than any of bordeaux or of england italian he might be were his bassinet more sloped but i will swear that those plates were welded betwixt this and rhine here comes his squire however and we shall hear what strange fortune hath brought him over the marches  as he spoke the attendant cantered up the grassy enclosure and pulling up his steed in front of the royal stand blew a second fanfare upon his bugle he was a rawboned swarthycheeked man with black bristling beard and a swaggering bearing  having sounded his call he thrust the bugle into his belt and pushing his way betwixt the groups of english and of gascon knights he reined up within a spears length of the royal party  i come he shouted in a hoarse thick voice with a strong breton accent as squire and herald from my master who is a very valiant pursuivantofarms and a liegeman to the great and powerful monarch charles king of the french my master has heard that there is jousting here and prospect of honorable advancement so he has come to ask that some english cavalier will vouchsafe for the love of his lady to run a course with sharpened lances with him or to meet him with sword mace battleaxe or dagger he bade me say however that he would fight only with a true englishman and not with any mongrel who is neither english nor french but speaks with the tongue of the one and fights under the banner of the other  sir cried de clisson with a voice of thunder while his countrymen clapped their hands to their swords the squire however took no notice of their angry faces but continued with his masters message  he is now ready sire he said albeit his destrier has travelled many miles this day and fast for we were in fear lest we come too late for the jousting  ye have indeed come too late said the prince seeing that the prize is about to be awarded yet i doubt not that one of these gentlemen will run a course for the sake of honor with this cavalier of france  and as to the prize sire quoth sir nigel i am sure that i speak for all when i say this french knight hath our leave to bear it away with him if he can fairly win it  bear word of this to your master said the prince and ask him which of these five englishmen he would desire to meet but stay your master bears no coatarmor and we have not yet heard his name  my master sire is under vow to the virgin neither to reveal his name nor to open his vizor until he is back upon french ground once more  yet what assurance have we said the prince that this is not some varlet masquerading in his masters harness or some caitiff knight the very touch of whose lance might bring infamy upon an honorable gentleman  it is not so sire cried the squire earnestly there is no man upon earth who would demean himself by breaking a lance with my master  you speak out boldly squire the prince answered but unless i have some further assurance of your masters noble birth and gentle name i cannot match the choicest lances of my court against him  you refuse sire  i do refuse  then sire i was bidden to ask you from my master whether you would consent if sir john chandos upon hearing my masters name should assure you that he was indeed a man with whom you might yourself cross swords without indignity  i ask no better said the prince  then i must ask lord chandos that you will step forth i have your pledge that the name shall remain ever a secret and that you will neither say nor write one word which might betray it the name is he stooped down from his horse and whispered something into the old knights ear which made him start with surprise and stare with much curiosity at the distant knight who was sitting his charger at the further end of the arena  is this indeed sooth he exclaimed  it is my lord and i swear it by st ives of brittany  i might have known it said chandos twisting his moustache and still looking thoughtfully at the cavalier  what then sir john asked the prince  sire this is a knight whom it is indeed great honor to meet and i would that your grace would grant me leave to send my squire for my harness for i would dearly love to run a course with him  nay nay sir john you have gained as much honor as one man can bear and it were hard if you could not rest now but i pray you squire to tell your master that he is very welcome to our court and that wines and spices will be served him if he would refresh himself before jousting  my master will not drink said the squire  let him then name the gentleman with whom he would break a spear  he would contend with these five knights each to choose such weapons as suit him best  i perceive said the prince that your master is a man of great heart and high of enterprise but the sun already is low in the west and there will scarce be light for these courses i pray you gentlemen to take your places that we may see whether this strangers deeds are as bold as his words  the unknown knight had sat like a statue of steel looking neither to the right nor to the left during these preliminaries he had changed from the horse upon which he had ridden and bestrode the black charger which his squire had led beside him his immense breadth his stern composed appearance and the mode in which he handled his shield and his lance were enough in themselves to convince the thousands of critical spectators that he was a dangerous opponent aylward who stood in the front row of the archers with simon big john and others of the company had been criticising the proceedings from the commencement with the ease and freedom of a man who had spent his life under arms and had learned in a hard school to know at a glance the points of a horse and his rider he stared now at the stranger with a wrinkled brow and the air of a man who is striving to stir his memory  by my hilt i have seen the thick body of him before today yet i cannot call to mind where it could have been at nogent belike or was it at auray mark me lads this man will prove to be one of the best lances of france and there are no better in the world  it is but childs play this poking game said john i would fain try my hand at it for by the black rood i think that it might be amended  what then would you do john asked several  there are many things which might be done said the forester thoughtfully methinks that i would begin by breaking my spear  so they all strive to do  nay but not upon another mans shield i would break it over my own knee  and what the better for that old beef and bones asked black simon  so i would turn what is but a ladys bodkin of a weapon into a very handsome club  and then john  then i would take the others spear into my arm or my leg or where it pleased him best to put it and i would dash out his brains with my club  by my ten fingerbones old john said aylward i would give my featherbed to see you at a spearrunning this is a most courtly and gentle sport which you have devised  so it seems to me said john seriously or again one might seize the other round the middle pluck him off his horse and bear him to the pavilion there to hold him to ransom  good cried simon amid a roar of laughter from all the archers round by thomas of kent i we shall make a campmarshal of thee and thou shalt draw up rules for our jousting but john who is it that you would uphold in this knightly and pleasing fashion  what mean you  why john so strong and strange a tilter must fight for the brightness of his ladys eyes or the curve of her eyelash even as sir nigel does for the lady loring  i know not about that said the big archer scratching his head in perplexity since mary hath played me false i can scarce fight for her  yet any woman will serve  there is my mother then said john she was at much pains at my upbringing and by my soul i will uphold the curve of her eyelashes for it tickleth my very heartroot to think of her but who is here  it is sir william beauchamp he is a valiant man but i fear that he is scarce firm enough upon the saddle to bear the thrust of such a tilter as this stranger promises to be  aylwards words were speedily justified for even as he spoke the two knights met in the centre of the lists beauchamp struck his opponent a shrewd blow upon the helmet but was met with so frightful a thrust that he whirled out of his saddle and rolled over and over upon the ground sir thomas percy met with little better success for his shield was split his vambrace torn and he himself wounded slightly in the side lord audley and the unknown knight struck each other fairly upon the helmet but while the stranger sat as firm and rigid as ever upon his charger the englishman was bent back to his horses cropper by the weight of the blow and had galloped halfway down the lists ere he could recover himself sir thomas wake was beaten to the ground with a battleaxethat being the weapon which he had selectedand had to be carried to his pavilion these rapid successes gained one after the other over four celebrated warriors worked the crowd up to a pitch of wonder and admiration thunders of applause from the english soldiers as well as from the citizens and peasants showed how far the love of brave and knightly deeds could rise above the rivalries of race  by my soul john cried the prince with his cheek flushed and his eyes shining this is a man of good courage and great hardiness i could not have thought that there was any single arm upon earth which could have overthrown these four champions  he is indeed as i have said sire a knight from whom much honor is to be gained but the lower edge of the sun is wet and it will be beneath the sea ere long  here is sir nigel loring on foot and with his sword said the prince i have heard that he is a fine swordsman  the finest in your army sire chandos answered yet i doubt not that he will need all his skill this day  as he spoke the two combatants advanced from either end in full armor with their twohanded swords sloping over their shoulders the stranger walked heavily and with a measured stride while the english knight advanced as briskly as though there was no iron shell to weigh down the freedom of his limbs at four paces distance they stopped eyed each other for a moment and then in an instant fell to work with a clatter and clang as though two sturdy smiths were busy upon their anvils up and down went the long shining blades round and round they circled in curves of glimmering light crossing meeting disengaging with flash of sparks at every parry here and there bounded sir nigel his head erect his jaunty plume fluttering in the air while his dark opponent sent in crashing blow upon blow following fiercely up with cut and with thrust but never once getting past the practised blade of the skilled swordsman the crowd roared with delight as sir nigel would stoop his head to avoid a blow or by some slight movement of his body allow some terrible thrust to glance harmlessly past him suddenly however his time came the frenchman whirling up his sword showed for an instant a chink betwixt his shoulder piece and the rerebrace which guarded his upper arm in dashed sir nigel and out again so swiftly that the eye could not follow the quick play of his blade but a trickle of blood from the strangers shoulder and a rapidly widening red smudge upon his white surcoat showed where the thrust had taken effect the wound was however but a slight one and the frenchman was about to renew his onset when at a sign from the prince chandos threw down his baton and the marshals of the lists struck up the weapons and brought the contest to an end  it were time to check it said the prince smiling for sir nigel is too good a man for me to lose and by the five holy wounds if one of those cuts came home i should have fears for our champion what think you pedro  i think edward that the little man was very well able to take care of himself for my part i should wish to see so well matched a pair fight on while a drop of blood remained in their veins  we must have speech with him such a man must not go from my court without rest or sup bring him hither chandos and certes if the lord loring hath resigned his claim upon this goblet it is right and proper that this cavalier should carry it to france with him as a sign of the prowess that he has shown this day  as he spoke the knighterrant who had remounted his warhorse galloped forward to the royal stand with a silken kerchief bound round his wounded arm the setting sun cast a ruddy glare upon his burnished arms and sent his long black shadow streaming behind him up the level clearing pulling up his steed he slightly inclined his head and sat in the stern and composed fashion with which he had borne himself throughout heedless of the applauding shouts and the flutter of kerchiefs from the long lines of brave men and of fair women who were looking down upon him  sir knight said the prince we have all marvelled this day at this great skill and valor with which god has been pleased to endow you i would fain that you should tarry at our court for a time at least until your hurt is healed and your horses rested  my hurt is nothing sire nor are my horses weary returned the stranger in a deep stern voice  will you not at least hie back to bordeaux with us that you may drain a cup of muscadine and sup at our table  i will neither drink your wine nor sit at your table returned the other i bear no love for you or for your race and there is nought that i wish at your hands until the day when i see the last sail which bears you back to your island vanishing away against the western sky  these are bitter words sir knight said prince edward with an angry frown  and they come from a bitter heart answered the unknown knight how long is it since there has been peace in my hapless country where are the steadings and orchards and vineyards which made france fair where are the cities which made her great from providence to burgundy we are beset by every prowling hireling in christendom who rend and tear the country which you have left too weak to guard her own marches is it not a byword that a man may ride all day in that unhappy land without seeing thatch upon roof or hearing the crow of cock does not one fair kingdom content you that you should strive so for this other one which has no love for you pardieu a true frenchmans words may well be bitter for bitter is his lot and bitter his thoughts as he rides through his thrice unhappy country  sir knight said the prince you speak like a brave man and our cousin of france is happy in having a cavalier who is so fit to uphold his cause either with tongue or with sword but if you think such evil of us how comes it that you have trusted yourselves to us without warranty or safeconduct  because i knew that you would be here sire had the man who sits upon your right been ruler of this land i had indeed thought twice before i looked to him for aught that was knightly or generous with a soldierly salute he wheeled round his horse and galloping down the lists disappeared amid the dense crowd of footmen and of horsemen who were streaming away from the scene of the tournament  the insolent villain cried pedro glaring furiously after him i have seen a mans tongue torn from his jaws for less would it not be well even now edward to send horsemen to hale him back bethink you that it may be one of the royal house of france or at least some knight whose loss would be a heavy blow to his master sir william felton you are well mounted gallop after the caitiff i pray you  do so sir william said the prince and give him this purse of a hundred nobles as a sign of the respect which i bear for him for by st george he has served his master this day even as i would wish liegeman of mine to serve me so saying the prince turned his back upon the king of spain and springing upon his horse rode slowly homewards to the abbey of saint andrews    chapter xxv how sir nigel wrote to twynham castle   on the morning after the jousting when alleyne edricson went as was his custom into his masters chamber to wait upon him in his dressing and to curl his hair he found him already up and very busily at work he sat at a table by the window a deerhound on one side of him and a lurcher on the other his feet tucked away under the trestle on which he sat and his tongue in his cheek with the air of a man who is much perplexed a sheet of vellum lay upon the board in front of him and he held a pen in his hand with which he had been scribbling in a rude schoolboy hand so many were the blots however and so numerous the scratches and erasures that he had at last given it up in despair and sat with his single uncovered eye cocked upwards at the ceiling as one who waits upon inspiration  by saint paul he cried as alleyne entered you are the man who will stand by me in this matter i have been in sore need of you alleyne  god be with you my fair lord the squire answered i trust that you have taken no hurt from all that you have gone through yesterday  nay i feel the fresher for it alleyne it has eased my joints which were somewhat stiff from these years of peace i trust alleyne that thou didst very carefully note and mark the bearing and carriage of this knight of france for it is time now when you are young that you should see all that is best and mould your own actions in accordance this was a man from whom much honor might be gained and i have seldom met any one for whom i have conceived so much love and esteem could i but learn his name i should send you to him with my cartel that we might have further occasion to watch his goodly feats of arms  it is said my fair lord that none know his name save only the lord chandos and that he is under vow not to speak it so ran the gossip at the squires table  be he who he might he was a very hardy gentleman but i have a task here alleyne which is harder to me than aught that was set before me yesterday  can i help you my lord  that indeed you can i have been writing my greetings to my sweet wife for i hear that a messenger goes from the prince to southampton within the week and he would gladly take a packet for me i pray you alleyne to cast your eyes upon what i have written and see it they are such words as my lady will understand my fingers as you can see are more used to iron and leather than to the drawing of strokes and turning of letters what then is there aught amiss that you should stare so  it is this first word my lord in what tongue were you pleased to write  in english for my lady talks it more than she doth french  yet this is no english word my sweet lord here are four ts and never a letter betwixt them  by st paul it seemed strange to my eye when i wrote it said sir nigel they bristle up together like a clump of lances we must break their ranks and set them farther apart the word is that now i will read it to you alleyne and you shall write it out fair for we leave bordeaux this day and it would be great joy to me to think that the lady loring had word from me  alleyne sat down as ordered with a pen in his hand and a fresh sheet of parchment before him while sir nigel slowly spelled out his letter running his forefinger on from word to word  that my heart is with thee my dear sweeting is what thine own heart will assure thee of all is well with us here save that pepin hath the mange on his back and pommers hath scarce yet got clear of his stiffness from being four days on shipboard and the more so because the sea was very high and we were like to founder on account of a hole in her side which was made by a stone cast at us by certain searovers who may the saints have in their keeping for they have gone from amongst us as has young terlake and twoscore mariners and archers who would be the more welcome here as there is like to be a very fine war with much honor and all hopes of advancement for which i go to gather my company together who are now at montaubon where they pillage and destroy yet i hope that by gods help i may be able to show that i am their master even as my sweet lady i am thy servant  how of that alleyne continued sir nigel blinking at his squire with an expression of some pride upon his face have i not told her all that hath befallen us  you have said much my fair lord and yet if i may say so it is somewhat crowded together so that my lady loring can mayhap scarce follow it were it in shorter periods  nay it boots me not how you marshal them as long as they are all there at the muster let my lady have the words and she will place them in such order as pleases her best but i would have you add what it would please her to know  that will i said alleyne blithely and bent to the task  my fair lady and mistress he wrote god hath had us in his keeping and my lord is well and in good cheer he hath won much honor at the jousting before the prince when he alone was able to make it good against a very valiant man from france touching the moneys there is enough and to spare until we reach montaubon herewith my fair lady i send my humble regards entreating you that you will give the same to your daughter the lady maude may the holy saints have you both in their keeping is ever the prayer of thy servant          alleyne edricson  that is very fairly set forth said sir nigel nodding his bald head as each sentence was read to him and for thyself alleyne if there be any dear friend to whom you would fain give greeting i can send it for thee within this packet  there is none said alleyne sadly  have you no kinsfolk then  none save my brother  ha i had forgotten that there was ill blood betwixt you but are there none in all england who love thee  none that i dare say so  and none whom you love  nay i will not say that said alleyne  sir nigel shook his head and laughed softly to himself i see how it is with you he said have i not noted your frequent sighs and vacant eye is she fair  she is indeed cried alleyne from his heart all tingling at this sudden turn of the talk  and good  as an angel  and yet she loves you not  nay i cannot say that she loves another  then you have hopes  i could not live else  then must you strive to be worthy of her love be brave and pure fearless to the strong and humble to the weak and so whether this love prosper or no you will have fitted yourself to be honored by a maidens love which is in sooth the highest guerdon which a true knight can hope for  indeed my lord i do so strive said alleyne but she is so sweet so dainty and of so noble a spirit that i fear me that i shall never be worthy of her  by thinking so you become worthy is she then of noble birth  she is my lord faltered alleyne  of a knightly house  yes  have a care alleyne have a care said sir nigel kindly the higher the steed the greater the fall hawk not at that which may be beyond thy flight  my lord i know little of the ways and usages of the world cried alleyne but i would fain ask your rede upon the matter you have known my father and my kin is not my family one of good standing and repute  beyond all question  and yet you warn me that i must not place my love too high  were minstead yours alleyne then by st paul i cannot think that any family in the land would not be proud to take you among them seeing that you come of so old a strain but while the socman livesha by my soul if this is not sir olivers step i am the more mistaken  as he spoke a heavy footfall was heard without and the portly knight flung open the door and strode into the room  why my little coz said he i have come across to tell you that i live above the barbers in the rue de la tour and that there is a venison pasty in the oven and two flasks of the right vintage on the table by st james a blind man might find the place for one has but to get in the wind from it and follow the savory smell put on your cloak then and come for sir walter hewett and sir robert briquet with one or two others are awaiting us  nay oliver i cannot be with you for i must to montaubon this day  to montaubon but i have heard that your company is to come with my forty winchester rascals to dax  if you will take charge of them oliver for i will go to montaubon with none save my two squires and two archers then when i have found the rest of my company i shall lead them to dax we set forth this morning  then i must back to my pasty said sir oliver you will find us at dax i doubt not unless the prince throw me into prison for he is very wroth against me  and why oliver  pardieu because i have sent my cartel gauntlet and defiance to sir john chandos and to sir william felton  to chandos in gods name oliver why have you done this  because he and the other have used me despitefully  and how  because they have passed me over in choosing those who should joust for england yourself and audley i could pass coz for you are mature men but who are wake and percy and beauchamp by my soul i was prodding for my food into a campkettle when they were howling for their pap is a man of my weight and substance to be thrown aside for the first three halfgrown lads who have learned the trick of the tiltyard but hark ye coz i think of sending my cartel also to the prince  oliver oliver you are mad  not i i faith i care not a denier whether he be prince or no by saint james i see that your squires eyes are starting from his head like a trussed crab well friend we are all three men of hampshire and not lightly to be jeered at  has he jeered at you than  pardieu yes old sir olivers heart is still stout said one of his court else had it been out of keeping with the rest of him quoth the prince and his arm is strong said another so is the backbone of his horse quoth the prince this very day i will send him my cartel and defiance  nay nay my dear oliver said sir nigel laying his hand upon his angry friends arm there is naught in this for it was but saying that you were a strong and robust man who had need of a good destrier and as to chandos and felton bethink you that if when you yourself were young the older lances had ever been preferred how would you then have had the chance to earn the good name and fame which you now bear you do not ride as light as you did oliver and i ride lighter by the weight of my hair but it would be an ill thing if in the evening of our lives we showed that our hearts were less true and loyal than of old if such a knight as sir oliver buttesthorn may turn against his own prince for the sake of a light word then where are we to look for steadfast faith and constancy  ah my dear little coz it is easy to sit in the sunshine and preach to the man in the shadow yet you could ever win me over to your side with that soft voice of yours let us think no more of it then but holy mother i had forgot the pasty and it will be as scorched as judas iscariot come nigel lest the foul fiend get the better of me again  for one hour then for we march at midday tell aylward alleyne that he is to come with me to montaubon and to choose one archer for his comrade the rest will to dax when the prince starts which will be before the feast of the epiphany have pommers ready at midday with my sycamore lance and place my harness on the sumpter mule  with these brief directions the two old soldiers strode off together while alleyne hastened to get all in order for their journey    chapter xxvi how the three comrades gained a mighty treasure   it was a bright crisp winters day when the little party set off from bordeaux on their journey to montaubon where the missing half of their company had last been heard of sir nigel and ford had ridden on in advance the knight upon his hackney while his great warhorse trotted beside his squire two hours later alleyne edricson followed for he had the tavern reckoning to settle and many other duties which fell to him as squire of the body with him came aylward and hordle john armed as of old but mounted for their journey upon a pair of clumsy landes horses heavyheaded and shambling but of great endurance and capable of jogging along all day even when between the knees of the huge archer who turned the scale at two hundred and seventy pounds they took with them the sumpter mules which carried in panniers the wardrobe and table furniture of sir nigel for the knight though neither fop nor epicure was very dainty in small matters and loved however bare the board or hard the life that his napery should still be white and his spoon of silver  there had been frost during the night and the white hard road rang loud under their horses irons as they spurred through the east gate of the town along the same broad highway which the unknown french champion had traversed on the day of the jousts the three rode abreast alleyne edricson with his eyes cast down and his mind distrait for his thoughts were busy with the conversation which he had had with sir nigel in the morning had he done well to say so much or had he not done better to have said more what would the knight have said had he confessed to his love for the lady maude would he cast him off in disgrace or might he chide him as having abused the shelter of his roof it had been ready upon his tongue to tell him all when sir oliver had broken in upon them perchance sir nigel with his love of all the dying usages of chivalry might have contrived some strange ordeal or feat of arms by which his love should be put to the test alleyne smiled as he wondered what fantastic and wondrous deed would be exacted from him whatever it was he was ready for it whether it were to hold the lists in the court of the king of tartary to carry a cartel to the sultan of baghdad or to serve a term against the wild heathen of prussia sir nigel had said that his birth was high enough for any lady if his fortune could but be amended often had alleyne curled his lip at the beggarly craving for land or for gold which blinded man to the higher and more lasting issues of life now it seemed as though it were only by this same land and gold that he might hope to reach his hearts desire but then again the socman of minstead was no friend to the constable of twynham castle it might happen that should he amass riches by some happy fortune of war this feud might hold the two families aloof even if maude loved him he knew her too well to think that she would wed him without the blessing of her father dark and murky was it all but hope mounts high in youth and it ever fluttered over all the turmoil of his thoughts like a white plume amid the shock of horsemen  if alleyne edricson had enough to ponder over as he rode through the bare plains of guienne his two companions were more busy with the present and less thoughtful of the future aylward rode for half a mile with his chin upon his shoulder looking back at a white kerchief which fluttered out of the gable window of a high house which peeped over the corner of the battlements when at last a dip of the road hid it from his view he cocked his steel cap shrugged his broad shoulders and rode on with laughter in his eyes and his weatherbeaten face all ashine with pleasant memories john also rode in silence but his eyes wandered slowly from one side of the road to the other and he stared and pondered and nodded his head like a traveller who makes his notes and saves them up for the retelling  by the rood he broke out suddenly slapping his thigh with his great red hand i knew that there was something amissing but i could not bring to my mind what it was  what was it then asked alleyne coming with a start out of his reverie  why it is the hedgerows roared john with a shout of laughter the country is all scraped as clear as a friars poll but indeed i cannot think much of the folk in these parts why do they not get to work and dig up these long rows of black and crooked stumps which i see on every hand a franklin of hampshire would think shame to have such litter upon his soil  thou foolish old john quoth aylward you should know better since i have heard that the monks of beaulieu could squeeze a good cup of wine from their own grapes know then that if these rows were dug up the wealth of the country would be gone and mayhap there would be dry throats and gaping mouths in england for in three months time these black roots will blossom and snoot and burgeon and from them will come many a good shipload of medoc and gascony which will cross the narrow seas but see the church in the hollow and the folk who cluster in the churchyard by my hilt it is a burial and there is a passing bell he pulled off his steel cap as he spoke and crossed himself with a muttered prayer for the repose of the dead  there too remarked alleyne as they rode on again that which seems to the eye to be dead is still full of the sap of life even as the vines were thus god hath written himself and his laws very broadly on all that is around us if our poor dull eyes and duller souls could but read what he hath set before us  ha mon petit cried the bowman you take me back to the days when you were new fledged as sweet a little chick as ever pecked his way out of a monkish egg i had feared that in gaining our debonair young manatarms we had lost our softspoken clerk in truth i have noted much change in you since we came from twynham castle  surely it would be strange else seeing that i have lived in a world so new to me yet i trust that there are many things in which i have not changed if i have turned to serve an earthly master and to carry arms for an earthly king it would be an ill thing if i were to lose all thought of the great high king and master of all whose humble and unworthy servant i was ere ever i left beaulieu you john are also from the cloisters but i trow that you do not feel that you have deserted the old service in taking on the new  i am a slowwitted man said john and in sooth when i try to think about such matters it casts a gloom upon me yet i do not look upon myself as a worse man in an archers jerkin than i was in a white cowl if that be what you mean  you have but changed from one white company to the other quoth aylward but by these ten fingerbones it is a passing strange thing to me to think that it was but in the last fall of the leaf that we walked from lyndhurst together he so gentle and maidenly and you john like a great redlimbed overgrown mooncalf and now here you are as sprack a squire and as lusty an archer as ever passed down the highway from bordeaux while i am still the same old samkin aylward with never a change save that i have a few more sins on my soul and a few less crowns in my pouch but i have never yet heard john what the reason was why you should come out of beaulieu  there were seven reasons said john thoughtfully the first of them was that they threw me out  ma foi camarade to the devil with the other six that is enough for me and for thee also i can see that they are very wise and discreet folk at beaulieu ah mon ange what have you in the pipkin  it is milk worthy sir answered the peasantmaid who stood by the door of a cottage with a jug in her hand would it please you gentles that i should bring you out three horns of it  nay ma petite but here is a twosous piece for thy kindly tongue and for the sight of thy pretty face ma foi but she has a bonne mine i have a mind to bide and speak with her  nay nay aylward cried alleyne sir nigel will await us and he in haste  true true camarade adieu ma cherie mon coeur est toujours a toi her mother is a wellgrown woman also see where she digs by the wayside ma foi the riper fruit is ever the sweeter bon jour ma belle dame god have you in his keeping said sir nigel where he would await us  at marmande or aiguillon he said that we could not pass him seeing that there is but the one road  aye and it is a road that i know as i know the midhurst parish butts quoth the bowman thirty times have i journeyed it forward and backward and by the twang of string i am wont to come back this way more laden than i went i have carried all that i had into france in a wallet and it hath taken four sumptermules to carry it back again gods benison on the man who first turned his hand to the making of war but there down in the dingle is the church of cardillac and you may see the inn where three poplars grow beyond the village let us on for a stoup of wine would hearten us upon our way  the highway had lain through the swelling vineyard country which stretched away to the north and east in gentle curves with many a peeping spire and feudal tower and cluster of village houses all clear cut and hard in the bright wintry air to their right stretched the blue garonne running swiftly seawards with boats and barges dotted over its broad bosom on the other side lay a strip of vineyard and beyond it the desolate and sandy region of the landes all tangled with faded gorse and heath and broom stretching away in unbroken gloom to the blue hills which lay low upon the furthest skyline behind them might still be seen the broad estuary of the gironde with the high towers of saint andre and saint remi shooting up from the plain in front amid radiating lines of poplars lay the riverside townlet of cardillacgray walls white houses and a feather of blue smoke  this is the mouton dor said aylward as they pulled up their horses at a whitewashed straggling hostel what ho there he continued beating upon the door with the hilt of his sword tapster ostler varlet hark hither and a wannion on your lazy limbs ha michel as red in the nose as ever three jacks of the wine of the country michelfor the air bites shrewdly i pray you alleyne to take note of this door for i have a tale concerning it  tell me friend said alleyne to the portly redfaced innkeeper has a knight and a squire passed this way within the hour  nay sir it would be two hours back was he a small man weak in the eyes with a want of hair and speaks very quiet when he is most to be feared  the same the squire answered but i marvel how you should know how he speaks when he is in wrath for he is very gentleminded with those who are beneath him  praise to the saints it was not i who angered him said the fat michel  who then  it was young sieur de crespigny of saintonge who chanced to be here and made game of the englishman seeing that he was but a small man and hath a face which is full of peace but indeed this good knight was a very quiet and patient man for he saw that the sieur de crespigny was still young and spoke from an empty head so he sat his horse and quaffed his wine even as you are doing now all heedless of the clacking tongue  and what then michel  well messieurs it chanced that the sieur de crespigny having said this and that for the laughter of the varlets cried out at last about the glove that the knight wore in his coif asking if it was the custom in england for a man to wear a great archers glove in his cap pardieu i have never seen a man get off his horse as quick as did that stranger englishman ere the words were past the others lips he was beside him his face nigh touching and his breath hot upon his cheeks i think young sir quoth he softly looking into the others eyes that now that i am nearer you will very clearly see that the glove is not an archers glove perchance not said the sieur de crespigny with a twitching lip nor is it large but very small quoth the englishman less large than i had thought said the other looking down for the knights gaze was heavy upon his eyelids and in every way such a glove as might be worn by the fairest and sweetest lady in england quoth the englishman it may be so said the sieur de crespigny turning his face from him i am myself weak in the eyes and have often taken one thing for another quoth the knight as he sprang back into his saddle and rode off leaving the sieur de crespigny biting his nails before the door ha by the five wounds many men of war have drunk my wine but never one was more to my fancy than this little englishman  by my hilt he is our master michel quoth aylward and such men as we do not serve under a laggart but here are four deniers michel and god be with you en avant camarades for we have a long road before us  at a brisk trot the three friends left cardillac and its winehouse behind them riding without a halt past st macaire and on by ferry over the river dorpt at the further side the road winds through la reolle bazaille and marmande with the sunlit river still gleaming upon the right and the bare poplars bristling up upon either side john and alleyne rode silent on either side but every inn farmsteading or castle brought back to aylward some remembrance of love foray or plunder with which to beguile the way  there is the smoke from bazas on the further side of garonne quoth he there were three sisters yonder the daughters of a farrier and by these ten fingerbones a man might ride for a long june day and never set eyes upon such maidens there was marie tall and grave and blanche petite and gay and the dark agnes with eyes that went through you like a waxed arrow i lingered there as long as four days and was betrothed to them all for it seemed shame to set one above her sisters and might make ill blood in the family yet for all my care things were not merry in the house and i thought it well to come away there too is the mill of le souris old pierre le caron who owned it was a right good comrade and had ever a seat and a crust for a weary archer he was a man who wrought hard at all that he turned his hand to but he heated himself in grinding bones to mix with his flour and so through overdiligence he brought a fever upon himself and died  tell me aylward said alleyne what was amiss with the door of yonder inn that you should ask me to observe it  pardieu yes i had wellnigh forgot what saw you on yonder door  i saw a square hole through which doubtless the host may peep when he is not too sure of those who knock  and saw you naught else  i marked that beneath this hole there was a deep cut in the door as though a great nail had been driven in  and naught else  no  had you looked more closely you might have seen that there was a stain upon the wood the first time that i ever heard my comrade black simon laugh was in front of that door i heard him once again when he slew a french squire with his teeth he being unarmed and the frenchman having a dagger  and why did simon laugh in front of the inndoor asked john  simon is a hard and perilous man when he hath the bitter drop in him and by my hilt he was born for war for there is little sweetness or rest in him this inn the mouton dor was kept in the old days by one francois gourval who had a hard fist and a harder heart it was said that many and many an archer coming from the wars had been served with wine with simples in it until he slept and had then been stripped of all by this gourval then on the morrow if he made complaint this wicked gourval would throw him out upon the road or beat him for he was a very lusty man and had many stout varlets in his service this chanced to come to simons ears when we were at bordeaux together and he would have it that we should ride to cardillac with a good hempen cord and give this gourval such a scourging as he merited forth we rode then but when we came to the mouton dor gourval had had word of our coming and its purpose so that the door was barred nor was there any way into the house let us in good master gourval cried simon and let us in good master gourval cried i but no word could we get through the hole in the door save that he would draw an arrow upon us unless we went on our way well master gourval quoth simon at last this is but a sorry welcome seeing that we have ridden so far just to shake you by the hand canst shake me by the hand without coming in said gourval and how that asked simon by passing in your hand through the hole said he nay my hand is wounded quoth simon and of such a size that i cannot pass it in that need not hinder said gourval who was hot to be rid of us pass in your left hand but i have something for thee gourval said simon what then he asked there was an english archer who slept here last week of the name of hugh of nutbourne we have had many rogues here said gourval his conscience hath been heavy within him because he owes you a debt of fourteen deniers having drunk wine for which he hath never paid for the easing of his soul he asked me to pay the money to you as i passed now this gourval was very greedy for money so he thrust forth his hand for the fourteen deniers but simon had his dagger ready and he pinned his hand to the door i have paid the englishmans debt gourval quoth he and so rode away laughing so that he could scarce sit his horse leaving mine host still nailed to his door such is the story of the hole which you have marked and of the smudge upon the wood i have heard that from that time english archers have been better treated in the auberge of cardillac but what have we here by the wayside  it appears to be a very holy man said alleyne  and by the rood he hath some strange wares cried john what are these bits of stone and of wood and rusted nails which are set out in front of him  the man whom they had remarked sat with his back against a cherrytree and his legs shooting out in front of him like one who is greatly at his ease across his thighs was a wooden board and scattered over it all manner of slips of wood and knobs of brick and stone each laid separate from the other as a huckster places his wares he was dressed in a long gray gown and wore a broad hat of the same color much weatherstained with three scallopshells dangling from the brim as they approached the travellers observed that he was advanced in years and that his eyes were upturned and yellow  dear knights and gentlemen he cried in a high crackling voice worthy christian cavaliers will ye ride past and leave an aged pilgrim to die of hunger the sight hast been burned from mine eyes by the sands of the holy land and i have had neither crust of bread nor cup of wine these two days past  by my hilt father said aylward looking keenly at him it is a marvel to me that thy girdle should have so goodly a span and clip thee so closely if you have in sooth had so little to place within it  kind stranger answered the pilgrim you have unwittingly spoken words which are very grievous to me to listen to yet i should be loth to blame you for i doubt not that what you said was not meant to sadden me nor to bring my sore affliction back to my mind it ill becomes me to prate too much of what i have endured for the faith and yet since you have observed it i must tell you that this thickness and roundness of the waist is caused by a dropsy brought on by overhaste in journeying from the house of pilate to the mount of olives  there aylward said alleyne with a reddened cheek let that curb your blunt tongue how could you bring a fresh pang to this holy man who hath endured so much and hath journeyed as far as christs own blessed tomb  may the foul fiend strike me dumb cried the bowman in hot repentance but both the palmer and alleyne threw up their hands to stop him  i forgive thee from my heart dear brother piped the blind man but oh these wild words of thine are worse to mine ears than aught which you could say of me  not another word shall i speak said aylward but here is a franc for thee and i crave thy blessing  and here is another said alleyne  and another cried hordle john  but the blind palmer would have none of their alms foolish foolish pride he cried beating upon his chest with his large brown hand foolish foolish pride how long then will it be ere i can scourge it forth am i then never to conquer it oh strong strong are the ties of flesh and hard it is to subdue the spirit i come friends of a noble house and i cannot bring myself to touch this money even though it be to save me from the grave  alas father said alleyne how then can we be of help to thee  i had sat down here to die quoth the palmer but for many years i have carried in my wallet these precious things which you see set forth now before me it were sin thought i that my secret should perish with me i shall therefore sell these things to the first worthy passersby and from them i shall have money enough to take me to the shrine of our lady at rocamadour where i hope to lay these old bones  what are these treasures then father asked hordle john i can but see an old rusty nail with bits of stone and slips of wood  my friend answered the palmer not all the money that is in this country could pay a just price for these wares of mine this nail he continued pulling off his hat and turning up his sightless orbs is one of those wherewith mans salvation was secured i had it together with this piece of the true rood from the fiveandtwentieth descendant of joseph of arimathea who still lives in jerusalem alive and well though latterly much afflicted by boils aye you may well cross yourselves and i beg that you will not breathe upon it or touch it with your fingers  and the wood and stone holy father asked alleyne with bated breath as he stared awestruck at his precious relics  this cantle of wood is from the true cross this other from noah his ark and the third is from the doorpost of the temple of the wise king solomon this stone was thrown at the sainted stephen and the other two are from the tower of babel here too is part of aarons rod and a lock of hair from elisha the prophet  but father quoth alleyne the holy elisha was bald which brought down upon him the revilements of the wicked children  it is very true that he had not much hair said the palmer quickly and it is this which makes this relic so exceeding precious take now your choice of these my worthy gentlemen and pay such a price as your consciences will suffer you to offer for i am not a chapman nor a huckster and i would never part with them did i not know that i am very near to my reward  aylward said alleyne excitedly this is such a chance as few folk have twice in one life the nail i must have and i will give it to the abbey of beaulieu so that all the folk in england may go thither to wonder and to pray  and i will have the stone from the temple cried hordle john what would not my old mother give to have it hung over her bed  and i will have aarons rod quoth aylward i have but five florins in the world and here are four of them  here are three more said john  and here are five more added alleyne holy father i hand you twelve florins which is all that we can give though we well know how poor a pay it is for the wondrous things which you sell us  down pride down cried the pilgrim still beating upon his chest can i not bend myself then to take this sorry sum which is offered me for that which has cost me the labors of a life give me the dross here are the precious relics and oh i pray you that you will handle them softly and with reverence else had i rather left my unworthy bones here by the wayside  with doffed caps and eager hands the comrades took their new and precious possessions and pressed onwards upon their journey leaving the aged palmer still seated under the cherrytree they rode in silence each with his treasure in his hand glancing at it from time to time and scarce able to believe that chance had made them sole owners of relics of such holiness and worth that every abbey and church in christendom would have bid eagerly for their possession so they journeyed full of this good fortune until opposite the town of le mas where johns horse cast a shoe and they were glad to find a wayside smith who might set the matter to rights to him aylward narrated the good hap which had befallen them but the smith when his eyes lit upon the relics leaned up against his anvil and laughed with his hand to his side until the tears hopped down his sooty cheeks  why masters quoth he this man is a coquillart or seller of false relics and was here in the smithy not two hours ago this nail that he hath sold you was taken from my nailbox and as to the wood and the stones you will see a heap of both outside from which he hath filled his scrip  nay nay cried alleyne this was a holy man who had journeyed to jerusalem and acquired a dropsy by running from the house of pilate to the mount of olives  i know not about that said the smith but i know that a man with a gray palmers hat and gown was here no very long time ago and that he sat on yonder stump and ate a cold pullet and drank a flask of wine then he begged from me one of my nails and filling his scrip with stones he went upon his way look at these nails and see if they are not the same as that which he has sold you  now may god save us cried alleyne all aghast is there no end then to the wickedness of humankind he so humble so aged so loth to take our moneyand yet a villain and a cheat whom can we trust or believe in  i will after him said aylward flinging himself into the saddle come alleyne we may catch him ere johns horse be shod  away they galloped together and ere long they saw the old gray palmer walking slowly along in front of them he turned however at the sound of their hoofs and it was clear that his blindness was a cheat like all the rest of him for he ran swiftly through a field and so into a wood where none could follow him they hurled their relics after him and so rode back to the blacksmiths the poorer both in pocket and in faith    chapter xxvii how roger clubfoot was passed into paradise   it was evening before the three comrades came into aiguillon there they found sir nigel loring and ford safely lodged at the sign of the baton rouge where they supped on good fare and slept between lavenderscented sheets it chanced however that a knight of poitou sir gaston destelle was staying there on his way back from lithuania where he had served a term with the teutonic knights under the landmaster of the presbytery of marienberg he and sir nigel sat late in high converse as to bushments outfalls and the intaking of cities with many tales of warlike men and valiant deeds then their talk turned to minstrelsy and the stranger knight drew forth a cittern upon which he played the minnelieder of the north singing the while in a high cracked voice of hildebrand and brunhild and siegfried and all the strength and beauty of the land of almain to this sir nigel answered with the romances of sir eglamour and of sir isumbras and so through the long winter night they sat by the crackling woodfire answering each others songs until the crowing cocks joined in their concert yet with scarce an hour of rest sir nigel was as blithe and bright as ever as they set forth after breakfast upon their way  this sir gaston is a very worthy man said he to his squires as they rode from the baton rouge he hath a very strong desire to advance himself and would have entered upon some small knightly debate with me had he not chanced to have his armbone broken by the kick of a horse i have conceived a great love for him and i have promised him that when his bone is mended i will exchange thrusts with him but we must keep to this road upon the left  nay my fair lord quoth aylward the road to montaubon is over the river and so through quercy and the agenois  true my good aylward but i have learned from this worthy knight who hath come over the french marches that there is a company of englishmen who are burning and plundering in the country round villefranche i have little doubt from what he says that they are those whom we seek  by my hilt it is like enough said aylward by all accounts they had been so long at montaubon that there would be little there worth the taking then as they have already been in the south they would come north to the country of the aveyron  we shall follow the lot until we come to cahors and then cross the marches into villefranche said sir nigel by st paul as we are but a small band it is very likely that we may have some very honorable and pleasing adventure for i hear that there is little peace upon the french border  all morning they rode down a broad and winding road barred with the shadows of poplars sir nigel rode in front with his squires while the two archers followed behind with the sumpter mule between them they had left aiguillon and the garonne far to the south and rode now by the tranquil lot which curves blue and placid through a gently rolling country alleyne could not but mark that whereas in guienne there had been many townlets and few castles there were now many castles and few houses on either hand gray walls and square grim keeps peeped out at every few miles from amid the forests while the few villages which they passed were all ringed round with rude walls which spoke of the constant fear and sudden foray of a wild frontier land twice during the morning there came bands of horsemen swooping down upon them from the black gateways of wayside strongholds with short stern questions as to whence they came and what their errand bands of armed men clanked along the highway and the few lines of laden mules which carried the merchandise of the trader were guarded by armed varlets or by archers hired for the service  the peace of bretigny hath not made much change in these parts quoth sir nigel for the country is overrun with free companions and masterless men yonder towers between the wood and the hill mark the town of cahors and beyond it is the land of france but here is a man by the wayside and as he hath two horses and a squire i make little doubt that he is a knight i pray you alleyne to give him greeting from me and to ask him for his titles and coatarmor it may be that i can relieve him of some vow or perchance he hath a lady whom he would wish to advance  nay my fair lord said alleyne these are not horses and a squire but mules and a varlet the man is a mercer for he hath a great bundle beside him  now gods blessing on your honest english voice cried the stranger pricking up his ears at the sound of alleynes words never have i heard music that was so sweet to mine ear come watkin lad throw the bales over lauras back my heart was nigh broke for it seemed that i had left all that was english behind me and that i would never set eyes upon norwich market square again he was a tall lusty middleaged man with a ruddy face a brown forked beard shot with gray and a broad flanders hat set at the back of his head his servant as tall as himself but gaunt and rawboned had swung the bales on the back of one mule while the merchant mounted upon the other and rode to join the party it was easy to see as he approached from the quality of his dress and the richness of his trappings that he was a man of some wealth and position  sir knight said he my name is david micheldene and i am a burgher and alderman of the good town of norwich where i live five doors from the church of our lady as all men know on the banks of yare i have here my bales of cloth which i carry to cahorswoe worth the day that ever i started on such an errand i crave your gracious protection upon the way for me my servant and my mercery for i have already had many perilous passages and have now learned that roger clubfoot the robberknight of quercy is out upon the road in front of me i hereby agree to give you one rosenoble if you bring me safe to the inn of the angel in cahors the same to be repaid to me or my heirs if any harm come to me or my goods  by saint paul answered sir nigel i should be a sorry knight if i ask pay for standing by a countryman in a strange land you may ride with me and welcome master micheldene and your varlet may follow with my archers  gods benison upon thy bounty cried the stranger should you come to norwich you may have cause to remember that you have been of service to alderman micheldene it is not very far to cahors for surely i see the cathedral towers against the skyline but i have heard much of this roger clubfoot and the more i hear the less do i wish to look upon his face oh but i am sick and weary of it all and i would give half that i am worth to see my good dame sitting in peace beside me and to hear the bells of norwich town  your words are strange to me quoth sir nigel for you have the appearance of a stout man and i see that you wear a sword by your side  yet it is not my trade answered the merchant i doubt not that if i set you down in my shop at norwich you might scarce tell fustian from falding and know little difference between the velvet of genoa and the threepiled cloth of bruges there you might well turn to me for help but here on a lone roadside with thick woods and robberknights i turn to you for it is the business to which you have been reared  there is sooth in what you say master micheldene said sir nigel and i trust that we may come upon this roger clubfoot for i have heard that he is a very stout and skilful soldier and a man from whom much honor is to be gained  he is a bloody robber said the trader curtly and i wish i saw him kicking at the end of a halter  it is such men as he sir nigel remarked who give the true knight honorable deeds to do whereby he may advance himself  it is such men as he retorted micheldene who are like rats in a wheatrick or moths in a woolfels a harm and a hindrance to all peaceful and honest men  yet if the dangers of the road weigh so heavily upon you master alderman it is a great marvel to me that you should venture so far from home  and sometimes sir knight it is a marvel to myself but i am a man who may grutch and grumble but when i have set my face to do a thing i will not turn my back upon it until it be done there is one francois villet at cahors who will send me winecasks for my clothbales so to cahors i will go though all the robberknights of christendom were to line the roads like yonder poplars  stoutly spoken master alderman but how have you fared hitherto  as a lamb fares in a land of wolves five times we have had to beg and pray ere we could pass twice i have paid toll to the wardens of the road three times we have had to draw and once at la reolle we stood seer our woolbales watkin and i and we laid about us for as long as a man might chant a litany slaying one rogue and wounding two others by gods coif we are men of peace but we are free english burghers not to be mishandled either in our country or abroad neither lord baron knight or commoner shall have as much as a strike of flax of mine whilst i have strength to wag this sword  and a passing strange sword it is quoth sir nigel what make you alleyne of these black lines which are drawn across the sheath  i cannot tell what they are my fair lord  nor can i said ford  the merchant chuckled to himself it was a thought of mine own said he for the sword was made by thomas wilson the armorer who is betrothed to my second daughter margery know then that the sheath is one clothyard in length marked off according to feet and inches to serve me as a measuring wand it is also of the exact weight of two pounds so that i may use it in the balance  by saint paul quoth sir nigel it is very clear to me that the sword is like thyself good alderman apt either for war or for peace but i doubt not that even in england you have had much to suffer from the hands of robbers and outlaws  it was only last lammastide sir knight that i was left for dead near reading as i journeyed to winchester fair yet i had the rogues up at the court of piepowder and they will harm no more peaceful traders  you travel much then  to winchester linn mart bristol fair stourbridge and bartholomews in london town the rest of the year you may ever find me five doors from the church of our lady where i would from my heart that i was at this moment for there is no air like norwich air and no water like the yare nor can all the wines of france compare with the beer of old sam yelverton who keeps the dun cow but out and alack here is an evil fruit which hangs upon this chestnuttree  as he spoke they had ridden round a curve of the road and come upon a great tree which shot one strong brown branch across their path from the centre of this branch there hung a man with his head at a horrid slant to his body and his toes just touching the ground he was naked save for a linen under shirt and pair of woollen drawers beside him on a green bank there sat a small man with a solemn face and a great bundle of papers of all colors thrusting forth from the scrip which lay beside him he was very richly dressed with furred robes a scarlet hood and wide hanging sleeves lined with flamecolored silk a great gold chain hung round his neck and rings glittered from every finger of his hands on his lap he had a little pile of gold and of silver which he was dropping coin by coin into a plump pouch which hung from his girdle  may the saints be with you good travellers he shouted as the party rode up may the four evangelists watch over you may the twelve apostles bear you up may the blessed army of martyrs direct your feet and lead you to eternal bliss  gramercy for these good wishes said sir nigel but i perceive master alderman that this man who hangs here is by mark of foot the very robberknight of whom we have spoken but there is a cartel pinned upon his breast and i pray you alleyne to read it to me  the dead robber swung slowly to and fro in the wintry wind a fixed smile upon his swarthy face and his bulging eyes still glaring down the highway of which he had so long been the terror on a sheet of parchment upon his breast was printed in rude characters                      roger piedbot                par lordre du senechal de               castelnau et de lechevin de               cahors servantes fideles du               tres vaillant et tres puissant               edouard prince de galles et               daquitaine               ne touchez pas               ne coutez pas               ne depechez pas  he took a sorry time in dying said the man who sat beside him he could stretch one toe to the ground and bear him self up so that i thought he would never have done now at last however he is safely in paradise and so i may jog on upon my earthly way he mounted as he spoke a white mule which had been grazing by the wayside all gay with fustian of gold and silver bells and rode onward with sir nigels party  how know you then that he is in paradise asked sir nigel all things are possible to god but certes without a miracle i should scarce expect to find the soul of roger clubfoot amongst the just  i know that he is there because i have just passed him in there answered the stranger rubbing his bejewelled hands together in placid satisfaction it is my holy mission to be a sompnour or pardoner i am the unworthy servant and delegate of him who holds the keys a contrite heart and ten nobles to holy mother church may stave off perdition but he hath a pardon of the first degree with a twentyfive livre benison so that i doubt if he will so much as feel a twinge of purgatory i came up even as the seneschals archers were tying him up and i gave him my foreword that i would bide with him until he had passed there were two leaden crowns among the silver but i would not for that stand in the way of his salvation  by saint paul said sir nigel if you have indeed this power to open and to shut the gates of hope then indeed you stand high above mankind but if you do but claim to have it and yet have it not then it seems to me master clerk that you may yourself find the gate barred when you shall ask admittance  small of faith small of faith cried the sompnour ah sir didymus yet walks upon earth and yet no words of doubt can bring anger to mine heart or a bitter word to my lip for am i not a poor unworthy worker in the cause of gentleness and peace of all these pardons which i bear every one is stamped and signed by our holy father the prop and centre of christendom  which of them asked sir nigel  ha ha cried the pardoner shaking a jewelled forefinger thou wouldst be deep in the secrets of mother church know then that i have both in my scrip those who hold with urban shall have urbans pardon while i have clements for the clementistor he who is in doubt may have both so that come what may he shall be secure i pray you that you will buy one for war is bloody work and the end is sudden with little time for thought or shrift or you sir for you seem to me to be a man who would do ill to trust to your own merits this to the alderman of norwich who had listened to him with a frowning brow and a sneering lip  when i sell my cloth quoth he he who buys may weigh and feel and handle these goods which you sell are not to be seen nor is there any proof that you hold them certes if mortal man might control gods mercy it would be one of a lofty and godlike life and not one who is decked out with rings and chains and silks like a pleasurewench at a kermesse  thou wicked and shameless man cried the clerk dost thou dare to raise thy voice against the unworthy servant of mother church  unworthy enough quoth david micheldene i would have you to know clerk that i am a free english burgher and that i dare say my mind to our father the pope himself let alone such a lacqueys lacquey as you  baseborn and foulmouthed knave cried the sompnour you prate of holy things to which your hogs mind can never rise keep silence lest i call a curse upon you  silence yourself roared the other foul bird we found thee by the gallows like a carrioncrow a fine life thou hast of it with thy silks and thy baubles cozening the last few shillings from the pouches of dying men a fig for thy curse bide here if you will take my rede for we will make england too hot for such as you when master wicliff has the ordering of it thou vile thief it is you and such as you who bring an evil name upon the many churchmen who lead a pure and a holy life thou outside the door of heaven art more like to be inside the door of hell  at this crowning insult the sompnour with a face ashen with rage raised up a quivering hand and began pouring latin imprecations upon the angry alderman the latter however was not a man to be quelled by words for he caught up his ellmeasure swordsheath and belabored the cursing clerk with it the latter unable to escape from the shower of blows set spurs to his mule and rode for his life with his enemy thundering behind him at sight of his masters sudden departure the varlet watkin set off after him with the packmule beside him so that the four clattered away down the road together until they swept round a curve and their babble was but a drone in the distance sir nigel and alleyne gazed in astonishment at one another while ford burst out alaughing  pardieu said the knight this david micheldene must be one of those lollards about whom father christopher of the priory had so much to say yet he seemed to be no bad man from what i have seen of him  i have heard that wicliff hath many followers in norwich answered alleyne  by st paul i have no great love for them quoth sir nigel i am a man who am slow to change and if you take away from me the faith that i have been taught it would be long ere i could learn one to set in its place it is but a chip here and a chip there yet it may bring the tree down in time yet on the other hand i cannot but think it shame that a man should turn gods mercy on and off as a cellarman doth wine with a spigot  nor is it said alleyne part of the teachings of that mother church of which he had so much to say there was sooth in what the alderman said of it  then by st paul they may settle it betwixt them quoth sir nigel for me i serve god the king and my lady and so long as i can keep the path of honor i am well content my creed shall ever be that of chandos          fais ce que doisadviegne que peut          cest commande au chevalier    chapter xxviii how the comrades came over the marches of france   after passing cahors the party branched away from the main road and leaving the river to the north of them followed a smaller track which wound over a vast and desolate plain this path led them amid marshes and woods until it brought them out into a glade with a broad stream swirling swiftly down the centre of it through this the horses splashed their way and on the farther shore sir nigel announced to them that they were now within the borders of the land of france for some miles they still followed the same lonely track which led them through a dense wood and then widening out curved down to an open rolling country such as they had traversed between aiguillon and cahors  if it were grim and desolate upon the english border however what can describe the hideous barrenness of this ten times harried tract of france the whole face of the country was scarred and disfigured mottled over with the black blotches of burned farmsteadings and the gray gaunt gableends of what had been chateaux broken fences crumbling walls vineyards littered with stones the shattered arches of bridgeslook where you might the signs of ruin and rapine met the eye here and there only on the farthest skyline the gnarled turrets of a castle or the graceful pinnacles of church or of monastery showed where the forces of the sword or of the spirit had preserved some small islet of security in this universal flood of misery moodily and in silence the little party rode along the narrow and irregular track their hearts weighed down by this farstretching land of despair it was indeed a stricken and a blighted country and a man might have ridden from auvergne in the north to the marches of foix nor ever seen a smiling village or a thriving homestead  from time to time as they advanced they saw strange lean figures scraping and scratching amid the weeds and thistles who on sight of the band of horsemen threw up their arms and dived in among the brushwood as shy and as swift as wild animals more than once however they came on families by the wayside who were too weak from hunger and disease to fly so that they could but sit like hares on a tussock with panting chests and terror in their eyes so gaunt were these poor folk so worn and spentwith bent and knotted frames and sullen hopeless mutinous facesthat it made the young englishman heartsick to look upon them indeed it seemed as though all hope and light had gone so far from them that it was not to be brought back for when sir nigel threw down a handful of silver among them there came no softening of their lined faces but they clutched greedily at the coins peering questioningly at him and champing with their animal jaws here and there amid the brushwood the travellers saw the rude bundle of sticks which served them as a homemore like a fowls nest than the dwellingplace of man yet why should they build and strive when the first adventurer who passed would set torch to their thatch and when their own feudal lord would wring from them with blows and curses the last fruits of their toil they sat at the lowest depth of human misery and hugged a bitter comfort to their souls as they realized that they could go no lower yet they had still the human gift of speech and would take council among themselves in their brushwood hovels glaring with bleared eyes and pointing with thin fingers at the great widespread chateaux which ate like a cancer into the life of the countryside when such men who are beyond hope and fear begin in their dim minds to see the source their woes it may be an evil time for those who have wronged them the weak man becomes strong when he has nothing for then only can he feel the wild mad thrill of despair high and strong the chateaux lowly and weak the brushwood hut but god help the seigneur and his lady when the men of the brushwood set their hands to the work of revenge  through such country did the party ride for eight or it might be nine miles until the sun began to slope down in the west and their shadows to stream down the road in front of them wary and careful they must be with watchful eyes to the right and the left for this was no mans land and their only passports were those which hung from their belts frenchmen and englishmen gascon and provencal brabanter tardvenu scorcher flayer and free companion wandered and struggled over the whole of this accursed district so bare and cheerless was the outlook and so few and poor the dwellings that sir nigel began to have fears as to whether he might find food and quarters for his little troop it was a relief to him therefore when their narrow track opened out upon a larger road and they saw some little way down it a square white house with a great bunch of holly hung out at the end of a stick from one of the upper windows  by st paul said he i am right glad for i had feared that we might have neither provant nor herbergage ride on alleyne and tell this innkeeper that an english knight with his party will lodge with him this night  alleyne set spurs to his horse and reached the inn door a long bowshot before his companions neither varlet nor ostler could be seen so he pushed open the door and called loudly for the landlord three times he shouted but receiving no reply he opened an inner door and advanced into the chief guestroom of the hostel  a very cheerful woodfire was sputtering and cracking in an open grate at the further end of the apartment at one side of this fire in a highbacked oak chair sat a lady her face turned towards the door the firelight played over her features and alleyne thought that he had never seen such queenly power such dignity and strength upon a womans face she might have been fiveandthirty years of age with aquiline nose firm yet sensitive mouth dark curving brows and deepset eyes which shone and sparkled with a shifting brilliancy beautiful as she was it was not her beauty which impressed itself upon the beholder it was her strength her power the sense of wisdom which hung over the broad white brow the decision which lay in the square jaw and delicately moulded chin a chaplet of pearls sparkled amid her black hair with a gauze of silver network flowing back from it over her shoulders a black mantle was swathed round her and she leaned back in her chair as one who is fresh from a journey  in the opposite corner there sat a very burly and broadshouldered man clad in a black jerkin trimmed with sable with a black velvet cap with curling white feather cocked upon the side of his head a flask of red wine stood at his elbow and he seemed to be very much at his ease for his feet were stuck up on a stool and between his thighs he held a dish full of nuts these he cracked between his strong white teeth and chewed in a leisurely way casting the shells into the blaze as alleyne gazed in at him he turned his face half round and cocked an eye at him over his shoulder it seemed to the young englishman that he had never seen so hideous a face for the eyes were of the lightest green the nose was broken and driven inwards while the whole countenance was seared and puckered with wounds the voice too when he spoke was as deep and as fierce as the growl of a beast of prey  young man said he i know not who you may be and i am not much inclined to bestir myself but if it were not that i am bent upon taking my ease i swear by the sword of joshua that i would lay my dogwhip across your shoulders for daring to fill the air with these discordant bellowings  taken aback at this ungentle speech and scarce knowing how to answer it fitly in the presence of the lady alleyne stood with his hand upon the handle of the door while sir nigel and his companions dismounted at the sound of these fresh voices and of the tongue in which they spoke the stranger crashed his dish of nuts down upon the floor and began himself to call for the landlord until the whole house reechoed with his roarings with an ashen face the whiteaproned host came running at his call his hands shaking and his very hair bristling with apprehension for the sake of god sirs he whispered as he passed speak him fair and do not rouse him for the love of the virgin be mild with him  who is this then asked sir nigel  alleyne was about to explain when a fresh roar from the stranger interrupted him  thou villain innkeeper he shouted did i not ask you when i brought my lady here whether your inn was clean  you did sire  did i not very particularly ask you whether there were any vermin in it  you did sire  and you answered me  that there were not sire  and yet ere i have been here an hour i find englishmen crawling about within it where are we to be free from this pestilent race can a frenchman upon french land not sit down in a french auberge without having his ears pained by the clack of their hideous talk send them packing innkeeper or it may be the worse for them and for you  i will sire i will cried the frightened host and bustled from the room while the soft soothing voice of the woman was heard remonstrating with her furious companion  indeed gentlemen you had best go said mine host it is but six miles to villefranche where there are very good quarters at the sign of the lion rouge  nay answered sir nigel i cannot go until i have seen more of this person for he appears to be a man from whom much is to be hoped what is his name and title  it is not for my lips to name it unless by his desire but i beg and pray you gentlemen that you will go from my house for i know not what may come of it if his rage should gain the mastery of him  by saint paul lisped sir nigel this is certainly a man whom it is worth journeying far to know go tell him that a humble knight of england would make his further honorable acquaintance not from any presumption pride or illwill but for the advancement of chivalry and the glory of our ladies give him greeting from sir nigel loring and say that the glove which i bear in my cap belongs to the most peerless and lovely of her sex whom i am now ready to uphold against any lady whose claim he might be desirous of advancing  the landlord was hesitating whether to carry this message or no when the door of the inner room was flung open and the stranger bounded out like a panther from its den his hair bristling and his deformed face convulsed with anger  still here he snarled dogs of england must ye be lashed hence tiphaine my sword he turned to seize his weapon but as he did so his gaze fell upon the blazonry of sir nigels shield and he stood staring while the fire in his strange green eyes softened into a sly and humorous twinkle  mort dieu cried he it is my little swordsman of bordeaux i should remember that coatarmor seeing that it is but three days since i looked upon it in the lists by garonne ah sir nigel sir nigel you owe me a return for this and he touched his right arm which was girt round just under the shoulder with a silken kerchief  but the surprise of the stranger at the sight of sir nigel was as nothing compared with the astonishment and the delight which shone upon the face of the knight of hampshire as he looked upon the strange face of the frenchman twice he opened his mouth and twice he peered again as though to assure himself that his eyes had not played him a trick  bertrand he gasped at last bertrand du guesclin  by saint ives shouted the french soldier with a hoarse roar of laughter it is well that i should ride with my vizor down for he that has once seen my face does not need to be told my name it is indeed i sir nigel and here is my hand i give you my word that there are but three englishmen in this world whom i would touch save with the sharp edge of the sword the prince is one chandos the second and you the third for i have heard much that is good of you  i am growing aged and am somewhat spent in the wars quoth sir nigel but i can lay by my sword now with an easy mind for i can say that i have crossed swords with him who hath the bravest heart and the strongest arm of all this great kingdom of france i have longed for it i have dreamed of it and now i can scarce bring my mind to understand that this great honor hath indeed been mine  by the virgin of rennes you have given me cause to be very certain of it said du guesclin with a gleam of his broad white teeth  and perhaps most honored sir it would please you to continue the debate perhaps you would condescend to go farther into the matter god he knows that i am unworthy of such honor yet i can show my fourandsixty quarterings and i have been present at some bickerings and scufflings during these twenty years  your fame is very well known to me and i shall ask my lady to enter your name upon my tablets said sir bertrand there are many who wish to advance themselves and who bide their turn for i refuse no man who comes on such an errand at present it may not be for mine arm is stiff from this small touch and i would fain do you full honor when we cross swords again come in with me and let your squires come also that my sweet spouse the lady tiphaine may say that she hath seen so famed and gentle a knight  into the chamber they went in all peace and concord where the lady tiphaine sat like queen on throne for each in turn to be presented to her sooth to say the stout heart of sir nigel which cared little for the wrath of her lionlike spouse was somewhat shaken by the calm cold face of this stately dame for twenty years of camplife had left him more at ease in the lists than in a ladys boudoir he bethought him too as he looked at her set lips and deepset questioning eyes that he had heard strange tales of this same lady tiphaine du guesclin was it not she who was said to lay hands upon the sick and raise them from their couches when the leeches had spent their last nostrums had she not forecast the future and were there not times when in the loneliness of her chamber she was heard to hold converse with some being upon whom mortal eye never restedsome dark familiar who passed where doors were barred and windows high sir nigel sunk his eye and marked a cross on the side of his leg as he greeted this dangerous dame and yet ere five minutes had passed he was hers and not he only but his two young squires as well the mind had gone out of them and they could but look at this woman and listen to the words which fell from her lipswords which thrilled through their nerves and stirred their souls like the battlecall of a bugle  often in peaceful afterdays was alleyne to think of that scene of the wayside inn of auvergne the shadows of evening had fallen and the corners of the long low woodpanelled room were draped in darkness the sputtering wood fire threw out a circle of red flickering light which played over the little group of wayfarers and showed up every line and shadow upon their faces sir nigel sat with elbows upon knees and chin upon hands his patch still covering one eye but his other shining like a star while the ruddy light gleamed upon his smooth white head ford was seated at his left his lips parted his eyes staring and a fleck of deep color on either cheek his limbs all rigid as one who fears to move on the other side the famous french captain leaned back in his chair a litter of nutshells upon his lap his huge head half buried in a cushion while his eyes wandered with an amused gleam from his dame to the staring enraptured englishmen then last of all that pale clearcut face that sweet clear voice with its high thrilling talk of the deathlessness of glory of the worthlessness of life of the pain of ignoble joys and of the joy which lies in all pains which lead to a noble end still as the shadows deepened she spoke of valor and virtue of loyalty honor and fame and still they sat drinking in her words while the fire burned down and the red ash turned to gray  by the sainted ives cried du guesclin at last it is time that we spoke of what we are to do this night for i cannot think that in this wayside auberge there are fit quarters for an honorable company  sir nigel gave a long sigh as he came back from the dreams of chivalry and hardihood into which this strange womans words had wafted him i care not where i sleep said he but these are indeed somewhat rude lodgings for this fair lady  what contents my lord contents me quoth she i perceive sir nigel that you are under vow she added glancing at his covered eye  it is my purpose to attempt some small deed he answered  and the gloveis it your ladys  it is indeed my sweet wifes  who is doubtless proud of you  say rather i of her quoth he quickly god he knows that i am not worthy to be her humble servant it is easy lady for a man to ride forth in the light of day and do his devoir when all men have eyes for him but in a womans heart there is a strength and truth which asks no praise and can but be known to him whose treasure it is  the lady tiphaine smiled across at her husband you have often told me bertrand that there were very gentle knights amongst the english quoth she  aye aye said he moodily but to horse sir nigel you and yours and we shall seek the chateau of sir tristram de rochefort which is two miles on this side of villefranche he is seneschal of auvergne and mine old war companion  certes he would have a welcome for you quoth sir nigel but indeed he might look askance at one who comes without permit over the marches  by the virgin when he learns that you have come to draw away these rascals he will be very blithe to look upon your face innkeeper here are ten gold pieces what is over and above your reckoning you may take off from your charges to the next needy knight who comes this way come then for it grows late and the horses are stamping in the roadway  the lady tiphaine and her spouse sprang upon their steeds without setting feet to stirrup and away they jingled down the white moonlit highway with sir nigel at the ladys bridlearm and ford a spears length behind them alleyne had lingered for an instant in the passage and as he did so there came a wild outcry from a chamber upon the left and out there ran aylward and john laughing together like two schoolboys who are bent upon a prank at sight of alleyne they slunk past him with somewhat of a shamefaced air and springing upon their horses galloped after their party the hubbub within the chamber did not cease however but rather increased with yells of a moi mes amis a moi camarades a moi lhonorable champion de leveque de montaubon a la recousse de leglise sainte so shrill was the outcry that both the innkeeper and alleyne with every varlet within hearing rushed wildly to the scene of the uproar  it was indeed a singular scene which met their eyes the room was a long and lofty one stone floored and bare with a fire at the further end upon which a great pot was boiling a deal table ran down the centre with a wooden winepitcher upon it and two horn cups some way from it was a smaller table with a single beaker and a broken winebottle from the heavy wooden rafters which formed the roof there hung rows of hooks which held up sides of bacon joints of smoked beef and strings of onions for winter use in the very centre of all these upon the largest hook of all there hung a fat little redfaced man with enormous whiskers kicking madly in the air and clawing at rafters hams and all else that was within handgrasp the huge steel hook had been passed through the collar of his leather jerkin and there he hung like a fish on a line writhing twisting and screaming but utterly unable to free himself from his extraordinary position it was not until alleyne and the landlord had mounted on the table that they were able to lift him down when he sank gasping with rage into a seat and rolled his eyes round in every direction  has he gone quoth he  gone who  he the man with the red head the giant man  yes said alleyne he hath gone  and comes not back  no  the better for him cried the little man with a long sigh of relief mon dieu what am i not the champion of the bishop of montaubon ah could i have descended could i have come down ere he fled then you would have seen you would have beheld a spectacle then there would have been one rascal the less upon earth ma foi yes  good master pelligny said the landlord these gentlemen have not gone very fast and i have a horse in the stable at your disposal for i would rather have such bloody doings as you threaten outside the four walls of mine auberge  i hurt my leg and cannot ride quoth the bishops champion i strained a sinew on the day that i slew the three men at castelnau  god save you master pelligny cried the landlord it must be an awesome thing to have so much blood upon ones soul and yet i do not wish to see so valiant a man mishandled and so i will for friendships sake ride after this englishman and bring him back to you  you shall not stir cried the champion seizing the innkeeper in a convulsive grasp i have a love for you gaston and i would not bring your house into ill repute nor do such scath to these walls and chattels as must befall if two such men as this englishman and i fall to work here  nay think not of me cried the innkeeper what are my walls when set against the honor of francois poursuivant damour pelligny champion of the bishop of montaubon my horse andre  by the saints no gaston i will not have it you have said truly that it is an awesome thing to have such rough work upon ones soul i am but a rude soldier yet i have a mind mon dieu i reflect i weigh i balance shall i not meet this man again shall i not bear him in mind shall i not know him by his great paws and his red head ma foi yes  and may i ask sir said alleyne why it is that you call yourself champion of the bishop of montaubon  you may ask aught which it is becoming to me to answer the bishop hath need of a champion because if any cause be set to test of combat it would scarce become his office to go down into the lists with leather and shield and cudgel to exchange blows with any varlet he looks around him then for some tried fighting man some honest smiter who can give a blow or take one it is not for me to say how far he hath succeeded but it is sooth that he who thinks that he hath but to do with the bishop of montaubon finds himself face to face with francois poursuivant damour pelligny  at this moment there was a clatter of hoofs upon the road and a varlet by the door cried out that one of the englishmen was coming back the champion looked wildly about for some corner of safety and was clambering up towards the window when fords voice sounded from without calling upon alleyne to hasten or he might scarce find his way bidding adieu to landlord and to champion therefore he set off at a gallop and soon overtook the two archers  a pretty thing this john said he thou wilt have holy church upon you if you hang her champions upon iron hooks in an inn kitchen  it was done without thinking he answered apologetically while aylward burst into a shout of laughter  by my hilt mon petit said he you would have laughed also could you have seen it for this man was so swollen with pride that he would neither drink with us nor sit at the same table with us nor as much as answer a question but must needs talk to the varlet all the time that it was well there was peace and that he had slain more englishmen than there were tags to his doublet our good old john could scarce lay his tongue to french enough to answer him so he must needs reach out his great hand to him and place him very gently where you saw him but we must on for i can scarce hear their hoofs upon the road  i think that i can see them yet said ford peering down the moonlit road  pardieu yes now they ride forth from the shadow and yonder dark clump is the castle of villefranche en avant camarades or sir nigel may reach the gates before us but hark mes amis what sound is that  as he spoke the hoarse blast of a horn was heard from some woods upon the right an answering call rung forth upon their left and hard upon it two others from behind them  they are the horns of swineherds quoth aylward though why they blow them so late i cannot tell  let us on then said ford and the whole party setting their spurs to their horses soon found themselves at the castle of villefranche where the drawbridge had already been lowered and the portcullis raised in response to the summons of du guesclin    chapter xxix how the blessed hour of sight came to the lady tiphaine   sir tristram de rochefort seneschal of auvergne and lord of villefranche was a fierce and renowned soldier who had grown gray in the english wars as lord of the marches and guardian of an exposed countryside there was little rest for him even in times of socalled peace and his whole life was spent in raids and outfalls upon the brabanters latecomers flayers free companions and roving archers who wandered over his province at times he would come back in triumph and a dozen corpses swinging from the summit of his keep would warn evildoers that there was still a law in the land at others his ventures were not so happy and he and his troop would spur it over the drawbridge with clatter of hoofs hard at their heels and whistle of arrows about their ears hard he was of hand and harder of heart hated by his foes and yet not loved by those whom he protected for twice he had been taken prisoner and twice his ransom had been wrung by dint of blows and tortures out of the starving peasants and ruined farmers wolves or watchdogs it was hard to say from which the sheep had most to fear  the castle of villefranche was harsh and stern as its master a broad moat a high outer wall turreted at the corners with a great black keep towering above allso it lay before them in the moonlight by the light of two flambeaux protruded through the narrow slitshaped openings at either side of the ponderous gate they caught a glimpse of the glitter of fierce eyes and of the gleam of the weapons of the guard the sight of the twoheaded eagle of du guesclin however was a passport into any fortalice in france and ere they had passed the gate the old border knight came running forwards with hands outthrown to greet his famous countryman nor was he less glad to see sir nigel when the englishmans errand was explained to him for these archers had been a sore thorn in his side and had routed two expeditions which he had sent against them a happy day it would be for the seneschal of auvergne when they should learn that the last yew bow was over the marches  the material for a feast was ever at hand in days when if there was grim want in the cottage there was at least rude plenty in the castle within an hour the guests were seated around a board which creaked under the great pasties and joints of meat varied by those more dainty dishes in which the french excelled the spiced ortolan and the truffled beccaficoes the lady rochefort a bright and laughterloving dame sat upon the left of her warlike spouse with lady tiphaine upon the right beneath sat du guesclin and sir nigel with sir amory monticourt of the order of the hospitallers and sir otto harnit a wandering knight from the kingdom of bohemia these with alleyne and ford four french squires and the castle chaplain made the company who sat together that night and made good cheer in the castle of villefranche the great fire crackled in the grate the hooded hawks slept upon their perches the rough deerhounds with expectant eyes crouched upon the tiled floor close at the elbows of the guests stood the dapper little lilaccoated pages the laugh and jest circled round and all was harmony and comfort little they recked of the brushwood men who crouched in their rags along the fringe of the forest and looked with wild and haggard eyes at the rich warm glow which shot a golden bar of light from the high arched windows of the castle  supper over the tables dormant were cleared away as by magic and trestles and bancals arranged around the blazing fire for there was a bitter nip in the air the lady tiphaine had sunk back in her cushioned chair and her long dark lashes drooped low over her sparkling eyes alleyne glancing at her noted that her breath came quick and short and that her cheeks had blanched to a lily white du guesclin eyed her keenly from time to time and passed his broad brown fingers through his crisp curly black hair with the air of a man who is perplexed in his mind  these folk here said the knight of bohemia they do not seem too well fed  ah canaille cried the lord of villefranche you would scarce credit it and yet it is sooth that when i was taken at poictiers it was all that my wife and fosterbrother could do to raise the money from them for my ransom the sulky dogs would rather have three twists of a rack or the thumbikins for an hour than pay out a denier for their own feudal father and liege lord yet there is not one of them but hath an old stocking full of gold pieces hid away in a snug corner  why do they not buy food then asked sir nigel by st paul it seemed to me their bones were breaking through their skin  it is their grutching and grumbling which makes them thin we have a saying here sir nigel that if you pummel jacques bonhomme he will pat you but if you pat him he will pummel you doubtless you find it so in england  ma foi no said sir nigel i have two englishmen of this class in my train who are at this instant i make little doubt as full of your wine as any cask in your cellar he who pummelled them might come by such a pat as he would be likely to remember  i cannot understand it quoth the seneschal for the english knights and nobles whom i have met were not men to brook the insolence of the base born  perchance my fair lord the poor folk are sweeter and of a better countenance in england laughed the lady rochefort mon dieu you cannot conceive to yourself how ugly they are without hair without teeth all twisted and bent for me i cannot think how the good god ever came to make such people i cannot bear it i and so my trusty raoul goes ever before me with a cudgel to drive them from my path  yet they have souls fair lady they have souls murmured the chaplain a whitehaired man with a weary patient face  so i have heard you tell them said the lord of the castle and for myself father though i am a true son of holy church yet i think that you were better employed in saying your mass and in teaching the children of my menatarms than in going over the countryside to put ideas in these folks heads which would never have been there but for you i have heard that you have said to them that their souls are as good as ours and that it is likely that in another life they may stand as high as the oldest blood of auvergne for my part i believe that there are so many worthy knights and gallant gentlemen in heaven who know how such things should be arranged that there is little fear that we shall find ourselves mixed up with base roturiers and swineherds tell your beads father and con your psalter but do not come between me and those whom the king has given to me  god help them cried the old priest a higher king than yours has given them to me and i tell you here in your own castle hall sir tristram de rochefort that you have sinned deeply in your dealings with these poor folk and that the hour will come and may even now be at hand when gods hand will be heavy upon you for what you have done he rose as he spoke and walked slowly from the room  pest take him cried the french knight now what is a man to do with a priest sir bertrandfor one can neither fight him like a man nor coax him like a woman  ah sir bertrand knows the naughty one cried the lady rochefort have we not all heard how he went to avignon and squeezed fifty thousand crowns out of the pope  ma foi said sir nigel looking with a mixture of horror and admiration at du guesclin did not your heart sink within you were you not smitten with fears have you not felt a curse hang over you  i have not observed it said the frenchman carelessly but by saint ives tristram this chaplain of yours seems to me to be a worthy man and you should give heed to his words for though i care nothing for the curse of a bad pope it would be a grief to me to have aught but a blessing from a good priest  hark to that my fair lord cried the lady rochefort take heed i pray thee for i do not wish to have a blight cast over me nor a palsy of the limbs i remember that once before you angered father stephen and my tirewoman said that i lost more hair in seven days than ever before in a month  if that be sign of sin then by saint paul i have much upon my soul said sir nigel amid a general laugh but in very truth sir tristram if i may venture a word of counsel i should advise that you make your peace with this good man  he shall have four silver candlesticks said the seneschal moodily and yet i would that he would leave the folk alone you cannot conceive in your mind how stubborn and brainless they are mules and pigs are full of reason beside them god he knows that i have had great patience with them it was but last week that having to raise some money i called up to the castle jean goubert who as all men know has a casketful of gold pieces hidden away in some hollow tree i give you my word that i did not so much as lay a stripe upon his fools back but after speaking with him and telling him how needful the money was to me i left him for the night to think over the matter in my dungeon what think you that the dog did why in the morning we found that he had made a rope from strips of his leathern jerkin and had hung himself to the bar of the window  for me i cannot conceive such wickedness cried the lady  and there was gertrude le boeuf as fair a maiden as eye could see but as bad and bitter as the rest of them when young amory de valance was here last lammastide he looked kindly upon the girl and even spoke of taking her into his service what does she do with her dog of a father why they tie themselves together and leap into the linden pool where the water is five spearslengths deep i give you my word that it was a great grief to young amory and it was days ere he could cast it from his mind but how can one serve people who are so foolish and so ungrateful  whilst the seneschal of villefranche had been detailing the evil doings of his tenants alleyne had been unable to take his eyes from the face of lady tiphaine she had lain back in her chair with drooping eyelids and bloodless face so that he had feared at first her journey had weighed heavily upon her and that the strength was ebbing out of her of a sudden however there came a change for a dash of bright color flickered up on to either cheek and her lids were slowly raised again upon eyes which sparkled with such lustre as alleyne had never seen in human eyes before while their gaze was fixed intently not on the company but on the dark tapestry which draped the wall so transformed and so ethereal was her expression that alleyne in his loftiest dream of archangel or of seraph had never pictured so sweet so womanly and yet so wise a face glancing at du guesclin alleyne saw that he also was watching his wife closely and from the twitching of his features and the beads upon his brickcolored brow it was easy to see that he was deeply agitated by the change which he marked in her  how is it with you lady he asked at last in a tremulous voice  her eyes remained fixed intently upon the wall and there was a long pause ere she answered him her voice too which had been so clear and ringing was now low and muffled as that of one who speaks from a distance  all is very well with me bertrand said she the blessed hour of sight has come round to me again  i could see it come i could see it come he exclaimed passing his fingers through his hair with the same perplexed expression as before  this is untoward sir tristram he said at last and i scarce know in what words to make it clear to you and to your fair wife and to sir nigel loring and to these other stranger knights my tongue is a blunt one and fitter to shout word of command than to clear up such a matter as this of which i can myself understand little this however i know that my wife is come of a very sainted race whom god hath in his wisdom endowed with wondrous powers so that tiphaine raquenel was known throughout brittany ere ever i first saw her at dinan yet these powers are ever used for good and they are the gift of god and not of the devil which is the difference betwixt white magic and black  perchance it would be as well that we should send for father stephen said sir tristram  it would be best that he should come cried the hospitaller  and bring with him a flask of holy water added the knight of bohemia  not so gentlemen answered sir bertrand it is not needful that this priest should be called and it is in my mind that in asking for this ye cast some slight shadow or slur upon the good name of my wife as though it were still doubtful whether her power came to her from above or below if ye have indeed such a doubt i pray that you will say so that we may discuss the matter in a fitting way  for myself said sir nigel i have heard such words fall from the lips of this lady that i am of the opinion that there is no woman save only one who can be in any way compared to her in beauty and in goodness should any gentleman think otherwise i should deem it great honor to run a small course with him or debate the matter in whatever way might be most pleasing to him  nay it would ill become me to cast a slur upon a lady who is both my guest and the wife of my comradeinarms said the seneschal of villefranche i have perceived also that on her mantle there is marked a silver cross which is surely sign enough that there is nought of evil in these strange powers which you say that she possesses  this argument of the seneschals appealed so powerfully to the bohemian and to the hospitaller that they at once intimated that their objections had been entirely overcome while even the lady rochefort who had sat shivering and crossing herself ceased to cast glances at the door and allowed her fears to turn to curiosity  among the gifts which have been vouchsafed to my wife said du guesclin there is the wondrous one of seeing into the future but it comes very seldom upon her and goes as quickly for none can command it the blessed hour of sight as she hath named it has come but twice since i have known her and i can vouch for it that all that she hath told me was true for on the evening of the battle of auray she said that the morrow would be an ill day for me and for charles of blois ere the sun had sunk again he was dead and i the prisoner of sir john chandos yet it is not every question that she can answer but only those  bertrand bertrand cried the lady in the same mutterings faraway voice the blessed hour passes use it bertrand while you may  i will my sweet tell me then what fortune comes upon me  danger bertranddeadly pressing dangerwhich creeps upon you and you know it not  the french soldier burst into a thunderous laugh and his green eyes twinkled with amusement at what time during these twenty years would not that have been a true word he cried danger is in the air that i breathe but is this so very close tiphaine  herenowclose upon you the words came out in broken strenuous speech while the ladys fair face was writhed and drawn like that of one who looks upon a horror which strikes the words from her lips du guesclin gazed round the tapestried room at the screens the tables the abace the credence the buffet with its silver salver and the halfcircle of friendly wondering faces there was an utter stillness save for the sharp breathing of the lady tiphaine and for the gentle soughing of the wind outside which wafted to their ears the distant call upon a swineherds horn  the danger may bide said he shrugging his broad shoulders and now tiphaine tell us what will come of this war in spain  i can see little she answered straining her eyes and puckering her brow as one who would fain clear her sight there are mountains and dry plains and flash of arms and shouting of battlecries yet it is whispered to me that by failure you will succeed  ha sir nigel how like you that quoth bertrand shaking his head it is like mead and vinegar half sweet half sour and is there no question which you would ask my lady  certes there is i would fain know fair lady how all things are at twynham castle and above all how my sweet lady employs herself  to answer this i would fain lay hand upon one whose thoughts turn strongly to this castle which you have named nay my lord loring it is whispered to me that there is another here who hath thought more deeply of it than you  thought more of mine own home cried sir nigel lady i fear that in this matter at least you are mistaken  not so sir nigel come hither young man young english squire with the gray eyes now give me your hand and place it here across my brow that i may see that which you have seen what is this that rises before me mist mist rolling mist with a square black tower above it see it shreds out it thins it rises and there lies a castle in green plain with the sea beneath it and a great church within a bowshot there are two rivers which run through the meadows and between them lie the tents of the besiegers  the besiegers cried alleyne ford and sir nigel all three in a breath  yes truly and they press hard upon the castle for they are an exceeding multitude and full of courage see how they storm and rage against the gate while some rear ladders and others line after line sweep the walls with their arrows they are many leaders who shout and beckon and one a tall man with a golden beard who stands before the gate stamping his foot and hallooing them on as a pricker doth the hounds but those in the castle fight bravely there is a woman two women who stand upon the walls and give heart to the menatarms they shower down arrows darts and great stones ah they have struck down the tall leader and the others give back the mist thickens and i can see no more  by saint paul said sir nigel i do not think that there can be any such doings at christchurch and i am very easy of the fortalice so long as my sweet wife hangs the key of the outer bailey at the head of her bed yet i will not deny that you have pictured the castle as well as i could have done myself and i am full of wonderment at all that i have heard and seen  i would lady tiphaine cried the lady rochefort that you would use your power to tell me what hath befallen my golden bracelet which i wore when hawking upon the second sunday of advent and have never set eyes upon since  nay lady said du guesclin it does not befit so great and wondrous a power to pry and search and play the varlet even to the beautiful chatelaine of villefranche ask a worthy question and with the blessing of god you shall have a worthy answer  then i would fain ask cried one of the french squires as to which may hope to conquer in these wars betwixt the english and ourselves  both will conquer and each will hold its own answered the lady tiphaine  then we shall still hold gascony and guienne cried sir nigel  the lady shook her head french land french blood french speech she answered they are french and france shall have them  but not bordeaux cried sir nigel excitedly  bordeaux also is for france  but calais  calais too  woe worth me then and ill hail to these evil words if bordeaux and calais be gone then what is left for england  it seems indeed that there are evil times coming upon your country said du guesclin in our fondest hopes we never thought to hold bordeaux by saint ives this news hath warmed the heart within me our dear country will then be very great in the future tiphaine  great and rich and beautiful she cried far down the course of time i can see her still leading the nations a wayward queen among the peoples great in war but greater in peace quick in thought deft in action with her peoples will for her sole monarch from the sands of calais to the blue seas of the south  ha cried du guesclin with his eyes flashing in triumph you hear her sir nigeland she never yet said word which was not sooth  the english knight shook his head moodily what of my own poor country said he i fear lady that what you have said bodes but small good for her  the lady sat with parted lips and her breath came quick and fast my god she cried what is this that is shown me whence come they these peoples these lordly nations these mighty countries which rise up before me i look beyond and others rise and yet others far and farther to the shores of the uttermost waters they crowd they swarm the world is given to them and it resounds with the clang of their hammers and the ringing of their church bells they call them many names and they rule them this way or that but they are all english for i can hear the voices of the people on i go and onwards over seas where man hath never yet sailed and i see a great land under new stars and a stranger sky and still the land is england where have her children not gone what have they not done her banner is planted on ice her banner is scorched in the sun she lies athwart the lands and her shadow is over the seas bertrand bertrand we are undone for the buds of her bud are even as our choicest flower her voice rose into a wild cry and throwing up her arms she sank back white and nerveless into the deep oaken chair  it is over said du guesclin moodily as he raised her drooping head with his strong brown hand wine for the lady squire the blessed hour of sight hath passed    chapter xxx how the brushwood men came to the chateau of villefranche   it was late ere alleyne edricson having carried sir nigel the goblet of spiced wine which it was his custom to drink after the curling of his hair was able at last to seek his chamber it was a stoneflagged room upon the second floor with a bed in a recess for him and two smaller pallets on the other side on which aylward and hordle john were already snoring alleyne had knelt down to his evening orisons when there came a tap at his door and ford entered with a small lamp in his hand his face was deadly pale and his hand shook until the shadows flickered up and down the wall  what is it ford cried alleyne springing to his feet  i can scarce tell you said he sitting down on the side of the couch and resting his chin upon his hand i know not what to say or what to think  has aught befallen you then  yes or i have been slave to my own fancy i tell you lad that i am all undone like a fretted bowstring hark hither alleyne it cannot be that you have forgotten little tita the daughter of the old glassstainer at bordeaux  i remember her well  she and i alleyne broke the lucky groat together ere we parted and she wears my ring upon her finger caro mio quoth she when last we parted i shall be near thee in the wars and thy danger will be my danger alleyne as god is my help as i came up the stairs this night i saw her stand before me her face in tears her hands out as though in warningi saw it alleyne even as i see those two archers upon their couches our very fingertips seemed to meet ere she thinned away like a mist in the sunshine  i would not give overmuch thought to it answered alleyne our minds will play us strange pranks and bethink you that these words of the lady tiphaine du guesclin have wrought upon us and shaken us  ford shook his head i saw little tita as clearly as though i were back at the rue des apotres at bordeaux said he  but the hour is late and i must go  where do you sleep then  in the chamber above you may the saints be with us all he rose from the couch and left the chamber while alleyne could hear his feet sounding upon the winding stair the young squire walked across to the window and gazed out at the moonlit landscape his mind absorbed by the thought of the lady tiphaine and of the strange words that she had spoken as to what was going forward at castle twynham leaning his elbows upon the stonework he was deeply plunged in reverie when in a moment his thoughts were brought back to villefranche and to the scene before him  the window at which he stood was in the second floor of that portion of the castle which was nearest to the keep in front lay the broad moat with the moon lying upon its surface now clear and round now drawn lengthwise as the breeze stirred the waters beyond the plain sloped down to a thick wood while further to the left a second wood shut out the view between the two an open glade stretched silvered in the moonshine with the river curving across the lower end of it  as he gazed he saw of a sudden a man steal forth from the wood into the open clearing he walked with his head sunk his shoulders curved and his knees bent as one who strives hard to remain unseen ten paces from the fringe of trees he glanced around and waving his hand he crouched down and was lost to sight among a belt of furzebushes after him there came a second man and after him a third a fourth and a fifth stealing across the narrow open space and darting into the shelter of the brushwood nineandseventy alleyne counted of these dark figures flitting across the line of the moonlight many bore huge burdens upon their backs though what it was that they carried he could not tell at the distance out of the one wood and into the other they passed all with the same crouching furtive gait until the black bristle of trees had swallowed up the last of them  for a moment alleyne stood in the window still staring down at the silent forest uncertain as to what he should think of these midnight walkers then he bethought him that there was one beside him who was fitter to judge on such a matter his fingers had scarce rested upon aylwards shoulder ere the bowman was on his feet with his hand outstretched to his sword  qui va he cried hola mon petit by my hilt i thought there had been a camisade what then mon gar  come hither by the window aylward said alleyne i have seen fourscore men pass from yonder shaw across the glade and nigh every man of them had a great burden on his back what think you of it  i think nothing of it mon camarade there are as many masterless folk in this country as there are rabbits on cowdray down and there are many who show their faces by night but would dance in a hempen collar if they stirred forth in the day on all the french marches are droves of outcasts reivers spoilers and drawlatches of whom i judge that these are some though i marvel that they should dare to come so nigh to the castle of the seneschal all seems very quiet now he added peering out of the window  they are in the further wood said alleyne  and there they may bide back to rest mon petit for by my hilt each day now will bring its own work yet it would be well to shoot the bolt in yonder door when one is in strange quarters so he threw himself down upon his pallet and in an instant was fast asleep  it might have been about three oclock in the morning when alleyne was aroused from a troubled sleep by a low cry or exclamation he listened but as he heard no more he set it down as the challenge of the guard upon the walls and dropped off to sleep once more a few minutes later he was disturbed by a gentle creaking of his own door as though some one were pushing cautiously against it and immediately afterwards he heard the soft thud of cautious footsteps upon the stair which led to the room above followed by a confused noise and a muffled groan alleyne sat up on his couch with all his nerves in a tingle uncertain whether these sounds might come from a simple causesome sick archer and visiting leech perhapsor whether they might have a more sinister meaning but what danger could threaten them here in this strong castle under the care of famous warriors with high walls and a broad moat around them who was there that could injure them he had wellnigh persuaded himself that his fears were a foolish fancy when his eyes fell upon that which sent the blood cold to his heart and left him gasping with hands clutching at the counterpane  right in front of him was the broad window of the chamber with the moon shining brightly through it for an instant something had obscured the light and now a head was bobbing up and down outside the face looking in at him and swinging slowly from one side of the window to the other even in that dim light there could be no mistaking those features drawn distorted and bloodstained they were still those of the young fellowsquire who had sat so recently upon his own couch with a cry of horror alleyne sprang from his bed and rushed to the casement while the two archers aroused by the sound seized their weapons and stared about them in bewilderment one glance was enough to show edricson that his fears were but too true foully murdered with a score of wounds upon him and a rope round his neck his poor friend had been cast from the upper window and swung slowly in the night wind his body rasping against the wall and his disfigured face upon a level with the casement  my god cried alleyne shaking in every limb what has come upon us what devils deed is this  here is flint and steel said john stolidly the lamp aylward this moonshine softens a mans heart now we may use the eyes which god hath given us  by my hilt cried aylward as the yellow flame flickered up it is indeed young master ford and i think that this seneschal is a black villain who dare not face us in the day but would murther us in our sleep by the twang of string if i do not soak a gooses feather with his hearts blood it will be no fault of samkin aylward of the white company  but aylward think of the men whom i saw yesternight said alleyne it may not be the seneschal it may be that others have come into the castle i must to sir nigel ere it be too late let me go aylward for my place is by his side  one moment mon gar put that steel headpiece on the end of my yewstave so i will put it first through the door for it is ill to come out when you can neither see nor guard yourself now camarades out swords and stand ready hola by my hilt it is time that we were stirring  as he spoke a sudden shouting broke forth in the castle with the scream of a woman and the rush of many feet then came the sharp clink of clashing steel and a roar like that of an angry lionnotre dame du guesclin st ives st ives the bowman pulled back the bolt of the door and thrust out the headpiece at the end of the bow a clash the clatter of the steelcap upon the ground and ere the man who struck could heave up for another blow the archer had passed his sword through his body on camarades on he cried and breaking fiercely past two men who threw themselves in his way he sped down the broad corridor in the direction of the shouting  a sharp turning and then a second one brought them to the head of a short stair from which they looked straight down upon the scene of the uproar a square oakfloored hall lay beneath them from which opened the doors of the principal guestchambers this hall was as light as day for torches burned in numerous sconces upon the walls throwing strange shadows from the tusked or antlered heads which ornamented them at the very foot of the stair close to the open door of their chamber lay the seneschal and his wife she with her head shorn from her shoulders he thrust through with a sharpened stake which still protruded from either side of his body three servants of the castle lay dead beside them all torn and draggled as though a pack of wolves had been upon them in front of the central guestchamber stood du guesclin and sir nigel halfclad and unarmored with the mad joy of battle gleaming in their eyes their heads were thrown back their lips compressed their bloodstained swords poised over their right shoulders and their left feet thrown out three dead men lay huddled together in front of them while a fourth with the blood squirting from a severed vessel lay back with updrawn knees breathing in wheezy gasps further backall panting together like the wind in a treethere stood a group of fierce wild creatures barearmed and barelegged gaunt unshaven with deepset murderous eyes and wild beast faces with their flashing teeth their bristling hair their mad leapings and screamings they seemed to alleyne more like fiends from the pit than men of flesh and blood even as he looked they broke into a hoarse yell and dashed once more upon the two knights hurling themselves madly upon their swordpoints clutching scrambling biting tearing careless of wounds if they could but drag the two soldiers to earth sir nigel was thrown down by the sheer weight of them and sir bertrand with his thunderous warcry was swinging round his heavy sword to clear a space for him to rise when the whistle of two long english arrows and the rush of the squire and the two english archers down the stairs turned the tide of the combat the assailants gave back the knights rushed forward and in a very few moments the hall was cleared and hordle john had hurled the last of the wild men down the steep steps which led from the end of it  do not follow them cried du guesclin we are lost if we scatter for myself i care not a denier though it is a poor thing to meet ones end at the hands of such scum but i have my dear lady here who must by no means be risked we have breathingspace now and i would ask you sir nigel what it is that you would counsel  by st paul answered sir nigel i can by no means understand what hath befallen us save that i have been woken up by your battlecry and rushing forth found myself in the midst of this small bickering harrow and alas for the lady and the seneschal what dogs are they who have done this bloody deed  they are the jacks the men of the brushwood they have the castle though i know not how it hath come to pass look from this window into the bailey  by heaven cried sir nigel it is as bright as day with the torches the gates stand open and there are three thousand of them within the walls see how they rush and scream and wave what is it that they thrust out through the postern door my god it is a manatarms and they pluck him limb from limb like hounds on a wolf now another and yet another they hold the whole castle for i see their faces at the windows see there are some with great bundles on their backs  it is dried wood from the forest they pile them against the walls and set them in a blaze who is this who tries to check them by st ives it is the good priest who spake for them in the hall he kneels he prays he implores what villains would ye raise hands against those who have befriended you ah the butcher has struck him he is down they stamp him under their feet they tear off his gown and wave it in the air see now how the flames lick up the walls are there none left to rally round us with a hundred men we might hold our own  oh for my company cried sir nigel but where is ford alleyne  he is foully murdered my fair lord  the saints receive him may he rest in peace but here come some at last who may give us counsel for amid these passages it is ill to stir without a guide  as he spoke a french squire and the bohemian knight came rushing down the steps the latter bleeding from a slash across his forehead  all is lost he cried the castle is taken and on fire the seneschal is slain and there is nought left for us  on the contrary quoth sir nigel there is much left to us for there is a very honorable contention before us and a fair lady for whom to give our lives there are many ways in which a man might die but none better than this  you can tell us godfrey said du guesclin to the french squire how came these men into the castle and what succors can we count upon by st ives if we come not quickly to some counsel we shall be burned like young rooks in a nest  the squire a dark slender stripling spoke firmly and quickly as one who was trained to swift action there is a passage under the earth into the castle said he and through it some of the jacks made their way casting open the gates for the others they have had help from within the walls and the menatarms were heavy with wine they must have been slain in their beds for these devils crept from room to room with soft step and ready knife sir amory the hospitaller was struck down with an axe as he rushed before us from his sleepingchamber save only ourselves i do not think that there are any left alive  what then would you counsel  that we make for the keep it is unused save in time of war and the key hangs from my poor lord and masters belt  there are two keys there  it is the larger once there we might hold the narrow stair and at least as the walls are of a greater thickness it would be longer ere they could burn them could we but carry the lady across the bailey all might be well with us  nay the lady hath seen something of the work of war said tiphaine coming forth as white as grave and as unmoved as ever i would not be a hamper to you my dear spouse and gallant friend rest assured of this that if all else fail i have always a safeguard heredrawing a small silverhilted poniard from her bosomwhich sets me beyond the fear of these vile and bloodstained wretches  tiphaine cried du guesclin i have always loved you and now by our lady of rennes i love you more than ever did i not know that your hand will be as ready as your words i would myself turn my last blow upon you ere you should fall into their hands lead on godfrey a new golden pyx will shine in the minster of dinan if we come safely through with it  the attention of the insurgents had been drawn away from murder to plunder and all over the castle might be heard their cries and whoops of delight as they dragged forth the rich tapestries the silver flagons and the carved furniture down in the courtyard halfclad wretches their bare limbs all mottled with bloodstains strutted about with plumed helmets upon their heads or with the lady rocheforts silken gowns girt round their loins and trailing on the ground behind them casks of choice wine had been rolled out from the cellars and starving peasants squatted goblet in hand draining off vintages which de rochefort had set aside for noble and royal guests others with slabs of bacon and joints of dried meat upon the ends of their pikes held them up to the blaze or tore at them ravenously with their teeth yet all order had not been lost amongst them for some hundreds of the better armed stood together in a silent group leaning upon their rude weapons and looking up at the fire which had spread so rapidly as to involve one whole side of the castle already alleyne could hear the crackling and roaring of the flames while the air was heavy with heat and full of the pungent whiff of burning wood    chapter xxxi how five men held the keep of villefranche   under the guidance of the french squire the party passed down two narrow corridors the first was empty but at the head of the second stood a peasant sentry who started off at the sight of them yelling loudly to his comrades stop him or we are undone cried du guesclin and had started to run when aylwards great warbow twanged like a harpstring and the man fell forward upon his face with twitching limbs and clutching fingers within five paces of where he lay a narrow and littleused door led out into the bailey from beyond it came such a babel of hooting and screaming horrible oaths and yet more horrible laughter that the stoutest heart might have shrunk from casting down the frail barrier which faced them  make straight for the keep said du guesclin in a sharp stern whisper the two archers in front the lady in the centre a squire on either side while we three knights shall bide behind and beat back those who press upon us so now open the door and god have us in his holy keeping  for a few moments it seemed that their object would be attained without danger so swift and so silent had been their movements they were halfway across the bailey ere the frantic howling peasants made a movement to stop them the few who threw themselves in their way were overpowered or brushed aside while the pursuers were beaten back by the ready weapons of the three cavaliers unscathed they fought their way to the door of the keep and faced round upon the swarming mob while the squire thrust the great key into the lock  my god he cried it is the wrong key  the wrong key  dolt fool that i am this is the key of the castle gate the other opens the keep i must back for it he turned with some wild intention of retracing his steps but at the instant a great jagged rock hurled by a brawny peasant struck him full upon the ear and he dropped senseless to the ground  this is key enough for me quoth hordle john picking up the huge stone and hurling it against the door with all the strength of his enormous body the lock shivered the wood smashed the stone flew into five pieces but the iron clamps still held the door in its position bending down he thrust his great fingers under it and with a heave raised the whole mass of wood and iron from its hinges for a moment it tottered and swayed and then falling outward buried him in its ruin while his comrades rushed into the dark archway which led to safety  up the steps tiphaine cried du guesclin now round friends and beat them back the mob of peasants had surged in upon their heels but the two trustiest blades in europe gleamed upon that narrow stair and four of their number dropped upon the threshold the others gave back and gathered in a half circle round the open door gnashing their teeth and shaking their clenched hands at the defenders the body of the french squire had been dragged out by them and hacked to pieces three or four others had pulled john from under the door when he suddenly bounded to his feet and clutching one in either hand dashed them together with such force that they fell senseless across each other upon the ground with a kick and a blow he freed himself from two others who clung to him and in a moment he was within the portal with his comrades  yet their position was a desperate one the peasants from far and near had been assembled for this deed of vengeance and not less than six thousand were within or around the walls of the chateau of villefranche ill armed and half starved they were still desperate men to whom danger had lost all fears for what was death that they should shun it to cling to such a life as theirs the castle was theirs and the roaring flames were spurting through the windows and flickering high above the turrets on two sides of the quadrangle from either side they were sweeping down from room to room and from bastion to bastion in the direction of the keep faced by an army and girt in by fire were six men and one woman but some of them were men so trained to danger and so wise in war that even now the combat was less unequal than it seemed courage and resource were penned in by desperation and numbers while the great yellow sheets of flame threw their lurid glare over the scene of death  there is but space for two upon a step to give free play to our swordarms said du guesclin do you stand with me nigel upon the lowest france and england will fight together this night sir otto i pray you to stand behind us with this young squire the archers may go higher yet and shoot over our heads i would that we had our harness nigel  often have i heard my dear sir john chandos say that a knight should never even when a guest be parted from it yet it will be more honor to us if we come well out of it we have a vantage since we see them against the light and they can scarce see us it seems to me that they muster for an onslaught  if we can but keep them in play said the bohemian it is likely that these flames may bring us succor if there be any true men in the country  bethink you my fair lord said alleyne to sir nigel that we have never injured these men nor have we cause of quarrel against them would it not be well if but for the ladys sake to speak them fair and see if we may not come to honorable terms with them  not so by st paul cried sir nigel it does not accord with mine honor nor shall it ever be said that i a knight of england was ready to hold parley with men who have slain a fair lady and a holy priest  as well hold parley with a pack of ravening wolves said the french captain ha notre dame du guesclin saint ives saint ives  as he thundered forth his warcry the jacks who had been gathering before the black arch of the gateway rushed in madly in a desperate effort to carry the staircase their leaders were a small man dark in the face with his beard done up in two plaits and another larger man very bowed in the shoulders with a huge club studded with sharp nails in his hand the first had not taken three steps ere an arrow from aylwards bow struck him full in the chest and he fell coughing and spluttering across the threshold the other rushed onwards and breaking between du guesclin and sir nigel he dashed out the brains of the bohemian with a single blow of his clumsy weapon with three swords through him he still struggled on and had almost won his way through them ere he fell dead upon the stair close at his heels came a hundred furious peasants who flung themselves again and again against the five swords which confronted them it was cut and parry and stab as quick as eye could see or hand act the door was piled with bodies and the stone floor was slippery with blood the deep shout of du guesclin the hard hissing breath of the pressing multitude the clatter of steel the thud of falling bodies and the screams of the stricken made up such a medley as came often in after years to break upon alleynes sleep slowly and sullenly at last the throng drew off with many a fierce backward glance while eleven of their number lay huddled in front of the stair which they had failed to win  the dogs have had enough said du guesclin  by saint paul there appear to be some very worthy and valiant persons among them observed sir nigel they are men from whom had they been of better birth much honor and advancement might be gained even as it is it is a great pleasure to have seen them but what is this that they are bringing forward  it is as i feared growled du guesclin they will burn us out since they cannot win their way past us shoot straight and hard archers for by st ives our good swords are of little use to us  as he spoke a dozen men rushed forward each screening himself behind a huge fardel of brushwood hurling their burdens in one vast heap within the portal they threw burning torches upon the top of it the wood had been soaked in oil for in an instant it was ablaze and a long hissing yellow flame licked over the heads of the defenders and drove them further up to the first floor of the keep they had scarce reached it however ere they found that the wooden joists and planks of the flooring were already on fire dry and wormeaten a spark upon them became a smoulder and a smoulder a blaze a choking smoke filled the air and the five could scarce grope their way to the staircase which led up to the very summit of the square tower  strange was the scene which met their eyes from this eminence beneath them on every side stretched the long sweep of peaceful country rolling plain and tangled wood all softened and mellowed in the silver moonshine no light nor movement nor any sign of human aid could be seen but far away the hoarse clangor of a heavy bell rose and fell upon the wintry air beneath and around them blazed the huge fire roaring and crackling on every side of the bailey and even as they looked the two corner turrets fell in with a deafening crash and the whole castle was but a shapeless mass spouting flames and smoke from every window and embrasure the great black tower upon which they stood rose like a last island of refuge amid this sea of fire but the ominous crackling and roaring below showed that it would not be long ere it was engulfed also in the common ruin at their very feet was the square courtyard crowded with the howling and dancing peasants their fierce faces upturned their clenched hands waving all drunk with bloodshed and with vengeance a yell of execration and a scream of hideous laughter burst from the vast throng as they saw the faces of the last survivors of their enemies peering down at them from the height of the keep they still piled the brushwood round the base of the tower and gambolled hand in hand around the blaze screaming out the doggerel lines which had long been the watchword of the jacquerie          cessez cessez gens darmes et pietons         de piller et manger le bonhomme         qui de longtemps jacques bonhomme           se nomme  their thin shrill voices rose high above the roar of the flames and the crash of the masonry like the yelping of a pack of wolves who see their quarry before them and know that they have wellnigh run him down  by my hilt said aylward to john it is in my mind that we shall not see spain this journey it is a great joy to me that i have placed my featherbed and other things of price with that worthy woman at lyndhurst who will now have the use of them i have thirteen arrows yet and if one of them fly unfleshed then by the twang of string i shall deserve my doom first at him who flaunts with my ladys silken frock clap in the clout by god though a handsbreadth lower than i had meant now for the rogue with the head upon his pike ha to the inch john when my eye is true i am better at rovers than at longbutts or hoyles a good shoot for you also john the villain hath fallen forward into the fire but i pray you john to loose gently and not to pluck with the drawinghand for it is a trick that hath marred many a fine bowman  whilst the two archers were keeping up a brisk fire upon the mob beneath them du guesclin and his lady were consulting with sir nigel upon their desperate situation  tis a strange end for one who has seen so many stricken fields said the french chieftain for me one death is as another but it is the thought of my sweet lady which goes to my heart  nay bertrand i fear it as little as you said she had i my dearest wish it would be that we should go together  well answered fair lady cried sir nigel and very sure i am that my own sweet wife would have said the same if the end be now come i have had great good fortune in having lived in times when so much glory was to be won and in knowing so many valiant gentlemen and knights but why do you pluck my sleeve alleyne  if it please you my fair lord there are in this corner two great tubes of iron with many heavy balls which may perchance be those bombards and shot of which i have heard  by saint ives it is true cried sir bertrand striding across to the recess where the ungainly funnelshaped thickribbed engines were standing bombards they are and of good size we may shoot down upon them  shoot with them quotha cried aylward in high disdain for pressing danger is the great leveller of classes how is a man to take aim with these fools toys and how can he hope to do scath with them  i will show you answered sir nigel for here is the great box of powder and if you will raise it for me john i will show you how it may be used come hither where the folk are thickest round the fire now aylward crane thy neck and see what would have been deemed an old wifes tale when we first turned our faces to the wars throw back the lid john and drop the box into the fire  a deafening roar a fluff of bluish light and the great square tower rocked and trembled from its very foundations swaying this way and that like a reed in the wind amazed and dizzy the defenders clutching at the cracking parapets for support saw great stones burning beams of wood and mangled bodies hurtling past them through the air when they staggered to their feet once more the whole keep had settled down upon one side so that they could scarce keep their footing upon the sloping platform gazing over the edge they looked down upon the horrible destruction which had been caused by the explosion for forty yards round the portal the ground was black with writhing screaming figures who struggled up and hurled themselves down again tossing this way and that sightless scorched with fire bursting from their tattered clothing beyond this circle of death their comrades bewildered and amazed cowered away from this black tower and from these invincible men who were most to be dreaded when hope was furthest from their hearts  a sally du guesclin a sally cried sir nigel by saint paul they are in two minds and a bold rush may turn them he drew his sword as he spoke and darted down the winding stairs closely followed by his four comrades ere he was at the first floor however he threw up his arms and stopped mon dieu he said we are lost men  what then cried those behind him  the wail hath fallen in the stair is blocked and the fire still rages below by saint paul friends we have fought a very honorable fight and may say in all humbleness that we have done our devoir but i think that we may now go back to the lady tiphaine and say our orisons for we have played our parts in this world and it is time that we made ready for another  the narrow pass was blocked by huge stones littered in wild confusion over each other with the blue choking smoke reeking up through the crevices the explosion had blown in the wall and cut off the only path by which they could descend pent in a hundred feet from earth with a furnace raging under them and a ravening multitude all round who thirsted for their blood it seemed indeed as though no men had ever come through such peril with their lives slowly they made their way back to the summit but as they came out upon it the lady tiphaine darted forward and caught her husband by the wrist  bertrand said she hush and listen i have heard the voices of men all singing together in a strange tongue  breathless they stood and silent but no sound came up to them save the roar of the flames and the clamor of their enemies  it cannot be lady said du guesclin this night hath over wrought you and your senses play you false what men ere there in this country who would sing in a strange tongue  hola yelled aylward leaping suddenly into the air with waving hands and joyous face i thought i heard it ere we went down and now i hear it again we are saved comrades by these ten fingerbones we are saved it is the marching song of the white company hush  with upraised forefinger and slanting head he stood listening suddenly there came swelling up a deepvoiced rollicking chorus from somewhere out of the darkness never did choice or dainty ditty of provence or languedoc sound more sweetly in the ears than did the roughtongued saxon to the six who strained their ears from the blazing keep          well drink all together         to the gray goose feather           and the land where the gray goose flew  ha by my hilt shouted aylward it is the dear old bow song of the company here come two hundred as tight lads as ever twirled a shaft over their thumbnails hark to the dogs how lustily they sing  nearer and clearer swelling up out of the night came the gay marching lilt          what of the bow            the bow was made in england         of true wood of yew wood            the wood of english bows         for men who are free         love the old yewtree            and the land where the yew tree grows          what of the men            the men were bred in england         the bowmen the yeomen            the lads of the dale and fell         heres to you and to you         to the hearts that are true            and the land where the true hearts dwell  they sing very joyfully said du guesclin as though they were going to a festival  it is their wont when there is work to be done  by saint paul quoth sir nigel it is in my mind that they come too late for i cannot see how we are to come down from this tower  there they come the hearts of gold cried aylward see they move out from the shadow now they cross the meadow they are on the further side of the moat hola camarades hola johnston eccles cooke harward bligh would ye see a fair lady and two gallant knights done foully to death  who is there shouted a deep voice from below who is this who speaks with an english tongue  it is i old lad it is sam aylward of the company and here is your captain sir nigel loring and four others all laid out to be grilled like an easterlings herrings  curse me if i did not think that it was the style of speech of old samkin aylward said the voice amid a buzz from the ranks wherever there are knocks going there is sammy in the heart of it but who are these illfaced rogues who block the path to your kennels canaille what you dare look us in the eyes out swords lads and give them the flat of them waste not your shafts upon such runagate knaves  there was little fight left in the peasants however still dazed by the explosion amazed at their own losses and disheartened by the arrival of the disciplined archers in a very few minutes they were in full flight for their brushwood homes leaving the morning sun to rise upon a blackened and bloodstained ruin where it had left the night before the magnificent castle of the seneschal of auvergne already the white lines in the east were deepening into pink as the archers gathered round the keep and took counsel how to rescue the survivors  had we a rope said alleyne there is one side which is not yet on fire down which we might slip  but how to get a rope  it is an old trick quoth aylward hola johnston cast me up a rope even as you did at maupertuis in the war time  the grizzled archer thus addressed took several lengths of rope from his comrades and knotting them firmly together he stretched them out in the long shadow which the rising sun threw from the frowning keep then he fixed the yewstave of his bow upon end and measured the long thin black line which it threw upon the turf  a sixfoot stave throws a twelvefoot shadow he muttered the keep throws a shadow of sixty paces thirty paces of rope will be enow and to spare another strand watkin now pull at the end that all may be safe so it is ready for them  but how are they to reach it asked the young archer beside him  watch and see young foolshead growled the old bowman he took a long string from his pouch and fastened one end to an arrow  all ready samkin  ready camarade  close to your hand then with an easy pull he sent the shaft flickering gently up falling upon the stonework within a foot of where aylward was standing the other end was secured to the rope so that in a minute a good strong cord was dangling from the only sound side of the blazing and shattered tower the lady tiphaine was lowered with a noose drawn fast under the arms and the other five slid swiftly down amid the cheers and joyous outcry of their rescuers    chapter xxxii how the company took counsel round the fallen tree   where is sir claude latour asked sir nigel as his feet touched ground  he is in camp near montpezat two hours march from here my fair lord said johnston the grizzled bowman who commanded the archers  then we shall march thither for i would fain have you all back at dax in time to be in the princes vanguard  my lord cried alleyne joyfully here are our chargers in the field and i see your harness amid the plunder which these rogues have left behind them  by saint ives you speak sooth young squire said du guesclin there is my horse and my ladys jennet the knaves led them from the stables but fled without them now nigel it is great joy to me to have seen one of whom i have often heard yet we must leave you now for i must be with the king of spain ere your army crosses the mountains  i had thought that you were in spain with the valiant henry of trastamare  i have been there but i came to france to raise succor for him i shall ride back nigel with four thousand of the best lances of france at my back so that your prince may find he hath a task which is worthy of him god be with you friend and may we meet again in better times  i do not think said sir nigel as he stood by alleynes side looking after the french knight and his lady that in all christendom you will meet with a more stouthearted man or a fairer and sweeter dame but your face is pale and sad alleyne have you perchance met with some hurt during the ruffle  nay my fair lord i was but thinking of my friend ford and how he sat upon my couch no later than yesternight  sir nigel shook his head sadly two brave squires have i lost said he i know not why the young shoots should be plucked and an old weed left standing yet certes there must be come good reason since god hath so planned it did you not note alleyne that the lady tiphaine did give us warning last night that danger was coming upon us  she did my lord  by saint paul my mind misgives me as to what she saw at twynham castle and yet i cannot think that any scottish or french rovers could land in such force as to beleaguer the fortalice call the company together aylward and let us on for it will be shame to us if we are not at dax upon the trysting day  the archers had spread themselves over the ruins but a blast upon a bugle brought them all back to muster with such booty as they could bear with them stuffed into their pouches or slung over their shoulders as they formed into ranks each man dropping silently into his place sir nigel ran a questioning eye over them and a smile of pleasure played over his face tall and sinewy and brown cleareyed hardfeatured with the stern and prompt bearing of experienced soldiers it would be hard indeed for a leader to seek for a choicer following here and there in the ranks were old soldiers of the french wars grizzled and lean with fierce puckered features and shaggy bristling brows the most however were young and dandy archers with fresh english faces their beards combed out their hair curling from under their close steel hufkens with gold or jewelled earrings gleaming in their ears while their goldspangled baldrics their silken belts and the chains which many of them wore round their thick brown necks all spoke of the brave times which they had had as free companions each had a yew or hazel stave slung over his shoulder plain and serviceable with the older men but gaudily painted and carved at either end with the others steel caps mail brigandines white surcoats with the red lion of st george and sword or battleaxe swinging from their belts completed this equipment while in some cases the murderous maule or fivefoot mallet was hung across the bowstave being fastened to their leathern shoulderbelt by a hook in the centre of the handle sir nigels heart beat high as he looked upon their free bearing and fearless faces  for two hours they marched through forest and marshland along the left bank of the river aveyron sir nigel riding behind his company with alleyne at his right hand and johnston the old master bowman walking by his left stirrup ere they had reached their journeys end the knight had learned all that he would know of his men their doings and their intentions once as they marched they saw upon the further bank of the river a body of french menatarms riding very swiftly in the direction of villefranche  it is the seneschal of toulouse with his following said johnston shading his eyes with his hand had he been on this side of the water he might have attempted something upon us  i think that it would be well that we should cross said sir nigel it were pity to balk this worthy seneschal should he desire to try some small feat of arms  nay there is no ford nearer than tourville answered the old archer he is on his way to villefranche and short will be the shrift of any jacks who come into his hands for he is a man of short speech it was he and the seneschal of beaucaire who hung peter wilkins of the company last lammastide for which by the black rood of waltham they shall hang themselves if ever they come into our power but here are our comrades sir nigel and here is our camp  as he spoke the forest pathway along which they marched opened out into a green glade which sloped down towards the river high leafless trees girt it in on three sides with a thick undergrowth of holly between their trunks at the farther end of this forest clearing there stood forty or fifty huts built very neatly from wood and clay with the blue smoke curling out from the roofs a dozen tethered horses and mules grazed around the encampment while a number of archers lounged about some shooting at marks while others built up great wooden fires in the open and hung their cooking kettles above them at the sight of their returning comrades there was a shout of welcome and a horseman who had been exercising his charger behind the camp came cantering down to them he was a dapper brisk man very richly clad with a round cleanshaven face and very bright black eyes which danced and sparkled with excitement  sir nigel he cried sir nigel loring at last by my soul we have awaited you this month past right welcome sir nigel you have had my letter  it was that which brought me here said sir nigel but indeed sir claude latour it is a great wonder to me that you did not yourself lead these bowmen for surely they could have found no better leader  none none by the virgin of lesparre he cried speaking in the strange thick gascon speech which turns every v into a b but you know what these islanders of yours are sir nigel they will not be led by any save their own blood and race there is no persuading them not even i claude latour seigneur of montchateau master of the high justice the middle and the low could gain their favor they must needs hold a council and put their two hundred thick heads together and then there comes this fellow aylward and another as their spokesmen to say that they will disband unless an englishman of good name be set over them there are many of them as i understand who come from some great forest which lies in hampi or hamptii cannot lay my tongue to the name your dwelling is in those parts and so their thoughts turned to you as their leader but we had hoped that you would bring a hundred men with you  they are already at dax where we shall join them said sir nigel but let the men break their fast and we shall then take counsel what to do  come into my hut said sir claude it is but poor fare that i can lay before youmilk cheese wine and baconyet your squire and yourself will doubtless excuse it this is my house where the pennon flies before the doora small residence to contain the lord of montchateau  sir nigel sat silent and distrait at his meal while alleyne hearkened to the clattering tongue of the gascon and to his talk of the glories of his own estate his successes in love and his triumphs in war  and now that you are here sir nigel he said at last i have many fine ventures all ready for us i have heard that montpezat is of no great strength and that there are two hundred thousand crowns in the castle at castelnau also there is a cobbler who is in my pay and who will throw us a rope any dark night from his house by the town wall i promise you that you shall thrust your arms elbowdeep among good silver pieces ere the nights are moonless again for on every hand of us are fair women rich wine and good plunder as much as heart could wish  i have other plans answered sir nigel curtly for i have come hither to lead these bowmen to the help of the prince our master who may have sore need of them ere he set pedro upon the throne of spain it is my purpose to start this very day for dax upon the adour where he hath now pitched his camp  the face of the gascon darkened and his eyes flashed with resentment for me he said i care little for this war and i find the life which i lead a very joyous and pleasant one i will not go to dax  nay think again sir claude said sir nigel gently for you have ever had the name of a true and loyal knight surely you will not hold back now when your master hath need of you  i will not go to dax the other shouted  but your devoiryour oath of fealty  i say that i will not go  then sir claude i must lead the company without you  if they will follow cried the gascon with a sneer these are not hired slaves but free companions who will do nothing save by their own good wills in very sooth my lord loring they are ill men to trifle with and it were easier to pluck a bone from a hungry bear than to lead a bowman out of a land of plenty and of pleasure  then i pray you to gather them together said sir nigel and i will tell them what is in my mind for if i am their leader they must to dax and if i am not then i know not what i am doing in auvergne have my horse ready alleyne for by st paul come what may i must be upon the homeward road ere midday  a blast upon the bugle summoned the bowmen to counsel and they gathered in little knots and groups around a great fallen tree which lay athwart the glade sir nigel sprang lightly upon the trunk and stood with blinking eye and firm lips looking down at the ring of upturned warlike faces  they tell me bowmen said he that ye have grown so fond of ease and plunder and high living that ye are not to be moved from this pleasant country but by saint paul i will believe no such thing of you for i can readily see that you are all very valiant men who would scorn to live here in peace when your prince hath so great a venture before him ye have chosen me as a leader and a leader i will be if ye come with me to spain and i vow to you that my pennon of the five roses shall if god give me strength and life be ever where there is most honor to be gained but if it be your wish to loll and loiter in these glades bartering glory and renown for vile gold and illgotten riches then ye must find another leader for i have lived in honor and in honor i trust that i shall die if there be forest men or hampshire men amongst ye i call upon them to say whether they will follow the banner of loring  heres a romsey man for you cried a young bowman with a sprig of evergreen set in his helmet  and a lad from alresford shouted another  and from milton  and from burley  and from lymington  and a little one from brockenhurst shouted a hugelimbed fellow who sprawled beneath a tree  by my hilt lads cried aylward jumping upon the fallen trunk i think that we could not look the girls in the eyes if we let the prince cross the mountains and did not pull string to clear a path for him it is very well in time of peace to lead such a life as we have had together but now the warbanner is in the wind once more and by these ten fingerbones if he go alone old samkin aylward will walk beside it  these words from a man as popular as aylward decided many of the waverers and a shout of approval burst from his audience  far be it from me said sir claude latour suavely to persuade you against this worthy archer or against sir nigel loring yet we have been together in many ventures and perchance it may not be amiss if i say to you what i think upon the matter  peace for the little gascon cried the archers let every man have his word shoot straight for the mark lad and fair play for all  bethink you then said sir claude that you go under a hard rule with neither freedom nor pleasureand for what for sixpence a day at the most while now you may walk across the country and stretch out either hand to gather in whatever you have a mind for what do we not hear of our comrades who have gone with sir john hawkwood to italy in one night they have held to ransom six hundred of the richest noblemen of mantua they camp before a great city and the base burghers come forth with the keys and then they make great spoil or if it please them better they take so many horseloads of silver as a composition and so they journey on from state to state rich and free and feared by all now is not that the proper life for a soldier  the proper life for a robber roared hordle john in his thundering voice  and yet there is much in what the gascon says said a swarthy fellow in a weatherstained doublet and i for one would rather prosper in italy than starve in spain  you were always a cur and a traitor mark shaw cried aylward by my hilt if you will stand forth and draw your sword i will warrant you that you will see neither one nor the other  nay aylward said sir nigel we cannot mend the matter by broiling sir claude i think that what you have said does you little honor and if my words aggrieve you i am ever ready to go deeper into the matter with you but you shall have such men as will follow you and you may go where you will so that you come not with us let all who love their prince and country stand fast while those who think more of a welllined purse step forth upon the farther side  thirteen bowmen with hung heads and sheepish faces stepped forward with mark shaw and ranged themselves behind sir claude amid the hootings and hissings of their comrades they marched off together to the gascons hut while the main body broke up their meeting and set cheerily to work packing their possessions furbishing their weapons and preparing for the march which lay before them over the tarn and the garonne through the vast quagmires of armagnac past the swiftflowing losse and so down the long valley of the adour there was many a long league to be crossed ere they could join themselves to that dark warcloud which was drifting slowly southwards to the line of the snowy peaks beyond which the banner of england had never yet been seen    chapter xxxiii how the army made the passage of roncesvalles   the whole vast plain of gascony and of languedoc is an arid and profitless expanse in winter save where the swiftflowing adour and her snowfed tributaries the louts the oloron and the pau run down to the sea of biscay south of the adour the jagged line of mountains which fringe the skyline send out long granite claws running down into the lowlands and dividing them into gaves or stretches of valley hillocks grow into hills and hills into mountains each range overlying its neighbor until they soar up in the giant chain which raises its spotless and untrodden peaks white and dazzling against the pale blue wintry sky  a quiet land is thisa land where the slowmoving basque with his flat birettacap his red sash and his hempen sandals tills his scanty farm or drives his lean flock to their hillside pastures it is the country of the wolf and the isard of the brown bear and the mountaingoat a land of bare rock and of rushing water yet here it was that the will of a great prince had now assembled a gallant army so that from the adour to the passes of navarre the barren valleys and windswept wastes were populous with soldiers and loud with the shouting of orders and the neighing of horses for the banners of war had been flung to the wind once more and over those glistening peaks was the highway along which honor pointed in an age when men had chosen her as their guide  and now all was ready for the enterprise from dax to st jean piedduport the country was mottled with the white tents of gascons aquitanians and english all eager for the advance from all sides the free companions had trooped in until not less than twelve thousand of these veteran troops were cantoned along the frontiers of navarre from england had arrived the princes brother the duke of lancaster with four hundred knights in his train and a strong company of archers above all an heir to the throne had been born in bordeaux and the prince might leave his spouse with an easy mind for all was well with mother and with child  the keys of the mountain passes still lay in the hands of the shifty and ignoble charles of navarre who had chaffered and bargained both with the english and with the spanish taking money from the one side to hold them open and from the other to keep them sealed the mallet hand of edward however had shattered all the schemes and wiles of the plotter neither entreaty nor courtly remonstrance came from the english prince but sir hugh calverley passed silently over the border with his company and the blazing walls of the two cities of miranda and puenta de la reyna warned the unfaithful monarch that there were other metals besides gold and that he was dealing with a man to whom it was unsafe to lie his price was paid his objections silenced and the mountain gorges lay open to the invaders from the feast of the epiphany there was mustering and massing until in the first week of februarythree days after the white company joined the armythe word was given for a general advance through the defile of roncesvalles at five in the cold winters morning the bugles were blowing in the hamlet of st jean piedduport and by six sir nigels company three hundred strong were on their way for the defile pushing swiftly in the dim light up the steep curving road for it was the princes order that they should be the first to pass through and that they should remain on guard at the further end until the whole army had emerged from the mountains day was already breaking in the east and the summits of the great peaks had turned rosy red while the valleys still lay in the shadow when they found themselves with the cliffs on either hand and the long rugged pass stretching away before them  sir nigel rode his great black warhorse at the head of his archers dressed in full armor with black simon bearing his banner behind him while alleyne at his bridlearm carried his blazoned shield and his wellsteeled ashen spear a proud and happy man was the knight and many a time he turned in his saddle to look at the long column of bowmen who swung swiftly along behind him  by saint paul alleyne said he this pass is a very perilous place and i would that the king of navarre had held it against us for it would have been a very honorable venture had it fallen to us to win a passage i have heard the minstrels sing of one sir roland who was slain by the infidels in these very parts  if it please you my fair lord said black simon i know something of these parts for i have twice served a term with the king of navarre there is a hospice of monks yonder where you may see the roof among the trees and there it was that sir roland was slain the village upon the left is orbaiceta and i know a house therein where the right wine of jurancon is to be bought if it would please you to quaff a morning cup  there is smoke yonder upon the right  that is a village named les aldudes and i know a hostel there also where the wine is of the best it is said that the innkeeper hath a buried treasure and i doubt not my fair lord that if you grant me leave i could prevail upon him to tell us where he hath hid it  nay nay simon said sir nigel curtly i pray you to forget these free companion tricks ha edricson i see that you stare about you and in good sooth these mountains must seem wondrous indeed to one who hath but seen butser or the portsdown hill  the broken and rugged road had wound along the crests of low hills with wooded ridges on either side of it over which peeped the loftier mountains the distant peak of the south and the vast altabisca which towered high above them and cast its black shadow from left to right across the valley from where they now stood they could look forward down a long vista of beech woods and jagged rockstrewn wilderness all white with snow to where the pass opened out upon the uplands beyond behind them they could still catch a glimpse of the gray plains of gascony and could see her rivers gleaming like coils of silver in the sunshine as far as eye could see from among the rocky gorges and the bristles of the pine woods there came the quick twinkle and glitter of steel while the wind brought with it sudden distant bursts of martial music from the great host which rolled by every road and bypath towards the narrow pass of roncesvalles on the cliffs on either side might also be seen the flash of arms and the waving of pennons where the force of navarre looked down upon the army of strangers who passed through their territories  by saint paul said sir nigel blinking up at them i think that we have much to hope for from these cavaliers for they cluster very thickly upon our flanks pass word to the men aylward that they unsling their bows for i have no doubt that there are some very worthy gentlemen yonder who may give us some opportunity for honorable advancement  i hear that the prince hath the king of navarre as hostage said alleyne and it is said that he hath sworn to put him to death if there be any attack upon us  it was not so that war was made when good king edward first turned his hand to it said sir nigel sadly ah alleyne i fear that you will never live to see such things for the minds of men are more set upon money and gain than of old by saint paul it was a noble sight when two great armies would draw together upon a certain day and all who had a vow would ride forth to discharge themselves of it what noble spearrunnings have i not seen and even in an humble way had a part in when cavaliers would run a course for the easing of their souls and for the love of their ladies never a bad word have i for the french for though i have ridden twenty times up to their array i have never yet failed to find some very gentle and worthy knight or squire who was willing to do what he might to enable me to attempt some small feat of arms then when all cavaliers had been satisfied the two armies would come to handstrokes and fight right merrily until one or other had the vantage by saint paul it was not our wont in those days to pay gold for the opening of passes nor would we hold a king as hostage lest his people come to thrusts with us in good sooth if the war is to be carried out in such a fashion then it is grief to me that i ever came away from castle twynham for i would not have left my sweet lady had i not thought that there were deeds of arms to be done  but surely my fair lord said alleyne you have done some great feats of arms since we left the lady loring  i cannot call any to mind answered sir nigel  there was the taking of the searovers and the holding of the keep against the jacks  nay nay said the knight these were not feats of arms but mere wayside ventures and the chances of travel by saint paul if it were not that these hills are oversteep for pommers i would ride to these cavaliers of navarre and see if there were not some among them who would help me to take this patch from mine eye it is a sad sight to see this very fine pass which my own company here could hold against an army and yet to ride through it with as little profit as though it were the lane from my kennels to the avon  all morning sir nigel rode in a very illhumor with his company tramping behind him it was a toilsome march over broken ground and through snow which came often as high as the knee yet ere the sun had begun to sink they had reached the spot where the gorge opens out on to the uplands of navarre and could see the towers of pampeluna jutting up against the southern skyline here the company were quartered in a scattered mountain hamlet and alleyne spent the day looking down upon the swarming army which poured with gleam of spears and flaunt of standards through the narrow pass  hola mon gar said aylward seating himself upon a boulder by his side this is indeed a fine sight upon which it is good to look and a man might go far ere he would see so many brave men and fine horses by my hilt our little lord is wroth because we have come peacefully through the passes but i will warrant him that we have fighting enow ere we turn our faces northward again it is said that there are fourscore thousand men behind the king of spain with du guesclin and all the best lances of france who have sworn to shed their hearts blood ere this pedro come again to the throne  yet our own army is a great one said alleyne  nay there are but sevenandtwenty thousand men chandos hath persuaded the prince to leave many behind and indeed i think that he is right for there is little food and less water in these parts for which we are bound a man without his meat or a horse without his fodder is like a wet bowstring fit for little but voila mon petit here comes chandos and his company and there is many a pensil and banderole among yonder squadrons which show that the best blood of england is riding under his banners  whilst aylward had been speaking a strong column of archers had defiled through the pass beneath them they were followed by a bannerbearer who held high the scarlet wedge upon a silver field which proclaimed the presence of the famous warrior he rode himself within a spearslength of his standard clad from neck to foot in steel but draped in the long linen gown or parement which was destined to be the cause of his death his plumed helmet was carried behind him by his bodysquire and his head was covered by a small purple cap from under which his snowwhite hair curled downwards to his shoulders with his long beaklike nose and his single gleaming eye which shone brightly from under a thick tuft of grizzled brow he seemed to alleyne to have something of the look of some fierce old bird of prey for a moment he smiled as his eye lit upon the banner of the five roses waving from the hamlet but his course lay for pampeluna and he rode on after the archers  close at his heels came sixteen squires all chosen from the highest families and behind them rode twelve hundred english knights with gleam of steel and tossing of plumes their harness jingling their long straight swords clanking against their stirrupirons and the beat of their chargers hoofs like the low deep roar of the sea upon the shore behind them marched six hundred cheshire and lancashire archers bearing the badge of the audleys followed by the famous lord audley himself with the four valiant squires dutton of dutton delves of doddington fowlehurst of crewe and hawkestone of wainehill who had all won such glory at poictiers two hundred heavilyarmed cavalry rode behind the audley standard while close at their heels came the duke of lancaster with a glittering train heralds tabarded with the royal arms riding three deep upon creamcolored chargers in front of him on either side of the young prince rode the two seneschals of aquitaine sir guiscard dangle and sir stephen cossington the one bearing the banner of the province and the other that of saint george away behind him as far as eye could reach rolled the farstretching unbroken river of steelrank after rank and column after column with waving of plumes glitter of arms tossing of guidons and flash and flutter of countless armorial devices all day alleyne looked down upon the changing scene and all day the old bowman stood by his elbow pointing out the crests of famous warriors and the arms of noble houses here were the gold mullets of the pakingtons the sable and ermine of the mackworths the scarlet bars of the wakes the gold and blue of the grosvenors the cinquefoils of the cliftons the annulets of the musgraves the silver pinions of the beauchamps the crosses of the molineaux the bloody chevron of the woodhouses the red and silver of the worsleys the swords of the clarks the boarsheads of the lucies the crescents of the boyntons and the wolf and dagger of the lipscombs so through the sunny winter day the chivalry of england poured down through the dark pass of roncesvalles to the plains of spain  it was on a monday that the duke of lancasters division passed safely through the pyrenees on the tuesday there was a bitter frost and the ground rung like iron beneath the feet of the horses yet ere evening the prince himself with the main battle of his army had passed the gorge and united with his vanguard at pampeluna with him rode the king of majorca the hostage king of navarre and the fierce don pedro of spain whose pale blue eyes gleamed with a sinister light as they rested once more upon the distant peaks of the land which had disowned him under the royal banners rode many a bold gascon baron and many a hotblooded islander here were the high stewards of aquitaine of saintonge of la rochelle of quercy of limousin of agenois of poitou and of bigorre with the banners and musters of their provinces here also were the valiant earl of angus sir thomas banaster with his garter over his greave sir nele loring second cousin to sir nigel and a long column of welsh footmen who marched under the red banner of merlin from dawn to sundown the long train wound through the pass their breath reeking up upon the frosty air like the steam from a cauldron  the weather was less keen upon the wednesday and the rearguard made good their passage with the bombards and the wagontrain free companions and gascons made up this portion of the army to the number of ten thousand men the fierce sir hugh calverley with his yellow mane and the rugged sir robert knolles with their warhardened and veteran companies of english bowmen headed the long column while behind them came the turbulent bands of the bastard of breteuil nandon de bagerant oneeyed camus black ortingo la nuit and others whose very names seem to smack of hard hands and ruthless deeds with them also were the pick of the gascon chivalrythe old duc darmagnac his nephew lord dalbret brooding and scowling over his wrongs the giant oliver de clisson the captal de buch pink of knighthood the sprightly sir perducas dalbret the redbearded lord desparre and a long train of needy and grasping border nobles with long pedigrees and short purses who had come down from their hillside strongholds all hungering for the spoils and the ransoms of spain by the thursday morning the whole army was encamped in the vale of pampeluna and the prince had called his council to meet him in the old palace of the ancient city of navarre    chapter xxxiv how the company made sport in the vale of pampeluna   whilst the council was sitting in pampeluna the white company having encamped in a neighboring valley close to the companies of la nuit and of black ortingo were amusing themselves with swordplay wrestling and shooting at the shields which they had placed upon the hillside to serve them as butts the younger archers with their coats of mail thrown aside their brown or flaxen hair tossing in the wind and their jerkins turned back to give free play to their brawny chests and arms stood in lines each loosing his shaft in turn while johnston aylward black simon and halfascore of the elders lounged up and down with critical eyes and a word of rough praise or of curt censure for the marksmen behind stood knots of gascon and brabant crossbowmen from the companies of ortingo and of la nuit leaning upon their unsightly weapons and watching the practice of the englishmen  a good shot hewett a good shot said old johnston to a young bowman who stood with his bow in his left hand gazing with parted lips after his flying shaft you see she finds the ring as i knew she would from the moment that your string twanged  loose it easy steady and yet sharp said aylward by my hilt mon gar it is very well when you do but shoot at a shield but when there is a man behind the shield and he rides at you with wave of sword and glint of eyes from behind his vizor you may find him a less easy mark  it is a mark that i have found before now answered the young bowman  and shall again camarade i doubt not but hola johnston who is this who holds his bow like a crowkeeper  it is silas peterson of horsham do not wink with one eye and look with the other silas and do not hop and dance after you shoot with your tongue out for that will not speed it upon its way stand straight and firm as god made you move not the bow arm and steady with the drawing hand  i faith said black simon i am a spearman myself and am more fitted for handstrokes than for such work as this yet i have spent my days among bowmen and i have seen many a brave shaft sped i will not say but that we have some good marksmen here and that this company would be accounted a fine body of archers at any time or place yet i do not see any men who bend so strong a bow or shoot as true a shaft as those whom i have known  you say sooth said johnston turning his seamed and grizzled face upon the manatarms see yonder he added pointing to a bombard which lay within the camp there is what hath done scath to good bowmanship with its filthy soot and foolish roaring mouth i wonder that a true knight like our prince should carry such a scurvy thing in his train robin thou redheaded lurden how oft must i tell thee not to shoot straight with a quarterwind blowing across the mark  by these ten fingerbones there were some fine bowmen at the intaking of calais said aylward i well remember that on occasion of an outfall a genoan raised his arm over his mantlet and shook it at us a hundred paces from our line there were twenty who loosed shafts at him and when the man was afterwards slain it was found that he had taken eighteen through his forearm  and i can call to mind remarked johnston that when the great cog christopher which the french had taken from us was moored two hundred paces from the shore two archers little robin withstaff and elias baddlesmere in four shots each cut every strand of her hempen anchorcord so that she wellnigh came upon the rocks  good shooting i faith rare shooting said black simon but i have seen you johnston and you samkin aylward and one or two others who are still with us shoot as well as the best was it not you johnston who took the fat ox at finsbury butts against the pick of london town  a sunburnt and blackeyed brabanter had stood near the old archers leaning upon a large crossbow and listening to their talk which had been carried on in that hybrid camp dialect which both nations could understand he was a squat bullnecked man clad in the iron helmet mail tunic and woollen gambesson of his class a jacket with hanging sleeves slashed with velvet at the neck and wrists showed that he was a man of some consideration an underofficer or fileleader of his company  i cannot think said he why you english should be so fond of your sixfoot stick if it amuse you to bend it well and good but why should i strain and pull when my little moulinet will do all for me and better than i can do it for myself  i have seen good shooting with the prod and with the latch said aylward but by my hilt camarade with all respect to you and to your bow i think that is but a womans weapon which a woman can point and loose as easily as a man  i know not about that answered the brabanter but this i know that though i have served for fourteen years i have never yet seen an englishman do aught with the longbow which i could not do better with my arbalest by the three kings i would even go further and say that i have done things with my arbalest which no englishman could do with his longbow  well said mon gar cried aylward a good cock has ever a brave call now i have shot little of late but there is johnston here who will try a round with you for the honor of the company  and i will lay a gallon of jurancon wine upon the longbow said black simon though i had rather for my own drinking that it were a quart of twynham ale  i take both your challenge and your wager said the man of brabant throwing off his jacket and glancing keenly about him with his black twinkling eyes i cannot see any fitting mark for i care not to waste a bolt upon these shields which a drunken boor could not miss at a village kermesse  this is a perilous man whispered an english manatarms plucking at aylwards sleeve he is the best marksman of all the crossbow companies and it was he who brought down the constable de bourbon at brignais i fear that your man will come by little honor with him  yet i have seen johnston shoot these twenty years and i will not flinch from it how say you old warhound will you not have a flight shot or two with this springald  tut tut aylward said the old bowman my day is past and it is for the younger ones to hold what we have gained i take it unkindly of thee samkin that thou shouldst call all eyes thus upon a broken bowman who could once shoot a fair shaft let me feel that bow wilkins it is a scotch bow i see for the upper nock is without and the lower within by the black rood it is a good piece of yew well nocked well strung well waxed and very joyful to the feel i think even now that i might hit any large and goodly mark with a bow like this turn thy quiver to me aylward i love an ash arrow pierced with cornelwood for a roving shaft  by my hilt and so do i cried aylward these three ganderwinged shafts are such  so i see comrade it has been my wont to choose a saddlebacked feather for a dead shaft and a swinebacked for a smooth flier i will take the two of them ah samkin lad the eye grows dim and the hand less firm as the years pass  come then are you not ready said the brabanter who had watched with illconcealed impatience the slow and methodic movements of his antagonist  i will venture a rover with you or try longbutts or hoyles said old johnston to my mind the longbow is a better weapon than the arbalest but it may be ill for me to prove it  so i think quoth the other with a sneer he drew his moulinet from his girdle and fixing it to the windlass he drew back the powerful double cord until it had clicked into the catch then from his quiver he drew a short thick quarrel which he placed with the utmost care upon the groove word had spread of what was going forward and the rivals were already surrounded not only by the english archers of the company but by hundreds of arbalestiers and menatarms from the bands of ortingo and la nuit to the latter of which the brabanter belonged  there is a mark yonder on the hill said he mayhap you can discern it  i see something answered johnston shading his eyes with his hand but it is a very long shoot  a fair shoota fair shoot stand aside arnaud lest you find a bolt through your gizzard now comrade i take no flight shot and i give you the vantage of watching my shaft  as he spoke he raised his arbalest to his shoulder and was about to pull the trigger when a large gray stork flapped heavily into view skimming over the brow of the hill and then soaring up into the air to pass the valley its shrill and piercing cries drew all eyes upon it and as it came nearer a dark spot which circled above it resolved itself into a peregrine falcon which hovered over its head poising itself from time to time and watching its chance of closing with its clumsy quarry nearer and nearer came the two birds all absorbed in their own contest the stork wheeling upwards the hawk still fluttering above it until they were not a hundred paces from the camp the brabanter raised his weapon to the sky and there came the short deep twang of his powerful string his bolt struck the stork just where its wing meets the body and the bird whirled aloft in a last convulsive flutter before falling wounded and flapping to the earth a roar of applause burst from the crossbowmen but at the instant that the bolt struck its mark old johnston who had stood listlessly with arrow on string bent his bow and sped a shaft through the body of the falcon whipping the other from his belt he sent it skimming some few feet from the earth with so true an aim that it struck and transfixed the stork for the second time ere it could reach the ground a deepchested shout of delight burst from the archers at the sight of this double feat and aylward dancing with joy threw his arms round the old marksman and embraced him with such vigor that their mail tunics clanged again  ah camarade he cried you shall have a stoup with me for this what then old dog would not the hawk please thee but thou must have the stork as well oh to my heart again  it is a pretty piece of yew and well strung said johnston with a twinkle in his deepset gray eyes even an old broken bowman might find the clout with a bow like this  you have done very well remarked the brabanter in a surly voice but it seems to me that you have not yet shown yourself to be a better marksman than i for i have struck that at which i aimed and by the three kings no man can do more  it would ill beseem me to claim to be a better marksman answered johnston for i have heard great things of your skill i did but wish to show that the longbow could do that which an arbalest could not do for you could not with your moulinet have your string ready to speed another shaft ere the bird drop to the earth  in that you have vantage said the crossbowman by saint james it is now my turn to show you where my weapon has the better of you i pray you to draw a flight shaft with all your strength down the valley that we may see the length of your shoot  that is a very strong prod of yours said johnston shaking his grizzled head as he glanced at the thick arch and powerful strings of his rivals arbalest i have little doubt that you can overshoot me and yet i have seen bowmen who could send a clothyard arrow further than you could speed a quarrel  so i have heard remarked the brabanter and yet it is a strange thing that these wondrous bowmen are never where i chance to be pace out the distances with a wand at every five score and do you arnaud stand at the fifth wand to carry back my bolts to me  a line was measured down the valley and johnston drawing an arrow to the very head sent it whistling over the row of wands  bravely drawn a rare shoot shouted the bystanders  it is well up to the fourth mark  by my hilt it is over it cried aylward i can see where they have stooped to gather up the shaft  we shall hear anon said johnston quietly and presently a young archer came running to say that the arrow had fallen twenty paces beyond the fourth wand  four hundred paces and a score cried black simon i faith it is a very long flight yet wood and steel may do more than flesh and blood  the brabanter stepped forward with a smile of conscious triumph and loosed the cord of his weapon a shout burst from his comrades as they watched the swift and lofty flight of the heavy bolt  over the fourth groaned aylward by my hilt i think that it is well up to the fifth  it is over the fifth cried a gascon loudly and a comrade came running with waving arms to say that the bolt had pitched eight paces beyond the mark of the five hundred  which weapon hath the vantage now cried the brabanter strutting proudly about with shouldered arbalest amid the applause of his companions  you can overshoot me said johnston gently  or any other man who ever bent a longbow cried his victorious adversary  nay not so fast said a huge archer whose mighty shoulders and red head towered high above the throng of his comrades i must have a word with you ere you crow so loudly where is my little popper by sainted dick of hampole it will be a strange thing if i cannot outshoot that thing of thine which to my eyes is more like a rattrap than a bow will you try another flight or do you stand by your last  five hundred and eight paces will serve my turn answered the brabanter looking askance at this new opponent  tut john whispered aylward you never were a marksman why must you thrust your spoon into this dish  easy and slow aylward there are very many things which i cannot do but there are also one or two which i have the trick of it is in my mind that i can beat this shoot if my bow will but hold together  go on old babe of the woods have at it hampshire cried the archers laughing  by my soul you may grin cried john but i learned how to make the long shoot from old hob miller of milford he took up a great black bow as he spoke and sitting down upon the ground he placed his two feet on either end of the stave with an arrow fitted he then pulled the string towards him with both hands until the head of the shaft was level with the wood the great bow creaked and groaned and the cord vibrated with the tension  who is this foolshead who stands in the way of my shoot said he craning up his neck from the ground  he stands on the further side of my mark answered the brabanter so he has little to fear from you  well the saints assoil him cried john though i think he is overnear to be scathed as he spoke he raised his two feet with the bowstave upon their soles and his cord twanged with a deep rich hum which might be heard across the valley the measurer in the distance fell flat upon his face and then jumping up again he began to run in the opposite direction  well shot old lad it is indeed over his head cried the bowmen  mon dieu exclaimed the brabanter who ever saw such a shoot  it is but a trick quoth john many a time have i won a gallon of ale by covering a mile in three flights down wilverley chase  it fell a hundred and thirty paces beyond the fifth mark shouted an archer in the distance  six hundred and thirty paces mon dieu but that is a shoot and yet it says nothing for your weapon mon gros camarade for it was by turning yourself into a crossbow that you did it  by my hilt there is truth in that cried aylward and now friend i will myself show you a vantage of the longbow i pray you to speed a bolt against yonder shield with all your force it is an inch of elm with bulls hide over it  i scarce shot as many shafts at brignais growled the man of brabant though i found a better mark there than a cantle of bulls hide but what is this englishman the shield hangs not one hundred paces from me and a blind man could strike it he screwed up his string to the furthest pitch and shot his quarrel at the dangling shield aylward who had drawn an arrow from his quiver carefully greased the head of it and sped it at the same mark  run wilkins quoth he and fetch me the shield  long were the faces of the englishmen and broad the laugh of the crossbowmen as the heavy mantlet was carried towards them for there in the centre was the thick brabant bolt driven deeply into the wood while there was neither sign nor trace of the clothyard shaft  by the three kings cried the brabanter this time at least there is no gainsaying which is the better weapon or which the truer hand that held it you have missed the shield englishman  tarry a bit tarry a bit mon gar quoth aylward and turning round the shield he showed a round clear hole in the wood at the back of it my shaft has passed through it camarade and i trow the one which goes through is more to be feared than that which bides on the way  the brabanter stamped his foot with mortification and was about to make some angry reply when alleyne edricson came riding up to the crowds of archers  sir nigel will be here anon said he and it is his wish to speak with the company  in an instant order and method took the place of general confusion bows steel caps and jacks were caught up from the grass a long cordon cleared the camp of all strangers while the main body fell into four lines with underofficers and fileleaders in front and on either flank so they stood silent and motionless when their leader came riding towards them his face shining and his whole small figure swelling with the news which he bore  great honor has been done to us men cried he for of all the army the prince has chosen us out that we should ride onwards into the lands of spain to spy upon our enemies yet as there are many of us and as the service may not be to the liking of all i pray that those will step forward from the ranks who have the will to follow me  there was a rustle among the bowmen but when sir nigel looked up at them no man stood forward from his fellows but the four lines of men stretched unbroken as before sir nigel blinked at them in amazement and a look of the deepest sorrow shadowed his face  that i should live to see the day he cried what not one  my fair lord whispered alleyne they have all stepped forward  ah by saint paul i see how it is with them i could not think that they would desert me we start at dawn tomorrow and ye are to have the horses of sir robert cheneys company be ready i pray ye at early cockcrow  a buzz of delight burst from the archers as they broke their ranks and ran hither and thither whooping and cheering like boys who have news of a holiday sir nigel gazed after them with a smiling face when a heavy hand fell upon his shoulder  what ho my knighterrant of twynham said a voice you are off to ebro i hear and by the holy fish of tobias you must take me under your banner  what sir oliver buttesthorn cried sir nigel i had heard that you were come into camp and had hoped to see you glad and proud shall i be to have you with me  i have a most particular and weighty reason for wishing to go said the sturdy knight  i can well believe it returned sir nigel i have met no man who is quicker to follow where honor leads  nay it is not for honor that i go nigel  for what then  for pullets  pullets  yes for the rascal vanguard have cleared every hen from the countryside it was this very morning that norbury my squire lamed his horse in riding round in quest of one for we have a bag of truffles and nought to eat with them never have i seen such locusts as this vanguard of ours not a pullet shall we see until we are in front of them so i shall leave my winchester runagates to the care of the provostmarshal and i shall hie south with you nigel with my truffles at my saddlebow  oliver oliver i know you overwell said sir nigel shaking his head and the two old soldiers rode off together to their pavilion    chapter xxxv how sir nigel hawked at an eagle   to the south of pampeluna in the kingdom of navarre there stretched a high tableland rising into bare sterile hills brown or gray in color and strewn with huge boulders of granite on the gascon side of the great mountains there had been running streams meadows forests and little nestling villages here on the contrary were nothing but naked rocks poor pasture and savage stonestrewn wastes gloomy defiles or barrancas intersected this wild country with mountain torrents dashing and foaming between their rugged sides the clatter of waters the scream of the eagle and the howling of wolves the only sounds which broke upon the silence in that dreary and inhospitable region  through this wild country it was that sir nigel and his company pushed their way riding at times through vast defiles where the brown gnarled cliffs shot up on either side of them and the sky was but a long winding blue slit between the clustering lines of box which fringed the lips of the precipices or again leading their horses along the narrow and rocky paths worn by the muleteers upon the edges of the chasm where under their very elbows they could see the white streak which marked the gave which foamed a thousand feet below them so for two days they pushed their way through the wild places of navarre past fuente over the rapid ega through estella until upon a winters evening the mountains fell away from in front of them and they saw the broad blue ebro curving betwixt its double line or homesteads and of villages the fishers of viana were aroused that night by rough voices speaking in a strange tongue and ere morning sir nigel and his men had ferried the river and were safe upon the land of spain  all the next day they lay in a pine wood near to the town of logrono resting their horses and taking counsel as to what they should do sir nigel had with him sir william felton sir oliver buttesthorn stout old sir simon burley the scotch knighterrant the earl of angus and sir richard causton all accounted among the bravest knights in the army together with sixty veteran menatarms and three hundred and twenty archers spies had been sent out in the morning and returned after nightfall to say that the king of spain was encamped some fourteen miles off in the direction of burgos having with him twenty thousand horse and fortyfive thousand foot  a drywood fire had been lit and round this the leaders crouched the glare beating upon their rugged faces while the hardy archers lounged and chatted amid the tethered horses while they munched their scanty provisions  for my part said sir simon burley i am of opinion that we have already done that which we have come for for do we not now know where the king is and how great a following he hath which was the end of our journey  true answered sir william felton but i have come on this venture because it is a long time since i have broken a spear in war and certes i shall not go back until i have run a course with some cavalier of spain let those go back who will but i must see more of these spaniards ere i turn  i will not leave you sir william returned sir simon burley and yet as an old soldier and one who hath seen much of war i cannot but think that it is an ill thing for four hundred men to find themselves between an army of sixty thousand on the one side and a broad river on the other  yet said sir richard causton we cannot for the honor of england go back without a blow struck  nor for the honor of scotland either cried the earl of angus by saint andrew i wish that i may never set eyes upon the water of leith again if i pluck my horses bridle ere i have seen this camp of theirs  by saint paul you have spoken very well said sir nigel and i have always heard that there were very worthy gentlemen among the scots and fine skirmishing to be had upon their border bethink you sir simon that we have this news from the lips of common spies who can scarce tell us as much of the enemy and of his forces as the prince would wish to hear  you are the leader in this venture sir nigel the other answered and i do but ride under your banner  yet i would fain have your rede and counsel sir simon but touching what you say of the river we can take heed that we shall not have it at the back of us for the prince hath now advanced to salvatierra and thence to vittoria so that if we come upon their camp from the further side we can make good our retreat  what then would you propose asked sir simon shaking his grizzled head as one who is but half convinced  that we ride forward ere the news reach them that we have crossed the river in this way we may have sight of their army and perchance even find occasion for some small deed against them  so be it then said sir simon burley and the rest of the council having approved a scanty meal was hurriedly snatched and the advance resumed under the cover of the darkness all night they led their horses stumbling and groping through wild defiles and rugged valleys following the guidance of a frightened peasant who was strapped by the wrist to black simons stirrupleather with the early dawn they found themselves in a black ravine with others sloping away from it on either side and the bare brown crags rising in long bleak terraces all round them  if it please you fair lord said black simon this man hath misled us and since there is no tree upon which we may hang him it might be well to hurl him over yonder cliff  the peasant reading the soldiers meaning in his fierce eyes and harsh accents dropped upon his knees screaming loudly for mercy  how comes it dog asked sir william felton in spanish where is this camp to which you swore that you would lead us  by the sweet virgin by the blessed mother of god cried the trembling peasant i swear to you that in the darkness i have myself lost the path  over the cliff with him shouted half a dozen voices but ere the archers could drag him from the rocks to which he clung sir nigel had ridden up and called upon them to stop  how is this sirs said he as long as the prince doth me the honor to entrust this venture to me it is for me only to give orders and by saint paul i shall be right blithe to go very deeply into the matter with any one to whom my words may give offence how say you sir william or you my lord of angus or you sir richard  nay nay nigel cried sir william this base peasant is too small a matter for old comrades to quarrel over but he hath betrayed us and certes he hath merited a dogs death  hark ye fellow said sir nigel we give you one more chance to find the path we are about to gain much honor sir william in this enterprise and it would be a sorry thing if the first blood shed were that of an unworthy boor let us say our morning orisons and it may chance that ere we finish he may strike upon the track  with bowed heads and steel caps in hand the archers stood at their horses heads while sir simon burley repeated the pater the ave and the credo long did alleyne bear the scene in mindthe knot of knights in their dull leadenhued armor the ruddy visage of sir oliver the craggy features of the scottish earl the shining scalp of sir nigel with the dense ring of hard bearded faces and the long brown heads of the horses all topped and circled by the beetling cliffs scarce had the last deep amen broken from the company when in an instant there rose the scream of a hundred bugles with the deep rolling of drums and the clashing of cymbals all sounding together in one deafening uproar knights and archers sprang to arms convinced that some great host was upon them but the guide dropped upon his knees and thanked heaven for its mercies  we have found them caballeros he cried this is their morning call if ye will but deign to follow me i will set them before you ere a man might tell his beads  as he spoke he scrambled down one of the narrow ravines and climbing over a low ridge at the further end he led them into a short valley with a stream purling down the centre of it and a very thick growth of elder and of box upon either side pushing their way through the dense brushwood they looked out upon a scene which made their hearts beat harder and their breath come faster  in front of them there lay a broad plain watered by two winding streams and covered with grass stretching away to where in the furthest distance the towers of burgos bristled up against the light blue morning sky over all this vast meadow there lay a great city of tentsthousands upon thousands of them laid out in streets and in squares like a wellordered town high silken pavilions or colored marquees shooting up from among the crowd of meaner dwellings marked where the great lords and barons of leon and castile displayed their standards while over the white roofs as far as eye could reach the waving of ancients pavons pensils and banderoles with flash of gold and glow of colors proclaimed that all the chivalry of iberia were mustered in the plain beneath them far off in the centre of the camp a huge palace of red and white silk with the royal arms of castile waiving from the summit announced that the gallant henry lay there in the midst of his warriors  as the english adventurers peeping out from behind their brushwood screen looked down upon this wondrous sight they could see that the vast army in front of them was already afoot the first pink light of the rising sun glittered upon the steel caps and breastplates of dense masses of slingers and of crossbowmen who drilled and marched in the spaces which had been left for their exercise a thousand columns of smoke reeked up into the pure morning air where the faggots were piled and the campkettles already simmering  in the open plain clouds of light horse galloped and swooped with swaying bodies and waving javelins after the fashion which the spanish had adopted from their moorish enemies all along by the sedgy banks of the rivers long lines of pages led their masters chargers down to water while the knights themselves lounged in gaylydressed groups about the doors of their pavilions or rode out with their falcons upon their wrists and their greyhounds behind them in quest of quail or of leveret  by my hilt mon gar whispered aylward to alleyne as the young squire stood with parted lips and wondering eyes gazing down at the novel scene before him we have been seeking them all night but now that we have found them i know not what we are to do with them  you say sooth samkin quoth old johnston i would that we were upon the far side of ebro again for there is neither honor nor profit to be gained here what say you simon  by the rood cried the fierce manatarms i will see the color of their blood ere i turn my mares head for the mountains am i a child that i should ride for three days and nought but words at the end of it  well said my sweet honeysuckle cried hordle john i am with you like hilt to blade could i but lay hands upon one of those gay prancers yonder i doubt not that i should have ransom enough from him to buy my mother a new cow  a cow said aylward say rather ten acres and a homestead on the banks of avon  say you so then by our lady here is for yonder one in the red jerkin  he was about to push recklessly forward into the open when sir nigel himself darted in front of him with his hand upon his breast  back said he our time is not yet come and we must lie here until evening throw off your jacks and headpieces least their eyes catch the shine and tether the horses among the rocks  the order was swiftly obeyed and in ten minutes the archers were stretched along by the side of the brook munching the bread and the bacon which they had brought in their bags and craning their necks to watch the everchanging scene beneath them very quiet and still they lay save for a muttered jest or whispered order for twice during the long morning they heard buglecalls from amid the hills on either side of them which showed that they had thrust themselves in between the outposts of the enemy the leaders sat amongst the boxwood and took counsel together as to what they should do while from below there surged up the buzz of voices the shouting the neighing of horses and all the uproar of a great camp  what boots it to wait said sir william felton let us ride down upon their camp ere they discover us  and so say i cried the scottish earl for they do not know that there is any enemy within thirty long leagues of them  for my part said sir simon burley i think that it is madness for you cannot hope to rout this great army and where are you to go and what are you to do when they have turned upon you how say you sir oliver buttesthorn  by the apple of eve cried the fat knight it appears to me that this wind brings a very savory smell of garlic and of onions from their cookingkettles i am in favor of riding down upon them at once if my old friend and comrade here is of the same mind  nay said sir nigel i have a plan by which we may attempt some small deed upon them and yet by the help of god may be able to draw off again which as sir simon burley hath said would be scarce possible in any other way  how then sir nigel asked several voices  we shall lie here all day for amid this brushwood it is ill for them to see us then when evening comes we shall sally out upon them and see if we may not gain some honorable advancement from them  but why then rather than now  because we shall have nightfall to cover us when we draw off so that we may make our way back through the mountains i would station a score of archers here in the pass with all our pennons jutting forth from the rocks and as many nakirs and drums and bugles as we have with us so that those who follow us in the fading light may think that the whole army of the prince is upon them and fear to go further what think you of my plan sir simon  by my troth i think very well of it cried the prudent old commander if four hundred men must needs run a tilt against sixty thousand i cannot see how they can do it better or more safely  and so say i cried felton heartily but i wish the day were over for it will be an ill thing for us if they chance to light upon us  the words were scarce out of his mouth when there came a clatter of loose stones the sharp clink of trotting hoofs and a darkfaced cavalier mounted upon a white horse burst through the bushes and rode swiftly down the valley from the end which was farthest from the spanish camp lightly armed with his vizor open and a hawk perched upon his left wrist he looked about him with the careless air of a man who is bent wholly upon pleasure and unconscious of the possibility of danger suddenly however his eyes lit upon the fierce faces which glared out at him from the brushwood with a cry of terror he thrust his spurs into his horses sides and dashed for the narrow opening of the gorge for a moment it seemed as though he would have reached it for he had trampled over or dashed aside the archers who threw themselves in his way but hordle john seized him by the foot in his grasp of iron and dragged him from the saddle while two others caught the frightened horse  ho ho roared the great archer how many cows wilt buy my mother if i set thee free  hush that bulls bellowing cried sir nigel impatiently bring the man here by st paul it is not the first time that we have met for if i mistake not it is don diego alvarez who was once at the princes court  it is indeed i said the spanish knight speaking in the french tongue and i pray you to pass your sword through my heart for how can i livei a caballero of castileafter being dragged from my horse by the base hands of a common archer  fret not for that answered sir nigel for in sooth had he not pulled you down a dozen clothyard shafts had crossed each other in your body  by st james it were better so than to be polluted by his touch answered the spaniard with his black eyes sparkling with rage and hatred i trust that i am now the prisoner of some honorable knight or gentleman  you are the prisoner of the man who took you sir diego answered sir nigel and i may tell you that better men than either you or i have found themselves before now prisoners in the hands of archers of england  what ransom then does he demand asked the spaniard  big john scratched his red head and grinned in high delight when the question was propounded to him tell him said he that i shall have ten cows and a bull too if it be but a little one also a dress of blue sendall for mother and a red one for joan with five acres of pastureland two scythes and a fine new grindstone likewise a small house with stalls for the cows and thirtysix gallons of beer for the thirsty weather  tut tut cried sir nigel laughing all these things may be had for money and i think don diego that five thousand crowns is not too much for so renowned a knight  it shall be duly paid him  for some days we must keep you with us and i must crave leave also to use your shield your armor and your horse  my harness is yours by the law of arms said the spaniard gloomily  i do but ask the loan of it i have need of it this day but it shall be duly returned to you set guards aylward with arrow on string at either end of the pass for it may happen that some other cavaliers may visit us ere the time be come all day the little band of englishmen lay in the sheltered gorge looking down upon the vast host of their unconscious enemies shortly after midday a great uproar of shouting and cheering broke out in the camp with mustering of men and calling of bugles clambering up among the rocks the companions saw a long rolling cloud of dust along the whole eastern skyline with the glint of spears and the flutter of pennons which announced the approach of a large body of cavalry for a moment a wild hope came upon them that perhaps the prince had moved more swiftly than had been planned that he had crossed the ebro and that this was his vanguard sweeping to the attack  surely i see the red pile of chandos at the head of yonder squadron cried sir richard causton shading his eyes with his hand  not so answered sir simon burley who had watched the approaching host with a darkening face it is even as i feared that is the double eagle of du guesclin  you say very truly cried the earl of angus these are the levies of france for i can see the ensigns of the marshal dandreghen with that of the lord of antoing and of briseuil and of many another from brittany and anjou  by st paul i am very glad of it said sir nigel of these spaniards i know nothing but the french are very worthy gentlemen and will do what they can for our advancement  there are at the least four thousand of them and all menatarms cried sir william felton see there is bertrand himself beside his banner and there is king henry who rides to welcome him now they all turn and come into the camp together  as he spoke the vast throng of spaniards and of frenchmen trooped across the plain with brandished arms and tossing banners all day long the sound of revelry and of rejoicing from the crowded camp swelled up to the ears of the englishmen and they could see the soldiers of the two nations throwing themselves into each others arms and dancing handinhand round the blazing fires the sun had sunk behind a cloudbank in the west before sir nigel at last gave word that the men should resume their arms and have their horses ready he had himself thrown off his armor and had dressed himself from head to foot in the harness of the captured spaniard  sir william said he it is my intention to attempt a small deed and i ask you therefore that you will lead this outfall upon the camp for me i will ride into their camp with my squire and two archers i pray you to watch me and to ride forth when i am come among the tents you will leave twenty men behind here as we planned this morning and you will ride back here after you have ventured as far as seems good to you  i will do as you order nigel but what is it that you propose to do  you will see anon and indeed it is but a trifling matter alleyne you will come with me and lead a spare horse by the bridle i will have the two archers who rode with us through france for they are trusty men and of stout heart let them ride behind us and let them leave their bows here among the bushes for it is not my wish that they should know that we are englishmen say no word to any whom we may meet and if any speak to you pass on as though you heard them not are you ready  i am ready my fair lord said alleyne  and i and i cried aylward and john  then the rest i leave to your wisdom sir william and if god sends us fortune we shall meet you again in this gorge ere it be dark  so saying sir nigel mounted the white horse of the spanish cavalier and rode quietly forth from his concealment with his three companions behind him alleyne leading his masters own steed by the bridle so many small parties of french and spanish horse were sweeping hither and thither that the small band attracted little notice and making its way at a gentle trot across the plain they came as far as the camp without challenge or hindrance on and on they pushed past the endless lines of tents amid the dense swarms of horsemen and of footmen until the huge royal pavilion stretched in front of them they were close upon it when of a sudden there broke out a wild hubbub from a distant portion of the camp with screams and warcries and all the wild tumult of battle at the sound soldiers came rushing from their tents knights shouted loudly for their squires and there was mad turmoil on every hand of bewildered men and plunging horses at the royal tent a crowd of gorgeously dressed servants ran hither and thither in helpless panic for the guard of soldiers who were stationed there had already ridden off in the direction of the alarm a manatarms on either side of the doorway were the sole protectors of the royal dwelling  i have come for the king whispered sir nigel and by saint paul he must back with us or i must bide here  alleyne and aylward sprang from their horses and flew at the two sentries who were disarmed and beaten down in an instant by so furious and unexpected an attack sir nigel dashed into the royal tent and was followed by hordle john as soon as the horses had been secured from within came wild screamings and the clash of steel and then the two emerged once more their swords and forearms reddened with blood while john bore over his shoulder the senseless body of a man whose gay surcoat adorned with the lions and towers of castile proclaimed him to belong to the royal house a crowd of whitefaced sewers and pages swarmed at their heels those behind pushing forwards while the foremost shrank back from the fierce faces and reeking weapons of the adventurers the senseless body was thrown across the spare horse the four sprang to their saddles and away they thundered with loose reins and busy spurs through the swarming camp  but confusion and disorder still reigned among the spaniards for sir william felton and his men had swept through half their camp leaving a long litter of the dead and the dying to mark their course uncertain who were their attackers and unable to tell their english enemies from their newlyarrived breton allies the spanish knights rode wildly hither and thither in aimless fury the mad turmoil the mixture of races and the fading light were all in favor of the four who alone knew their own purpose among the vast uncertain multitude twice ere they reached open ground they had to break their way through small bodies of horses and once there came a whistle of arrows and singing of stones about their ears but still dashing onwards they shot out from among the tents and found their own comrades retreating for the mountains at no very great distance from them another five minutes of wild galloping over the plain and they were all back in their gorge while their pursuers fell back before the rolling of drums and blare of trumpets which seemed to proclaim that the whole army of the prince was about to emerge from the mountain passes  by my soul nigel cried sir oliver waving a great boiled ham over his head i have come by something which i may eat with my truffles i had a hard fight for it for there were three of them with their mouths open and the knives in their hands all sitting agape round the table when i rushed in upon them how say you sir william will you not try the smack of the famed spanish swine though we have but the brook water to wash it down  later sir oliver answered the old soldier wiping his grimed face we must further into the mountains ere we be in safety but what have we here nigel  it is a prisoner whom i have taken and in sooth as he came from the royal tent and wears the royal arms upon his jupon i trust that he is the king of spain  the king of spain cried the companions crowding round in amazement  nay sir nigel said felton peering at the prisoner through the uncertain light i have twice seen henry of transtamare and certes this man in no way resembles him  then by the light of heaven i will ride back for him cried sir nigel  nay nay the camp is in arms and it would be rank madness who are you fellow he added in spanish and how is it that you dare to wear the arms of castile  the prisoner was bent recovering the consciousness which had been squeezed from him by the grip of hordle john if it please you he answered i and nine others are the bodysquires of the king and must ever wear his arms so as to shield him from even such perils as have threatened him this night the king is at the tent of the brave du guesclin where he will sup to night but i am a caballero of aragon don sancho penelosa and though i be no king i am yet ready to pay a fitting price for my ransom  by saint paul i will not touch your gold cried sir nigel go back to your master and give him greeting from sir nigel loring of twynham castle telling him that i had hoped to make his better acquaintance this night and that if i have disordered his tent it was but in my eagerness to know so famed and courteous a knight spur on comrades for we must cover many a league ere we can venture to light fire or to loosen girth i had hoped to ride without this patch tonight but it seems that i must carry it yet a little longer    chapter xxxvi how sir nigel took the patch from his eye   it was a cold bleak morning in the beginning of march and the mist was drifting in dense rolling clouds through the passes of the cantabrian mountains the company who had passed the night in a sheltered gully were already astir some crowding round the blazing fires and others romping or leaping over each others backs for their limbs were chilled and the air biting here and there through the dense haze which surrounded them there loomed out huge pinnacles and jutting boulders of rock while high above the sea of vapor there towered up one gigantic peak with the pink glow of the early sunshine upon its snowcapped head the ground was wet the rocks dripping the grass and evergreens sparkling with beads of moisture yet the camp was loud with laughter and merriment for a messenger had ridden in from the prince with words of heartstirring praise for what they had done and with orders that they should still abide in the forefront of the army  round one of the fires were clustered four or five of the leading men of the archers cleaning the rust from their weapons and glancing impatiently from time to time at a great pot which smoked over the blaze there was aylward squatting crosslegged in his shirt while he scrubbed away at his chainmail brigandine whistling loudly the while on one side of him sat old johnston who was busy in trimming the feathers of some arrows to his liking and on the other hordle john who lay with his great limbs all asprawl and his headpiece balanced upon his uplifted foot black simon of norwich crouched amid the rocks crooning an eastland ballad to himself while he whetted his sword upon a flat stone which lay across his knees while beside him sat alleyne edricson and norbury the silent squire of sir oliver holding out their chilled hands towards the crackling faggots  cast on another culpon john and stir the broth with thy swordsheath growled johnston looking anxiously for the twentieth time at the reeking pot  by my hilt cried aylward now that john hath come by this great ransom he will scarce abide the fare of poor archer lads how say you camarade when you see hordle once more there will be no penny ale and fat bacon but gascon wines and baked meats every day of the seven  i know not about that said john kicking his helmet up into the air and catching it in his hand i do but know that whether the broth be ready or no i am about to dip this into it  it simmers and it boils cried johnston pushing his hardlined face through the smoke in an instant the pot had been plucked from the blaze and its contents had been scooped up in half a dozen steel headpieces which were balanced betwixt their owners knees while with spoon and gobbet of bread they devoured their morning meal  it is ill weather for bows remarked john at last when with a long sigh he drained the last drop from his helmet my strings are as limp as a cows tail this morning  you should rub them with water glue quoth johnston you remember samkin that it was wetter than this on the morning of crecy and yet i cannot call to mind that there was aught amiss with our strings  it is in my thoughts said black simon still pensively grinding his sword that we may have need of your strings ere sundown i dreamed of the red cow last night  and what is this red cow simon asked alleyne  i know not young sir but i can only say that on the eve of cadsand and on the eve of crecy and on the eve of nogent i dreamed of a red cow and now the dream has come upon me again so i am now setting a very keen edge to my blade  well said old wardog cried aylward by my hilt i pray that your dream may come true for the prince hath not set us out here to drink broth or to gather whortleberries one more fight and i am ready to hang up my bow marry a wife and take to the fire corner but how now robin whom is it that you seek  the lord loring craves your attendance in his tent said a young archer to alleyne  the squire rose and proceeded to the pavilion where he found the knight seated upon a cushion with his legs crossed in front of him and a broad ribbon of parchment laid across his knees over which he was poring with frowning brows and pursed lips  it came this morning by the princes messenger said he and was brought from england by sir john fallislee who is new come from sussex what make you of this upon the outer side  it is fairly and clearly written alleyne answered and it signifies to sir nigel loring knight constable of twynham castle by the hand of christopher the servant of god at the priory of christchurch  so i read it said sir nigel now i pray you to read what is set forth within  alleyne turned to the letter and as his eyes rested upon it his face turned pale and a cry of surprise and grief burst from his lips  what then asked the knight peering up at him anxiously there is nought amiss with the lady mary or with the lady maude  it is my brothermy poor unhappy brother cried alleyne with his hand to his brow he is dead  by saint paul i have never heard that he had shown so much love for you that you should mourn him so  yet he was my brotherthe only kith or kin that i had upon earth mayhap he had cause to be bitter against me for his land was given to the abbey for my upbringing alas alas and i raised my staff against him when last we met he has been slainand slain i fear amidst crime and violence  ha said sir nigel read on i pray you  god be with thee my honored lord and have thee in his holy keeping the lady loring hath asked me to set down in writing what hath befallen at twynham and all that concerns the death of thy ill neighbor the socman of minstead for when ye had left us this evil man gathered around him all outlaws villeins and masterless men until they were come to such a force that they slew and scattered the kings men who went against them then coming forth from the woods they laid siege to thy castle and for two days they girt us in and shot hard against us with such numbers as were a marvel to see yet the lady loring held the place stoutly and on the second day the socman was slainby his own men as some thinkso that we were delivered from their hands for which praise be to all the saints and more especially to the holy anselm upon whose feast it came to pass the lady loring and the lady maude thy fair daughter are in good health and so also am i save for an imposthume of the toejoint which hath been sent me for my sins may all the saints preserve thee  it was the vision of the lady tiphaine said sir nigel after a pause marked you not how she said that the leader was one with a yellow beard and how he fell before the gate but how came it alleyne that this woman to whom all things are as crystal and who hath not said one word which has not come to pass was yet so led astray as to say that your thoughts turned to twynham castle even more than my own  my fair lord said alleyne with a flush on his weatherstained cheeks the lady tiphaine may have spoken sooth when she said it for twynham castle is in my heart by day and in my dreams by night  ha cried sir nigel with a sidelong glance  yes my fair lord for indeed i love your daughter the lady maude and unworthy as i am i would give my hearts blood to serve her  by st paul edricson said the knight coldly arching his eyebrows you aim high in this matter our blood is very old  and mine also is very old answered the squire  and the lady maude is our single child all our name and lands centre upon her  alas that i should say it but i also am now the only edricson  and why have i not heard this from you before alleyne in sooth i think that you have used me ill  nay my fair lord say not so for i know not whether your daughter loves me and there is no pledge between us  sir nigel pondered for a few moments and then burst out alaughing by st paul said he i know not why i should mix in the matter for i h  look to her own affairs since first she could stamp her little foot she hath ever been able to get that for which she craved and if she set her heart on thee alleyne and thou on her i do not think that this spanish king with his threescore thousand men could hold you apart yet this i will say that i would see you a full knight ere you go to my daughter with words of love i have ever said that a brave lance should wed her and by my soul edricson if god spare you i think that you will acquit yourself well but enough of such trifles for we have our work before us and it will be time to speak of this matter when we see the white cliffs of england once more go to sir william felton i pray you and ask him to come hither for it is time that we were marching there is no pass at the further end of the valley and it is a perilous place should an enemy come upon us  alleyne delivered his message and then wandered forth from the camp for his mind was all in a whirl with this unexpected news and with his talk with sir nigel sitting upon a rock with his burning brow resting upon his hands he thought of his brother of their quarrel of the lady maude in her bedraggled ridingdress of the gray old castle of the proud pale face in the armory and of the last fiery words with which she had sped him on his way then he was but a penniless monkbred lad unknown and unfriended now he was himself socman of minstead the head of an old stock and the lord of an estate which if reduced from its former size was still ample to preserve the dignity of his family further he had become a man of experience was counted brave among brave men had won the esteem and confidence of her father and above all had been listened to by him when he told him the secret of his love as to the gaining of knighthood in such stirring times it was no great matter for a brave squire of gentle birth to aspire to that honor he would leave his bones among these spanish ravines or he would do some deed which would call the eyes of men upon him  alleyne was still seated on the rock his griefs and his joys drifting swiftly over his mind like the shadow of clouds upon a sunlit meadow when of a sudden he became conscious of a low deep sound which came booming up to him through the fog close behind him he could hear the murmur of the bowmen the occasional bursts of hoarse laughter and the champing and stamping of their horses behind it all however came that lowpitched deeptoned hum which seemed to come from every quarter and to fill the whole air in the old monastic days he remembered to have heard such a sound when he had walked out one windy night at bucklershard and had listened to the long waves breaking upon the shingly shore here however was neither wind nor sea and yet the dull murmur rose ever louder and stronger out of the heart of the rolling sea of vapor he turned and ran to the camp shouting an alarm at the top of his voice  it was but a hundred paces and yet ere he had crossed it every bowman was ready at his horses head and the group of knights were out and listening intently to the ominous sound  it is a great body of horse said sir william felton and they are riding very swiftly hitherwards  yet they must be from the princes army remarked sir richard causton for they come from the north  nay said the earl of angus it is not so certain for the peasant with whom we spoke last night said that it was rumored that don tello the spanish kings brother had ridden with six thousand chosen men to beat up the princes camp it may be that on their backward road they have come this way  by st paul cried sir nigel i think that it is even as you say for that same peasant had a sour face and a shifting eye as one who bore us little good will i doubt not that he has brought these cavaliers upon us  but the mist covers us said sir simon burley we have yet time to ride through the further end of the pass  were we a troop of mountain goats we might do so answered sir william felton but it is not to be passed by a company of horsemen if these be indeed don tello and his men then we must bide where we are and do what we can to make them rue the day that they found us in their path  well spoken william cried sir nigel in high delight if there be so many as has been said then there will be much honor to be gained from them and every hope of advancement but the sound has ceased and i fear that they have gone some other way  or mayhap they have come to the mouth of the gorge and are marshalling their ranks hush and hearken for they are no great way from us  the company stood peering into the dense fogwreath amidst a silence so profound that the dripping of the water from the rocks and the breathing of the horses grew loud upon the ear suddenly from out the sea of mist came the shrill sound of a neigh followed by a long blast upon a bugle  it is a spanish call my fair lord said black simon it is used by their prickers and huntsmen when the beast hath not fled but is still in its lair  by my faith said sir nigel smiling if they are in a humor for venerie we may promise them some sport ere they sound the mort over us but there is a hill in the centre of the gorge on which we might take our stand  i marked it yesternight said felton and no better spot could be found for our purpose for it is very steep at the back it is but a bowshot to the left and indeed i can see the shadow of it  the whole company leading their horses passed across to the small hill which loomed in front of them out of the mist it was indeed admirably designed for defence for it sloped down in front all jagged and boulderstrewn while it fell away in a sheer cliff of a hundred feet or more on the summit was a small uneven plateau with a stretch across of a hundred paces and a depth of half as much again  unloose the horses said sir nigel we have no space for them and if we hold our own we shall have horses and to spare when this days work is done nay keep yours my fair sirs for we may have work for them aylward johnston let your men form a harrow on either side of the ridge sir oliver and you my lord angus i give you the right wing and the left to you sir simon and to you sir richard causton i and sir william felton will hold the centre with our menatarms now order the ranks and fling wide the banners for our souls are gods and our bodies the kings and our swords for saint george and for england  sir nigel had scarcely spoken when the mist seemed to thin in the valley and to shred away into long ragged clouds which trailed from the edges of the cliffs the gorge in which they had camped was a mere wedgeshaped cleft among the hills threequarters of a mile deep with the small rugged rising upon which they stood at the further end and the brown crags walling it in on three sides as the mist parted and the sun broke through it gleamed and shimmered with dazzling brightness upon the armor and headpieces of a vast body of horsemen who stretched across the barranca from one cliff to the other and extended backwards until their rear guard were far out upon the plain beyond line after line and rank after rank they choked the neck of the valley with a long vista of tossing pennons twinkling lances waving plumes and streaming banderoles while the curvets and gambades of the chargers lent a constant motion and shimmer to the glittering manycolored mass a yell of exultation and a forest of waving steel through the length and breadth of their column announced that they could at last see their entrapped enemies while the swelling notes of a hundred bugles and drums mixed with the clash of moorish cymbals broke forth into a proud peal of martial triumph strange it was to these gallant and sparkling cavaliers of spain to look upon this handful of men upon the hill the thin lines of bowmen the knots of knights and menatarms with armor rusted and discolored from long service and to learn that these were indeed the soldiers whose fame and prowess had been the campfire talk of every army in christendom very still and silent they stood leaning upon their bows while their leaders took counsel together in front of them no clang of bugle rose from their stern ranks but in the centre waved the leopards of england on the right the ensign of their company with the roses of loring and on the left over three score of welsh bowmen there floated the red banner of merlin with the boarsheads of the buttesthorns gravely and sedately they stood beneath the morning sun waiting for the onslaught of their foemen  by saint paul said sir nigel gazing with puckered eye down the valley there appear to be some very worthy people among them what is this golden banner which waves upon the left  it is the ensign of the knights of calatrava answered felton  and the other upon the right  it marks the knights of santiago and i see by his flag that their grandmaster rides at their head there too is the banner of castile amid yonder sparkling squadron which heads the main battle there are six thousand menatarms with ten squadrons of slingers as far as i may judge their numbers  there are frenchmen among them my fair lord remarked black simon i can see the pennons of de couvette de brieux saint pol and many others who struck in against us for charles of blois  you are right said sir william for i can also see them there is much spanish blazonry also if i could but read it don diego you know the arms of your own land who are they who have done us this honor  the spanish prisoner looked with exultant eyes upon the deep and serried ranks of his countrymen  by saint james said he if ye fall this day ye fall by no mean hands for the flower of the knighthood of castile ride under the banner of don tello with the chivalry of asturias toledo leon cordova galicia and seville i see the guidons of albornez cacorla rodriguez tavora with the two great orders and the knights of france and of aragon if you will take my rede you will come to a composition with them for they will give you such terms as you have given me  nay by saint paul it were pity if so many brave men were drawn together and no little deed of arms to come of it ha william they advance upon us and by my soul it is a sight that is worth coming over the seas to see  as he spoke the two wings of the spanish host consisting of the knights of calatrava on the one side and of santiago upon the other came swooping swiftly down the valley while the main body followed more slowly behind five hundred paces from the english the two great bodies of horse crossed each other and sweeping round in a curve retired in feigned confusion towards their centre often in bygone wars had the moors tempted the hotblooded spaniards from their places of strength by such pretended flights but there were men upon the hill to whom every ruse an trick of war were as their daily trade and practice again and even nearer came the rallying spaniards and again with cry of fear and stooping bodies they swerved off to right and left but the english still stood stolid and observant among their rocks the vanguard halted a long bow shot from the hill and with waving spears and vaunting shouts challenged their enemies to come forth while two cavaliers pricking forward from the glittering ranks walked their horses slowly between the two arrays with targets braced and lances in rest like the challengers in a tourney  by saint paul cried sir nigel with his one eye glowing like an ember these appear to be two very worthy and debonair gentlemen i do not call to mind when i have seen any people who seemed of so great a heart and so high of enterprise we have our horses sir william shall we not relieve them of any vow which they may have upon their souls  feltons reply was to bound upon his charger and to urge it down the slope while sir nigel followed not three spearslengths behind him it was a rugged course rocky and uneven yet the two knights choosing their men dashed onwards at the top of their speed while the gallant spaniards flew as swiftly to meet them the one to whom felton found himself opposed was a tall stripling with a stags head upon his shield while sir nigels man was broad and squat with plain steel harness and a pink and white torse bound round his helmet the first struck felton on the target with such force as to split it from side to side but sir williams lance crashed through the camail which shielded the spaniards throat and he fell screaming hoarsely to the ground carried away by the heat and madness of fight the english knight never drew rein but charged straight on into the array of the knights of calatrava long time the silent ranks upon the hill could see a swirl and eddy deep down in the heart of the spanish column with a circle of rearing chargers and flashing blades here and there tossed the white plume of the english helmet rising and falling like the foam upon a wave with the fierce gleam and sparkle ever circling round it until at last it had sunk from view and another brave man had turned from war to peace  sir nigel meanwhile had found a foeman worthy of his steel for his opponent was none other than sebastian gomez the picked lance of the monkish knights of santiago who had won fame in a hundred bloody combats with the moors of andalusia so fierce was their meeting that their spears shivered up to the very grasp and the horses reared backwards until it seemed that they must crash down upon their riders yet with consummate horsemanship they both swung round in a long curvet and then plucking out their swords they lashed at each other like two lusty smiths hammering upon an anvil the chargers spun round each other biting and striking while the two blades wheeled and whizzed and circled in gleams of dazzling light cut parry and thrust followed so swiftly upon each other that the eye could not follow them until at last coming thigh to thigh they cast their arms around each other and rolled off their saddles to the ground the heavier spaniard threw himself upon his enemy and pinning him down beneath him raised his sword to slay him while a shout of triumph rose from the ranks of his countrymen but the fatal blow never fell for even as his arm quivered before descending the spaniard gave a shudder and stiffening himself rolled heavily over upon his side with the blood gushing from his armpit and from the slit of his vizor sir nigel sprang to his feet with his bloody dagger in his left hand and gazed down upon his adversary but that fatal and sudden stab in the vital spot which the spaniard had exposed by raising his arm had proved instantly mortal the englishman leaped upon his horse and made for the hill at the very instant that a yell of rage from a thousand voices and the clang of a score of bugles announced the spanish onset  but the islanders were ready and eager for the encounter with feet firmly planted their sleeves rolled back to give free play to their muscles their long yellow bowstaves in their left hands and their quivers slung to the front they had waited in the fourdeep harrow formation which gave strength to their array and yet permitted every man to draw his arrow freely without harm to those in front aylward and johnston had been engaged in throwing light tufts of grass into the air to gauge the wind force and a hoarse whisper passed down the ranks from the fileleaders to the men with scraps of advice and admonition  do not shoot outside the fifteenscore paces cried johnston we may need all our shafts ere we have done with them  better to overshoot than to undershoot added aylward better to strike the rear guard than to feather a shaft in the earth  loose quick and sharp when they come added another let it be the eye to the string the string to the shaft and the shaft to the mark by our lady their banners advance and we must hold our ground now if ever we are to see southampton water again  alleyne standing with his sword drawn amidst the archers saw a long toss and heave of the glittering squadrons then the front ranks began to surge slowly forward to trot to canter to gallop and in an instant the whole vast array was hurtling onward line after line the air full of the thunder of their cries the ground shaking with the beat of their hoots the valley choked with the rushing torrent of steel topped by the waving plumes the slanting spears and the fluttering banderoles on they swept over the level and up to the slope ere they met the blinding storm of the english arrows down went the whole ranks in a whirl of mad confusion horses plunging and kicking bewildered men falling rising staggering on or back while ever new lines of horsemen came spurring through the gaps and urged their chargers up the fatal slope all around him alleyne could hear the stern short orders of the masterbowmen while the air was filled with the keen twanging of the strings and the swish and patter of the shafts right across the foot of the hill there had sprung up a long wall of struggling horses and stricken men which ever grew and heightened as fresh squadrons poured on the attack one young knight on a gray jennet leaped over his fallen comrades and galloped swiftly up the hill shrieking loudly upon saint james ere he fell within a spearlength of the english line with the feathers of arrows thrusting out from every crevice and joint of his armor so for five long minutes the gallant horsemen of spain and of france strove ever and again to force a passage until the wailing note of a bugle called them back and they rode slowly out of bowshot leaving their best and their bravest in the ghastly bloodmottled heap behind them  but there was little rest for the victors whilst the knights had charged them in front the slingers had crept round upon either flank and had gained a footing upon the cliffs and behind the outlying rocks a storm of stones broke suddenly upon the defenders who drawn up in lines upon the exposed summit offered a fair mark to their hidden foes johnston the old archer was struck upon the temple and fell dead without a groan while fifteen of his bowmen and six of the menatarms were struck down at the same moment the others lay on their faces to avoid the deadly hail while at each side of the plateau a fringe of bowmen exchanged shots with the slingers and crossbowmen among the rocks aiming mainly at those who had swarmed up the cliffs and bursting into laughter and cheers when a wellaimed shaft brought one of their opponents toppling down from his lofty perch  i think nigel said sir oliver striding across to the little knight that we should all acquit ourselves better had we our nonemeat for the sun is high in the heaven  by saint paul quoth sir nigel plucking the patch from his eye i think that i am now clear of my vow for this spanish knight was a person from whom much honor might be won indeed he was a very worthy gentleman of good courage and great hardiness and it grieves me that he should have come by such a hurt as to what you say of food oliver it is not to be thought of for we have nothing with us upon the hill  nigel cried sir simon burley hurrying up with consternation upon his face aylward tells me that there are not tenscore arrows left in all their sheaves see they are springing from their horses and cutting their sollerets that they may rush upon us might we not even now make a retreat  my soul will retreat from my body first cried the little knight here i am and here i bide while god gives me strength to lift a sword  and so say i shouted sir oliver throwing his mace high into the air and catching it again by the handle  to your arms men roared sir nigel shoot while you may and then out sword and let us live or die together    chapter xxxvii how the white company came to be disbanded   then up rose from the hill in the rugged cantabrian valley a sound such as had not been heard in those parts before nor was again until the streams which rippled amid the rocks had been frozen by over four hundred winters and thawed by as many returning springs deep and full and strong it thundered down the ravine the fierce battlecall of a warrior race the last stern welcome to whoso should join with them in that worldold game where the stake is death thrice it swelled forth and thrice it sank away echoing and reverberating amidst the crags then with set faces the company rose up among the storm of stones and looked down upon the thousands who sped swiftly up the slope against them horse and spear had been set aside but on foot with sword and battleaxe their broad shields slung in front of them the chivalry of spain rushed to the attack  and now arose a struggle so fell so long so evenly sustained that even now the memory of it is handed down amongst the cantabrian mountaineers and the illomened knoll is still pointed out by fathers to their children as the altura de los inglesos where the men from across the sea fought the great fight with the knights of the south the last arrow was quickly shot nor could the slingers hurl their stones so close were friend and foe from side to side stretched the thin line of the english lightly armed and quickfooted while against it stormed and raged the pressing throng of fiery spaniards and of gallant bretons the clink of crossing swordblades the dull thudding of heavy blows the panting and gasping of weary and wounded men all rose together in a wild longdrawn note which swelled upwards to the ears of the wondering peasants who looked down from the edges of the cliffs upon the swaying turmoil of the battle beneath them back and forward reeled the leopard banner now borne up the slope by the rush and weight of the onslaught now pushing downwards again as sir nigel burley and black simon with their veteran menat arms flung themselves madly into the fray alleyne at his lords right hand found himself swept hither and thither in the desperate struggle exchanging savage thrusts one instant with a spanish cavalier and the next torn away by the whirl of men and dashed up against some new antagonist to the right sir oliver aylward hordle john and the bowmen of the company fought furiously against the monkish knights of santiago who were led up the hill by their priora great deepchested man who wore a brown monastic habit over his suit of mail three archers he slew in three giant strokes but sir oliver flung his arms round him and the two staggering and straining reeled backwards and fell locked in each others grasp over the edge of the steep cliff which flanked the hill in vain his knights stormed and raved against the thin line which barred their path the sword of aylward and the great axe of john gleamed in the forefront of the battle and huge jagged pieces of rock hurled by the strong arms of the bowmen crashed and hurtled amid their ranks slowly they gave back down the hill the archers still hanging upon their skirts with a long litter of writhing and twisted figures to mark the course which they had taken at the same instant the welshmen upon the left led on by the scotch earl had charged out from among the rocks which sheltered them and by the fury of their outfall had driven the spaniards in front of them in headlong flight down the hill in the centre only things seemed to be going ill with the defenders black simon was downdying as he would wish to have died like a grim old wolf in its lair with a ring of his slain around him twice sir nigel had been overborne and twice alleyne had fought over him until he had staggered to his feet once more burley lay senseless stunned by a blow from a mace and half of the menatarms lay littered upon the ground around him sir nigels shield was broken his crest shorn his armor cut and smashed and the vizor torn from his helmet yet he sprang hither and thither with light foot and ready hand engaging two bretons and a spaniard at the same instantthrusting stooping dashing in springing outwhile alleyne still fought by his side stemming with a handful of men the fierce tide which surged up against them yet it would have fared ill with them had not the archers from either side closed in upon the flanks of the attackers and pressed them very slowly and foot by foot down the long slope until they were on the plain once more where their fellows were already rallying for a fresh assault  but terrible indeed was the cost at which the last had been repelled of the three hundred and seventy men who had held the crest one hundred and seventytwo were left standing many of whom were sorely wounded and weak from loss of blood sir oliver buttesthorn sir richard causton sir simon burley black simon johnston a hundred and fifty archers and fortyseven menatarms had fallen while the pitiless hail of stones was already whizzing and piping once more about their ears threatening every instant to further reduce their numbers  sir nigel looked about him at his shattered ranks and his face flushed with a soldiers pride  by st paul he cried i have fought in many a little bickering but never one that i would be more loth to have missed than this but you are wounded alleyne  it is nought answered his squire stanching the blood which dripped from a swordcut across his forehead  these gentlemen of spain seem to be most courteous and worthy people i see that they are already forming to continue this debate with us form up the bowmen two deep instead of four by my faith some very brave men have gone from among us aylward you are a trusty soldier for all that your shoulder has never felt accolade nor your heels worn the gold spurs do you take charge of the right i will hold the centre and you my lord of angus the left  ho for sir samkin aylward cried a rough voice among the archers and a roar of laughter greeted their new leader  by my hilt said the old bowman i never thought to lead a wing in a stricken field stand close camarades for by these fingerbones we must play the man this day  come hither alleyne said sir nigel walking back to the edge of the cliff which formed the rear of their position and you norbury he continued beckoning to the squire of sir oliver do you also come here  the two squires hurried across to him and the three stood looking down into the rocky ravine which lay a hundred and fifty feet beneath them  the prince must hear of how things are with us said the knight another onfall we may withstand but they are many and we are few so that the time must come when we can no longer form line across the hill yet if help were brought us we might hold the crest until it comes see yonder horses which stray among the rocks beneath us  i see them my fair lord  and see yonder path which winds along the hill upon the further end of the valley  i see it  were you on those horses and riding up yonder track steep and rough as it is i think that ye might gain the valley beyond then on to the prince and tell him how we fare  but my fair lord how can we hope to reach the horses asked norbury  ye cannot go round to them for they would be upon ye ere ye could come to them think ye that ye have heart enough to clamber down this cliff  had we but a rope  there is one here it is but one hundred feet long and for the rest ye must trust to god and to your fingers can you try it alleyne  with all my heart my dear lord but how can i leave you in such a strait  nay it is to serve me that ye go and you norbury  the silent squire said nothing but he took up the rope and having examined it he tied one end firmly round a projecting rock then he cast off his breastplate thigh pieces and greaves while alleyne followed his example  tell chandos or calverley or knolles should the prince have gone forward cried sir nigel now may god speed ye for ye are brave and worthy men  it was indeed a task which might make the heart of the bravest sink within him the thin cord dangling down the face of the brown cliff seemed from above to reach little more than halfway down it beyond stretched the rugged rock wet and shining with a green tuft here and there thrusting out from it but little sign of ridge or foothold far below the jagged points of the boulders bristled up dark and menacing norbury tugged thrice with all his strength upon the cord and then lowered himself over the edge while a hundred anxious faces peered over at him as he slowly clambered downwards to the end of the rope twice he stretched out his foot and twice he failed to reach the point at which he aimed but even as he swung himself for a third effort a stone from a sling buzzed like a wasp from amid the rocks and struck him full upon the side of his head his grasp relaxed his feet slipped and in an instant he was a crushed and mangled corpse upon the sharp ridges beneath him  if i have no better fortune said alleyne leading sir nigel aside i pray you my dear lord that you will give my humble service to the lady maude and say to her that i was ever her true servant and most unworthy cavalier  the old knight said no word but he put a hand on either shoulder and kissed his squire with the tears shining in his eyes alleyne sprang to the rope and sliding swiftly down soon found himself at its extremity from above it seemed as though rope and cliff were wellnigh touching but now when swinging a hundred feet down the squire found that he could scarce reach the face of the rock with his foot and that it was as smooth as glass with no restingplace where a mouse could stand some three feet lower however his eye lit upon a long jagged crack which slanted downwards and this he must reach if he would save not only his own poor life but that of the eightscore men above him yet it were madness to spring for that narrow slit with nought but the wet smooth rock to cling to he swung for a moment full of thought and even as he hung there another of the hellish stones sang through his curls and struck a chip from the face of the cliff up he clambered a few feet drew up the loose end after him unslung his belt held on with knee and with elbow while he spliced the long tough leathern belt to the end of the cord then lowering himself as far as he could go he swung backwards and forwards until his hand reached the crack when he left the rope and clung to the face of the cliff another stone struck him on the side and he heard a sound like a breaking stick with a keen stabbing pain which shot through his chest yet it was no time now to think of pain or ache there was his lord and his eightscore comrades and they must be plucked from the jaws of death on he clambered with his hand shuffling down the long sloping crack sometimes bearing all his weight upon his arms at others finding some small shelf or tuft on which to rest his foot would he never pass over that fifty feet he dared not look down and could but grope slowly onwards his face to the cliff his fingers clutching his feet scraping and feeling for a support every vein and crack and mottling of that face of rock remained forever stamped upon his memory at last however his foot came upon a broad restingplace and he ventured to cast a glance downwards thank god he had reached the highest of those fatal pinnacles upon which his comrade had fallen quickly now he sprang from rock to rock until his feet were on the ground and he had his hand stretched out for the horses rein when a slingstone struck him on the head and he dropped senseless upon the ground  an evil blow it was for alleyne but a worse one still for him who struck it the spanish slinger seeing the youth lie slain and judging from his dress that he was no common man rushed forward to plunder him knowing well that the bowmen above him had expended their last shaft he was still three paces however from his victims side when john upon the cliff above plucked up a huge boulder and poising it for an instant dropped it with fatal aim upon the slinger beneath him it struck upon his shoulder and hurled him crushed and screaming to the ground while alleyne recalled to his senses by these shrill cries in his very ear staggered on to his feet and gazed wildly about him his eyes fell upon the horses grazing upon the scanty pasture and in an instant all had come back to himhis mission his comrades the need for haste he was dizzy sick faint but he must not die and he must not tarry for his life meant many lives that day in an instant he was in his saddle and spurring down the valley loud rang the swift chargers hoofs over rock and reef while the fire flew from the stroke of iron and the loose stones showered up behind him but his head was whirling round the blood was gushing from his brow his temple his mouth ever keener and sharper was the deadly pain which shot like a redhot arrow through his side he felt that his eye was glazing his senses slipping from him his grasp upon the reins relaxing then with one mighty effort he called up all his strength for a single minute stooping down he loosened the stirrupstraps bound his knees tightly to his saddleflaps twisted his hands in the bridle and then putting the gallant horses head for the mountain path he dashed the spurs in and fell forward fainting with his face buried in the coarse black mane  little could he ever remember of that wild ride half conscious but ever with the one thought beating in his mind he goaded the horse onwards rushing swiftly down steep ravines over huge boulders along the edges of black abysses dim memories he had of beetling cliffs of a group of huts with wondering faces at the doors of foaming clattering water and of a bristle of mountain beeches once ere he had ridden far he heard behind him three deep sullen shouts which told him that his comrades had set their faces to the foe once more then all was blank until he woke to find kindly blue english eyes peering down upon him and to hear the blessed sound of his countrys speech they were but a foraging partya hundred archers and as many menatarmsbut their leader was sir hugh calverley and he was not a man to bide idle when good blows were to be had not three leagues from him a scout was sent flying with a message to the camp and sir hugh with his two hundred men thundered off to the rescue with them went alleyne still bound to his saddle still dripping with blood and swooning and recovering and swooning once again on they rode and on until at last topping a ridge they looked down upon the fateful valley alas and alas for the sight that met their eyes  there beneath them was the bloodbathed hill and from the highest pinnacle there flaunted the yellow and white banner with the lions and the towers of the royal house of castile up the long slope rushed ranks and ranks of men exultant shouting with waving pennons and brandished arms over the whole summit were dense throngs of knights with no enemy that could be seen to face them save only that at one corner of the plateau an eddy and swirl amid the crowded mass seemed to show that all resistance was not yet at an end at the sight a deep groan of rage and of despair went up from the baffled rescuers and spurring on their horses they clattered down the long and winding path which led to the valley beneath  but they were too late to avenge as they had been too late to save long ere they could gain the level ground the spaniards seeing them riding swiftly amid the rocks and being ignorant of their numbers drew off from the captured hill and having secured their few prisoners rode slowly in a long column with drumbeating and cymbalclashing out of the valley their rear ranks were already passing out of sight ere the newcomers were urging their panting foaming horses up the slope which had been the scene of that long drawn and bloody fight  and a fearsome sight it was that met their eyes across the lower end lay the dense heap of men and horses where the first arrowstorm had burst above the bodies of the dead and the dyingfrench spanish and aragoneselay thick and thicker until they covered the whole ground two and three deep in one dreadful tangle of slaughter above them lay the englishmen in their lines even as they had stood and higher yet upon the plateau a wild medley of the dead of all nations where the last deadly grapple had left them in the further corner under the shadow of a great rock there crouched seven bowmen with great john in the centre of themall wounded weary and in sorry case but still unconquered with their bloodstained weapons waving and their voices ringing a welcome to their countrymen alleyne rode across to john while sir hugh calverley followed close behind him  by saint george cried sir hugh i have never seen signs of so stern a fight and i am right glad that we have been in time to save you  you have saved more than us said john pointing to the banner which leaned against the rock behind him  you have done nobly cried the old free companion gazing with a soldiers admiration at the huge frame and bold face of the archer but why is it my good fellow that you sit upon this man  by the rood i had forgot him john answered rising and dragging from under him no less a person than the spanish caballero don diego alvarez this man my fair lord means to me a new house ten cows one bullif it be but a little onea grindstone and i know not what besides so that i thought it well to sit upon him lest he should take a fancy to leave me  tell me john cried alleyne faintly where is my dear lord sir nigel loring  he is dead i fear i saw them throw his body across a horse and ride away with it but i fear the life had gone from him  now woe worth me and where is aylward  he sprang upon a riderless horse and rode after sir nigel to save him i saw them throng around him and he is either taken or slain  blow the bugles cried sir hugh with a scowling brow we must back to camp and ere three days i trust that we may see these spaniards again i would fain have ye all in my company  we are of the white company my fair lord said john  nay the white company is here disbanded answered sir hugh solemnly looking round him at the lines of silent figures look to the brave squire for i fear that he will never see the sun rise again    chapter xxxviii of the homecoming to hampshire   it was a bright july morning four months after that fatal fight in the spanish barranca a blue heaven stretched above a green rolling plain undulated below intersected with hedgerows and flecked with grazing sheep the sun was yet low in the heaven and the red cows stood in the long shadow of the elms chewing the cud and gazing with great vacant eyes at two horsemen who were spurring it down the long white road which dipped and curved away back to where the towers and pinnacles beneath the flattopped hill marked the old town of winchester  of the riders one was young graceful and fair clad in plain doublet and hosen of blue brussels cloth which served to show his active and wellknit figure a flat velvet cap was drawn forward to keep the glare from his eyes and he rode with lips compressed and anxious face as one who has much care upon his mind young as he was and peaceful as was his dress the dainty golden spurs which twinkled upon his heels proclaimed his knighthood while a long seam upon his brow and a scar upon his temple gave a manly grace to his refined and delicate countenance his comrade was a large redheaded man upon a great black horse with a huge canvas bag slung from his saddlebow which jingled and clinked with every movement of his steed his broad brown face was lighted up by a continual smile and he looked slowly from side to side with eyes which twinkled and shone with delight well might john rejoice for was he not back in his native hampshire had he not don diegos five thousand crowns rasping against his knee and above all was he not himself squire now to sir alleyne edricson the young socman of minstead lately knighted by the sword of the black prince himself and esteemed by the whole army as one of the most rising of the soldiers of england  for the last stand of the company had been told throughout christendom wherever a brave deed of arms was loved and honors had flowed in upon the few who had survived it for two months alleyne had wavered betwixt death and life with a broken rib and a shattered head yet youth and strength and a cleanly life were all upon his side and he awoke from his long delirium to find that the war was over that the spaniards and their allies had been crushed at navaretta and that the prince had himself heard the tale of his ride for succor and had come in person to his bedside to touch his shoulder with his sword and to insure that so brave and true a man should die if he could not live within the order of chivalry the instant that he could set foot to ground alleyne had started in search of his lord but no word could he hear of him dead or alive and he had come home now sadhearted in the hope of raising money upon his estates and so starting upon his quest once more landing at london he had hurried on with a mind full of care for he had heard no word from hampshire since the short note which had announced his brothers death  by the rood cried john looking around him exultantly where have we seen since we left such noble cows such fleecy sheep grass so green or a man so drunk as yonder rogue who lies in the gap of the hedge  ah john alleyne answered wearily it is well for you but i never thought that my homecoming would be so sad a one my heart is heavy for my dear lord and for aylward and i know not how i may break the news to the lady mary and to the lady maude if they have not yet had tidings of it  john gave a groan which made the horses shy it is indeed a black business said he but be not sad for i shall give half these crowns to my old mother and half will i add to the money which you may have and so we shall buy that yellow cog wherein we sailed to bordeaux and in it we shall go forth and seek sir nigel  alleyne smiled but shook his head were he alive we should have had word of him ere now said he but what is this town before us  why it is romsey cried john see the tower of the old gray church and the long stretch of the nunnery but here sits a very holy man and i shall give him a crown for his prayers  three large stones formed a rough cot by the roadside and beside it basking in the sun sat the hermit with claycolored face dull eyes and long withered hands with crossed ankles and sunken head he sat as though all his life had passed out of him with the beads slipping slowly through his thin yellow fingers behind him lay the narrow cell clayfloored and damp comfortless profitless and sordid beyond it there lay amid the trees the wattleanddaub hut of a laborer the door open and the single room exposed to the view the man ruddy and yellowhaired stood leaning upon the spade wherewith he had been at work upon the garden patch from behind him came the ripple of a happy womans laughter and two young urchins darted forth from the hut barelegged and towsy while the mother stepping out laid her hand upon her husbands arm and watched the gambols of the children the hermit frowned at the untoward noise which broke upon his prayers but his brow relaxed as he looked upon the broad silver piece which john held out to him  there lies the image of our past and of our future cried alleyne as they rode on upon their way now which is better to till gods earth to have happy faces round ones knee and to love and be loved or to sit forever moaning over ones own soul like a mother over a sick babe  i know not about that said john for it casts a great cloud over me when i think of such matters but i know that my crown was well spent for the man had the look of a very holy person as to the other there was nought holy about him that i could see and it would be cheaper for me to pray for myself than to give a crown to one who spent his days in digging for lettuces  ere alleyne could answer there swung round the curve of the road a ladys carriage drawn by three horses abreast with a postilion upon the outer one very fine and rich it was with beams painted and gilt wheels and spokes carved in strange figures and over all an arched cover of red and white tapestry beneath its shade there sat a stout and elderly lady in a pink cotehardie leaning back among a pile of cushions and plucking out her eyebrows with a small pair of silver tweezers none could seem more safe and secure and at her ease than this lady yet here also was a symbol of human life for in an instant even as alleyne reined aside to let the carriage pass a wheel flew out from among its fellows and over it all toppledcarving tapestry and giltin one wild heap with the horses plunging the postilion shouting and the lady screaming from within in an instant alleyne and john were on foot and had lifted her forth all in a shake with fear but little the worse for her mischance  now woe worth me she cried and ill fall on michael easover of romsey for i told him that the pin was loose and yet he must needs gainsay me like the foolish daffe that he is  i trust that you have taken no hurt my fair lady said alleyne conducting her to the bank upon which john had already placed a cushion  nay i have had no scath though i have lost my silver tweezers now lackaday did god ever put breath into such a fool as michael easover of romsey but i am much beholden to you gentle sirs soldiers ye are as one may readily see i am myself a soldiers daughter she added casting a somewhat languishing glance at john and my heart ever goes out to a brave man  we are indeed fresh from spain quoth alleyne  from spain say you ah it was an ill and sorry thing that so many should throw away the lives that heaven gave them in sooth it is bad for those who fall but worse for those who bide behind i have but now bid farewell to one who hath lost all in this cruel war  and how that lady  she is a young damsel of these parts and she goes now into a nunnery alack it is not a year since she was the fairest maid from avon to itchen and now it was more than i could abide to wait at romsey nunnery to see her put the white veil upon her face for she was made for a wife and not for the cloister did you ever gentle sir hear of a body of men called the white company over yonder  surely so cried both the comrades  her father was the leader of it and her lover served under him as squire news hath come that not one of the company was left alive and so poor lamb she hath  lady cried alleyne with catching breath is it the lady maude loring of whom you speak  it is in sooth  maude and in a nunnery did then the thought of her fathers death so move her  her father cried the lady smiling nay maude is a good daughter but i think it was this young goldenhaired squire of whom i have heard who has made her turn her back upon the world  and i stand talking here cried alleyne wildly come john come  rushing to his horse he swung himself into the saddle and was off down the road in a rolling cloud of dust as fast as his good steed could bear him  great had been the rejoicing amid the romsey nuns when the lady maude loring had craved admission into their orderfor was she not sole child and heiress of the old knight with farms and fiefs which she could bring to the great nunnery long and earnest had been the talks of the gaunt lady abbess in which she had conjured the young novice to turn forever from the world and to rest her bruised heart under the broad and peaceful shelter of the church and now when all was settled and when abbess and lady superior had had their will it was but fitting that some pomp and show should mark the glad occasion hence was it that the good burghers of romsey were all in the streets that gay flags and flowers brightened the path from the nunnery to the church and that a long procession wound up to the old arched door leading up the bride to these spiritual nuptials there was laysister agatha with the high gold crucifix and the three incensebearers and the twoandtwenty garbed in white who cast flowers upon either side of them and sang sweetly the while then with four attendants came the novice her drooping head wreathed with white blossoms and behind the abbess and her council of older nuns who were already counting in their minds whether their own bailiff could manage the farms of twynham or whether a reeve would be needed beneath him to draw the utmost from these new possessions which this young novice was about to bring them  but alas for plots and plans when love and youth and nature and above all fortune are arrayed against them who is this travelstained youth who dares to ride so madly through the lines of staring burghers why does he fling himself from his horse and stare so strangely about him see how he has rushed through the incensebearers thrust aside laysister agatha scattered the twoandtwenty damosels who sang so sweetlyand he stands before the novice with his hands outstretched and his face shining and the light of love in his gray eyes her foot is on the very lintel of the church and yet he bars the wayand she she thinks no more of the wise words and holy rede of the lady abbess but she hath given a sobbing cry and hath fallen forward with his arms around her drooping body and her wet cheek upon his breast a sorry sight this for the gaunt abbess an ill lesson too for the stainless twoandtwenty who have ever been taught that the way of nature is the way of sin but maude and alleyne care little for this a dank cold air comes out from the black arch before them without the sun shines bright and the birds are singing amid the ivy on the drooping beeches their choice is made and they turn away handinhand with their backs to the darkness and their faces to the light  very quiet was the wedding in the old priory church at christchurch where father christopher read the service and there were few to see save the lady loring and john and a dozen bowmen from the castle the lady of twynham had drooped and pined for weary months so that her face was harsher and less comely than before yet she still hoped on for her lord had come through so many dangers that she could scarce believe that he might be stricken down at last it had been her wish to start for spain and to search for him but alleyne had persuaded her to let him go in her place there was much to look after now that the lands of minstead were joined to those of twynham and alleyne had promised her that if she would but bide with his wife he would never come back to hampshire again until he had gained some news good or ill of her lord and lover  the yellow cog had been engaged with goodwin hawtayne in command and a month after the wedding alleyne rode down to bucklershard to see if she had come round yet from southampton on the way he passed the fishing village of pitts deep and marked that a little creyer or brig was tacking off the land as though about to anchor there on his way back as he rode towards the village he saw that she had indeed anchored and that many boats were round her bearing cargo to the shore  a bowshot from pitts deep there was an inn a little back from the road very large and widespread with a great green bush hung upon a pole from one of the upper windows at this window he marked as he rode up that a man was seated who appeared to be craning his neck in his direction alleyne was still looking up at him when a woman came rushing from the open door of the inn and made as though she would climb a tree looking back the while with a laughing face wondering what these doings might mean alleyne tied his horse to a tree and was walking amid the trunks towards the inn when there shot from the entrance a second woman who made also for the trees close at her heels came a burly brownfaced man who leaned against the doorpost and laughed loudly with his hand to his side ah mes belles he cried and is it thus you treat me ah mes petites i swear by these fingerbones that i would not hurt a hair of your pretty heads but i have been among the black paynim and by my hilt it does me good to look at your english cheeks come drink a stoup of muscadine with me mes anges for my heart is warm to be among ye again  at the sight of the man alleyne had stood staring but at the sound of his voice such a thrill of joy bubbled up in his heart that he had to bite his lip to keep himself from shouting outright but a deeper pleasure yet was in store even as he looked the window above was pushed outwards and the voice of the man whom he had seen there came out from it aylward cried the voice i have seen just now a very worthy person come down the road though my eyes could scarce discern whether he carried coatarmor i pray you to wait upon him and tell him that a very humble knight of england abides here so that if he be in need of advancement or have any small vow upon his soul or desire to exalt his lady i may help him to accomplish it  aylward at this order came shuffling forward amid the trees and in an instant the two men were clinging in each others arms laughing and shouting and patting each other in their delight while old sir nigel came running with his sword under the impression that some small bickering had broken out only to embrace and be embraced himself until all three were hoarse with their questions and outcries and congratulations  on their journey home through the woods alleyne learnt their wondrous story how when sir nigel came to his senses he with his fellowcaptive had been hurried to the coast and conveyed by sea to their captors castle how upon the way they had been taken by a barbary rover and how they exchanged their light captivity for a seat on a galley bench and hard labor at the pirates oars how in the port at barbary sir nigel had slain the moorish captain and had swum with aylward to a small coaster which they had taken and so made their way to england with a rich cargo to reward them for their toils all this alleyne listened to until the dark keep of twynham towered above them in the gloaming and they saw the red sun lying athwart the rippling avon no need to speak of the glad hearts at twynham castle that night nor of the rich offerings from out that moorish cargo which found their way to the chapel of father christopher  sir nigel loring lived for many years full of honor and laden with every blessing he rode no more to the wars but he found his way to every jousting within thirty miles and the hampshire youth treasured it as the highest honor when a word of praise fell from him as to their management of their horses or their breaking of their lances so he lived and so he died the most revered and the happiest man in all his native shire  for sir alleyne edricson and for his beautiful bride the future had also naught but what was good twice he fought in france and came back each time laden with honors a high place at court was given to him and he spent many years at windsor under the second richard and the fourth henrywhere he received the honor of the garter and won the name of being a brave soldier a truehearted gentleman and a great lover and patron of every art and science which refines or ennobles life  as to john he took unto himself a village maid and settled in lyndhurst where his five thousand crowns made him the richest franklin for many miles around for many years he drank his ale every night at the pied merlin which was now kept by his friend aylward who had wedded the good widow to whom he had committed his plunder the strong men and the bowmen of the country round used to drop in there of an evening to wrestle a fall with john or to shoot a round with aylward but though a silver shilling was to be the prize of the victory it has never been reported that any man earned much money in that fashion so they lived these men in their own lusty cheery fashionrude and rough but honest kindly and true let us thank god if we have outgrown their vices let us pray to god that we may ever hold their virtues the sky may darken and the clouds may gather and again the day may come when britain may have sore need of her children on whatever shore of the sea they be found shall they not muster at her call
