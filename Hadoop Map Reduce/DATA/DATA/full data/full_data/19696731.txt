 some  account  of the  family  of  armine   and      especially of sir ferdinand and of sir ratcliffe  the family of armine entered england with william the norman ralph darmyn was standardbearer of the conqueror and shared prodigally in the plunder as appears by doomsday book at the time of the general survey the family of ermyn or armyn possessed numerous manors in nottinghamshire and several in the shire of lincoln william darmyn lord of the honour of armyn was one of the subscribing barons to the great charter his predecessor died in the holy land before ascalon a succession of stout barons and valiant knights maintained the high fortunes of the family and in the course of the various struggles with france they obtained possession of several fair castles in guienne and gascony in the wars of the roses the armyns sided with the house of lancaster ferdinand armyn who shared the exile of henry the seventh was knighted on bosworth field and soon after created earl of tewkesbury faithful to the church the second lord tewkesbury became involved in one of those numerous risings that harassed the last years of henry the eighth the rebellion was unsuccessful lord tewkesbury was beheaded his blood attainted and his numerous estates forfeited to the crown a younger branch of the family who had adopted protestantism married the daughter of sir francis walsingham and attracted by his talents in negotiation the notice of queen elizabeth he was sent on a secret mission to the low countries where having greatly distinguished himself he obtained on his return the restoration of the family estate of armine in nottinghamshire to which he retired after an eminently prosperous career and amused the latter years of his life in the construction of a family mansion built in that national style of architecture since described by the name of his royal mistress at once magnificent and convenient his son sir walsingham armine figured in the first batch of baronets under james the first  during the memorable struggle between the crown and the commons in the reign of the unhappy charles the armine family became distinguished cavaliers the second sir walsingham raised a troop of horse and gained great credit by charging at the head of his regiment and defeating sir arthur haselriggs cuirassiers it was the first time that that impenetrable band had been taught to fly but the conqueror was covered with wounds the same sir walsingham also successfully defended armine house against the commons and commanded the cavalry at the battle of newbury where two of his brothers were slain for these various services and sufferings sir walsingham was advanced to the dignity of a baron of the realm by the title of lord armine of armine in the county of nottingham he died without issue but the baronetcy devolved on his youngest brother sir ferdinando  the armine family who had relapsed into popery followed the fortunes of the second james and the head of the house died at st germain his son however had been prudent enough to remain in england and support the new dynasty by which means he contrived to secure his title and estates roman catholics however the armines always remained and this circumstance accounts for this oncedistinguished family no longer figuring in the history of their country so far therefore as the house of armine was concerned time flew during the next century with immemorable wing the family led a secluded life on their estate intermarrying only with the great catholic families and duly begetting baronets  at length arose in the person of the last sir ferdinand armine one of those extraordinary and rarely gifted beings who require only an opportunity to influence the fortunes of their nation and to figure as a c√¶sar or an alcibiades beautiful brilliant and ambitious the young and restless armine quitted in his eighteenth year the house of his fathers and his stepdame of a country and entered the imperial service his blood and creed gained him a flattering reception his skill and valour soon made him distinguished the world rang with stories of his romantic bravery his gallantries his eccentric manners and his political intrigues for he nearly contrived to be elected king of poland whether it were disgust at being foiled in this high object by the influence of austria or whether as was much whispered at the time he had dared to urge his insolent and unsuccessful suit on a still more delicate subject to the empress queen herself certain it is that sir ferdinand suddenly quitted the imperial service and appeared at constantinople in person the man whom a point of honour prevented from becoming a protestant in his native country had no scruples about his profession of faith at stamboul certain it is that the english baronet soon rose high in the favour of the sultan assumed the turkish dress conformed to the turkish customs and finally led against austria a division of the turkish army having gratified his pique by defeating the imperial forces in a sanguinary engagement and obtaining a favourable peace for the porte sir ferdinand armine doffed his turban and suddenly reappeared in his native country after the sketch we have given of the last ten years of his life it is unnecessary to observe that sir ferdinand armine immediately became what is called fashionable and as he was now in protestant england the empire of fashion was the only one in which the young catholic could distinguish himself let us then charitably set down to the score of his political disabilities the fantastic dissipation and the frantic prodigality in which the liveliness of his imagination and the energy of his soul exhausted themselves after three startling years he married the lady barbara ratcliffe whose previous divorce from her husband the earl of faulconville sir ferdinand had occasioned he was however separated from his lady during the first year of their more hallowed union and retiring to rome sir ferdinand became apparently devout at the end of a year he offered to transfer the whole of his property to the church provided the pope would allow him an annuity and make him a cardinal his holiness not deeming it fit to consent to the proposition sir ferdinand quitted his capital in a huff and returning to england laid claim to the peerages of tewkesbury and armine although assured of failing in these claims and himself perhaps as certain of ill success as his lawyers sir ferdinand nevertheless expended upwards of 60000l in their promotion and was amply repaid for the expenditure in the gratification of his vanity by keeping his name before the public he was never content except when he was astonishing mankind and while he was apparently exerting all his efforts to become a king of poland a roman cardinal or an english peer the crown the coronet and the scarlet hat were in truth ever secondary points with him compared to the sensation throughout europe which the effort was contrived and calculated to ensure  on his second return to his native country sir ferdinand had not reentered society for such a man society with all its superficial excitement and all the shadowy variety with which it attempts to cloud the essential monotony of its nature was intolerably dull and commonplace sir ferdinand on the contrary shut himself up in armine having previously announced to the world that he was going to write his memoirs this history the construction of a castle and the prosecution of his claims before the house of lords apparently occupied his time to his satisfaction for he remained quiet for several years until on the breaking out of the french revolution he hastened to paris became a member of the jacobin club and of the national convention the name of citizen armine appears among the regicides perhaps in this vote he avenged the loss of the crown of poland and the still more mortifying repulse he may have received from the mother of marie antoinette after the execution of the royal victims however it was discovered that citizen armine had made them an offer to save their lives and raise an insurrection in la vendue provided he was made lieutenantgeneral of the kingdom at his trial which from the nature of the accusation and the character of the accused occasioned to his gratification a great sensation he made no effort to defend himself but seemed to glory in the chivalric crime he was hurried to the guillotine and met his fate with the greatest composure assuring the public with a mysterious air that had he lived fourandtwenty hours longer everything would have been arranged and the troubles which he foresaw impending for europe prevented so successfully had armine played his part that his mysterious and doubtful career occasioned a controversy from which only the appearance of napoleon distracted universal attention and which indeed only wholly ceased within these few years what were his intentions was he or was he not a sincere jacobin if he made the offer to the royal family why did he vote for their death was he resolved at all events to be at the head of one of the parties a middle course would not suit such a man and so on interminable were the queries and their solutions the pamphlets and the memoirs which the conduct of this vain man occasioned and which must assuredly have appeased his manes recently it has been discovered that the charge brought against armine was perfectly false and purely malicious its victim however could not resist the dazzling celebrity of the imaginary crime and he preferred the reputation of closing his career by conduct which at once perplexed and astonished mankind to a vindication which would have deprived his name of some brilliant accessories and spared him to a life of which he was perhaps wearied  by the unhappy victim of his vanity and passion sir ferdinand armine left one child a son whom he had never seen now sir ratcliffe brought up in sadness and in seclusion education had faithfully developed the characteristics of a reserved and melancholy mind pride of lineage and sentiments of religion which even in early youth darkened into bigotry were not incompatible with strong affections a stern sense of duty and a spirit of chivalric honour limited in capacity he was however firm in purpose trembling at the name of his father and devoted to the unhappy parent whose presence he had scarcely ever quitted a word of reproach had never escaped his lips against the chieftain of his blood and one too whose career how little soever his child could sympathise with it still maintained in mens mouths and minds the name and memory of the house of armine at the death of his father sir ratcliffe had just attained his majority and he succeeded to immense estates encumbered with mortgages and to considerable debts which his feelings of honour would have compelled him to discharge had they indeed been enforced by no other claim the estates of the family on their restoration had not been entailed but until sir ferdinand no head of the house had abused the confidence of his ancestors and the vast possessions of the house of armine had descended unimpaired and unimpaired so far as he was concerned sir ratcliffe determined they should remain although by the sale of the estates not only the encumbrances and liabilities might have been discharged but himself left in possession of a moderate independence sir ratcliffe at once resolved to part with nothing fresh sums were raised for the payment of the debts and the mortgages now consumed nearly the whole rental of the lands on which they were secured sir ratcliffe obtained for himself only an annuity of three hundred per annum which he presented to his mother in addition to the small portion which she had received on her first marriage and for himself visiting armine place for the first time he roamed for a few days with sad complacency about that magnificent demesne and then taking down from the walls of the magnificent hall the sabre with which his father had defeated the imperial host he embarked for cadiz and shortly after his arrival obtained a commission in the spanish service  although the hereditary valour of the armines had descended to their forlorn representative it is not probable that under any circumstances sir ratcliffe would have risen to any eminence in the country of his temporary adoption his was not one of those minds born to command and to create and his temper was too proud to serve and to solicit his residence in spain however was not altogether without satisfaction it was during this sojourn that he gained the little knowledge of life and human nature he possessed and the creed and solemn manners of the land harmonised with his faith and habits among these strangers too the proud young englishman felt not so keenly the degradation of his house and sometimes though his was not the fatal gift of imagination sometimes he indulged in day dreams of its rise unpractised in business and not gifted with that intuitive quickness which supplies experience and often baffles it ratcliffe armine who had not quitted the domestic hearth even for the purposes of education was yet fortunate enough to possess a devoted friend and this was glastonbury his tutor and confessor to his mother it was to him that sir ratcliffe intrusted the management of his affairs with a confidence which was deserved for glastonbury sympathised with all his feelings and was so wrapped up in the glory of the family that he had no greater ambition in life than to become their historiographer and had been for years employed in amassing materials for a great work dedicated to their celebrity  when ratcliffe armine had been absent about three years his mother died her death was unexpected she had not fulfilled twothirds of the allotted period of the psalmist and in spite of many sorrows she was still beautiful glastonbury who communicated to him the intelligence in a letter in which he vainly attempted to suppress his own overwhelming affliction counselled his immediate return to england if but for a season and the unhappy ratcliffe followed his advice by the death of his mother sir ratcliffe armine became possessed for the first time of a small but still an independent income and having paid a visit soon after his return to his native country to a catholic nobleman to whom his acquaintance had been of some use when travelling in spain he became enamored of one of his daughters and his passion being returned and not disapproved by the father he was soon after married to constance the eldest daughter of lord grandison     chapter ii       armine described  after his marriage sir ratcliffe determined to reside at armine in one of the largest parks in england there yet remained a fragment of a vast elizabethan pile that in old days bore the name of armine place when sir ferdinand had commenced building armine castle he had pulled down the old mansion partly for the sake of its site and partly for the sake of its materials long lines of turreted and manywindowed walls tall towers and lofty arches now rose in picturesque confusion on the green ascent where heretofore old sir walsingham had raised the fair and convenient dwelling which he justly deemed might have served the purpose of a long posterity the hall and chief staircase of the castle and a gallery alone were finished and many a day had sir ferdinand passed in arranging the pictures the armour and choice rarities of these magnificent apartments the rest of the building was a mere shell nor was it in all parts even roofed in heaps of bricks and stone and piles of timber appeared in every direction and traces of the sudden stoppage of a great work might be observed in the temporary sawpits still remaining the sheds for the workmen and the kilns and furnaces which never had been removed time however that had stained the neglected towers with an antique tint and had permitted many a generation of summer birds to build their sunny nests on all the coignes of vantage of the unfinished walls had exercised a mellowing influence even on these rude accessories and in the course of years they had been so drenched by the rain and so buffeted by the wind and had become so covered with moss and ivy that they rather added to then detracted from the picturesque character of the whole mass  a few hundred yards from the castle but situate on the same verdant rising ground and commanding although well sheltered an extensive view over the wide park was the fragment of the old place that we have noticed the rough and undulating rent which marked the severance of the building was now thickly covered with ivy which in its gamesome luxuriance had contrived also to climb up a remaining stack of tall chimneys and to spread over the covering of the large oriel window this fragment contained a set of pleasant chambers which having been occupied by the late baronet were of course furnished with great taste and comfort and there was moreover accommodation sufficient for a small establishment armine place before sir ferdinand unfortunately for his descendants determined in the eighteenth century on building a feudal castle had been situate in famous pleasuregrounds which extended at the back of the mansion over a space of some hundred acres the grounds in the immediate vicinity of the buildings had of course suffered severely but the far greater portion had only been neglected and there were some indeed who deemed as they wandered through the arbourwalks of this enchanting wilderness that its beauty had been enhanced even by this very neglect it seemed like a forest in a beautiful romance a green and bowery wilderness where boccaccio would have loved to woo and watteau to paint so artfully had the walks been planned that they seemed interminable nor was there a single point in the whole pleasaunce where the keenest eye could have detected a limit sometimes you wandered in those arched and winding walks dear to pensive spirits sometimes you emerged on a plot of turf blazing in the sunshine a small and bright savannah and gazed with wonder on the group of black and mighty cedars that rose from its centre with their sharp and spreading foliage the beautiful and the vast blended together and the moment after you had beheld with delight a bed of geraniums or of myrtles you found yourself in an amphitheatre of italian pines a strange exotic perfume filled the air you trod on the flowers of other lands and shrubs and plants that usually are only trusted from their conservatories like sultanas from their jalousies to sniff the air and recall their bloom here learning from hardship the philosophy of endurance had struggled successfully even against northern winters and wantoned now in native and unpruned luxuriance sir ferdinand when he resided at armine was accustomed to fill these pleasuregrounds with macaws and other birds of gorgeous plumage but these had fled away with their master all but some swans which still floated on the surface of a lake which marked the centre of this paradise in the remains of the ancient seat of his fathers sir ratcliffe armine and his bride now sought a home  the principal chamber of armine place was a large irregular room with a low but richlycarved oaken roof studded with achievements this apartment was lighted by the oriel window we have mentioned the upper panes of which contained some ancient specimens of painted glass and having been fitted up by sir ferdinand as a library contained a collection of valuable books from the library you entered through an arched door of glass into a small room of which it being much out of repair when the family arrived lady armine had seized the opportunity of gratifying her taste in the adornment she had hung it with some oldfashioned peagreen damask that exhibited to a vantage several copies of spanish paintings by herself for she was a skilful artist the third and remaining chamber was the diningroom a somewhat gloomy chamber being shadowed by a neighbouring chestnut a portrait of sir ferdinand when a youth in a venetian dress was suspended over the oldfashioned fireplace and opposite hung a fine hunting piece by schneiders lady armine was an amiable and accomplished woman she had enjoyed the advantage of a foreign education under the inspection of a cautious parent and a residence on the continent while it had afforded her many graces had not as unfortunately sometimes is the case divested her of those more substantial though less showy qualities of which a husband knows the value she was pious and dutiful her manners were graceful for she had visited courts and mixed in polished circles but she had fortunately not learnt to affect insensibility as a system or to believe that the essence of good breeding consists in showing your fellowcreatures that you despise them her cheerful temper solaced the constitutional gloom of sir ratcliffe and indeed had originally won his heart even more than her remarkable beauty and while at the same time she loved a country life she possessed in a lettered taste in a beautiful and highly cultivated voice and in a scientific knowledge of music and of painting all those resources which prevent retirement from degenerating into loneliness her foibles if we must confess that she was not faultless endeared her to her husband for her temper reflected his own pride and she possessed the taste for splendour which was also his native mood although circumstances had compelled him to stifle its gratification  love pure and profound had alone prompted the union between ratcliffe armine and constance grandison doubtless like all of her race she might have chosen amid the wealthiest of the catholic nobles and gentry one who would have been proud to have mingled his life with hers but with a soul not insensible to the splendid accidents of existence she yielded her heart to one who could repay the rich sacrifice only with devotion his poverty his pride his dangerous and hereditary gift of beauty his mournful life his illustrious lineage his reserved and romantic mind had at once attracted her fancy and captivated her heart she shared all his aspirations and sympathised with all his hopes and the old glory of the house of armine and its revival and restoration were the object of her daily thoughts and often of her nightly dreams  with these feelings lady armine settled herself at her new home scarcely with a pang that the whole of the park in which she lived was let out as grazing ground and only trusting as she beheld the groups of ruminating cattle that the day might yet come for the antlered tenants of the bowers to resume their shady dwellings the good man and his wife who hitherto had inhabited the old place and shown the castle and the pleasaunce to passing travellers were under the new order of affairs promoted to the respective offices of servingman and cook or butler and housekeeper as they styled themselves in the village a maiden brought from grandison to wait on lady armine completed the establishment with her young brother who among numerous duties performed the office of groom and attended to a pair of beautiful white ponies which sir ratcliffe drove in a phaeton this equipage which was remarkable for its elegance was the especial delight of lady armine and certainly the only piece of splendour in which sir ratcliffe indulged as for neighbourhood sir ratcliffe on his arrival of course received a visit from the rector of his parish and by the courteous medium of this gentleman he soon occasioned it to be generally understood that he was not anxious that the example of his rector should be followed the intimation in spite of much curiosity was of course respected nobody called upon the armines this happy couple however were too much engrossed with their own society to require amusement from any other sources than themselves the honeymoon was passed in wandering in the pleasuregrounds and in wondering at their own marvellous happiness then lady armine would sit on a green bank and sing her choicest songs and sir ratcliffe repaid her for her kindness with speeches softer even than serenades the arrangement of their dwelling occupied the second month each day witnessed some felicitous yet economical alteration of her creative taste the third month lady armine determined to make a garden  i wish said her affectionate husband as he toiled with delight in her service i wish my dear constance that glastonbury was here he was such a capital gardener  let us ask him dear ratcliffe and perhaps for such a friend we have already allowed too great a space of time to elapse without sending an invitation  why we are so happy said sir ratcliffe smiling and yet glastonbury is the best creature in the world i hope you will like him dear constance  i am sure i shall dear ratcliffe give me that geranium love write to him today write to glastonbury today     chapter iii        arrival of glastonbury  adrian glastonbury was a younger son of an old but decayed english family he had been educated at a college of jesuits in france and had entered at an early period of life the service of the romish church whose communion his family had never quitted at college young glastonbury had been alike distinguished for his assiduous talents and for the extreme benevolence of his disposition his was one of those minds to which refinement is natural and which learning and experience never deprive of simplicity apparently his passions were not violent perhaps they were restrained by his profound piety next to his devotion glastonbury was remarkable for his taste the magnificent temples in which the mysteries of the deity and saints he worshipped were celebrated developed the latent predisposition for the beautiful which became almost the master sentiment of his life in the inspired and inspiring paintings that crowned the altars of the churches and the cathedrals in which he ministered glastonbury first studied art and it was as he glided along the solemn shade of those gothic aisles gazing on the brave groining of the vaulted roofs whose deep and sublime shadows so beautifully contrasted with the sparkling shrines and the delicate chantries below that he first imbibed that passion for the architecture of the middle ages that afterwards led him on many a pleasant pilgrimage with no better companions than a wallet and a sketchbook indeed so sensible was glastonbury of the influence of the early and constant scene of his youth on his imagination that he was wont to trace his love of heraldry of which he possessed a remarkable knowledge to the emblazoned windows that perpetuated the memory and the achievements of many a pious founder  when glastonbury was about twentyone years of age he unexpectedly inherited from an uncle a sum which though by no means considerable was for him a sufficient independence and as no opening in the service of the church at this moment offered itself which he considered it a duty to pursue he determined to gratify that restless feeling which seems inseparable from the youth of men gifted with fine sensibilities and which probably arises in an unconscious desire to quit the commonplace and to discover the ideal he wandered on foot throughout the whole of switzerland and italy and after more than three years absence returned to england with several thousand sketches and a complete alpine hortus siccus he was even more proud of the latter than of having kissed the popes toe in the next seven years the life of glastonbury was nearly equally divided between the duties of his sacred profession and the gratification of his simple and elegant tastes he resided principally in lancashire where he became librarian to a catholic nobleman of the highest rank whose notice he had first attracted by publishing a description of his graces residence illustrated by his drawings the duke who was a man of fine taste and antiquarian pursuits and an exceedingly benevolent person sought glastonburys acquaintance in consequence of the publication and from that moment a close and cherished intimacy subsisted between them in the absence of the family however glastonbury found time for many excursions by means of which he at last completed drawings of all our cathedrals there remained for him still the abbeys and the minsters of the west of england a subject on which he was ever eloquent glastonbury performed all these excursions on foot armed only with an ashen staff which he had cut in his early travels and respecting which he was superstitious so that he would have no more thought of journeying without this stick than most other people without their hat indeed to speak truth glastonbury had been known to quit a house occasionally without that necessary appendage for from living much alone he was not a little absent but instead of piquing himself on such eccentricities they ever occasioned him mortification yet glastonbury was an universal favourite and ever a welcome guest in his journeys he had no want of hosts for there was not a catholic family which would not have been hurt had he passed them without a visit he was indeed a rarely accomplished personage an admirable scholar and profound antiquary he possessed also a considerable practical knowledge of the less severe sciences was a fine artist and no contemptible musician his pen too was that of a ready writer if his sonnets be ever published they will rank among the finest in our literature  glastonbury was about thirty when he was induced by lady barbara armine to quit a roof where he had passed some happy years and to undertake the education of her son ratcliffe a child of eight years of age from this time glastonbury in a great degree withdrew himself from his former connexions and so completely abandoned his previous mode of life that he never quitted his new home his pupil repaid him for his zeal rather by the goodness of his disposition and his unblemished conduct than by any remarkable brilliancy of talents or acquirements but ratcliffe and particularly his mother were capable of appreciating glastonbury and certain it is whatever might be the cause he returned their sympathy with deep emotion for every thought and feeling of his existence seemed dedicated to their happiness and prosperity  so great indeed was the shock which he experienced at the unexpected death of lady barbara that for some time he meditated assuming the cowl and if the absence of his pupil prevented the accomplishment of this project the plan was only postponed not abandoned the speedy marriage of sir ratcliffe followed circumstances had prevented glastonbury from being present at the ceremony it was impossible for him to retire to the cloister without seeing his pupil business if not affection rendered an interview between them necessary it was equally impossible for glastonbury to trouble a bride and bridegroom with his presence when however three months had elapsed he began to believe that he might venture to propose a meeting to sir ratcliffe but while he was yet meditating on this step he was anticipated by the receipt of a letter containing a warm invitation to armine  it was a beautiful sunshiny afternoon in june lady armine was seated in front of the place looking towards the park and busied with her work while sir ratcliffe stretched on the grass was reading to her the last poem of scott which they had just received from the neighbouring town  ratcliffe my dear said lady armine some one approaches  a tramper constance  no no my love rise it is a gentleman  who can it be said sir ratcliffe rising perhaps it is your brother love ah no it isit is glastonbury  and at these words he ran forward jumped over the iron hurdle which separated their lawn from the park nor stopped his quick pace until he reached a middleaged man of very prepossessing appearance though certainly not unsullied by the dust for assuredly the guest had travelled far and long  my dear glastonbury exclaimed sir ratcliffe embracing him and speaking under the influence of an excitement in which he rarely indulged i am the happiest fellow alive how do you do i will introduce you to constance directly she is dying to know you and quite prepared to love you as much as myself o my dear glastonbury you have no idea how happy i am she is a perfect angel  i am sure of it said glastonbury seriously  sir ratcliffe hurried his tutor along here is my best friend constance he eagerly exclaimed lady armine rose and welcomed mr glastonbury very cordially your presence my dear sir has i assure you been long desired by both of us she said with a delightful smile  no compliments believe me added sir ratcliffe constance never pays compliments she fixed upon your own room herself she always calls it mr glastonburys room  ah madam said mr glastonbury laying his hand very gently on the shoulder of sir ratcliffe and meaning to say something felicitous i know this dear youth well and i have always thought whoever could claim this heart should be counted a very fortunate woman  and such the possessor esteems herself replied lady armine with a smile  sir ratcliffe after a quarter of an hour or so had passed in conversation said come glastonbury you have arrived at a good time for dinner is at hand let me show you to your room i fear you have had a hot days journey thank god we are together again give me your staff i will take care of it no fear of that so this way you have seen the old place before take care of that step i say constance said sir ratcliffe in a suppressed voice and running back to his wife how do you like him  very much indeed  but do you really  really truly  angel exclaimed the gratified sir ratcliffe     chapter iv       progress of affairs at armine  life is adventurous events are perpetually occurring even in the calmness of domestic existence which change in an instant the whole train and tenor of our thoughts and feelings and often materially influence our fortunes and our character it is strange and sometimes as profitable as it is singular to recall our state on the eve of some acquaintance which transfigures our being with some man whose philosophy revolutionises our mind with some woman whose charms metamorphose our career these retrospective meditations are fruitful of selfknowledge  the visit of glastonbury was one of those incidents which from the unexpected results that they occasion swell into events he had not been long a guest at armine before sir ratcliffe and his lady could not refrain from mutually communicating to each other the gratification they should feel could glastonbury be induced to cast his lot among them his benevolent and placid temper his many accomplishments and the entire affection which he evidently entertained for everybody that bore the name and for everything that related to the fortunes of armine all pointed him out as a friend alike to be cherished and to be valued under his auspices the garden of the fair constance soon flourished his taste guided her pencil and his voice accompanied her lute sir ratcliffe too thoroughly enjoyed his society glastonbury was with him the only link in life between the present and the past they talked over old times together and sorrowful recollections lost half their bitterness from the tenderness of his sympathetic reminiscences sir ratcliffe too was conscious of the value of such a companion for his gifted wife and glastonbury moreover among his many accomplishments had the excellent quality of never being in the way he was aware that young people and especially young lovers are not averse sometimes to being alone and his friends in his absence never felt that he was neglected because his pursuits were so various and his resources so numerous that they were sure he was employed and amused  in the pleasaunce of armine at the termination of a long turfen avenue of purple beeches there was a turreted gate flanked by round towers intended by sir ferdinand for one of the principal entrances of his castle over the gate were small but convenient chambers to which you ascended by a winding stair case in one of the towers the other was a mere shell it was sunset the long vista gleamed in the dying rays that shed also a rich breadth of light over the bold and baronial arch our friends had been examining the chambers and lady armine who was a little wearied by the exertion stood opposite the building leaning on her husband and his friend  a man might go far and find a worse dwelling than that portal said glastonbury musingly methinks life might glide away pleasantly enough in those little rooms with ones books and drawings and this noble avenue for a pensive stroll  i wish to heaven my dear glastonbury you would try the experiment said sir ratcliffe  ah do mr glastonbury added lady armine take pity upon us  at any rate it is not so dull as a cloister added sir ratcliffe and say what they like there is nothing like living among friends  you would find me very troublesome replied glastonbury with a smile and then turning the conversation evidently more from embarrassment than distaste he remarked the singularity of the purple beeches  their origin was uncertain but one circumstance is sure that before another month had passed glastonbury was a tenant for life of the portal of armine castle and all his books and collections were safely stowed and arranged in the rooms with which he had been so much pleased  the course of time for some years flowed on happily at armine in the second year of their marriage lady armine presented her husband with a son their family was never afterwards increased but the proud father was consoled by the sex of his child for the recollection that the existence of his line depended upon the precious contingency of a single life the boy was christened ferdinand with the exception of an annual visit to lord grandison the armine family never quitted their home necessity as well as taste induced this regularity of life the affairs of sir ratcliffe did not improve his mortgagees were more strict in their demands of interest than his tenants in payment of their rents his man of business who had made his fortune in the service of the family was not wanting in accommodation to his client but he was a man of business he could not sympathise with the peculiar feelings and fancies of sir ratcliffe and he persisted in seizing every opportunity of urging on him the advisability of selling his estates however by strict economy and temporary assistance from his lawyer sir ratcliffe during the first ten years of his marriage managed to carry on affairs and though occasional embarrassments sometimes caused him fits of gloom and despondency the sanguine spirit of his wife and the confidence in the destiny of their beautiful child which she regularly enforced upon him maintained on the whole his courage all their hopes and joys were indeed centred in the education of the little ferdinand at ten years of age he was one of those spirited and at the same time docile boys who seem to combine with the wild and careless grace of childhood the thoughtfulness and selfdiscipline of maturer age it was the constant and truthful boast of his parents that in spite of all his liveliness he had never in the whole course of his life disobeyed them in the village where he was idolised they called him the little prince he was so gentle and so generous so kind and yet so dignified in his demeanour his education was remarkable for though he never quitted home and lived in such extreme seclusion so richly gifted were those few persons with whom he passed his life that it would have been difficult to have fixed upon a youth however favoured by fortune who enjoyed greater advantages for the cultivation of his mind and manners from the first dawn of the intellect of the young armine glastonbury had devoted himself to its culture and the kind scholar who had not shrunk from the painful and patient task of impregnating a young mind with the seeds of knowledge had bedewed its budding promise with all the fertilising influence of his learning and his taste as ferdinand advanced in years he had participated in the accomplishments of his mother from her he derived not only a taste for the fine arts but no unskilful practice she too had cultivated the rich voice with which nature had endowed him and it was his mother who taught him not only to sing but to dance in more manly accomplishments ferdinand could not have found a more skilful instructor than his father a consummate sportsman and who like all his ancestors was remarkable for his finished horsemanship and the certainty of his aim under a roof too whose inmates were distinguished for their sincere piety and unaffected virtue the higher duties of existence were not forgotten and ferdinand armine was early and ever taught to be sincere dutiful charitable and just and to have a deep sense of the great account hereafter to be delivered to his creator the very foibles of his parents which he imbibed tended to the maintenance of his magnanimity his illustrious lineage was early impressed upon him and inasmuch as little now was left to them but their honour so it was doubly incumbent upon him to preserve that chief treasure of which fortune could not deprive them unsullied  this much of the education of ferdinand armine with great gifts of nature with lively and highly cultivated talents and a most affectionate and disciplined temper he was adored by the friends who nevertheless had too much sense to spoil him but for his character what was that perhaps with all their anxiety and all their care and all their apparent opportunities for observation the parent and the tutor are rarely skilful in discovering the character of their child or charge custom blunts the fineness of psychological study those with whom we have lived long and early are apt to blend our essential and our accidental qualities in one bewildering association the consequences of education and of nature are not sufficiently discriminated nor is it indeed marvellous that for a long time temperament should be disguised and even stifled by education for it is as it were a contest between a child and a man  there were moments when ferdinand armine loved to be alone when he could fly from all the fondness of his friends and roam in solitude amid the wild and desolate pleasuregrounds or wander for hours in the halls and galleries of the castle gazing on the pictures of his ancestors he ever experienced a strange satisfaction in beholding the portrait of his grandfather he would sometimes stand abstracted for many minutes before the portrait of sir ferdinand in the gallery painted by reynolds before his grandfather left england and which the child already singularly resembled but was there any other resemblance between them than form and feature did the fiery imagination and the terrible passions of that extraordinary man lurk in the innocent heart and the placid mien of his young descendant no matter now behold he is a lighthearted and airy child thought passes over his brow like a cloud in a summer sky or the shadow of a bird over the sunshiny earth and he skims away from the silent hall and his momentary reverie to fly a kite or chase a butterfly     chapter v       a domestic scene  years glided away without any remarkable incidents in the life of young ferdinand he seldom quitted home except as companion to glastonbury in his pedestrian excursions when he witnessed a different kind of life from that displayed in the annual visit which he paid to grandison the boy amused his grandfather with whom therefore he became a favourite the old lord indeed would have had no objection to his grandson passing half the year with him and he always returned home with a benediction a letter full of his praises and a tenpound note lady armine was quite delighted with these symptoms of affection on the part of her father towards her child and augured from them important future results but sir ratcliffe who was not blessed with so sanguine a temperament as his amiable lady and who unbiassed by blood was perhaps better qualified to form an opinion of the character of his fatherinlaw never shared her transports and seldom omitted an opportunity of restraining them  it is all very well my dear he would observe for ferdinand to visit his relations lord grandison is his grandfather it is very proper that he should visit his grandfather i like him to be seen at grandison that is all very right grandison is a firstrate establishment where he is certain of meeting persons of his own class with whom circumstances unhappily and here sir ratcliffe sighed debar him from mixing and your father constance is a very good sort of man i like your father constance you know very much no person ever could be more courteous to me than he has ever been i have no complaints to make of him constance or your brother or indeed of any member of your family i like them all persons more kind or more thoroughly bred i am sure i never knew and i think they like us they appear to me to be always really glad to see us and to be unaffectedly sorry when we quit them i am sure i should be very happy if it were in my power to return their hospitality and welcome them at armine but it is useless to think of that god only knows whether we shall be able to remain here ourselves all i want to make you feel my love is that if you are building any castle in that little brain of yours on the ground of expectations from grandison trust me you will be disappointed my dear you will indeed but my love  if your father die tomorrow my dear he will not leave us a shilling and who can complain i cannot he has always been very frank i remember when we were going to marry and i was obliged to talk to him about your portion i remember it as if it were only yesterday i remember his saying with the most flattering smile in the world i wish the 5000l sir ratcliffe were 50000l for your sake particularly as it will never be in my power to increase it  but my dear ratcliffe surely he may do something for his favourite ferdinand  my dear constance there you are again why favourite i hate the very word your father is a goodnatured man a very goodnatured man he is one of the bestnatured men i ever was acquainted with he has not a single care in the world and he thinks nobody else has and what is more my dear nobody ever could persuade him that anybody else has he has no idea of our situation he never could form an idea of it if i chose to attempt to make him understand it he would listen with the greatest politeness shrug his shoulders at the end of the story tell me to keep up my spirits and order another bottle of madeira in order that he might illustrate his precept by practice he is a goodnatured selfish man he likes us to visit him because you are gay and agreeable and because i never asked a favour of him in the whole course of our acquaintance he likes ferdinand to visit him because he is a handsome finespirited boy and his friends congratulate him on having such a grandson and so ferdinand is his favourite and next year i should not be surprised were he to give him a pony and perhaps if he die he will leave him fifty guineas to buy a gold watch  well i dare say you are right ratcliffe but still nothing that you can say will ever persuade me that ferdinand is not papas decided favourite  well we shall soon see what this favour is worth retorted sir ratcliffe rather bitterly regularly every visit for the last three years your father has asked me what i intended to do with ferdinand i said to him last year more than i thought i ever could say to anyone i told him that ferdinand was now fifteen and that i wished to get him a commission but that i had no influence to get him a commission and no money to pay for it if it were offered me i think that was pretty plain and i have been surprised ever since that i ever could have placed myself in such a degrading position as to say so much  degrading my dear ratcliffe said his wife  i felt it as such and such i still feel it  at this moment glastonbury who was standing at the other end of the room examining a large folio and who had evidently been uneasy during the whole conversation attempted to quit the room  my dear glastonbury said sir ratcliffe with a forced smile you are alarmed at our domestic broils pray do not leave the room you know we have no secrets from you  no pray do not go mr glastonbury added lady armine and if indeed there be a domestic broil and here she rose and kissed her husband at any rate witness our reconciliation  sir ratcliffe smiled and returned his wifes embrace with much feeling  my own constance he said you are the dearest wife in the world and if i ever feel unhappy believe me it is only because i do not see you in the position to which you are entitled  i know no fortune to be compared to your love ratcliffe and as for our child nothing will ever persuade me that all will not go right and that he will not restore the fortunes of the family  amen said glastonbury closing the book with a reverberating sound nor indeed can i believe that providence will ever desert a great and pious line     chapter vi       containing another domestic scene  lady armine and glastonbury were both too much interested in the welfare of sir ratcliffe not to observe with deep concern that a great although gradual change had occurred in his character during the last five years he had become moody and querulous and occasionally even irritable his constitutional melancholy long diverted by the influence of a vigorous youth the society of a charming woman and the interesting feelings of a father began to reassert its ancient and essential sway and at times even to deepen into gloom sometimes whole days elapsed without his ever indulging in conversation his nights once tranquil were now remarkable for their restlessness his wife was alarmed at the sighs and agitation of his dreams he abandoned also his field sports and none of those innocent sources of amusement in which it was once his boast their retirement was so rich now interested him in vain lady armine sought his society in her walks or consulted him about her flowers his frigid and monosyllabic replies discouraged all her efforts no longer did he lean over her easel or call for a repetition of his favourite song at times these dark fits passed away and if not cheerful he was at least serene but on the whole he was an altered man and his wife could no longer resist the miserable conviction that he was an unhappy one  she however was at least spared the mortification the bitterest that a wife can experience of feeling that this change in his conduct was occasioned by any indifference towards her for averse as sir ratcliffe was to converse on a subject so hopeless and ungrateful as the state of his fortune still there were times in which he could not refrain from communicating to the partner of his bosom all the causes of his misery and these indeed too truly had she divined  alas she would sometimes say as she tried to compose his restless pillow what is this pride to which you men sacrifice everything for me who am a woman love is sufficient oh my ratcliffe why do you not feel like your constance what if these estates be sold still we are armines and still our dear ferdinand is spared to us believe me love that if deference to your feelings has prompted my silence i have long felt that it would be wiser for us at once to meet a necessary evil for gods sake put an end to the torture of this life which is destroying us both poverty absolute poverty with you and with your love i can meet even with cheerfulness but indeed my ratcliffe i can bear our present life no longer i shall die if you be unhappy and oh dearest ratcliffe if that were to happen which sometimes i fear has happened if you were no longer to love me  but here sir ratcliffe assured her of the reverse  only think she would continue if when we married we had voluntarily done that which we may now be forced to do we really should have been almost rich people at least we should have had quite enough to live in ease and even elegance and now we owe thousands to that horrible bagster who i am sure cheated your father out of house and home and i dare say after all wants to buy armine for himself  he buy armine an attorney buy armine never constance never i will be buried in its ruins first there is no sacrifice that i would not sooner make  but dearest love suppose we sell it to some one else and suppose after paying every thing we have thirty thousand pounds left how well we could live abroad on the interest of thirty thousand pounds  there would not be thirty thousand pounds left now  well fiveandtwenty or even twenty i could manage on twenty and then we could buy a commission for dear ferdinand  but to leave our child  could not he go into the spanish service perhaps you could get a commission in the spanish guards for nothing they must remember you there and such a name as armine i have no doubt that the king would be quite proud to have another armine in his guard and then we could live at madrid and that would be so delightful because you speak spanish so beautifully and i could learn it very quickly i am very quick at learning languages i am indeed  i think you are very quick at everything dear constance i am sure you are really a treasure of a wife i have cause every hour to bless you and if it were not for my own sake i should say that i wish you had made a happier marriage  oh do not say that ratcliffe say anything but that ratcliffe if you love me i am the happiest woman that ever lived be sure always of that  i wonder if they do remember me at madrid  to be sure they do how could they forget you how could they forget my ratcliffe i daresay you go to this day by the name of the handsome englishman  pooh i remember when i left england before i had no wife then no child but i remembered who i was and when i thought i was the last of our race and that i was in all probability going to spill the little blood that was spared of us in a foreign soil oh constance i do not think i ever could forget the agony of that moment had it been for england i would have met my fate without a pang no constance i am an englishman i am proud of being an englishman my fathers helped to make this country what it is no one can deny that and no consideration in the world shall ever induce me again to quit this island  but suppose we do not quit england suppose we buy a small estate and live at home  a small estate at home a small new estate bought of a mr hopkins a great tallowchandler or some stockjobber about to make a new flight from a lodge to a park oh no that would be too degrading  but suppose we keep one of our own manors  and be reminded every instant of every day of those we have lost and hear of the wonderful improvements of our successors i should go mad  but suppose we live in london  where  i am sure i do not know but i should think we might get a nice little house somewhere  in a suburb a fitting lodgment for lady armine no at any rate we will have no witnesses to our fall  but could not we try some place near my fathers  and be patronised by the great family with whom i had the good fortune of being connected no my dear constance i like your father very well but i could not stand his eleemosynary haunches of venison and great baskets of apples and creamcheeses sent with the housekeepers duty  but what shall we do dear ratcliffe  my love there is no resisting fate we must live or die at armine even if we starve  perhaps something will turn up i dreamed the other night that dear ferdinand married an heiress suppose he should what do you think  why even then that he would not be as lucky as his father good night love     chapter vii       containing an unexpected visit to london and its      consequences  the day after the conversation in the library to which glastonbury had been an unwilling listener he informed his friends that it was necessary for him to visit the metropolis and as young ferdinand had never yet seen london he proposed that he should accompany him sir ratcliffe and lady armine cheerfully assented to this proposition and as for ferdinand it is difficult to describe the delight which the anticipation of his visit occasioned him the three days that were to elapse before his departure did not seem sufficient to ensure the complete packing of his portmanteau and his excited manner the rapidity of his conversation and the restlessness of his movements were very diverting  mamma is london twenty times bigger than nottingham how big is it then shall we travel all night what oclock is it now i wonder if thursday will ever come i think i shall go to bed early to finish the day sooner do you think my cap is good enough to travel in i shall buy a hat in london i shall get up early the very first morning and buy a hat do you think my uncle is in london i wish augustus were not at eton perhaps he would be there i wonder if mr glastonbury will take me to see st pauls i wonder if he will take me to the play id give anything to go to the play i should like to go to the play and st pauls what fun it will be dining on the road  it did indeed seem that thursday would never come yet it came at last the travellers were obliged to rise before the sun and drive over to nottingham to meet their coach so they bid their adieus the previous eve as for ferdinand so fearful was he of losing the coach that he scarcely slept and was never convinced that he was really in time until he found himself planted in breathless agitation outside of the dart lightpostcoach it was the first time in his life that he had ever travelled outside of a coach he felt all the excitement of expanding experience and advancing manhood they whirled along at the end of every stage ferdinand followed the example of his fellowtravellers and dismounted and then with sparkling eyes hurried to glastonbury who was inside to inquire how he sped capital travelling isnt it sir did the ten miles within the hour you have no idea what a fellow our coachman is and the guard such a fellow our guard dont wait here a moment can i get anything for you we dine at millfield what fun  away whirled the dashing dart over the rich plains of our merry midland a quick and dazzling vision of golden cornfields and lawny pasture land farmhouses embowered in orchards and hamlets shaded by the straggling members of some vast and ancient forest then rose in the distance the dim blue towers or the graceful spire of some old cathedral and soon the spreading causeways announced their approach to some provincial capital the coachman flanks his leaders who break into a gallop the guard sounds his triumphant bugle the coach bounds over the noble bridge that spans a stream covered with craft public buildings guildhalls and county gaols rise on each side rattling through many an inferior way they at length emerge into the high street the observed of all observers and mine host of the red lion or the white hart followed by all his waiters advances from his portal with a smile to receive the gentlemen passengers  the coach stops here half an hour gentlemen dinner quite ready  tis a delightful sound and what a dinner what a profusion of substantial delicacies what mighty and iristinted rounds of beef what vast and marbleveined ribs what gelatinous veal pies what colossal hams those are evidently prize cheeses and how invigorating is the perfume of those various and variegated pickles then the bustle emulating the plenty the ringing of bells the clash of thoroughfare the summoning of ubiquitous waiters and the allpervading feeling of omnipotence from the guests who order what they please to the landlord who can produce and execute everything they can desire tis a wondrous sight why should a man go and see the pyramids and cross the desert when he has not beheld york minster or travelled on the road our little ferdinand amid all this novelty heartily enjoyed himself and did ample justice to mine hosts good cheer they were soon again whirling along the road but at sunset ferdinand at the instance of glastonbury availed himself of his inside place and wearied by the air and the excitement of the day he soon fell soundly asleep  several hours had elapsed when awaking from a confused dream in which armine and all he had lately seen were blended together he found his fellowtravellers slumbering and the mail dashing along through the illuminated streets of a great city the streets were thickly thronged ferdinand stared at the magnificence of the shops blazing with lights and the multitude of men and vehicles moving in all directions the guard sounded his bugle with treble energy and the coach suddenly turned through an arched entrance into the courtyard of an oldfashioned inn his fellowpassengers started and rubbed their eyes  so we have arrived i suppose grumbled one of these gentlemen taking off his nightcap  yes gentlemen i am happy to say our journey is finished said a more polite voice and a very pleasant one i have found it porter have the goodness to call me a coach  and one for me added the gruff voice  mr glastonbury whispered the awestruck ferdinand is this london  this is london but we have yet two or three miles to go before we reach our quarters i think we had better alight and look after our luggage gentlemen good evening  mr glastonbury hailed a coach into which having safely deposited their portmanteaus he and ferdinand entered but our young friend was so entirely overcome by his feelings and the genius of the place that he was quite unable to make an observation each minute the streets seemed to grow more spacious and more brilliant and the multitude more dense and more excited beautiful buildings too rose before him palaces and churches and streets and squares of imposing architecture to his inexperienced eye and unsophisticated spirit their route appeared a neverending triumph to the hackneycoachman however who had no imagination and who was quite satiated with metropolitan experience it only appeared that he had had an exceeding good fare and that he was jogging up from bishopsgate street to charing cross  when jarvis therefore had safely deposited his charge at morleys hotel in cockspur street and extorted from them an extra shilling in consideration of their evident rustication he bent his course towards the opera house for clouds were gathering and with the favour of providence there seemed a chance about midnight of picking up some helpless beau or desperate cabless dandy the choicest victim in a midnight shower of these public conveyancers  the coffeeroom at morleys was a new scene of amusement to ferdinand and he watched with great diversion the two evening papers portioned out among twelve eager quidnuncs and the evident anxiety which they endured and the nice diplomacies to which they resorted to obtain the envied journals the entrance of our two travellers so alarmingly increasing the demand over the supply at first seemed to attract considerable and not very friendly notice but when a malignant halfpay officer in order to revenge himself for the restless watchfulness of his neighbour a political doctor of divinity offered the journal which he had long finished to glastonbury and it was declined the general alarm visibly diminished poor mr glastonbury had never looked into a newspaper in his life save the county chronicle to which he occasionally contributed a communication giving an account of the digging up of some old coins signed antiquarius or of the exhumation of some fossil remains to which he more boldly appended his initials  in spite of the strange clatter in the streets ferdinand slept well and the next morning after an early breakfast himself and his fellowtraveller set out on their peregrinations young and sanguine full of health and enjoyment innocent and happy it was with difficulty that ferdinand could restrain his spirits as he mingled in the bustle of the streets it was a bright sunny morning and although the end of june the town was yet quite full  is this charing cross sir i wonder if we shall ever be able to get over is this the fullest part of the town sir what a fine day sir how lucky we are in the weather we are lucky in everything whose house is that northumberland house is it the duke of northumberlands does he live there how i should like to see it is it very fine who is that what is this the admiralty oh let me see the admiralty the horse guards oh where where let us set our watches by the horse guards the guard of our coach always sets his watch by the horse guards mr glastonbury which is the best clock the horse guards or st pauls is that the treasury can we go in that is downing street is it i never heard of downing street what do they do in downing street is this charing cross still or is it parliament street where does charing cross end and where does parliament street begin by jove i see westminster abbey  after visiting westminster abbey and the two houses of parliament mr glastonbury looking at his watch said it was now time to call upon a friend of his who lived in st jamess square this was the nobleman with whom early in life glastonbury had been connected and with whom and whose family he had become so great a favourite that notwithstanding his retired life they had never permitted the connexion entirely to subside during the very few visits which he had made to the metropolis he always called in st jamess square and his reception always assured him that his remembrance imparted pleasure  when glastonbury sent up his name he was instantly admitted and ushered up stairs the room was full but it consisted only of a family party the mother of the duke who was an interesting personage with fine grey hair a clear blue eye and a soft voice was surrounded by her greatgrandchildren who were at home for the midsummer holidays and who had gathered together at her rooms this morning to consult upon amusements among them was the heir presumptive of the house a youth of the age of ferdinand and of a prepossessing appearance it was difficult to meet a more amiable and agreeable family and nothing could exceed the kindness with which they all welcomed glastonbury the duke himself soon appeared my dear dear glastonbury he said i heard you were here and i would come this shall be a holiday for us all why man you bury yourself alive  mr armine said the duchess pointing to ferdinand  mr armine how do you do your grandfather and i were well acquainted i am glad to know his grandson i hope your father sir ratcliffe and lady armine are well my dear glastonbury i hope you have come to stay a long time you must dine with us every day you know we are very oldfashioned people we do not go much into the world so you will always find us at home and we will do what we can to amuse your young friend why i should think he was about the same age as digby is he at eton his grandfather was i shall never forget the time he cut off old barnards pigtail he was a wonderful man poor sir ferdinand he was indeed  while his grace and glastonbury maintained their conversation ferdinand conducted himself with so much spirit and propriety towards the rest of the party and gave them such a lively and graceful narrative of all his travels up to town and the wonders he had already witnessed that they were quite delighted with him and in short from this moment during his visit to london he was scarcely ever out of their society and every day became a greater favourite with them his letters to his mother for he wrote to her almost every day recounted all their successful efforts for his amusement and it seemed that he passed his mornings in a round of sightseeing and that he went to the play every night of his life perhaps there never existed a human being who at this moment more thoroughly enjoyed life than ferdinand armine  in the meantime while he thought only of amusement mr glastonbury was not inattentive to his more important interests for the truth is that this excellent man had introduced him to the family only with the hope of interesting the feelings of the duke in his behalf his grace was a man of a generous disposition he sympathised with the recital of glastonbury as he detailed to him the unfortunate situation of this youth sprung from so illustrious a lineage and yet cut off by a combination of unhappy circumstances from almost all those natural sources whence he might have expected support and countenance and when glastonbury seeing that the dukes heart was moved added that all he required for him ferdinand was a commission in the army for which his parents were prepared to advance the money his grace instantly declared that he would exert all his influence to obtain their purpose  mr glastonbury was therefore more gratified than surprised when a few days after the conversation which we have mentioned his noble friend informed him with a smile that he believed all might be arranged provided his young charge could make it convenient to quit england at once a vacancy had unexpectedly occurred in a regiment just ordered to malta and an ensigncy had been promised to ferdinand armine mr glastonbury gratefully closed with the offer he sacrificed a fourth part of his moderate independence in the purchase of the commission and the outfit of his young friend and had the supreme satisfaction ere the third week of their visit was completed of forwarding a gazette to armine containing the appointment of ferdinand armine as ensign in the royal fusiliers     chapter viii       a visit to glastonburys chamber  it was arranged that ferdinand should join his regiment by the next mediterranean packet which was not to quit falmouth for a fortnight glastonbury and himself therefore lost no time in bidding adieu to their kind friends in london and hastening to armine they arrived the day after the gazette they found sir ratcliffe waiting for them at the town and the fond smile and cordial embrace with which he greeted glastonbury more than repaid that good man for all his exertions there was notwithstanding a perceptible degree of constraint both on the part of the baronet and his former tutor it was evident that sir ratcliffe had something on his mind of which he wished to disburden himself and it was equally apparent that glastonbury was unwilling to afford him an opportunity under these rather awkward circumstances it was perhaps fortunate that ferdinand talked without ceasing giving his father an account of all he had seen done and heard and of all the friends he had made from the good duke ofto that capital fellow the guard of the coach  they were at the park gates lady armine was there to meet them the carriage stopped ferdinand jumped out and embraced his mother she kissed him and ran forward and extended both her hands to mr glastonbury deeds not words must show our feelings she said and the tears glittered in her beautiful eyes glastonbury with a blush pressed her hand to his lips after dinner during which ferdinand recounted all his adventures lady armine invited him when she rose to walk with her in the garden it was then with an air of considerable confusion clearing his throat and filling his glass at the same time that sir ratcliffe said to his remaining guest  my dear glastonbury you cannot suppose that i believe that the days of magic have returned this commission both constance and myself feel that is we are certain that you are at the bottom of it all the commission is purchased i could not expect the duke deeply as i feel his generous kindness to purchase a commission for my son i could not permit it no glastonbury and here sir ratcliffe became more animated you could not permit it my honour is safe in your hands sir ratcliffe paused for a reply  on that score my conscience is clear replied glastonbury  it is thenit must be then as i suspect rejoined sir ratcliffe i am your debtor for this great service  it is easy to count your obligations to me said glastonbury but mine to you and yours are incalculable  my dear glastonbury said sir ratcliffe pushing his glass away as he rose from his seat and walked up and down the room i may be proud but i have no pride for you i owe you too much indeed my dear friend there is nothing that i would not accept from you were it in your power to grant what you would desire it is not pride my dear glastonbury do not mistake me it is not pride that prompts this explanation butbuthad i your command of language i would explain myself more readily but the truth is iii cannot permit that you should suffer for us glastonbury i cannot indeed  mr glastonbury looked at sir ratcliffe steadily then rising from his seat he took the baronets arm and without saying a word walked slowly towards the gates of the castle where he lodged and which we have before described when he had reached the steps of the tower he withdrew his arm and saying let me be pioneer invited sir ratcliffe to follow him they accordingly entered his chamber  it was a small room lined with shelves of books except in one spot where was suspended a portrait of lady barbara which she had bequeathed him in her will the floor was covered with so many boxes and cases that it was not very easy to steer a course when you had entered glastonbury however beckoned to his companion to seat himself in one of his two chairs while he unlocked a small cabinet from a drawer of which he brought forth a paper  it is my will said glastonbury handing it to sir ratcliffe who laid it down on the table  nay i wish you my dear friend to peruse it for it concerns yourself  i would rather learn its contents from yourself if you positively desire me replied sir ratcliffe  i have left everything to our child said glastonbury for thus when speaking to the father alone he would often style the son  may it be long before he enjoys the bequest said sir ratcliffe brushing away a tear long very long  as the almighty pleases said glastonbury crossing himself but living or dead i look upon all as ferdinands and hold myself but the steward of his inheritance which i will never abuse  o glastonbury no more of this i pray you have wasted a precious life upon our forlorn race alas how often and how keenly do i feel that had it not been for the name of armine your great talents and goodness might have gained for you an enviable portion of earthly felicity yes glastonbury you have sacrificed yourself to us  would that i could said the old man with brightening eyes and an unaccustomed energy of manner would that i could would that any act of mine i care not what could revive the fortunes of the house of armine honoured for ever be the name which with me is associated with all that is great and glorious in man and here his voice faltered and he turned away his face exquisite and enchanting in woman  no ratcliffe he resumed by the memory of one i cannot name by that blessed and saintly being from whom you derive your life you will not you cannot deny this last favour i ask i entreat i supplicate you to accord me me who have ever eaten of your bread and whom your roof hath ever shrouded  my friend i cannot speak said sir ratcliffe throwing himself back in the chair and covering his face with his right hand i know not what to say i know not what to feel  glastonbury advanced and gently took his other hand dear sir ratcliffe he observed in his usual calm sweet voice if i have erred you will pardon me i did believe that after my long and intimate connection with your house after having for nearly forty years sympathised as deeply with all your fortunes as if indeed your noble blood flowed in these old veins after having been honoured on your side with a friendship which has been the consolation and charm of my existence indeed too great a blessing i did believe more especially when i reminded myself of the unrestrained manner in which i had availed myself of the advantages of that friendship i did believe actuated by feelings which perhaps i cannot describe and thoughts to which i cannot now give utterance that i might venture without offence upon this slight service ay that the offering might be made in the spirit of most respectful affection and not altogether be devoid of favour in your sight  excellent kindhearted man said sir ratcliffe pressing the hand of glastonbury in his own i accept your offering in the spirit of perfect love believe me dearest friend it was no feeling of false pride that for a moment influenced me i only felt  that in venturing upon this humble service i deprived myself of some portion of my means of livelihood you are mistaken when i cast my lot at armine i sank a portion of my capital on my life so slender are my wants here and so little does your dear lady permit me to desire that believe me i have never yet expended upon myself this apportioned income and as for the rest it is as you have seen destined for our ferdinand yet a little time and adrian glastonbury must be gathered to his fathers why then deprive him of the greatest gratification of his remaining years the consciousness that to be really serviceable to those he loves it is not necessary for him to cease to exist  may you never repent your devotion to our house said sir ratcliffe rising from his seat time was we could give them who served us something better than thanks but at any rate these come from the heart     chapter ix       the last day and the last night  in the meantime the approaching i departure of ferdinand was the great topic of interest at armine it was settled that his father should accompany him to falmouth where he was to embark and that they should pay a visit on their way to his grandfather whose seat was situate in the west of england this separation now so near at hand occasioned lady armine the deepest affliction but she struggled to suppress her emotion yet often while apparently busied with the common occupations of the day the tears trickled down her cheek and often she rose from her restless seat while surrounded by those she loved to seek the solitude of her chamber and indulge her overwhelming sorrow nor was ferdinand less sensible of the bitterness of this separation with all the excitement of his new prospects and the feeling of approaching adventure and fancied independence so flattering to inexperienced youth he could not forget that his had been a very happy home nearly seventeen years of an innocent existence had passed undisturbed by a single bad passion and unsullied by a single action that he could regret the river of his life had glided along reflecting only a cloudless sky but if he had been dutiful and happy if at this moment of severe examination his conscience were serene he could not but feel how much this enviable state of mind was to be attributed to those who had as it were imbued his life with love whose nevervarying affection had developed all the kindly feelings of his nature had anticipated all his wants and listened to all his wishes had assisted him in difficulty and guided him in doubt had invited confidence by kindness and deserved it by sympathy had robbed instruction of all its labour and discipline of all its harshness  it was the last day on the morrow he was to quit armine he strolled about among the mouldering chambers of the castle and a host of thoughts and passions like clouds in a stormy sky coursed over his hitherto serene and lighthearted breast in this first great struggle of his soul some symptoms of his latent nature developed themselves and amid the rifts of the mental tempest occasionally he caught some glimpses of selfknowledge nature that had endowed him with a fiery imagination and a reckless courage had tempered those dangerous and hitherto those undeveloped and untried gifts with a heart of infinite sensibility ferdinand armine was in truth a singular blending of the daring and the soft and now as he looked around him and thought of his illustrious and fallen race and especially of that extraordinary man of whose splendid and ruinous career that mans own creation the surrounding pile seemed a fitting emblem he asked himself if he had not inherited the energies with the name of his grandsire and if their exertion might not yet revive the glories of his line he felt within him alike the power and the will and while he indulged in magnificent reveries of fame and glory and heroic action of which career indeed his approaching departure was to be the commencement the association of ideas led his recollection to those beings from whom he was about to depart his fancy dropped like a bird of paradise in full wing tumbling exhausted in the sky he thought of his innocent and happy boyhood of his fathers thoughtful benevolence his sweet mothers gentle assiduities and glastonburys devotion and he demanded aloud in a voice of anguish whether fate could indeed supply a lot more exquisite than to pass existence in these calm and beauteous bowers with such beloved companions  his name was called it was his mothers voice he dashed away a desperate tear and came forth with a smiling face his mother and father were walking together at a little distance  ferdinand said lady armine with an air of affected gaiety we have just been settling that you are to send me a gazelle from malta and in this strain speaking of slight things yet all in some degree touching upon the mournful incident of the morrow did lady armine for some time converse as if she were all this time trying the fortitude of her mind and accustoming herself to a catastrophe which she was resolved to meet with fortitude  while they were walking together glastonbury who was hurrying from his rooms to the place for the dinner hour was at hand joined them and they entered their home together it was singular at dinner too in what excellent spirits everybody determined to be the dinner also generally a simple repast was almost as elaborate as the demeanour of the guests and although no one felt inclined to eat consisted of every dish and delicacy which was supposed to be a favourite with ferdinand sir ratcliffe in general so grave was today quite joyous and produced a magnum of claret which he had himself discovered in the old cellars and of which even glastonbury an habitual waterdrinker ventured to partake as for lady armine she scarcely ever ceased talking she found a jest in every sentence and seemed only uneasy when there was silence ferdinand of course yielded himself to the apparent spirit of the party and had a stranger been present he could only have supposed that they were celebrating some anniversary of domestic joy it seemed rather a birthday feast than the last social meeting of those who had lived together so long and loved each other so dearly  but as the evening drew on their hearts began to grow heavy and every one was glad that the early departure of the travellers on the morrow was an excuse for speedily retiring  no adieus tonight said lady armine with a gay air as she scarcely returned the habitual embrace of her son we shall be all up tomorrow  so wishing his last good night with a charged heart and faltering tongue ferdinand armine took up his candle and retired to his chamber he could not refrain from exercising an unusual scrutiny when he had entered the room he held up the light to the old accustomed walls and threw a parting glance of affection at the curtains there was the glass vase which his mother had never omitted each day to fill with fresh flowers and the counterpane that was her own handiwork he kissed it and flinging off his clothes was glad when he was surrounded with darkness and buried in his bed  there was a gentle tap at his door he started  are you in bed my ferdinand inquired his mothers voice  ere he could reply he heard the door open and observed a tall white figure approaching him  lady armine without speaking knelt down by his bedside and took him in her arms she buried her face in his breast he felt her tears upon his heart he could not move he could not speak at length he sobbed aloud  may our father that is in heaven bless you my darling child may he guard over you may he preserve you very weak was her still solemn voice i would have spared you this my darling for you not for myself have i controlled my feelings but i knew not the strength of a mothers love alas what mother has a child like thee o ferdinand my first my onlyborn child of love and joy and happiness that never cost me a thought of sorrow so kind so gentle and so dutiful must we oh must we indeed part  it is too cruel continued lady armine kissing with a thousand kisses her weeping child what have i done to deserve such misery as this ferdinand beloved ferdinand i shall die  i will not go mother i will not go wildly exclaimed the boy disengaging himself from her embrace and starting up in his bed mother i cannot go no no it never can be good to leave a home like this  hush hush my darling what words are these how unkind how wicked it is of me

wicked i am a fool i never no never shall pardon myself for this night ferdinand  sweet mother i beseech you calm yourself believe me we shall indeed meet very soon and somehow or other a little bird whispers to me we shall yet be very happy  but will you be the same ferdinand to me as before ay there it is my child you will be a man when you come back and be ashamed to love your mother promise me now said lady armine with extraordinary energy promise me ferdinand you will always love me do not let them make you ashamed of loving me they will joke and jest and ridicule all home affections you

and those who live there trust me oh yes indeed believe me darling you will never find friends in this world like those you leave at armine  i know it exclaimed ferdinand with streaming eyes god be my witness how deeply i feel that truth if i forget thee and them dear mother may god indeed forget me  my ferdinand said lady armine in a calm tone i am better now i hardly am sorry that i did come now it will be a consolation to me in your absence to remember all you have said good night my beloved child my darling child good night i shall not come down tomorrow dear we will not meet again i will say goodbye to you from the window be happy my dear ferdinand and as you say indeed we shall soon meet again eightandforty weeks why what are eightandforty weeks it is not quite a year courage my

myself whenever you want anything write to your mother mind you have eight packages i have written them down on a card and placed it on the hall table and take the greatest care of old sir ferdinands sword i am very superstitious about that sword and while you have it i am sure you will succeed i have ever thought that had he taken it with him to france all would have gone right with him god bless god almighty bless you child be of good heart i will write you everything that takes place and as you say we shall soon meet indeed after tonight she added in a more mournful tone we have naught else to think of but of meeting i fear it is very late your father will be surprised at my absence she rose from his bed and walked up and down the room several times in silence then again approaching him she folded him in her arms and quitted the chamber without again speaking     chapter x       the advantage of being a favourite grandson  the exhausted ferdinand found consolation in sleep when he woke the dawn was just breaking he dressed and went forth to look for the last time on his hereditary woods the air was cold but the sky was perfectly clear and the beams of the rising sun soon spread over the blue heaven how fresh and glad and sparkling was the surrounding scene with what enjoyment did he inhale the soft and renovating breeze the dew quivered on the grass and the carol of the wakening birds roused from their slumbers by the spreading warmth resounded from the groves from the green knoll on which he stood he beheld the clustering village of armine a little agricultural settlement formed of the peasants alone who lived on the estate the smoke began to rise in blue curls from the cottage chimneys and the church clock struck the hour of five it seemed to ferdinand that those labourers were far happier than he since the setting sun would find them still at armine happy happy armine  the sound of carriage wheels roused him from his reverie the fatal moment had arrived he hastened to the gate according to his promise to bid farewell to glastonbury the good old man was up he pressed his pupil to his bosom and blessed him with a choking voice  dearest and kindest friend murmured ferdinand glastonbury placed round his neck a small golden crucifix that had belonged to lady barbara wear it next your heart my child said he it will remind you of your god and of us all ferdinand quitted the tower with a thousand blessings  when he came in sight of the place he saw his father standing by the carriage which was already packed ferdinand ran into the house to get the card which had been left on the hall table for him by his mother he ran over the list with the old and faithful domestic and shook hands with him nothing now remained all was ready his father was seated ferdinand stood a moment in thought let me run up to my mother sir you had better not my child replied sir ratcliffe she does not expect you come come along so he slowly seated himself with his eyes fixed on the window of his mothers chamber and as the carriage drove off the window opened and a hand waved a white handkerchief he saw no more but as he saw it he clenched his hand in agony  how different was this journey to london from his last he scarcely spoke a word nothing interested him but his own feelings the guard and the coachman and the bustle of the inn and the passing spectacles of the road appeared a collection of impertinences all of a sudden it seemed that his boyish feelings had deserted him he was glad when they arrived in london and glad that they were to stay in it only a single day sir ratcliffe and his son called upon the duke but as they had anticipated the family had quitted town our travellers put up at hatchetts and the following night started for exeter in the devonport mail ferdinand arrived at the western metropolis having interchanged with his father scarcely a hundred sentences at exeter after a night of most welcome rest they took a postchaise and proceeded by a crossroad to grandison  when lord grandison who as yet was perfectly unacquainted with the revolutions in the armine family had clearly comprehended that his grandson had obtained a commission without either troubling him for his interest or putting him in the disagreeable predicament of refusing his money there were no bounds to the extravagant testimonials of his affection both towards his soninlaw and his grandson he seemed quite proud of such relations he patted sir ratcliffe on his back asked a thousand questions about his darling constance and hugged and slobbered over ferdinand as if he were a child of five years old he informed all his guests daily and the house was full that lady armine was his favourite daughter and sir ratcliffe his favourite soninlaw and ferdinand especially his favourite grandchild he insisted upon sir ratcliffe always sitting at the head of his table and always placed ferdinand on his own right hand he asked his butler aloud at dinner why he had not given a particular kind of burgundy because sir ratcliffe armine was here  darbois said the old nobleman have not i told you that clos de vougeot is always to be kept for sir ratcliffe armine it is his favourite wine clos de vougeot directly to sir ratcliffe armine i do not think my dear madam turning to a fair neighbour that i have yet had the pleasure of introducing you to my soninlaw my favourite soninlaw sir ratcliffe armine he married my daughter constance my favourite daughter constance only here for a few days a very very few days indeed quite a flying visit i wish i could see the whole family oftener and longer passing through to falmouth with his son this young gentleman on my right my grandson my favourite grandson ferdinand just got his commission ordered for malta immediately he is in the fusileers the royal fusileers very difficult my dear madam in these days to obtain a commission especially a commission in the royal fusileers very great interest required very great interest indeed but the armines are a most ancient family very highly connected very highly connected and between you and me the duke ofwould do anything for them  come come captain armine take a glass of wine with your old grandfather  how attached the old gentleman appears to be to his grandson whispered the lady to her neighbour  delightful yes was the reply i believe he is the favourite grandson  in short the old gentleman at last got so excited by the universal admiration lavished on his favourite grandson that he finally insisted on seeing the young hero in his regimentals and when ferdinand took his leave after a great many whimpering blessings his domestic feelings were worked up to such a pitch of enthusiasm that he absolutely presented his grandson with a hundredpound note  thank you my dear grandpapa said the astonished ferdinand who really did not expect more than fifty perhaps even a moiety of that more moderate sum thank you my dear grandpapa i am very much obliged to you indeed  i wish i could do more for you i do indeed said lord grandison but nobody ever thinks of paying his rent now you are my grandson my favourite grandson my dear favourite daughters only child and you are an officer in his majestys service an officer in the royal fusiliers only think of that it is the most unexpected thing that ever happened to me to see you so well and so unexpectedly provided for my dear child has taken a very great load off my mind it has indeed you have no idea of a parents anxiety in these matters especially of a grandfather you will some day i warrant you continued the noble grandfather with an expression between a giggle and a leer but do not be wild my dear ferdinand do not be too wild at least young blood must have its way but be cautious now do be cautious my dear child do not get into any scrapes at least do not get into any serious scrapes and whatever happens to you and here his lordship assumed even a solemn tone remember you have friends remember my dear boy you have a grandfather and that you my dear ferdinand are his favourite grandson  this passing visit to grandison rather rallied the spirits of our travellers when they arrived at falmouth they found however that the packet which waited for government despatches was not yet to sail sir ratcliffe scarcely knew whether he ought to grieve or to rejoice at the reprieve but he determined to be gay so ferdinand and himself passed their mornings in visiting the mines pendennis castle and the other lions of the neighbourhood and returned in the evening to their cheerful hotel with good appetites for their agreeable banquet the mutton of dartmoor and the cream of devon  at length however the hour of separation approached a message awaited them at the inn on their return from one of their rambles that ferdinand must be on board at an early hour on the morrow that evening the conversation between sir ratcliffe and his son was of a graver nature than they usually indulged in he spoke to him in confidence of his affairs dark hints indeed had before reached ferdinand nor although his parents had ever spared his feelings could his intelligent mind have altogether refrained from guessing much that had never been formally communicated yet the truth was worse even than he had anticipated ferdinand however was young and sanguine he encouraged his father with his hopes and supported him by his sympathy he expressed to sir ratcliffe his confidence that the generosity of his grandfather would prevent him at present from becoming a burden to his own parent and he inwardly resolved that no possible circumstance should ever induce him to abuse the benevolence of sir ratcliffe  the moment of separation arrived sir ratcliffe pressed to his bosom his only his loving and his beloved child he poured over ferdinand the deepest the most fervid blessing that a father ever granted to a son but with all this pious consolation it was a moment of agony     book ii     chapter i       partly retrospective yet very necessary to be perused  early five years had elapsed between the event which formed the subject of our last chapter and the recall to england of the regiment in which captain armine now commanded a company this period of time had passed away not unfruitful of events in the experience of that family in whose fate and feelings i have attempted to interest the reader in this interval ferdinand armine had paid one short visit to his native land a visit which had certainly been accelerated if not absolutely occasioned by the untimely death of his cousin augustus the presumptive heir of grandison this unforeseen event produced a great revolution in the prospects of the family of armine for although the title and an entailed estate devolved to a distant branch the absolute property of the old lord was of great amount and as he had no male heir now living conjectures as to its probable disposition were now rife among all those who could possibly become interested in it whatever arrangement the old lord might decide upon it seemed nearly certain that the armine family must be greatly benefited some persons even went so far as to express their conviction that everything would be left to mr armine who everybody now discovered to have always been a particular favourite with his grandfather at all events sir ratcliffe who ever maintained upon the subject a becoming silence thought it as well that his son should remind his grandfather personally of his existence and it was at his fathers suggestion that ferdinand had obtained a short leave of absence at the first opportunity to pay a hurried visit to grandison and his grandfather  the old lord yielded him a reception which might have flattered the most daring hopes he embraced ferdinand and pressed him to his heart a thousand times he gave him his blessing in the most formal manner every morning and evening and assured everybody that he now was not only his favourite but his only grandson he did not even hesitate to affect a growing dislike for his own seat because it was not in his power to leave it to ferdinand and he endeavoured to console that fortunate youth for his indispensable deprivation by mysterious intimations that he would perhaps find quite enough to do with his money in completing armine castle and maintaining its becoming splendour the sanguine ferdinand returned to malta with the conviction that he was his grandfathers heir and even sir ratcliffe was almost disposed to believe that his sons expectations were not without some show of probability when he found that lord grandison had absolutely furnished him with the funds for the purchase of his company  ferdinand was fond of his profession he had entered it under favourable circumstances he had joined a crack regiment in a crack garrison malta is certainly a delightful station its city valetta equals in its noble architecture if it even do not excel any capital in europe and although it must be confessed that the surrounding region is little better than a rock the vicinity nevertheless of barbary of italy and of sicily presents exhaustless resources to the lovers of the highest order of natural beauty if that fair valetta with its streets of palaces its picturesque forts and magnificent church only crowned some green and azure island of the ionian sea corfu for instance i really think that the ideal of landscape would be realised  to ferdinand who was inexperienced in the world the dissipation of malta too was delightful it must be confessed that under all circumstances the first burst of emancipation from domestic routine hath in it something fascinating however you may be indulged at home it is impossible to break the chain of childish associations it is impossible to escape from the feeling of dependence and the habit of submission charming hour when you first order your own servants and ride your own horses instead of your fathers it is delightful even to kick about your own furniture and there is something manly and magnanimous in paying our own taxes young lively kind accomplished goodlooking and wellbred ferdinand armine had in him all the elements of popularity and the novelty of popularity quite intoxicated a youth who had passed his life in a rural seclusion where he had been appreciated but not huzzaed ferdinand was not only popular but proud of being popular he was popular with the governor he was popular with his colonel he was popular with his mess he was popular throughout the garrison never was a person so popular as ferdinand armine he was the best rider among them and the deadliest shot and he soon became an oracle at the billiardtable and a hero in the racquetcourt his refined education however fortunately preserved him from the fate of many other lively youths he did not degenerate into a mere hero of sports and brawls the genius of male revels the arbiter of roistering suppers and the comus of a club his boyish feelings had their play he soon exuded the wanton heat of which a public school would have served as a safetyvalve he returned to his books his music and his pencil he became more quiet but he was not less liked if he lost some companions he gained many friends and on the whole the most boisterous wassailers were proud of the accomplishments of their comrade and often an invitation to a mess dinner was accompanied by a hint that armine dined there and that there was a chance of hearing him sing ferdinand now became as popular with the governors lady as with the governor himself was idolised by his colonels wife while not a party throughout the island was considered perfect without the presence of mr armine  excited by his situation ferdinand was soon tempted to incur expenses which his income did not justify the facility of credit afforded him not a moment to pause everything he wanted was furnished him and until the regiment quitted the garrison he was well aware that a settlement of accounts was never even desired amid this imprudence he was firm however in his resolution never to trespass on the resources of his father it was with difficulty that he even brought himself to draw for the allowance which sir ratcliffe insisted on making him and he would gladly have saved his father from making even this advance by vague intimations of the bounty of lord grandison had he not feared this conduct might have led to suspicious and disagreeable enquiries it cannot be denied that his debts occasionally caused him anxiety but they were not considerable he quieted his conscience by the belief that if he were pressed his grandfather could scarcely refuse to discharge a few hundred pounds for his favourite grandson and at all events he felt that the ultimate resource of selling his commission was still reserved for him if these vague prospects did not drive away compunction the qualms of conscience were generally allayed in the evening assembly in which his vanity was gratified at length he paid his first visit to england that was a happy meeting his kind father his dear dear mother and the faithful glastonbury experienced some of the most transporting moments of their existence when they beheld with admiring gaze the hero who returned to them their eyes were never satiated with beholding him they hung upon his accents then came the triumphant visit to grandison and then ferdinand returned to malta in the full conviction that he was the heir to fifteen thousand a year  among many other there is one characteristic of capitals in which valetta is not deficient the facility with which young heirs apparent presumptive or expectant can obtain any accommodation they desire the terms never mind the terms who ever thinks of them as for ferdinand armine who as the only son of an old baronet and the supposed future inheritor of armine park had always been looked upon by tradesmen with a gracious eye he found that his popularity in this respect was not at all diminished by his visit to england and its supposed consequences slight expressions uttered on his return in the confidence of convivial companionship were repeated misrepresented exaggerated and circulated in all quarters we like those whom we love to be fortunate everybody rejoices in the good luck of a popular character and soon it was generally understood that ferdinand armine had become next in the entail to thirty thousand a year and a peerage moreover he was not long to wait for his inheritance the usurers pricked up their ears and such numerous proffers of accommodation and assistance were made to the fortunate mr armine that he really found it quite impossible to refuse them or to reject the loans that were almost forced on his acceptance  ferdinand armine had passed the rubicon he was in debt if youth but knew the fatal misery that they are entailing on themselves the moment they accept a pecuniary credit to which they are not entitled how they would start in their career how pale they would turn how they would tremble and clasp their hands in agony at the precipice on which they are disporting debt is the prolific mother of folly and of crime it taints the course of life in all its dreams hence so many unhappy marriages so many prostituted pens and venal politicians it hath a small beginning but a giants growth and strength when we make the monster we make our master who haunts us at all hours and shakes his whip of scorpions for ever in our sight the slave hath no overseer so severe faustus when he signed the bond with blood did not secure a doom more terrific but when we are young we must enjoy ourselves true and there are few things more gloomy than the recollection of a youth that has not been enjoyed what prosperity of manhood what splendour of old age can compensate for it wealth is power and in youth of all seasons of life we require power because we can enjoy everything that we can command what then is to be done i leave the question to the schoolmen because i am convinced that to moralise with the inexperienced availeth nothing  the conduct of men depends upon their temperament not upon a bunch of musty maxims no one had been educated with more care than ferdinand armine in no heart had stricter precepts of moral conduct ever been instilled but he was lively and impetuous with a fiery imagination violent passions and a daring soul sanguine he was as the day he could not believe in the night of sorrow and the impenetrable gloom that attends a career that has failed the world was all before him and he dashed at it like a young charger in his first strife confident that he must rush to victory and never dreaming of death  thus would i attempt to account for the extreme imprudence of his conduct on his return from england he was confident in his future fortunes he was excited by the applause of the men and the admiration of the women he determined to gratify even to satiety his restless vanity he broke into profuse expenditure he purchased a yacht he engaged a villa his racinghorses and his servants exceeded all other establishments except the governors in breeding in splendour and in number occasionally wearied with the monotony of malta he obtained a short leave of absence and passed a few weeks at naples palermo and rome where he glittered in brilliant circles and whence he returned laden with choice specimens of art and luxury and followed by the report of strange and flattering adventures finally he was the prime patron of the maltese opera and brought over a celebrated prima donna from san carlo in his own vessel  in the midst of his career ferdinand received intelligence of the death of lord grandison fortunately when he received it he was alone there was no one therefore to witness his blank dismay when he discovered that after all he was not his grandfathers heir after a vast number of trifling legacies to his daughters and their husbands and their children and all his favourite friends lord grandison left the whole of his property to his granddaughter katherine the only remaining child of his son who had died early in life and the sister of the lately deceased augustus  what was to be done now his mothers sanguine mind for lady armine broke to him the fatal intelligence already seemed to anticipate the only remedy for this unjust will it was a remedy delicately intimated but the intention fell upon a fine and ready ear yes he must marry he must marry his cousin he must marry katherine grandison ferdinand looked around him at his magnificent rooms the damask hangings of tunis the tall mirrors from marseilles the inlaid tables the marble statues and the alabaster vases that he had purchased at florence and at rome and the delicate mats that he had himself imported from algiers he looked around and he shrugged his shoulders all this must be paid for thought he and alas how much more and then came across his mind a recollection of his father and his cares and innocent armine and dear glastonbury and his sacrifice ferdinand shook his head and sighed  how have i repaid them thought he thank god they know nothing thank god they have only to bear their own disappointments and their own privations but it is in vain to moralise the future not the past must be my motto to retreat is impossible i may yet advance and conquer katherine grandison only think of my little cousin kate for a wife they say that it is not the easiest task in the world to fan a lively flame in the bosom of a cousin the love of cousins is proverbially not of a very romantic character tis well i have not seen her much in my life and very little of late familiarity breeds contempt they say will she dare to despise me he glanced at the mirror the inspection was not unsatisfactory plunged in profound meditation he paced the room     chapter ii       in which captain armine achieves with rapidity a result      which always requires great deliberation  it so happened that the regiment in which captain armine had the honour of commanding a company was at this time under orders of immediate recall to england and within a month of his receipt of the fatal intelligence of his being as he styled it disinherited he was on his way to his native land this speedy departure was fortunate because it permitted him to retire before the death of lord grandison became generally known and consequently commented upon and enquired into previous to quitting the garrison ferdinand had settled his affairs for the time without the slightest difficulty as he was still able to raise any money that he required  on arriving at falmouth ferdinand learnt that his father and mother were at bath on a visit to his maiden aunt miss grandison with whom his cousin now resided as the regiment was quartered at exeter he was enabled in a very few days to obtain leave of absence and join them in the first rapture of meeting all disappointment was forgotten and in the course of a day or two when this sentiment had somewhat subsided ferdinand perceived that the shock which his parents must have necessarily experienced was already considerably softened by the prospect in which they secretly indulged and which various circumstances combined in inducing them to believe was by no means a visionary one  his cousin katherine was about his own age mild elegant and pretty being fair she looked extremely well in her deep mourning she was not remarkable for the liveliness of her mind yet not devoid of observation although easily influenced by those whom she loved and with whom she lived her maiden aunt evidently exercised a powerful control over her conduct and opinions and lady armine was a favourite sister of this maiden aunt without therefore apparently directing her will there was no lack of effort from this quarter to predispose katherine in favour of her cousin she heard so much of her cousin ferdinand of his beauty and his goodness and his accomplishments that she had looked forward to his arrival with feelings of no ordinary interest and indeed if the opinions and sentiments of those with whom she lived could influence there was no need of any artifice to predispose her in favour of her cousin sir ratcliffe and lady armine were wrapped up in their son they seemed scarcely to have another idea feeling or thought in the world but his existence and his felicity and although their good sense had ever preserved them from the silly habit of uttering his panegyric in his presence they amply compensated for this painful restraint when he was away then he was ever the handsomest the cleverest the most accomplished and the most kindhearted and virtuous of his sex fortunate the parents blessed with such a son thrice fortunate the wife blessed with such a husband  it was therefore with no ordinary emotion that katherine grandison heard that this perfect cousin ferdinand had at length arrived she had seen little of him even in his boyish days and even then he was rather a hero in their lilliputian circle  ferdinand armine was always looked up to at grandison and always spoken of by her grandfather as a very fine fellow indeed a wonderfully fine fellow his favourite grandson ferdinand armine and now he had arrived his knock was heard at the door his step was on the stairs the door opened and certainly his first appearance did not disappoint his cousin kate so handsome so easy so gentle and so cordial they were all the best friends in a moment then he embraced his father with such fervour and kissed his mother with such fondness it was evident that he had an excellent heart his arrival indeed was a revolution their mourning days seemed at once to disappear and although they of course entered society very little and never frequented any public amusement it seemed to katherine that all of a sudden she lived in a round of delightful gaiety ferdinand was so amusing and so accomplished he sang with her he played with her he was always projecting long summer rides and long summer walks then his conversation was so different from everything to which she had ever listened he had seen so many things and so many persons everything that was strange and everybody that was famous his opinions were so original his illustrations so apt and lively his anecdotes so inexhaustible and sparkling poor inexperienced innocent katherine her cousin in fourandtwenty hours found it quite impossible to fall in love with her and so he determined to make her fall in love with him he quite succeeded she adored him she did not believe that there was anyone in the world so handsome so good and so clever no one indeed who knew ferdinand armine could deny that he was a rare being but had there been any acute and unprejudiced observers who had known him in his younger and happier hours they would perhaps have remarked some difference in his character and conduct and not a favourable one he was indeed more brilliant but not quite so interesting as in old days far more dazzling but not quite so apt to charm no one could deny his lively talents and his perfect breeding but there was a restlessness about him an excited and exaggerated style which might have made some suspect that his demeanour was an effort and that under a superficial glitter by which so many are deceived there was no little deficiency of the genuine and sincere katherine grandison however was not one of those profound observers she was easily captivated ferdinand who really did not feel sufficient emotion to venture upon a scene made his proposals to her when they were riding in a green lane the sun just setting and the evening star glittering through a vista the lady blushed and wept and sobbed and hid her fair and streaming face but the result was as satisfactory as our hero could desire the young equestrians kept their friends in the crescent at least two hours for dinner and then had no appetite for the repast when they had arrived  nevertheless the maiden aunt although a very particular personage made this day no complaint and was evidently far from being dissatisfied with anybody or anything as for ferdinand he called for a tumbler of champagne and secretly drank his own health as the luckiest fellow of his acquaintance with a pretty amiable and highbred wife with all his debts paid and the house of armine restored     chapter iii       which ferdinand returns to armine  it was settled that a year must elapse from the death of lord grandison before the young couple could be united a reprieve which did not occasion ferdinand acute grief in the meantime the grandisons were to pass at least the autumn at armine and thither the united families proposed soon to direct their progress ferdinand who had been nearly two months at bath and was a little wearied of courtship contrived to quit that city before his friends on the plea of visiting london to arrange about selling his commission for it was agreed that he should quit the army  on his arrival in london having spoken to his agent and finding town quite empty he set off immediately for armine in order that he might have the pleasure of being there a few days without the society of his intended celebrate the impending first of september and especially embrace his dear glastonbury for it must not be supposed that ferdinand had forgotten for a moment this invaluable friend on the contrary he had written to him several times since his arrival always assuring him that nothing but important business could prevent him from instantly paying him his respects  it was with feelings of no common emotion even of agitation that ferdinand beheld the woods of his ancient home rise in the distance and soon the towers and turrets of armine castle those venerable bowers that proud and lordly house were not then to pass away from their old and famous line he had redeemed the heritage of his great ancestry he looked with unmingled complacency on the magnificent landscape once to him a source of as much anxiety as affection what a change in the destiny of the armines their glory restored his own devoted and domestic hearth once the prey of so much care and gloom crowned with ease and happiness and joy on all sides a career of splendour and felicity and he had done all this what a prophet was his mother she had ever indulged the fond conviction that her beloved son would be their restorer how wise and pious was the undeviating confidence of kind old glastonbury in their fate with what pure what heartfelt delight would that faithful friend listen to his extraordinary communication  his carriage dashed through the park gates as if the driver were sensible of his masters pride and exultation glastonbury was ready to welcome him standing in the flowergarden which he had made so rich and beautiful and which had been the charm and consolation of many of their humbler hours  my dear dear father exclaimed ferdinand embracing him for thus he ever styled his old tutor  but glastonbury could not speak the tears quivered in his eyes and trickled down his faded cheek ferdinand led him into the house  how well you look dear father continued ferdinand you really look younger and heartier than ever you received all my letters i am sure and yours how kind of you to remember and to write to me i never forgot you my dear dear friend i never could forget you do you know i am the happiest fellow in the world i have the greatest news in the world to tell my glastonburyand we owe everything to you everything what would sir ratcliffe have been without you what should i have been fancy the best news you can dear friend and it is not so good as i have got to tell you will rejoice you will be delighted we shall furnish a castle by jove we shall furnish a castle we shall indeed and you shall build it no more gloom no more care the armines shall hold their heads up again by jove they shall dearest of men i dare say you think me mad i am mad with joy how that virginian creeper has grown i have brought you so many plants my father a complete sicilian hortus siccus ah john good john how is your wife take care of my pistolcase ask louis he knows all about everything well dear glastonbury and how have you been how is the old tower how are the old books and the old staff and the old arms and the old everything dear dear glastonbury  while the carriage was unpacking and the dinnertable prepared the friends walked in the garden and from thence strolled towards the tower where they remained some time pacing up and down the beechen avenue it was evident on their return that ferdinand had communicated his great intelligence the countenance of glastonbury was radiant with delight  indeed although he had dined he accepted with readiness ferdinands invitation to repeat the ceremony nay he quaffed more than one glass of wine and i believe even drank the health of every member of the united families of armine and grandison it was late before the companions parted and retired for the night and i think before they bade each other good night they must have talked over every circumstance that had occurred in their experience since the birth of ferdinand     chapter iv       in which some light is thrown on the title of this work  how delicious after a long absence to wake on a sunny morning and find ourselves at home ferdinand could scarcely credit that he was really again at armine he started up in his bed and rubbed his eyes and stared at the unaccustomed yet familiar sights and for a moment malta and the royal fusiliers bath and his betrothed were all a dream and then he remembered the visit of his dear mother to this very room on the eve of his first departure he had returned in safety had he returned and in happiness to accomplish all her hopes and to reward her for all her solicitude never felt anyone more content than ferdinand armine more content and more grateful  he rose and opened the casement a rich and exhilarating perfume filled the chamber he looked with a feeling of delight and pride over the broad and beautiful park the tall trees rising and flinging their taller shadows over the bright and dewy turf and the last mists clearing away from the distant woods and blending with the spotless sky everything was sweet and still save indeed the carol of the birds or the tinkle of some restless bellwether it was a rich autumnal morn and yet with all the excitement of his new views in life and the blissful consciousness of the happiness of those he loved he could not but feel that a great change had come over his spirit since the days he was wont to ramble in this old haunt of his boyhood his innocence was gone life was no longer that deep unbroken trance of duty and of love from which he had been roused to so much care and if not remorse at least to so much compunction he had no secrets then existence was not then a subterfuge but a calm and candid state of serene enjoyment feelings then were not compromised for interests and then it was the excellent that was studied not the expedient yet such i suppose is life murmured ferdinand we moralise when it is too late nor is there anything more silly than to regret one event makes another what we anticipate seldom occurs what we least expected generally happens and time can only prove which is most for our advantage and surely i am the last person who should look grave our ancient house rises from its ruins the beings i love most in the world are not only happy but indebted to me for their happiness and i i myself with every gift of fortune suddenly thrown at my feet what more can i desire am i not satisfied why do i even ask the question i am sure i know not it rises like a devil in my thoughts and spoils everything the girl is young noble and fair and loves me and her i love her at least i suppose i love her i love her at any rate as much as i love or ever did love woman there is no great sacrifice then on my part there should be none there is none unless indeed it be that a man does not like to give up without a struggle all his chance of romance and rapture  i know not how it is but there are moments i almost wish that i had no father and no mother ay not a single friend or relative in the world and that armine were sunk into the very centre of the earth if i stood alone in the world methinks i might find the place that suits me now everything seems ordained for me as it were beforehand my spirit has had no play something whispers me that with all its flush prosperity this is neither wise nor well god knows i am not heartless and would be grateful and yet if life can afford me no deeper sympathy than i have yet experienced i cannot but hold it even with all its sweet reflections as little better than a dull delusion  while ferdinand was thus moralising at the casement glastonbury appeared beneath and his appearance dissipated this gathering gloom let us breakfast together proposed ferdinand i have breakfasted these two hours replied the hermit of the gate i hope that on the first night of your return to armine you have proved auspicious dreams  my bed and i are old companions said ferdinand and we agreed very well i tell you what my dear glastonbury we will have a stroll together this morning and talk over our plans of last night go into the library and look over my sketchbooks you will find them on my pistolcase and i will be with you anon  in due time the friends commenced their ramble ferdinand soon became excited by glastonburys various suggestions for the completion of the castle and as for the old man himself between his architectural creation and the restoration of the family to which he had been so long devoted he was in a rapture of enthusiasm which afforded an amusing contrast to his usual meek and subdued demeanour  your grandfather was a great man said glastonbury who in old days seldom ventured to mention the name of the famous sir ferdinand there is no doubt he was a very great man he had great ideas how he would glory in our present prospects tis strange what a strong confidence i have ever had in the destiny of your house i felt sure that providence would not desert us there is no doubt we must have a portcullis  decidedly a portcullis said ferdinand you shall make all the drawings yourself my dear glastonbury and supervise everything we will not have a single anachronism it shall be perfect  perfect echoed glastonbury really perfect it shall be a perfect gothic castle i have such treasures for the work all the labours of my life have tended to this object i have all the emblazonings of your house since the conquest there shall be three hundred shields in the hall i will paint them myself oh there is no place in the world like armine  nothing said ferdinand i have seen a great deal but after all there is nothing like armine  had we been born to this splendour said glastonbury we should have thought little of it we have been mildly and wisely chastened i cannot sufficiently admire the wisdom of providence which has tempered by such a wise dispensation the tooeager blood of your race  i should be sorry to pull down the old place said ferdinand  it must not be said glastonbury we have lived there happily though humbly  i would we could move it to another part of the park like the house of loretto said ferdinand with a smile  we can cover it with ivy observed glastonbury looking somewhat grave  the morning stole away in these agreeable plans and prospects at length the friends parted agreeing to meet again at dinner glastonbury repaired to his tower and ferdinand taking his gun sauntered into the surrounding wilderness  but he felt no inclination for sport the conversation with glastonbury had raised a thousand thoughts over which he longed to brood his life had been a scene of such constant excitement since his return to england that he had enjoyed little opportunity of indulging in calm selfcommunion and now that he was at armine and alone the contrast between his past and his present situation struck him so forcibly that he could not refrain from falling into a reverie upon his fortunes it was wonderful all wonderful very very wonderful there seemed indeed as glastonbury affirmed a providential dispensation in the whole transaction the fall of his family the heroic and as it now appeared prescient firmness with which his father had clung in all their deprivations to his unproductive patrimony his own education the extinction of his mothers house his very follies once to him a cause of so much unhappiness but which it now seemed were all the time compelling him as it were to his prosperity all these and a thousand other traits and circumstances flitted over his mind and were each in turn the subject of his manifold meditation willing was he to credit that destiny had reserved for him the character of restorer that duty indeed he had accepted and yet  he looked around him as if to see what devil was whispering in his ear he was alone no one was there or near around him rose the silent bowers and scarcely the voice of a bird or the hum of an insect disturbed the deep tranquillity but a cloud seemed to rest on the fair and pensive brow of ferdinand armine he threw himself on the turf leaning his head on one hand and with the other plucking the wild flowers which he as hastily almost as fretfully flung away  conceal it as i will he exclaimed i am a victim disguise them as i may all the considerations are worldly there is there must be something better in this world than power and wealth and rank and surely there must be felicity more rapturous even than securing the happiness of a parent ah dreams in which i have so oft and so fondly indulged are ye indeed after all but fantastical and airy visions is love indeed a delusion or am i marked out from men alone to be exempted from its delicious bondage it must be a delusion all laugh at it all jest about it all agree in stigmatising it the vanity of vanities and does my experience contradict this harsh but common fame alas what have i seen or known to give the lie to this ill report no one nothing some women i have met more beautiful assuredly than kate and many many less fair and some have crossed my path with a wild and brilliant grace that has for a moment dazzled my sight and perhaps for a moment lured me from my way but these shooting stars have but glittered transiently in my heaven and only made me by their evanescent brilliancy more sensible of its gloom let me believe then oh let me of all men then believe that the forms that inspire the sculptor and the painter have no models in nature that that combination of beauty and grace of fascinating intelligence and fond devotion over which men brood in the soft hours of their young loneliness is but the promise of a better world and not the charm of this one  but what terror in that truth what despair what madness yes at this moment of severest scrutiny how profoundly i feel that life without love is worse than death how vain and void how flat and fruitless appear all those splendid accidents of existence for which men struggle without this essential and pervading charm what a world without a sun yes without this transcendent sympathy riches and rank and even power and fame seem to me at best but jewels set in a coronet of lead  and who knows whether that extraordinary being of whose magnificent yet ruinous career this castle is in truth a fitting emblemi say who knows whether the secret of his wild and restless course is not hidden in this same sad lack of love perhaps while the world the silly superficial world marvelled and moralised at his wanton life and poured forth its anathemas against his heartless selfishness perchance he all the time was sighing for some soft bosom whereon to pour his overwhelming passion even as i am  o nature why art thou beautiful my heart requires not imagination cannot paint a sweeter or a fairer scene than these surrounding bowers this azazure vault of heaven this golden sunshine this deep and blending shade these rare and fragrant shrubs yon grove of green and tallest pines and the bright gliding of this swancrowned lake my soul is charmed with all this beauty and this sweetness i feel no disappointment here my mind does not here outrun reality here there is no cause to mourn over ungratified hopes and fanciful desires is it then my destiny that i am to be baffled only in the dearest desires of my heart  at this moment the loud and agitated barking of his dogs at some little distance roused ferdinand from his reverie he called them to him and soon one of them obeyed his summons but instantly returned to his companion with such significant gestures panting and yelping that ferdinand supposed that basto was caught perhaps in some trap so taking up his gun he proceeded to the dogs rescue  to his surprise as he was about to emerge from a berceau on to a plot of turf in the centre of which grew a large cedar he beheld a lady in a ridinghabit standing before the tree and evidently admiring its beautiful proportions  illustration page094jpg  her countenance was raised and motionless it seemed to him that it was more radiant than the sunshine he gazed with rapture on the dazzling brilliancy of her complexion the delicate regularity of her features and the large violettinted eyes fringed with the longest and the darkest lashes that he had ever beheld from her position her hat had fallen back revealing her lofty and pellucid brow and the dark and lustrous locks that were braided over her temples the whole countenance combined that brilliant health and that classic beauty which we associate with the idea of some nymph tripping over the dewbespangled meads of ida or glancing amid the hallowed groves of greece although the lady could scarcely have seen eighteen summers her stature was above the common height but language cannot describe the startling symmetry of her superb figure  there is no love but love at first sight this is the transcendent and surpassing offspring of sheer and unpolluted sympathy all other is the illegitimate result of observation of reflection of compromise of comparison of expediency the passions that endure flash like the lightning they scorch the soul but it is warmed for ever miserable man whose love rises by degrees upon the frigid morning of his mind some hours indeed of warmth and lustre may perchance fall to his lot some moments of meridian splendour in which he basks in what he deems eternal sunshine but then how often overcast by the clouds of care how often dusked by the blight of misery and misfortune and certain as the gradual rise of such affection is its gradual decline and melancholy setting then in the chill dim twilight of his soul he execrates custom because he has madly expected that feelings could be habitual that were not homogeneous and because he has been guided by the observation of sense and not by the inspiration of sympathy  amid the gloom and travail of existence suddenly to behold a beautiful being and as instantaneously to feel an overwhelming conviction that with that fair form for ever our destiny must be entwined that there is no more joy but in her joy no sorrow but when she grieves that in her sigh of love in her smile of fondness hereafter all is bliss to feel our flaunty ambition fade away like a shrivelled gourd before her vision to feel fame a juggle and posterity a lie and to be prepared at once for this great object to forfeit and fling away all former hopes ties schemes views to violate in her favour every duty of society this is a lover and this is love magnificent sublime divine sentiment an immortal flame burns in the breast of that man who adores and is adored he is an ethereal being the accidents of earth touch him not revolutions of empire changes of creed mutations of opinion are to him but the clouds and meteors of a stormy sky the schemes and struggles of mankind are in his thinking but the anxieties of pigmies and the fantastical achievements of apes nothing can subdue him he laughs alike at loss of fortune loss of friends loss of character the deeds and thoughts of men are tor him equally indifferent he does not mingle in their paths of callous bustle or hold himself responsible to the airy impostures before which they bow down he is a mariner who on the sea of life keeps his gaze fixedly on a single star and if that do not shine he lets go the rudder and glories when his barque descends into the bottomless gulf  yes it was this mighty passion that now raged in the heart of ferdinand armine as pale and trembling he withdrew a few paces from the overwhelming spectacle and leant against a tree in a chaos of emotion what had he seen what ravishing vision had risen upon his sight what did he feel what wild what delicious what maddening impulse now pervaded his frame a storm seemed raging in his soul a mighty wind dispelling in its course the sullen clouds and vapours of long years silent he was indeed for he was speechless though the big drop that quivered on his brow and the slight foam that played upon his lip proved the difficult triumph of passion over expression but as the wind clears the heaven passion eventually tranquillises the soul the tumult of his mind gradually subsided the flitting memories the scudding thoughts that for a moment had coursed about in such wild order vanished and melted away and a feeling of bright serenity succeeded a sense of beauty and of joy and of hovering and circumambient happiness  he advanced and gazed again the lady was still there changed indeed her position she had gathered a flower and was examining its beauty  henrietta exclaimed a manly voice from the adjoining wood before she could answer a stranger came forward a man of middle age but of an appearance remarkably prepossessing he was tall and dignified fair with an aquiline nose one of ferdinands dogs followed him barking  i cannot find the gardener anywhere said the stranger i think we had better remount  ah me what a pity exclaimed the lady  let me be your guide said ferdinand advancing  the lady rather started the gentleman not at all discomposed courteously welcomed ferdinand and said i feel that we are intruders sir but we were informed by the woman at the lodge that the family were not here at present and that we should find her husband in the grounds  the family are not at armine replied ferdinand i am sure however sir ratcliffe would be most happy for you to walk about the grounds as much as you please and as i am well acquainted with them i should feel delighted to be your guide  you are really too courteous sir replied the gentleman and his beautiful companion rewarded ferdinand with a smile like a sunbeam that played about her countenance till it finally settled into two exquisite dimples and revealed to him teeth that for a moment he believed to be even the most beautiful feature of that surpassing visage  they sauntered along every step developing new beauties in their progress and eliciting from his companions renewed expressions of rapture the dim bowers the shining glades the tall rare trees the luxuriant shrubs the silent and sequestered lake in turn enchanted them until at length ferdinand who had led them with experienced taste through all the most striking points of the pleasaunce brought them before the walls of the castle  and here is armine castle he said it is little better than a shell and yet contains something which you might like to see  oh by all means exclaimed the lady  but we are spoiling your sport suggested the gentleman  i can always kill partridges replied ferdinand laying down his gun but i cannot always find agreeable companions  so saying he opened the massy portal of the castle and they entered the hall it was a lofty chamber of dimensions large enough to feast a thousand vassals with a dais and a rich gothic screen and a gallery for the musicians the walls were hung with arms and armour admirably arranged but the particoloured marble floor was so covered with piledup cases of furniture that the general effect of the scene was not only greatly marred but it was even difficult in some parts to trace a path  here said ferdinand jumping upon a huge case and running to the wall here is the standard of ralph dermyn who came over with the conqueror and founded the family in england here is the sword of william darmyn who signed magna carta here is the complete coat armour of the second ralph who died before ascalon this case contains a diamondhilted sword given by the empress to the great sir ferdinand for defeating the turks and here is a mameluke sabre given to the same sir ferdinand by the sultan for defeating the empress  oh i have heard so much of that great sir ferdinand said the lady he must have been the most interesting character  he was a marvellous being answered her guide with a peculiar look and yet i know not whether his descendants have not cause to rue his genius  oh never never said the lady what is wealth to genius how much prouder were i an armine should i be of such an ancestor than of a thousand others even if they had left me this castle as complete as he wished it to be  well as to that replied ferdinand i believe i am somewhat of your opinion though i fear he lived in too late an age for such order of minds it would have been better for him perhaps if he had succeeded in becoming king of poland  i hope there is a portrait of him said the lady there is nothing i long so much to see  i rather think there is a portrait replied her companion somewhat drily we will try to find it out do not you think i make not a bad cicerone  indeed most excellent replied the lady  i perceive you are a master of your subject replied the gentleman thus affording ferdinand an easy opportunity of telling them who he was the hint however was not accepted  and now said ferdinand we will ascend the staircase  accordingly they mounted a large spiral staircase which filled the space of a round tower and was lighted from the top by a lantern of rich coloured glass on which were emblazoned the arms of the family then they entered the vestibule an apartment spacious enough for a salon which however was not fitted up in the gothic style but of which the painted ceiling the gilded panels and inlaid floor were more suitable to a french palace the brilliant doors of this vestibule opened in many directions upon long suites of state chambers which indeed merited the description of shells they were nothing more of many the flooring was not even laid down the walls of all were rough and plastered  ah said the lady what a pity it is not finished  it is indeed desolate observed ferdinand but here perhaps is something more to your taste so saying he opened another door and ushered them into the picture gallery  it was a superb chamber nearly two hundred feet in length and contained only portraits of the family or pictures of their achievements it was of a pale green colour lighted from the top and the floor of oak and ebony was partially covered with a single persian carpet of fanciful pattern and brilliant dye a present from the sultan to the great sir ferdinand the earlier annals of the family were illustrated by a series of paintings by modern masters representing the battle of hastings the siege of ascalon the meeting at runnymede the various invasions of france and some of the most striking incidents in the wars of the roses in all of which a valiant armyn prominently figured at length they stood before the first contemporary portrait of the armyn family one of cardinal stephen armyn by an italian master this great dignitary was legate of the pope in the time of the seventh henry and in his scarlet robes and ivory chair looked a papal jupiter not unworthy himself of wielding the thunder of the vatican from him the series of family portraits was unbroken and it was very interesting to trace in this excellently arranged collection the history of national costume holbein had commemorated the lords tewkesbury rich in velvet and golden chains and jewels the statesmen of elizabeth and james and their beautiful and gorgeous dames followed and then came many a gallant cavalier by vandyke one admirable picture contained lord armine and his brave brothers seated together in a tent round a drum on which his lordship was apparently planning the operations of the campaign then followed a long series of unmemorable baronets and their more interesting wives and daughters touched by the pencil of kneller of lely or of hudson squires in wigs and scarlet jackets and powdered dames in hoops and farthingales  they stood before the crowning effort of the gallery the masterpiece of reynolds it represented a fulllength portrait of a young man apparently just past his minority the side of the figure was alone exhibited and the face glanced at the spectator over the shoulder in a favourite attitude of vandyke it was a countenance of ideal beauty a profusion of dark brown curls was dashed aside from a lofty forehead of dazzling brilliancy the face was perfectly oval the nose though small was high and aquiline and exhibited a remarkable dilation of the nostril the curling lip was shaded by a very delicate mustache and the general expression indeed of the mouth and of the large grey eyes would have been perhaps arrogant and imperious had not the extraordinary beauty of the whole countenance rendered it fascinating  it was indeed a picture to gaze upon and to return to one of those visages which after having once beheld haunt us at all hours and flit across our minds eye unexpected and unbidden so great was the effect that it produced upon the present visitors to the gallery that they stood before it for some minutes in silence the scrutinising glance of the gentleman was more than once diverted from the portrait to the countenance of his conductor and the silence was eventually broken by our hero  and what think you he enquired of the famous sir ferdinand  the lady started looked at him withdrew her glance and appeared somewhat confused her companion replied i think sir i cannot err in believing that i am indebted for much courtesy to his descendant  i believe said ferdinand that i should not have much trouble in proving my pedigree i am generally considered an ugly likeness of my grandfather  the gentleman smiled and then said i hardly know whether i can style myself your neighbour for i live nearly ten miles distant it would however afford me sincere gratification to see you at ducie bower i cannot welcome you in a castle my name is temple he continued offering his card to ferdinand i need not now introduce you to my daughter i was not unaware that sir ratcliffe armine had a son but i had understood he was abroad  i have returned to england within these two months replied ferdinand and to armine within these two days i deem it fortunate that my return has afforded me an opportunity of welcoming you and miss temple but you must not talk of our castle for that you know is our folly pray come now and visit our older and humbler dwelling and take some refreshment after your long ride  this offer was declined but with great courtesy they quitted the castle and mr temple was about to direct his steps towards the lodge where he had left his own and his daughters horses but ferdinand persuaded them to return through the park which he proved to them very satisfactorily must be the nearest way he even asked permission to accompany them and while his groom was saddling his horse he led them to the old place and the flowergarden  you must be very fatigued miss temple i wish that i could persuade you to enter and rest yourself  indeed no i love flowers too much to leave them  here is one that has the recommendation of novelty as well as beauty said ferdinand plucking a strange rose and presenting it to her i sent it to my mother from barbary  you live amidst beauty  i think that i never remember armine looking so well as today  a sylvan scene requires sunshine replied miss temple we have been most fortunate in our visit  it is something brighter than the sunshine that makes it so fair replied ferdinand but at this moment the horses appeared     chapter v       in which captain armine is very absent during dinner  you are well mounted said mr temple to ferdinand  tis a barb i brought it over with me  tis a beautiful creature said miss temple  hear that selim said ferdinand prick up thine ears my steed i perceive that you are an accomplished horsewoman miss temple you know our country i dare say well  i wish to know it better this is only the second summer that we have passed at ducie  bythebye i suppose you know my landlord captain armine said mr temple  no said ferdinand i do not know a single person in the county i have myself scarcely been at armine for these five years and my father and mother do not visit anyone  what a beautiful oak exclaimed miss temple desirous of turning the conversation  it has the reputation of being planted by sir francis walsingham said ferdinand an ancestor of mine married his daughter he was the father of sir walsingham the portrait in the gallery with the white stick you remember it  perfectly that beautiful portrait it must be at all events a very old tree  there are few things more pleasing to me than an ancient place said mr temple  doubly pleasing when in the possession of an ancient family added his daughter  i fear such feelings are fast wearing away said ferdinand  there will be a reaction said mr temple  they cannot destroy the poetry of time said the lady  i hope i have no very inveterate prejudices said ferdinand but i should be sorry to see armine in any other hands than our own i confess  i never would enter the park again said miss temple  so far as worldly considerations are concerned continued ferdinand it would perhaps be much better for us if we were to part with it  it must indeed be a costly place to keep up said mr temple  why as for that said ferdinand we let the kine rove and the sheep browse where our fathers hunted the stag and flew their falcons i think if they were to rise from their graves they would be ashamed of us  nay said miss temple i think yonder cattle are very picturesque but the truth is anything would look well in such a park as this there is such a variety of prospect  the park of armine indeed differed materially from those vampedup sheepwalks and ambitious paddocks which are now honoured with the title it was in truth the old chase and little shorn of its original proportions it was many miles in circumference abounding in hill and dale and offering much variety of appearance sometimes it was studded with ancient timber single trees of extraordinary growth and rich clumps that seemed coeval with the foundation of the family tracts of wild champaign succeeded these covered with gorse and fern then came stately avenues of sycamore or spanish chestnut fragments of stately woods that in old days doubtless reached the vicinity of the mansion house and these were in turn succeeded by modern coverts  at length our party reached the gate whence ferdinand had calculated that they should quit the park he would willingly have accompanied them he bade them farewell with regret which was softened by the hope expressed by all of a speedy meeting  i wish captain armine said miss temple we had your turf to canter home upon  bythebye captain armine said mr temple ceremony should scarcely subsist between country neighbours and certainly we have given you no cause to complain of our reserve as you are alone at armine perhaps you would come over and dine with us tomorrow if you can manage to come early we will see whether we may not contrive to kill a bird together and pray remember we can give you a bed which i think all things considered it would be but wise to accept  i accept everything said ferdinand smiling all your offers good morning my dearest sir good morning miss temple  miss temple indeed exclaimed ferdinand when he had watched them out of sight exquisite enchanting adored being without thee what is existence how dull how blank does everything even now seem it is as if the sun had just set oh that form that radiant countenance that musical and thrilling voice those tones still vibrate on my ear or i should deem it all a vision will tomorrow ever come oh that i could express to you my love my overwhelming my absorbing my burning passion beautiful henrietta thou hast a name methinks i ever loved where am i what do i say what wild what maddening words are these am i not ferdinand armine the betrothed the victim even now methinks i hear the chariotwheels of my bride god if she be there if she indeed be at armine on my return ill not see her ill not speak to them ill fly ill cast to the winds all ties and duties i will not be dragged to the altar a miserable sacrifice to redeem by my forfeited felicity the worldly fortunes of my race o armine armine she would not enter thy walls again if other blood but mine swayed thy fair demesne and i shall i give thee another mistress armine it would indeed be treason without her i cannot live without her form bounds over this turf and glances in these arbours i never wish to view them all the inducements to make the wretched sacrifice once meditated then vanish for armine without her is a desert a tomb a hell i am free then excellent logician but this woman i am bound to her bound the word makes me tremble i shiver i hear the clank of my fetters am i indeed bound ay in honour honour and love a contest pah the idol must yield to the divinity  with these wild words and wilder thoughts bursting from his lips and dashing through his mind his course as irregular and as reckless as his fancies now fiercely galloping now pulling up into a sudden halt ferdinand at length arrived home and his quick eye perceived in a moment that the dreaded arrival had not taken place glastonbury was in the flowergarden on one knee before a vase over which he was training a creeper he looked up as he heard the approach of ferdinand his presence and benignant smile in some degree stilled the fierce emotions of his pupil ferdinand felt that the system of dissimulation must now commence besides he was always careful to be most kind to glastonbury he would not allow that any attack of spleen or even illness could ever justify a careless look or expression to that dear friend  i hope my dear father said ferdinand i am punctual to our hour  the sundial tells me said glastonbury that you have arrived to the moment and i rather think that yonder approaches a summons to our repast i hope you have passed your morning agreeably  if all days would pass as sweet my father i should indeed be blessed  i too have had a fine morning of it you must come tomorrow and see my grand emblazonry of the ratcliffe and armine coats i mean it for the gallery with these words they entered the place  you do not eat my child said glastonbury to his companion  i have taken too long a ride perhaps said ferdinand who indeed was much too excited to have an appetite and so abstracted that anyone but glastonbury would have long before detected his absence  i have changed my hour today continued glastonbury for the pleasure of dining with you and i think tomorrow you had better change your hour and dine with me  bythebye my dear father you who know everything do you happen to know a gentleman of the name of temple in this neighbourhood  i think i heard that mr ducie had let the bower to a gentleman of that name  do you know who he is  i never asked for i feel no interest except about proprietors because they enter into my county history but i think i once heard that this mr temple had been our minister at some foreign court you give me a fine dinner and eat nothing yourself this pigeon is savoury  i will trouble you i think there once was a henrietta armine my father  the beautiful creature said glastonbury laying down his knife and fork she died young she was a daughter of lord armine and the queen henrietta maria was her godmother it grieves me much that we have no portrait of her she was very fair her eyes of a sweet light blue  oh no dark my father dark and deep as the violet  my child the letterwriter who mentions her death describes them as light blue i know of no other record of her beauty  i wish they had been dark said ferdinand recovering himself however i am glad there was a henrietta armine tis a beautiful name  i think that armine makes any name sound well said glastonbury no more wine indeed my child nay if i must continued he with a most benevolent smile i will drink to the health of miss grandison  ah exclaimed ferdinand  my child what is the matter inquired glastonbury  a gnat a fly a wasp something stung me said ferdinand  let me fetch my oil of lilies said glastonbury tis a specific  oh no tis nothing only a fly sharp at the moment nothing more  the dinner was over they retired to the library ferdinand walked about the room restless and moody at length he bethought himself of the piano and affecting an anxiety to hear some old favourite compositions of glastonbury he contrived to occupy his companion in time however his old tutor invited him to take his violoncello and join him in a concerto ferdinand of course complied with his invitation but the result was not satisfactory after a series of blunders which were the natural result of his thoughts being occupied on other subjects he was obliged to plead a headache and was glad when he could escape to his chamber  rest however no longer awaited him on his old pillow it was at first delightful to escape from the restraint upon his reverie which he had lately experienced he leant for an hour over his empty fireplace in mute abstraction the cold however in time drove him to bed but he could not sleep his eyes indeed were closed but the vision of henrietta temple was not less apparent to him he recalled every feature of her countenance every trait of her conduct every word that she had expressed the whole series of her observations from the moment he had first seen her until the moment they had parted were accurately repeated her very tones considered and her very attitudes pondered over many were the hours that he heard strike he grew restless and feverish sleep would not be commanded he jumped out of bed he opened the casement he beheld in the moonlight the barbary rosetree of which he had presented her a flower this consoling spectacle assured him that he had not been as he had almost imagined the victim of a dream he knelt down and invoked all heavenly and earthly blessings on henrietta temple and his love the night air and the earnest invocation together cooled his brain and nature soon delivered him exhausted to repose     chapter vi       in which  captain   armine  pays  his first visit to      ducie  yes it is the morning is it possible shall he again behold her that form of surpassing beauty that bright that dazzling countenance again are they to bless his entranced vision shall he speak to her again that musical and thrilling voice shall it again sound and echo in his enraptured ear  ferdinand had reached armine so many days before his calculated arrival that he did not expect his family and the grandisons to arrive for at least a week what a respite did he not now feel this delay if ever he could venture to think of the subject at all he drove it indeed from his thoughts the fascinating present completely engrossed his existence he waited until the post arrived it brought no letters letters now so dreaded he jumped upon his horse and galloped towards ducie  mr temple was the younger son of a younger branch of a noble family inheriting no patrimony he had been educated for the diplomatic service and the influence of his family had early obtained him distinguished appointments he was envoy to a german court when a change of ministry occasioned his recall and he retired after a long career of able and assiduous service comforted by a pension and glorified by a privycouncillorship he was an acute and accomplished man practised in the world with great selfcontrol yet devoted to his daughter the only offspring of a wife whom he had lost early and loved much  deprived at a tender age of that parent of whom she would have become peculiarly the charge henrietta temple found in the devotion of her father all that consolation of which her forlorn state was susceptible she was not delivered over to the custody of a governess or to the even less sympathetic supervision of relations mr temple never permitted his daughter to be separated from him he cherished her life and he directed her education resident in a city which arrogates to itself not without justice the title of the german athens his pupil availed herself of all those advantages which were offered to her by the instruction of the most skilful professors few persons were more accomplished than henrietta temple even at an early age but her rare accomplishments were not her most remarkable characteristics nature which had accorded to her that extraordinary beauty we have attempted to describe had endowed her with great talents and a soul of sublime temper  it was often remarked of henrietta temple and the circumstance may doubtless be in some degree accounted for by the little interference and influence of women in her education that she never was a girl she expanded at once from a charming child into a magnificent woman she had entered life very early and had presided at her fathers table for a year before his recall from his mission few women in so short a period had received so much homage but she listened to compliments with a careless though courteous ear and received more ardent aspirations with a smile the men who were puzzled voted her cold and heartless but men should remember that fineness of taste as well as apathy of temperament may account for an unsuccessful suit assuredly henrietta temple was not deficient in feeling she entertained for her father sentiments almost of idolatry and those more intimate or dependent acquaintances best qualified to form an opinion of her character spoke of her always as a soul of infinite tenderness  notwithstanding their mutual devotion to each other there were not many points of resemblance between the characters of mr temple and his daughter she was remarkable for a frankness of demeanour and a simplicity yet strength of thought which contrasted with the artificial manners and the conventional opinions and conversation of her sire a mind at once thoughtful and energetic permitted henrietta temple to form her own judgments and an artless candour which her father never could eradicate from her habit generally impelled her to express them it was indeed impossible even for him long to find fault with these ebullitions however the diplomatist might deplore them for nature had so imbued the existence of this being with that indefinable charm which we call grace that it was not in your power to behold her a moment without being enchanted a glance a movement a sunny smile a word of thrilling music and all that was left to you was to adore there was indeed in henrietta temple that rare and extraordinary combination of intellectual strength and physical softness which marks out the woman capable of exercising an irresistible influence over mankind in the good old days she might have occasioned a siege of troy or a battle of actium she was one of those women who make nations mad and for whom a man of genius would willingly peril the empire of the world  so at least deemed ferdinand armine as he cantered through the park talking to himself apostrophising the woods and shouting his passion to the winds it was scarcely noon when he reached ducie bower this was a palladian pavilion situated in the midst of beautiful gardens and surrounded by green hills the sun shone brightly the sky was without a cloud it appeared to him that he had never beheld a more graceful scene it was a temple worthy of the divinity it enshrined a fa√ßade of four ionic columns fronted an octagon hall adorned with statues which led into a salon of considerable size and fine proportion ferdinand thought that he had never in his life entered so brilliant a chamber the lofty walls were covered with an indian paper of vivid fancy and adorned with several pictures which his practised eye assured him were of great merit the room without being inconveniently crowded was amply stored with furniture every article of which bespoke a refined and luxurious taste easy chairs of all descriptions most inviting couches cabinets of choice inlay and grotesque tables covered with articles of vertu all those charming infinite nothings which a person of taste might some time back have easily collected during a long residence on the continent a large lamp of dresden china was suspended from the painted and gilded ceiling the three tall windows opened on the gardens and admitted a perfume so rich and various that ferdinand could easily believe the fair mistress as she told him was indeed a lover of flowers a light bridge in the distant wood that bounded the furthest lawn indicated that a stream was at hand what with the beauty of the chamber the richness of the exterior scene and the bright sun that painted every object with its magical colouring and made everything appear even more fair and brilliant ferdinand stood for some moments quite entranced a door opened and mr temple came forward and welcomed him with cordiality  after they had passed a halfhour in looking at the pictures and in conversation to which they gave rise mr temple proposing an adjournment to luncheon conducted ferdinand into a diningroom of which the suitable decorations wonderfully pleased his taste a subdued tint pervaded every part of the chamber the ceiling was painted in grey tinted frescoes of a classical and festive character and the side table which stood in a recess supported by four magnificent columns was adorned with choice etruscan vases the air of repose and stillness which distinguished this apartment was heightened by the vast conservatory into which it led blazing with light and beauty groups of exotic trees plants of radiant tint the sound of a fountain and gorgeous forms of tropic birds  how beautiful exclaimed ferdinand  tis pretty said mr temple carving a pasty but we are very humble people and cannot vie with the lords of gothic castles  it appears to me said ferdinand that ducie bower is the most exquisite place i ever beheld  if you had seen it two years ago you would have thought differently said mr temple i assure you i dreaded becoming its tenant henrietta is entitled to all the praise as she took upon herself the whole responsibility there is not on the banks of the brenta a more dingy and desolate villa than ducie appeared when we first came and as for the gardens they were a perfect wilderness she made everything it was one vast desolate and neglected lawn used as a sheepwalk when we arrived as for the ceilings i was almost tempted to whitewash them and yet you see they have cleaned wonderfully and after all it only required a little taste and labour i have not laid out much money here i built the conservatory to be sure henrietta could not live without a conservatory  miss temple is quite right pronounced ferdinand it is impossible to live without a conservatory  at this moment the heroine of their conversation entered the room and ferdinand turned pale she extended to him her hand with a graceful smile as he touched it he trembled from head to foot  you were not fatigued i hope by your ride miss temple at length he contrived to say  not in the least i am an experienced horsewoman papa and i take very long rides together  as for eating with henrietta temple in the room ferdinand found that quite impossible the moment she appeared his appetite vanished anxious to speak yet deprived of his accustomed fluency he began to praise ducie  you must see it said miss temple shall we walk round the grounds  my dear henrietta said her father i dare say captain armine is at this moment sufficiently tired besides when he moves he will like perhaps to take his gun you forget he is a sportsman and that he cannot waste his morning in talking to ladies and picking flowers  indeed sir i assure you said ferdinand there is nothing i like so much as talking to ladies and picking flowers that is to say when the ladies have as fine taste as miss temple and the flowers are as beautiful as those at ducie  well you shall see my conservatory captain armine said miss temple and you shall go and kill partridges afterwards so saying she entered the conservatory and ferdinand followed her leaving mr temple to his pasty  these orange groves remind me of palmero said ferdinand  ah said miss temple i have never been in the sweet south  you seem to me a person born to live in a sicilian palace said ferdinand to wander in perfumed groves and to glance in a moonlight warmer than this sun  i see you pay compliments said miss temple looking at him archly and meeting a glance serious and soft  believe me not to you  what do you think of this flower said miss temple turning away rather quickly and pointing to a strange plant it is the most singular thing in the world but if it be tended by any other person than myself it withers is it not droll  i think not said ferdinand  i excuse you for your incredulity no one does believe it no one can and yet it is quite true our gardener gave it up in despair i wonder what it can be  i think it must be some enchanted prince said ferdinand  if i thought so how i should long for a wand to emancipate him said miss temple  i would break your wand if you had one said ferdinand  why said miss temple  oh i dont know said ferdinand i suppose because i believe you are sufficiently enchanting without one  i am bound to consider that most excellent logic said miss temple  do you admire my fountain and my birds she continued after a short pause after armine ducie appears a little tawdry toy  ducie is paradise said ferdinand i should like to pass my life in this conservatory  as an enchanted prince i suppose said miss temple  exactly said captain armine i would willingly this instant become a flower if i were sure that miss temple would cherish my existence  cut off your tendrils and drown you with a wateringpot said miss temple you really are very sicilian in your conversation captain armine  come said mr temple who now joined them if you really should like to take a stroll round the grounds i will order the keeper to meet us at the cottage  a very good proposition said miss temple  but you must get a bonnet henrietta i must forbid your going out uncovered  no papa this will do said miss temple taking a handkerchief twisting it round her head and tying it under her chin  you look like an old woman henrietta said her father smiling  i shall not say what you look like miss temple said captain armine with a glance of admiration lest you should think that i was this time even talking sicilian  i reward you for your forbearance with a rose said miss temple plucking a flower it is a return for your beautiful present of yesterday  ferdinand pressed the gift to his lips  they went forth they stepped into a paradise where the sweetest flowers seemed grouped in every combination of the choicest forms baskets and vases and beds of infinite fancy a thousand bees and butterflies filled the air with their glancing shapes and cheerful music and the birds from the neighbouring groves joined in the chorus of melody the wood walks through which they now rambled admitted at intervals glimpses of the ornate landscape and occasionally the view extended beyond the enclosed limits and exhibited the clustering and embowered roofs of the neighbouring village or some woody hill studded with a farmhouse or a distant spire as for ferdinand he strolled along full of beautiful thoughts and thrilling fancies in a dreamy state which had banished all recollection or consciousness but of the present he was happy positively perfectly supremely happy he was happy for the first time in his life he had no conception that life could afford such bliss as now filled his being what a chain of miserable tame factitious sensations seemed the whole course of his past existence even the joys of yesterday were nothing to these armine was associated with too much of the commonplace and the gloomy to realise the ideal in which he now revelled but now all circumstances contributed to enchant him the novelty the beauty of the scene harmoniously blended with his passion the sun seemed to him a more brilliant sun than the orb that illumined armine the sky more clear more pure more odorous there seemed a magic sympathy in the trees and every flower reminded him of his mistress and then he looked around and beheld her was he positively awake was he in england was he in the same globe in which he had hitherto moved and acted what was this entrancing form that moved before him was it indeed a woman       o dea cert√®  that voice too now wilder than the wildest bird now low and hushed yet always sweet where was he what did he listen to what did he behold what did he feel the presence of her father alone restrained him from falling on his knees and expressing to her his adoration  at length our friends arrived at a picturesque and ivygrown cottage where the keeper with their guns and dogs awaited mr temple and his guest ferdinand although a keen sportsman beheld the spectacle with dismay he execrated at the same time the existence of partridges and the invention of gunpowder to resist his fate however was impossible he took his gun and turned to bid his hostess adieu  i do not like to quit paradise at all he said in a low voice must i go  oh certainly said miss temple it will do you a great deal of good  never did anyone at first shoot more wildly in time however ferdinand sufficiently rallied to recover his reputation with the keeper who from his first observation began to wink his eye to his son an attendant bushbeater and occasionally even thrust his tongue inside his cheek a significant gesture perfectly understood by the imp for the life of me sam he afterwards profoundly observed i couldnt make out this here captain by no manner of means whatsomever at first i thought as how he was going to put the muzzle to his shoulder hang me if ever i see sich a gentleman he missed everything and at last if he didnt hit the longest flying shots without taking aim hang me if ever i see sich a gentleman he hit everything that ere captain puzzled me surely  the party at dinner was increased by a neighbouring squire and his wife and the rector of the parish ferdinand was placed at the right hand of miss temple the more he beheld her the more beautiful she seemed he detected every moment some charm before unobserved it seemed to him that he never was in such agreeable society though sooth to say the conversation was not of a very brilliant character mr temple recounted the sport of the morning to the squire whose ears kindled at a congenial subject and every preserve in the county was then discussed with some episodes on poaching the rector an old gentleman who had dined in old days at armine place reminded ferdinand of the agreeable circumstance sanguine perhaps that the invitation might lead to a renewal of his acquaintance with that hospitable board he was painfully profuse in his description of the public days of the famous sir ferdinand from the service of plate to the thirty servants in livery nothing was omitted  our friend deals in arabian tales whispered ferdinand to miss temple you can be a witness that we live quietly enough now  i shall certainly never forget my visit to armine replied miss temple it was one of the agreeable days of life  and that is saying a great deal for i think your life must have abounded in agreeable days  i cannot indeed lay any claim to that misery which makes many people interesting said miss temple i am a very commonplace person for i have been always happy  when the ladies withdrew there appeared but little inclination on the part of the squire and the rector to follow their example and captain armine therefore soon left mr temple to his fate and escaped to the drawingroom he glided to a seat on an ottoman by the side of his hostess and listened in silence to the conversation what a conversation at any other time under any other circumstances ferdinand would have been teased and wearied with its commonplace current all the dull detail of county tattle in which the squires lady was a proficient and with which miss temple was too highly bred not to appear to sympathise and yet the conversation to ferdinand appeared quite charming every accent of henriettas sounded like wit and when she bent her head in assent to her companions obvious deductions there was about each movement a grace so ineffable that ferdinand could have sat in silence and listened entranced for ever and occasionally too she turned to captain armine and appealed on some point to his knowledge or his taste it seemed to him that he had never listened to sounds so sweetly thrilling as her voice it was a birdlike burst of music that well became the sparkling sunshine of her violet eyes  his late companions entered ferdinand rose from his seat the windows of the salon were open he stepped forth into the garden he felt the necessity of being a moment alone he proceeded a few paces beyond the ken of man and then leaning on a statue and burying his face in his arm he gave way to irresistible emotion what wild thoughts dashed through his impetuous soul at that instant it is difficult to conjecture perhaps it was passion that inspired that convulsive reverie perchance it might have been remorse did he abandon himself to those novel sentiments which in a few brief hours had changed all his aspirations and coloured his whole existence or was he tortured by that dark and perplexing future from which his imagination in vain struggled to extricate him  he was roused from his reverie brief but tumultuous by the note of music and then by the sound of a human voice the stag detecting the huntsmans horn could not have started with more wild emotion but one fair organ could send forth that voice he approached he listened the voice of henrietta temple floated to him on the air breathing with a thousand odours in a moment he was at her side the squires lady was standing by her the gentlemen for a moment arrested from a political discussion formed a group in a distant part of the room the rector occasionally venturing in a practised whisper to enforce a disturbed argument ferdinand glided in unobserved by the fair performer miss temple not only possessed a voice of rare tone and compass but this delightful gift of nature had been cultivated with refined art ferdinand himself a musician and passionately devoted to vocal melody listened with unexaggerated rapture  oh beautiful exclaimed he as the songstress ceased  captain armine cried miss temple looking round with a wild bewitching smile i thought you were meditating in the twilight  your voice summoned me  you care for music  for little else  you sing  i hum  try this  with you  ferdinand armine was not unworthy of singing with henrietta temple his mother had been his able instructress in the art even in his childhood and his frequent residence at naples and other parts of the south had afforded him ample opportunities of perfecting a talent thus early cultivated but tonight the love of something beyond his art inspired the voice of ferdinand singing with henrietta temple he poured forth to her in safety all the passion which raged in his soul the squires lady looked confused henrietta herself grew pale the politicians ceased even to whisper and advanced from their corner to the instrument and when the duet was terminated mr temple offered his sincere congratulations to his guest henrietta also turned with some words of commendation to ferdinand but the words were faint and confused and finally requesting captain armine to favour them by singing alone she rose and vacated her seat  ferdinand took up the guitar and accompanied himself to a neapolitan air it was gay and festive a ritornella which might summon your mistress to dance in the moonlight and then amid many congratulations he offered the guitar to miss temple  no one will listen to a simple melody after anything so brilliant said miss temple as she touched a string and after a slight prelude sang these words       the  deserted       i       yes weeping is madness      away with this tear      let no sign of sadness      betray the wild anguish i fear      when we meet him tonight      be mute then my heart      and my smile be as bright      as if we were never to part       ii       girl give me the mirror      that said  i was fair      alas fatal error      this picture reveals my despair      smiles no longer can pass      oer this faded brow      and i shiver this glass      like his love and his fragile vow   the music said ferdinand full of enthusiasm is  henriettas replied her father  and the words  were found in my canarys cage said henrietta temple rising and putting an end to the conversation     chapter vii       in which captain armine  indulges in a reverie  the squires carriage was announced and then came his ladys shawl how happy was ferdinand when he recollected that he was to remain at ducie remain at ducie  remain under the same roof as henrietta temple what bliss what ravishing bliss all his life and his had not been a monotonous one it seemed that all his life could not afford a situation so adventurous and so sweet as this now they have gone the squire and his lady and the worthy rector who recollected armine so well they have all departed all the adieus are uttered after this little and unavoidable bustle silence reigns in the salon of ducie ferdinand walked to the window the moon was up the air was sweet and hushed the landscape clear though soft oh what would he not have given to have strolled in that garden with henrietta temple to have poured forth his whole soul to her to have told her how wondrous fair she was how wildly bewitching and how he loved her how he sighed to bind his fate with hers and live for ever in the brilliant atmosphere of her grace and beauty  good night captain armine said henrietta temple  he turned hastily round he blushed he grew pale there she stood in one hand a light the other extended to her fathers guest he pressed her hand he sighed he looked confused then suddenly letting go her hand he walked quickly towards the door of the salon which he opened that she might retire  the happiest day of my life has ended he muttered  you are so easily content then that i think you must always be happy  i fear i am not so easily content as you imagine  she has gone hours many and long hours must elapse before he sees her again before he again listens to that music watches that airy grace and meets the bright flashing of that fascinating eye what misery was there in this idea how little had he seemed hitherto to prize the joy of being her companion he cursed the hours which had been wasted away from her in the mornings sport he blamed himself that he had not even sooner quitted the diningroom or that he had left the salon for a moment to commune with his own thoughts in the garden with difficulty he restrained himself from reopening the door to listen for the distant sound of her footsteps or catch perhaps along some corridor the fading echo of her voice but ferdinand was not alone mr temple still remained that gentleman raised his face from the newspaper as captain armine advanced to him and after some observations about the days sport and a hope that he would repeat his trial of the manor tomorrow proposed their retirement ferdinand of course assented and in a moment he was ascending with his host the noble and italian staircase and he then was ushered from the vestibule into his room  his previous visit to the chamber had been so hurried that he had only made a general observation on its appearance little inclined to slumber he now examined it more critically in a recess was a french bed of simple furniture on the walls which were covered with a rustic paper were suspended several drawings representing views in the saxon switzerland they were so bold and spirited that they arrested attention but the quick eye of ferdinand instantly detected the initials of the artist in the corner they were letters that made his heart tremble as he gazed with admiring fondness on her performances before a sofa covered with a chintz of a corresponding pattern with the paper of the walls was placed a small french table on which were writing materials and his toilettable and his mantelpiece were profusely ornamented with rare flowers on all sides were symptoms of female taste and feminine consideration  ferdinand carefully withdrew from his coat the flower that henrietta had given him in the morning and which he had worn the whole day he kissed it he kissed it more than once he pressed its somewhat faded form to his lips with cautious delicacy then tending it with the utmost care he placed it in a vase of water which holding in his hand he threw himself into an easy chair with his eyes fixed on the gift he most valued in the world  an hour passed and ferdinand armine remained fixed in the same position but no one who beheld that beautiful and pensive countenance and the dreamy softness of that large grey eye could for a moment conceive that his thoughts were less sweet than the object on which they appeared to gaze no distant recollections disturbed him now no memory of the past no fear of the future the delicious present monopolised his existence the ties of duty the claims of domestic affection the worldly considerations that by a cruel dispensation had seemed as it were to taint even his innocent and careless boyhood even the urgent appeals of his critical and perilous situation all all were forgotten in one intense delirium of absorbing love  anon he rose from his seat and paced his room for some minutes with his eyes fixed on the ground then throwing off his clothes and taking the flower from the vase which he had previously placed on the table he deposited it in his bosom beautiful beloved flower exclaimed he thus thus will i win and wear your mistress     chapter viii       a strange dream  restless are the dreams of the lover that is young ferdinand armine started awake from the agony of a terrible slumber he had been walking in a garden with henrietta temple her hand was clasped in his her eyes fixed on the ground as he whispered delicious words his face was flushed his speech panting and low gently he wound his vacant arm round her graceful form she looked up her speaking eyes met his and their trembling lips seemed about to cling into a  when lo the splendour of the garden faded and all seemed changed and dim instead of the beautiful arched walks in which a moment before they appeared to wander it was beneath the vaulted roof of some temple that they now moved instead of the bed of glowing flowers from which he was about to pluck an offering for her bosom an altar rose from the centre of which upsprang a quick and lurid tongue of fire the dreamer gazed upon his companion and her form was tinted with the dusky hue of the flame and she held to her countenance a scarf as if pressed by the unnatural heat great fear suddenly came over him with haste yet with tenderness he himself withdrew the scarf from the face of his companion and this movement revealed the visage of miss grandison  ferdinand armine awoke and started up in his bed before him still appeared the unexpected figure he jumped out of bed he gazed upon the form with staring eyes and open mouth she was there assuredly she was there it was katherine katherine his betrothed sad and reproachful the figure faded before him he advanced with outstretched hand in his desperation he determined to clutch the escaping form and he found in his grasp his dressinggown which he had thrown over the back of a chair  a dream and but a dream after all he muttered to himself and yet a strange one  his brow was heated he opened the casement it was still night the moon had vanished but the stars were still shining he recalled with an effort the scene with which he had become acquainted yesterday for the first time before him serene and still rose the bowers of ducie and their mistress that angelic form whose hand he had clasped in his dream was not then merely a shadow she breathed she lived and under the same roof henrietta temple was at this moment under the same roof as himself and what were her slumbers were they wild as his own or sweet and innocent as herself did his form flit over her closed vision at this charmed hour as hers had visited his had it been scared away by an apparition as awful bore anyone to her the same relation as katherine grandison to him a fearful surmise that had occurred to him now for the first time and which it seemed could never again quit his brain the stars faded away the breath of morn was abroad the chant of birds arose exhausted in body and in mind ferdinand armine flung himself upon his bed and soon was lost in slumbers undisturbed as the tomb     chapter ix       which i hope may prove as agreeable to the reader as to our      hero  ferdinands servant whom he had despatched the previous evening to armine returned early with his masters letters one from his mother and one from miss grandison  they were all to arrive at the place on the day after the morrow ferdinand opened these epistles with a trembling hand the sight of katherines his katherines handwriting was almost as terrible as his dream it recalled to him with a dreadful reality his actual situation which he had driven from his thoughts he had quitted his family his family who were so devoted to him and whom he so loved happy nay triumphant a pledged and rejoicing bridegroom what had occurred during the last eightandforty hours seemed completely to have changed all his feelings all his wishes all his views all his hopes he had in that interval met a single human being a woman a girl a young and innocent girl he had looked upon that girl and listened to her voice and his soul was changed as the earth by the sunrise as lying in his bed he read these letters and mused over their contents and all the thoughts that they suggested the strangeness of life the mystery of human nature were painfully impressed upon him his melancholy father his fond and confiding mother the devoted glastonbury all the mortifying circumstances of his illustrious race rose in painful succession before him nor could he forget his own wretched follies and that fatal visit to bath of which the consequences clanked upon his memory like degrading and disgraceful fetters the burden of existence seemed intolerable that domestic love which had so solaced his existence recalled now only the most painful associations in the wildness of his thoughts he wished himself alone in the world to struggle with his fate and mould his fortunes he felt himself a slave and a sacrifice he cursed armine his ancient house and his broken fortunes he felt that death was preferable to life without henrietta temple but even supposing that he could extricate himself from his rash engagement even admitting that all worldly considerations might be thrown aside and the pride of his father and his mothers love and glastonburys pure hopes might all be outraged what chance what hope was there of obtaining his great object what was he what was he ferdinand armine free as the air from the claims of miss grandison with all sense of duty rooted out of his once sensitive bosom and existing only for the gratification of his own wild fancies a beggar worse than a beggar without a home without the possibility of a home to offer the lady of his passion nay not even secure that the harsh process of the law might not instantly claim its victim and he himself be hurried from the altar to the gaol  moody and melancholy he repaired to the salon he beheld henrietta temple and the cloud left his brow and lightness came to his heart never had she looked so beautiful so fresh and bright so like a fair flower with the dew upon its leaves her voice penetrated his soul her sunny smile warmed his breast her father greeted him too with kindness and inquired after his slumbers which he assured mr temple had been satisfactory  i find continued mr temple that the post has brought me some business today which i fear claims the morning to transact but i hope you will not forget your promise the keeper will be ready whenever you summon him  ferdinand muttered something about trouble and intrusion and the expected arrival of his family but miss temple begged him to accept the offer and refusal was impossible  after breakfast mr temple retired to his library and ferdinand found himself alone for the first time with henrietta temple  she was copying a miniature of charles the first ferdinand looked over her shoulder  a melancholy countenance he observed  it is a favourite one of mine she replied  yet you are always gay  always  i envy you miss temple  what are you melancholy  i have every cause  indeed i should have thought the reverse  i look upon myself as the most unfortunate of human beings replied ferdinand  he spoke so seriously in a tone of such deep and bitter feeling that miss temple could not resist looking up at her companion his countenance was gloomy  you surprise me said miss temple i think that few people ought to be unhappy and i rather suspect fewer are than we imagine  all i wish is replied he that the battle of newbury had witnessed the extinction of our family as well as our peerage  a peerage and such a peerage as yours is a fine thing said henrietta temple a very fine thing but i would not grieve if i were you for that i would sooner be an armine without a coronet than many a brow i wot of with  you misconceived a silly phrase rejoined ferdinand i was not thinking of the loss of our coronet though that is only part of the system our family i am sure are fated birth without honour estates without fortune life without happiness that is our lot  as for the first said miss temple the honourable are always honoured money in spite of what they say i feel is not the greatest thing in the world and as for misery i confess i do not very readily believe in the misery of youth  may you never prove it replied ferdinand may you never be as i am the victim of family profligacy and family pride so saying he turned away and taking up a book for a few minutes seemed wrapped in his reflections  he suddenly resumed the conversation in a more cheerful tone holding a volume of petrarch in his hand he touched lightly but with grace on italian poetry then diverged into his travels recounted an adventure with sprightliness and replied to miss temples lively remarks with gaiety and readiness the morning advanced miss temple closed her portfolio and visited her flowers inviting him to follow her her invitation was scarcely necessary his movements were regulated by hers he was as faithful to her as her shadow from the conservatory they entered the garden ferdinand was as fond of gardens as miss temple she praised the flowergarden of armine he gave her some account of its principal creator the character of glastonbury highly interested miss temple love is confidential it has no fear of ridicule ferdinand entered with freedom and yet with grace into family details from which at another time and to another person he would have been the first to shrink the imagination of miss temple was greatly interested by his simple and to her affecting account of this ancient line living in their hereditary solitude with all their noble pride and haughty poverty the scene the circumstances were all such as please a maidens fancy and he the natural hero of this singular history seemed deficient in none of those heroic qualities which the wildest spirit of romance might require for the completion of its spell beautiful as his ancestors and she was sure as brave young spirited graceful and accomplished a gay and daring spirit blended with the mournful melody of his voice and occasionally contrasted with the somewhat subdued and chastened character of his demeanour  well do not despair said henrietta temple riches did not make sir ferdinand happy i feel confident the house will yet flourish  i have no confidence replied ferdinand i feel the struggle with our fate to be fruitless once indeed i felt like you there was a time when i took even a fancied pride in all the follies of my grandfather but that is past i have lived to execrate his memory  hush hush  yes to execrate his memory i repeat to execrate his memory his follies stand between me and my happiness  indeed i see not that  may you never i cannot disguise from myself that i am a slave and a wretched one and that his career has entailed this curse of servitude upon me but away with this you must think me miss temple the most egotistical of human beings and yet to do myself justice i never remember having spoken of myself so much before  will you walk with me said miss temple after a moments silence you seem little inclined to avail yourself of my fathers invitation to solitary sport but i cannot stay at home for i have visits to pay although i fear you will consider them rather dull ones why so  my visits are to cottages  i love nothing better i used ever to be my mothers companion on such occasions  so crossing the lawn they entered a beautiful wood of considerable extent which formed the boundary of the grounds and after some time passed in agreeable conversation emerged upon a common of no ordinary extent or beauty for it was thickly studded in some parts with lofty timber while in others the furze and fern gave richness and variety to the vast wilderness of verdant turf scarcely marked except by the light hoof of miss temples palfrey  it is not so grand as armine park said miss temple but we are proud of our common  the thin grey smoke that rose in different directions was a beacon to the charitable visits of miss temple it was evident that she was a visitor both habitual and beloved each cottagedoor was familiar to her entrance the children smiled at her approach their mothers rose and courtesied with affectionate respect how many names and how many wants had she to remember yet nothing was forgotten some were rewarded for industry some were admonished not to be idle but all were treated with an engaging suavity more efficacious than gifts or punishments the aged were solaced by her visit the sick forgot their pains and as she listened with sympathising patience to long narratives of rheumatic griefs it seemed her presence in each old chair her tender enquiries and sanguine hopes brought even more comfort than her plenteous promises of succour from the bower in the shape of arrowroot and gruel port wine and flannel petticoats  this scene of sweet simplicity brought back old days and old places to the memory of ferdinand armine he thought of the time when he was a happy boy at his innocent home his mothers boy the child she so loved and looked after when a cloud upon her brow brought a tear into his eye and when a kiss from her lips was his most dear and desired reward the last night he had passed at armine before his first departure rose up to his recollection all his mothers passionate fondness all her wild fear that the day might come when her child would not love her so dearly as he did then that time had come but a few hours back ay but a few hours back and he had sighed to be alone in the world and had felt those domestic ties which had been the joy of his existence a burthen and a curse a tear stole down his cheek he stepped forth from the cottage to conceal his emotion he seated himself on the trunk of a tree a few paces withdrawn he looked upon the declining sun that gilded the distant landscape with its rich yet pensive light the scenes of the last five years flitted across his minds eye in fleet succession his dissipation his vanity his desperate folly his hollow worldliness why oh why had he ever left his unpolluted home why could he not have lived and died in that sylvan paradise why oh why was it impossible to admit his beautiful companion into that sweet and serene society why should his love for her make his heart a rebel to his hearth money horrible money it seemed to him that the contiguous cottage and the labour of his hands with her were preferable to palaces and crowds of retainers without her inspiring presence and why not screw his courage to the stickingpoint and commune in confidence with his parents they loved him yes they idolised him for him for him alone they sought the restoration of their house and fortunes why henrietta temple was a treasure richer than any his ancestors had counted let them look on her let them listen to her let them breathe as he had done in her enchantment and could they wonder could they murmur at his conduct would they not oh would they not rather admire extol it but then his debts his overwhelming debts all the rest might be faced his desperate engagement might be broken his family might be reconciled to obscurity and poverty but ruin what was to grapple with his impending ruin now his folly stung him now the scorpion entered his soul it was not the profligacy of his ancestor it was not the pride of his family then that stood between him and his love it was his own culpable and heartless career he covered his face with his hands something touched him lightly it was the parasol of miss temple  i am afraid she said that my visits have wearied you but you have been very kind and good  he rose rapidly with a slight blush indeed he replied i have passed a most delightful morning and i was only regretting that life consisted of anything else but cottages and yourself  they were late they heard the first dinnerbell at ducie as they reentered the wood we must hurry on said miss temple dinner is the only subject on which papa is a tyrant what a sunset i wonder if lady armine will return on saturday when she returns i hope you will make her call upon us for i want to copy the pictures in your gallery  if they were not heirlooms i would give them you said ferdinand but as it is there is only one way by which i can manage it  what way enquired miss temple very innocently  i forget replied ferdinand with a peculiar smile miss temple looked a little confused     chapter x       evening stroll  in spite of his perilous situation an indefinable sensation of happiness pervaded the soul of ferdinand armine as he made his hurried toilet and hastened to the domestic board of ducie where he was now the solitary guest his eye caught miss temples as he entered the room it seemed to beam upon him with interest and kindness his courteous and agreeable host welcomed him with polished warmth it seemed that a feeling of intimacy was already established among them and he fancied himself already looked upon as an habitual member of their circle all dark thoughts were driven away he was gay and pleasant and duly maintained with mr temple that conversation in which his host excelled miss temple spoke little but listened with evident interest to her father and ferdinand she seemed to delight in their society and to be gratified by captain armines evident sense of her fathers agreeable qualities when dinner was over they all rose together and repaired to the salon  i wish mr glastonbury were here said miss temple as ferdinand opened the instrument you must bring him some day and then our concert will be perfect  ferdinand smiled but the name of glastonbury made him shudder his countenance changed at the future plans of miss temple some day indeed when he might also take the opportunity of introducing his betrothed but the voice of henrietta temple drove all care from his bosom he abandoned himself to the intoxicating present she sang alone and then they sang together and as he arranged her books or selected her theme a thousand instances of the interest with which she inspired him developed themselves once he touched her hand and he pressed his own unseen to his lips  though the room was lit up the windows were open and admitted the moonlight the beautiful salon was full of fragrance and of melody the fairest of women dazzled ferdinand with her presence his heart was full his senses ravished his hopes were high could there be such a demon as care in such a paradise could sorrow ever enter here was it possible that these bright halls and odorous bowers could be polluted by the miserable considerations that reigned too often supreme in his unhappy breast an enchanted scene had suddenly risen from the earth for his delight and fascination could he be unhappy why if all went darker even than he sometimes feared that man had not lived in vain who had beheld henrietta temple all the troubles of the world were folly here this was fairyland and he some knight who had fallen from a gloomy globe upon some starry region flashing with perennial lustre  the hours flew on the servants brought in that light banquet whose entrance in the country seems the only method of reminding our guests that there is a morrow  illustration frontispage146jpg  tis the last night said ferdinand smiling with a sigh one more song only one more mr temple be indulgent it is the last night i feel he added in a lower tone to henrietta i feel exactly as i did when i left armine for the first time  because you are going to return to it that is wilful  wilful or not i would that i might never see it again  for my part armine is to me the very land of romance  it is strange  no spot on earth ever impressed me more it is the finest combination of art and nature and poetical associations i know it is indeed unique  i do not like to differ with you on any subject  we should be dull companions i fear if we agreed upon everything  i cannot think it  papa said miss temple one little stroll upon the lawn one little little stroll the moon is so bright and autumn this year has brought us as yet no dew and as she spoke she took up her scarf and wound it round her head there she said i look like the portrait of the turkish page in armine gallery  there was a playful grace about henrietta temple a wild and brilliant simplicity which was the more charming because it was blended with peculiarly high breeding no person in ordinary society was more calm or enjoyed a more complete selfpossession yet no one in the more intimate relations of life indulged more in those little unstudied bursts of nature which seemed almost to remind one of the playful child rather than the polished woman and which under such circumstances are infinitely captivating as for ferdinand armine he looked upon the turkish page with a countenance beaming with admiration he wished it was turkey wherein he then beheld her or any other strange land where he could have placed her on his courser and galloped away in pursuit of a fortune wild as his soul  though the year was in decay summer had lent this night to autumn it was so soft and sweet the moonbeam fell brightly upon ducie bower and the illumined salon contrasted effectively with the natural splendour of the exterior scene mr temple reminded henrietta of a brilliant f√™te which had been given at a saxon palace and which some circumstances of similarity recalled to his recollection ferdinand could not speak but found himself unconsciously pressing henrietta temples arm to his heart the saxon palace brought back to miss temple a wild melody which had been sung in the gardens on that night she asked her father if he recollected it and hummed the air as she made the enquiry her gentle murmur soon expanded into song it was one of those wild and natural lyrics that spring up in mountainous countries and which seem to mimic the prolonged echoes that in such regions greet the ear of the pastor and the huntsman  oh why did this night ever have an end     chapter xi       a morning walk  it was solitude that brought despair to ferdinand armine the moment he was alone his real situation thrust itself upon him the moment he had quitted the presence of henrietta temple he was as a man under the influence of music when the orchestra suddenly stops the source of all his inspiration failed him this last night at ducie was dreadful sleep was out of the question he did not affect even the mimicry of retiring but paced up and down his room the whole night or flung himself when exhausted upon a restless sofa occasionally he varied these monotonous occupations by pressing his lips to the drawings which bore her name then relapsing into a profound reverie he sought some solace in recalling the scenes of the morning all her movements every word she had uttered every look which had illumined his soul in vain he endeavoured to find consolation in the fond belief that he was not altogether without interest in her eyes even the conviction that his passion was returned in the situation in which he was plunged would however flattering be rather a source of fresh anxiety and perplexity he took a volume from the single shelf of books that was slung against the wall it was a volume of corinne the fervid eloquence of the poetess sublimated his passion and without disturbing the tone of his excited mind relieved in some degree its tension by busying his imagination with other though similar emotions as he read his mind became more calm and his feelings deeper and by the time his lamp grew ghastly in the purple light of morning that now entered his chamber his soul seemed so stilled that he closed the volume and though sleep was impossible he remained nevertheless calm and absorbed  when the first sounds assured him that some were stirring in the house he quitted his room and after some difficulty found a maidservant by whose aid he succeeded in getting into the garden he took his way to the common where he had observed the preceding day a fine sheet of water the sun had not risen more than an hour it was a fresh and ruddy morn the cottagers were just abroad the air of the plain invigorated him and the singing of the birds and all those rural sounds that rise with the husbandman brought to his mind a wonderful degree of freshness and serenity occasionally he heard the gun of an early sportsman to him at all times an animating sound but when he had plunged into the water and found himself struggling with that inspiring element all sorrow seemed to leave him his heated brow became cool and clear his aching limbs vigorous and elastic his jaded soul full of hope and joy he lingered in the liquid and vivifying world playing with the stream for he was an expert and practised swimmer and often after nights of southern dissipation had recurred to this natural bath for health and renovation  the sun had now risen far above the horizon the village clock had long struck seven ferdinand was three miles from ducie bower it was time to return yet he loitered on his way the air was so sweet and fresh the scene so pretty and his mind in comparison with his recent feelings so calm and even happy just as he emerged from the woods and entered the grounds of ducie he met miss temple she stared and she had cause ferdinand indeed presented rather an unusual figure his head uncovered his hair matted and his countenance glowing with his exercise but his figure clothed with the identical evening dress in which he had bid her a tender good night  captain armine exclaimed miss temple you are an early riser i see  ferdinand looked a little confused the truth is he replied i have not risen at all i could not sleep why i know not the evening i suppose was too happy for so commonplace a termination so i escaped from my room as soon as i could do so without disturbing your household and i have been bathing which refreshes me always more than slumber  well i could not resign my sleep were it only for the sake of my dreams  pleasant i trust they were rosy dreams and slumbers light are for ladies as fair as you  i am grateful that i always fulfil the poets wish and what is more i wake only to gather roses see here  she extended to him a flower  i deserve it said ferdinand for i have not neglected your first gift and he offered her the rose she had given him the first day of his visit tis shrivelled he added but still very sweet at least to me  it is mine now said henrietta temple  ah you will throw it away  do you think me then so insensible  it cannot be to you what it is to me replied ferdinand  it is a memorial said miss temple  of what and of whom enquired ferdinand  of friendship and a friend  tis something to be miss temples friend  i am glad you think so i believe i am very vain but certainly i like to beliked  then you can always gain your wish without an effort  now i think we are very good friends said miss temple considering we have known each other so short a time but then papa likes you so much  i am honoured as well as gratified by the kindly dispositions of so agreeable a person as mr temple i can assure his daughter that the feeling is mutual your fathers opinion influences you  in everything he has been so kind a father that it would be worse than ingratitude to be less than devoted to him  mr temple is a very enviable person  but captain armine knows the delight of a parent who loves him i love my father as you love your mother  i have however lived to feel that no persons opinion could influence me in everything i have lived to find that even filial love and god knows mine was powerful enough is after all but a pallid moonlight beam compared with  see my father kisses his hand to us from the window let us run and meet him     chapter xii       containing an ominous incident  the last adieus are bidden ferdinand is on his road to armine flying from the woman whom he adores to meet the woman to whom he is betrothed he reined in his horse as he entered the park as he slowly approached his home he could not avoid feeling that after so long an absence he had not treated glastonbury with the kindness and consideration he merited while he was torturing his invention for an excuse for his conduct he observed his old tutor in the distance and riding up and dismounting he joined that faithful friend whether it be that love and falsehood are under any circumstances inseparable ferdinand armine whose frankness was proverbial found himself involved in a long and confused narrative of a visit to a friend whom he had unexpectedly met whom he had known abroad and to whom he was under the greatest obligations he even affected to regret this temporary estrangement from armine after so long a separation and to rejoice at his escape no names were mentioned and the unsuspicious glastonbury delighted again to be his companion inconvenienced him with no crossexamination but this was only the commencement of the system of degrading deception which awaited him  willingly would ferdinand have devoted all his time and feelings to his companion but in vain he struggled with the absorbing passion of his soul he dwelt in silence upon the memory of the last three days the most eventful period of his existence he was moody and absent silent when he should have spoken wandering when he should have listened hazarding random observations instead of conversing or breaking into hurried and inappropriate comments so that to any worldly critic of his conduct he would have appeared at the same time both dull and excited at length he made a desperate effort to accompany glastonbury to the picture gallery and listen to his plans the scene indeed was not ungrateful to him for it was associated with the existence and the conversation of the lady of his heart he stood entranced before the picture of the turkish page and lamented to glastonbury a thousand times that there was no portrait of henrietta armine  i would sooner have a portrait of henrietta armine than the whole gallery together said ferdinand  glastonbury stared  i wonder if there ever will be a portrait of henrietta armine come now my dear glastonbury he continued with an air of remarkable excitement let us have a wager upon it what are the odds will there ever be a portrait of henrietta armine i am quite fantastic today you are smiling at me now do you know if i had a wish certain to be gratified it should be to add a portrait of henrietta armine to our gallery  she died very young remarked glastonbury  but my henrietta armine should not die young said ferdinand she should live breathe smile she  glastonbury looked very confused  so strange is love that this kind of veiled allusion to his secret passion relieved and gratified the overcharged bosom of ferdinand he pursued the subject with enjoyment anybody but glastonbury might have thought that he had lost his senses he laughed so loud and talked so fast about a subject which seemed almost nonsensical but the good glastonbury ascribed these ebullitions to the wanton spirit of youth and smiled out of sympathy though he knew not why except that his pupil appeared happy  at length they quitted the gallery glastonbury resumed his labours in the hall where he was copying an escutcheon and after hovering a short time restlessly around his tutor now escaping into the garden that he might muse over henrietta temple undisturbed and now returning for a few minutes to his companion lest the good glastonbury should feel mortified by his neglect ferdinand broke away altogether and wandered far into the pleasaunce  he came to the green and shady spot where he had first beheld her there rose the cedar spreading its dark form in solitary grandeur and holding as it were its state among its subject woods it was the same scene almost the same hour but where was she he waited for her form to rise and yet it came not he shouted henrietta temple yet no fair vision blessed his expectant sight was it all a dream had he been but lying beneath these branches in a rapturous trance and had he only woke to the shivering dulness of reality what evidence was there of the existence of such a being as henrietta temple if such a being did not exist of what value was life after a glimpse of paradise could he breathe again in this tame and frigid world where was ducie where were its immortal bowers those roses of supernatural fragrance and the celestial melody of its halls that garden wherein he wandered and hung upon her accents that wood among whose shadowy boughs she glided like an antelope that pensive twilight on which he had gazed with such subdued emotion that moonlight walk when her voice floated like ariels in the purple sky were these all phantoms could it be that this morn this very morn he had beheld henrietta temple had conversed with her alone had bidden her a soft adieu what was it this day that she had given him this rose  he threw himself upon the turf and gazed upon the flower the flower was young and beautiful as herself and just expanding into perfect life to the fantastic brain of love there seemed a resemblance between this rose and her who had culled it its stem was tall its countenance was brilliant an aromatic essence pervaded its being as he held it in his hand a bee came hovering round its charms eager to revel in its fragrant loveliness more than once had ferdinand driven the bee away when suddenly it succeeded in alighting on the rose jealous of his rose ferdinand in his haste shook the flower and the fragile head fell from the stem  a feeling of deep melancholy came over him with which he found it in vain to struggle and which he could not analyse he rose and pressing the flower to his heart he walked away and rejoined glastonbury whose task was nearly accomplished ferdinand seated himself upon one of the high cases which had been stowed away in the hall folding his arms swinging his legs and whistling the german air which miss temple had sung the preceding night  that is a wild and pretty air said glastonbury who was devoted to music i never heard it before you travellers pick up choice things where did you find it  i am sure i cannot tell my dear glastonbury i have been asking myself the same question the whole morning sometimes i think i dreamt it  a few more such dreams would make you a rare composer said glastonbury smiling  ah my dear glastonbury talking of music i know a musician such a musician a musician whom i should like to introduce you to above all persons in the world  you always loved music dear ferdinand tis in the blood you come from a musical stock on your mothers side is miss grandison musical  yes no that is to say i forget some commonplace accomplishment in the art she has i believe but i was not thinking of that sort of thing i was thinking of the lady who taught me this air  a lady said glastonbury the german ladies are highly cultivated  yes the germans and the women especially have a remarkably fine musical taste rejoined ferdinand recovering from his blunder  i like the germans very much said glastonbury and i admire that air  o my dear glastonbury you should hear it sung by moonlight  indeed said glastonbury  yes if you could only hear her sing it by moonlight i venture to say my dear glastonbury that you would confess that all you had ever heard or seen or imagined of enchanted spirits floating in the air and filling the atmosphere with supernatural symphonies was realised  indeed said glastonbury a most accomplished performer no doubt was she professional who inquired ferdinand your songstress  professional oh ah yes no she was not a professional singer but she was fit to be one and that is an excellent idea too for i would sooner after all be a professional singer and live by my art than marry against my inclination or not marry according to it  marry said glastonbury rather astonished what is she going to be married against her will poor devoted thing  devoted indeed said ferdinand there is no greater curse on earth  glastonbury shook his head  the affections should not be forced the old man added our feelings are our own property often our best  ferdinand fell into a fit of abstraction then suddenly turning round he said is it possible that i have been away from armine only two days do you know it really seems to me a year  you are very kind to say so my ferdinand said glastonbury     chapter xiii       in which captain armine finds reason to believe in the      existence of fairies  it is difficult to describe the restlessness of ferdinand armine his solitary dinner was an excuse for quitting glastonbury but to eat is as impossible as to sleep for a man who is really in love he took a spoonful of soup and then jumping up from his chair he walked up and down the room thinking of henrietta temple then tomorrow occurred to him and that other lady that tomorrow was to bring he drowned the thought in a bumper of claret wine mighty wine thou best and surest consolation what care can withstand thy inspiring influence from what scrape canst thou not for the moment extricate the victim who can deny that our spiritual nature in some degree depends upon our corporeal condition a man without breakfast is not a hero a hero well fed is full of audacious invention everything depends upon the circulation let but the blood flow freely and a man of imagination is never without resources a fine pulse is a talisman a charmed life a balance at our bankers it is good luck it is eternity it is wealth nothing can withstand us nothing injure us it is inexhaustible riches so felt ferdinand armine though on the verge of a moral precipice tomorrow what of tomorrow did tomorrow daunt him not a jot he would wrestle with tomorrow laden as it might be with curses and dash it to the earth it should not be a day he would blot it out of the calendar of time he would effect a moral eclipse of its influence he loved henrietta temple she should be his who could prevent him was he not an armine was he not the near descendant of that bold man who passed his whole life in the voluptuous indulgence of his unrestrained volition bravo he willed it and it should be done everything yields to determination what a fool what a miserable craven fool had he been to have frightened himself with the flimsy shadows of petty worldly cares he was born to follow his own pleasure it was supreme it was absolute he was a despot he set everything and everybody at defiance and filling a huge tumbler to the health of the great sir ferdinand he retired glorious as an emperor  on the whole ferdinand had not committed so great an indiscretion as the reader of course shocked might at first imagine for the first time for some days he slept and slept soundly next to wine a renovating slumber perhaps puts us in the best humour with our destiny ferdinand awoke refreshed and sanguine full of inventive life which soon developed itself in a flow of improbable conclusions his most rational scheme however appeared to consist in winning henrietta temple and turning pirate or engaging in the service of some distant and disturbed state why might he not free greece or revolutionize spain or conquer the brazils others had embarked in these bold enterprises men not more desperate than himself and not better qualified for the career young courageous a warrior by profession with a name of traditionary glory throughout the courts of christendom perhaps even remembered in asia he seemed just the individual to carve out a glorious heritage with his sword and as for his parents they were not in the vale of years let them dream on in easy obscurity and maintain themselves at armine until he returned to redeem his hereditary domain all that was requisite was the concurrence of his adored mistress perhaps after all his foolish fears and all his petty anxiety he might live to replace upon her brow the ancient coronet of tewkesbury why not the world is strange nothing happens that we anticipate when apparently stifled by the commonplace we are on the brink of stepping into the adventurous if he married miss grandison his career was closed a most unnatural conclusion for one so young and bold it was evident that he must marry henrietta temple and then why then something would happen totally unexpected and unforeseen who could doubt it not he  he rose he mounted his horse and galloped over to ducie common its very aspect melted his heart he called at the cottages he had visited two days before without enquiring after miss temple he contrived to hear a thousand circumstances relating to her which interested and charmed him in the distance rose the woods of ducie he gazed upon them as if he could never withdraw his sight from their deep and silent forms oh that sweet bower why was there any other world but ducie all his brave projects of war and conquest and imperial plunder seemed dull and vain now he sickened at the thought of action he sighed to gather roses to listen to songs sweeter than the nightingale and wander for ever in moonlit groves  he turned his horses head slowly and sorrowfully he directed his course to armine had they arrived the stern presence of reality was too much for all his slight and glittering visions what was he after all this future conqueror was a young officer on leave obscure except in his immediate circle with no inheritance and very much in debt awaited with anxiety by his affectionate parents and a young lady whom he was about to marry for her fortune most impotent epilogue to a magnificent reverie  the post arrived at armine in the afternoon as ferdinand nervous as a child returning to school tardily regained home he recognised the approaching postman hah a letter what was its import the blessing of delay or was it the herald of their instant arrival pale and sick at heart he tore open the hurried lines of katherine the maiden aunt had stumbled while getting out of a pony phaeton and experienced a serious accident their visit to armine was necessarily postponed he read no more the colour returned to his cheek reinforced by his hearts liveliest blood a thousand thoughts a thousand wild hopes and wilder plans came over him here was at least one interposition in his favour others would occur he felt fortunate he rushed to the tower to tell the news to glastonbury his tutor ascribed his agitation to the shock and attempted to console him in communicating the intelligence he was obliged to finish the letter it expressed a hope that if their visit were postponed for more than a day or two katherines dearest ferdinand would return to bath  ferdinand wandered forth into the park to enjoy his freedom a burden had suddenly fallen from his frame a cloud that had haunted his vision had vanished today that was so accursed was to be marked now in his calendar with red chalk even armine pleased him its sky was brighter its woods more vast and green they had not arrived they would not arrive tomorrow that was certain the third day too was a day of hope why three days three whole days of unexpected unhopedfor freedom it was eternity what might not happen in three days for three days he might fairly remain in expectation of fresh letters it could not be anticipated it was not even desired that he should instantly repair to them come he would forget this curse he would be happy the past the future should be nothing he would revel in the auspicious present  thus communing with himself he sauntered along musing over henrietta temple and building bright castles in the air a man engaged with his ideas is insensible of fatigue ferdinand found himself at the park gate that led to ducie intending only a slight stroll he had already rambled half way to his beloved it was a delicious afternoon the heat of the sun had long abated the air was sweet and just beginning to stir not a sound was heard except the last blow of the woodmans axe or the occasional note of some joyous bird waking from its siesta ferdinand passed the gate he entered the winding road the road that henrietta temple had so admired a beautiful green lane with banks of flowers and hedges of tall trees he strolled along our happy ferdinand indefinite of purpose almost insensible whether he were advancing or returning home he plucked the wild flowers and pressed them to his lips because she had admired them rested on a bank lounged on a gate cut a stick from the hedge traced henrietta temple in the road and then turned the words into henrietta armine and soand soand so he at length stared at finding himself on ducie common  beautiful common how he loved it how familiar every tree and rustic roof had become to him could he ever forget the morning he had bathed in those fresh waters what lake of italy what heroic wave of the midland ocean could rival in his imagination that simple basin he drew near to the woods of ducie glowing with the setting sun surely there was no twilight like the twilight of this land the woods of ducie are entered he recognised the path over which she had glided he knelt down and kissed that sacred earth as he approached the pleasure grounds he turned off into a side path that he might not be perceived he caught through a vista a distant glimpse of the mansion the sight of that roof wherein he had been so happy of that roof that contained all that he cared for or thought of in this world overcame him he leant against a tree and hid his face  the twilight died away the stars stole forth and ferdinand ventured in the spreading gloom of night to approach the mansion he threw himself upon the turf and watched the chamber where she lived the windows were open there were lights within the room but the thin curtains were drawn and concealed the inmates happy happy chamber all that was bright and fair and sweet were concentrated in those charming walls  the curtain is withdrawn an arm an arm which cannot be mistaken pulls back the drapery is she coming forth no she does not but he sees distinctly he sees her she sits in an old chair that he had often praised her head rests upon her arm her brow seems pensive and in her other hand she holds a volume that she scarcely appears to read oh may he gaze upon her for ever may this celestial scene this seraphic hour never pass away bright stars do not fade thou summer wind that playest upon his brow perfumed by her flowers refresh him for ever beautiful night be for ever the canopy of a scene so sweet and still let existence glide away in gazing on yon delicate and tender vision  dreams of fantastic love the curtain closes a ruder hand than hers has shut her from his sight it has all vanished the stars seem dim the autumnal air is dank and harsh and where he had gazed on heaven a bat flits wild and fleet poor ferdinand unhappy ferdinand how dull and depressed our brave gallant has become was it her father who had closed the curtain could he himself thought ferdinand have been observed  hark a voice softer and sweeter than the night breaks upon the air it is the voice of his beloved and indeed with all her singular and admirable qualities there was not anything more remarkable about henrietta temple than her voice it was a rare voice so that in speaking and in ordinary conversation though there was no one whose utterance was more natural and less unstudied it forcibly affected you she could not give you a greeting bid you an adieu or make a routine remark without impressing you with her power and sweetness it sounded like a bell sweet and clear and thrilling it was astonishing what influence a little word uttered by this woman without thought would have upon those she addressed of such fine clay is man made  that beautiful voice recalled to ferdinand all his fading visions it renewed the spell which had recently enchanted him it conjured up again all those sweet spirits that had a moment since hovered over him with their auspicious pinions he could not indeed see her her form was shrouded but her voice reached him a voice attuned to tenderness even to love a voice that ravished his ear melted his soul and blended with his whole existence his heart fluttered his pulse beat high he sprang up he advanced to the window yes a few paces alone divide them a single step and he will be at her side his hand is outstretched to clutch the curtain his when suddenly the music ceased his courage vanished with its inspiration for a moment he lingered but his heart misgave him and he stole back to his solitude  what a mystery is love all the necessities and habits of our life sink before it food and sleep that seem to divide our being as day and night divide time lose all their influence over the lover he is a spiritualised being fit only to live upon ambrosia and slumber in an imaginary paradise the cares of the world do not touch him its most stirring events are to him but the dusty incidents of bygone annals all the fortune of the world without his mistress is misery and with her all its mischances a transient dream revolutions earthquakes the change of governments the fall of empires are to him but childish games distasteful to a manly spirit men love in the plague and forget the pest though it rages about them they bear a charmed life and think not of destruction until it touches their idol and then they die without a pang like zealots for their persecuted creed a man in love wanders in the world as a somnambulist with eyes that seem open to those that watch him yet in fact view nothing but their own inward fancies  oh that night at ducie through whose long hours ferdinand armine in a tumult of enraptured passion wandered in its lawns and groves feeding on the image of its enchanting mistress watching the solitary light in her chamber that was to him as the pharos to a mariner in a tumultuous voyage the morning the grey cold morning came at last he had outwatched the stars and listened to the matins of the waking birds it was no longer possible to remain in the gardens unobserved he regained the common  what should he do whither should he wend his course to armine oh not to armine never could he return to armine without the heart of henrietta temple yes on that great venture he had now resolved on that mighty hazard all should now be staked reckless of consequences one vast object now alone sustained him existence without her was impossible ay a day a day a single a solitary day should not elapse without his breathing to her his passion and seeking his fate from her dark eyes  he strolled along to the extremity of the common it was a great table land from whose boundary you look down on small rich valleys and into one of these winding his way through fields and pastures of which the fertile soil was testified by their vigorous hedgerows he now descended a long low farmhouse with gable ends and ample porch an antique building that in old days might have been some manorial residence attracted his attention its picturesque form its angles and twisted chimneys its porch covered with jessamine and eglantine its verdant homestead and its orchard rich with ruddy fruit its vast barns and long lines of ample stacks produced altogether a rural picture complete and cheerful near it a stream which ferdinand followed and which after a devious and rapid course emptied itself into a deep and capacious pool touched by the early sunbeam and grateful to the swimmers eye here ferdinand made his natural toilet and afterwards slowly returning to the farmhouse sought an agreeable refuge from the sun in its fragrant porch  the farmers wife accompanied by a pretty daughter with downcast eyes came forth and invited him to enter while he courteously refused her offer he sought her hospitality the good wife brought a table and placed it in the porch and covered it with a napkin purer than snow her viands were fresh eggs milk warm from the cow and bread she had herself baked even a lover might feed on such sweet food this happy valley and this cheerful settlement wonderfully touched the fancy of ferdinand the season was mild and sunny the air scented by the flowers that rustled in the breeze the bees soon came to rifle their sweetness and flights of white and blue pigeons ever and anon skimmed along the sky from the neighbouring gables that were their dovecotes ferdinand made a salutary if not a plenteous meal and when the table was removed exhausted by the fatigue and excitement of the last fourandtwenty hours he stretched himself at full length in the porch and fell into a gentle and dreamless slumber  hours elapsed before he awoke vigorous indeed and wonderfully refreshed but the sun had already greatly declined to his astonishment as he moved there fell from his breast a beautiful nosegay he was charmed with this delicate attention from his hostess or perhaps from her pretty daughter with those downcast eyes there seemed a refinement about the gift and the mode of its offering which scarcely could be expected from these kind yet simple rustics the flowers too were rare and choice geraniums such as are found only in ladys bower a cape jessamine some musky carnations and a rose that seemed the sister of the one that he had borne from ducie they were delicately bound together too by a bright blue riband fastened by a gold and turquoise pin this was most strange this was an adventure more suitable to a sicilian palace than an english farmhouse to the gardens of a princess than the clustered porch of his kind hostess ferdinand gazed at the bouquet with a glance of blended perplexity and pleasure then he entered the farmhouse and made enquiries of his hostess but they were fruitless the pretty daughter with the downcast eyes was there too but her very admiration of the gift so genuine and unrestrained proved if testimony indeed were necessary that she was not his unknown benefactor admirer he would have said but ferdinand was in love and modest all agreed no one to their knowledge had been there and so ferdinand cherishing his beautiful gift was fain to quit his new friends in as much perplexity as ever     chapter xiv       containing an incident which  is the termination of most      tales though  almost the beginning of the present  it was about two hours before sunset that captain armine summoned up courage to call at ducie bower he enquired for mr temple and learned to his surprise that mr temple had quitted ducie yesterday morning for scotland and miss temple said ferdinand is at home sir replied the servant ferdinand was ushered into the salon she was not there our hero was very nervous he had been bold enough in the course of his walk from the farmhouse and indulged in a thousand imaginary conversations with his mistress but now that he was really about to meet her all his fire and fancy deserted him everything occurred to him inauspicious to his suit his own situation the short time she had known him his uncertainty of the state of her affections how did he know she was not engaged to another why should she not be betrothed as well as himself this contingency had occurred to him before and yet he had driven it from his thoughts he began to be jealous he began to think himself a very great fool at any rate he resolved not to expose himself any further he was clearly premature he would call tomorrow or next day to speak to her now was certainly impossible  the door opened she entered radiant as the day what a smile what dazzling teeth what ravishing dimples her eyes flashed like summer lightning she extended to him a hand white and soft as one of those doves that had played about him in the morning surely never was anyone endued with such an imperial presence so stately so majestic and yet withal so simply gracious full of such airy artlessness at one moment she seemed an empress and then only a beautiful child and the hand and arm that seemed fashioned to wave a sceptre in an instant appeared only fit to fondle a gazelle or pluck a flower  how do you do she said and he really fancied she was going to sing he was not yet accustomed to that marvellous voice it broke upon the silence like a silver bell just touched by the summer air it is kind of you to come and see a lone maiden she continued papa has deserted me and without any preparation i cannot endure to be separated from him and this is almost the only time that he has refused my solicitation to accompany him but he must travel far and quickly my uncle has sent for him he is very unwell and papa is his trustee there is business i do not know what it is but i dare say not very agreeable bythebye i hope lady armine is well  my papa has deserted me said ferdinand with a smile they have not yet arrived and some days may yet elapse before they reach armine  indeed i hope they are well  yes they are well  did you ride here  no  you did not walk  i hardly know how i came i believe i walked  you must be very tired and you are standing pray sit down sit in that chair you know that is your favourite chair  and ferdinand seated himself in the very chair in which he had watched her the preceding night  this is certainly my favourite chair he said i know no seat in the world i prefer to this  will you take some refreshment i am sure you will you must be very tired take some hock papa always takes hock and soda water i shall order some hock and soda water for you she rose and rang the bell in spite of his remonstrance  and have you been walking miss temple enquired ferdinand  i was thinking of strolling now she replied but i am glad that you have called for i wanted an excuse to be idle  an hour passed away nor was the conversation on either side very brilliantly supported ferdinand seemed dull but indeed was only moody revolving in his mind many strange incidents and feelings and then turning for consolation in his perplexities to the enchanting vision on which he still could gaze nor was miss temple either in her usually sparkling vein her liveliness seemed an effort she was more constrained she was less fluent than before ferdinand indeed rose more than once to depart yet still he remained he lost his cap he looked for his cap and then again seated himself again he rose restless and disquieted wandered about the room looked at a picture plucked a flower pulled the flower to pieces  miss temple he at length observed i am afraid i am very stupid  because you are silent  is not that a sufficient reason  nay i think not i think i am rather fond of silent people myself i cannot bear to live with a person who feels bound to talk because he is my companion the whole day passes sometimes without papa and myself exchanging fifty words yet i am very happy i do not feel that we are dull and miss temple pursued her work which she had previously taken up  ah but i am not your papa when we are very intimate with people when they interest us we are engaged with their feelings we do not perpetually require their ideas but an acquaintance as i am only an acquaintance a miserable acquaintance unless i speak or listen i have no business to be here unless i in some degree contribute to the amusement or the convenience of my companion i degenerate into a bore  i think you are very amusing and you may be useful if you like very and she offered him a skein of silk which she requested him to hold  it was a beautiful hand that was extended to him a beautiful hand is an excellent thing in woman it is a charm that never palls and better than all it is a means of fascination that never disappears women carry a beautiful hand with them to the grave when a beautiful face has long ago vanished or ceased to enchant the expression of the hand too is inexhaustible and when the eyes we may have worshipped no longer flash or sparkle the ringlets with which we may have played are covered with a cap or worse a turban and the symmetrical presence which in our sonnets has reminded us so oft of antelopes and wild gazelles have all all vanished the hand the immortal hand defying alike time and care still vanquishes and still triumphs and small soft and fair by an airy attitude a gentle pressure or a new ring renews with untiring grace the spell that bound our enamoured and adoring youth  but in the present instance there were eyes as bright as the hand locks more glossy and luxuriant than helens of troy a cheek pink as a shell and breaking into dimples like a may morning into sunshine and lips from which stole forth a perfume sweeter than the whole conservatory ferdinand sat down on a chair opposite miss temple with the extended skein  now this is better than doing nothing she said catching his eye with a glance halfkind halfarch i suspect captain armine that your melancholy originates in idleness  ah if i could only be employed every day in this manner ejaculated ferdinand  nay not with a distaff but you must do something you must get into parliament  you forget that i am a catholic said ferdinand  miss temple slightly blushed and talked rather quickly about her work but her companion would not relinquish the subject  i hope you are not prejudiced against my faith said ferdinand  prejudiced dear captain armine do not make me repent too seriously a giddy word i feel it is wrong that matters of taste should mingle with matters of belief but to speak the truth i am not quite sure that a howard or an armine who was a protestant like myself would quite please my fancy so much as in their present position which if a little inconvenient is very picturesque  ferdinand smiled my great grandmother was a protestant said ferdinand margaret armine do you think margaret a pretty name  queen margaret yes a fine name i think barring its abbreviation  i wish my great grandmothers name had not been margaret said ferdinand very seriously  now why should that respectable dames baptism disturb your fancy enquired miss temple  i wish her name had been henrietta replied ferdinand henrietta armine you know there was a henrietta armine once  was there said miss temple rising our skein is finished you have been very good i must go and see my flowers come and as she said this little word she turned her fair and finelyfinished neck and looked over her shoulder at ferdinand with an arch expression of countenance peculiar to her that winning look indeed that clear sweet voice and that quick graceful attitude blended into a spell which was irresistible his heart yearned for henrietta temple and rose at the bidding of her voice  from the conservatory they stepped into the garden it was a delicious afternoon the sun had sunk behind the grove and the air which had been throughout the day somewhat oppressive was now warm but mild at ducie there was a fine old terrace facing the western hills that bound the valley in which the bower was situate these hills a ridge of moderate elevation but of picturesque form parted just opposite the terrace as if on purpose to admit the setting sun like inferior existences that had as it were made way before the splendour of some mighty lord or conqueror the lofty and sloping bank which this terrace crowned was covered with rare shrubs and occasionally a group of tall trees sprang up among them and broke the view with an interference which was far from ungraceful while plants spreading forth from large marble vases had extended over their trunks and sometimes in their play had touched even their topmost branches between the terrace and the distant hills extended a tract of pastureland green and wellwooded by its rich hedgerows not a roof was visible though many farms and hamlets were at hand and in the heart of a rich and populous land here was a region where the shepherd or the herdsman was the only evidence of human existence it was thither a grateful spot at such an hour that miss temple and her companion directed their steps the last beam of the sun flashed across the flaming horizon as they gained the terrace the hills well wooded or presenting a bare and acute outline to the sky rose sharply defined in form while in another direction some more distant elevations were pervaded with a rich purple tint touched sometimes with a rosy blaze of soft and flickering light the whole scene indeed from the humble pastureland that was soon to creep into darkness to the proud hills whose sparkling crests were yet touched by the living beam was bathed with lucid beauty and luminous softness and blended with the glowing canopy of the lustrous sky but on the terrace and the groves that rose beyond it and on the glades and vistas into which they opened fell the full glory of the sunset each moment a new shadow now rosy now golden now blending in its shifting tints all the glory of the iris fell over the rich pleasuregrounds their groups of rare and noble trees and their dim or glittering avenues  the vespers of the birds were faintly dying away the last low of the returning kine sounded over the lea the tinkle of the sheepbell was heard no more the thin white moon began to gleam and hesperus glittered in the fading sky it was the twilight hour  that delicious hour that softens the heart of man what is its magic not merely its beauty it is not more beautiful than the sunrise it is its repose our tumultuous passions sink with the sun there is a fine sympathy between us and our world and the stillness of nature is responded to by the serenity of the soul  at this sacred hour our hearts are pure all worldly cares all those vulgar anxieties and aspirations that at other seasons hover like vultures over our existence vanish from the serene atmosphere of our susceptibility a sense of beauty and a sentiment of love pervade our being but if at such a moment solitude is full of joy if even when alone our native sensibility suffices to entrance us with a tranquil yet thrilling bliss how doubly sweet how multiplied must be our fine emotions when the most delicate influence of human sympathy combines with the power and purity of material and moral nature and completes the exquisite and enchanting spell  ferdinand armine turned from the beautiful world around him to gaze upon a countenance sweeter than the summer air softer than the gleaming moon brighter than the evening star the shadowy light of purple eve fell upon the still and solemn presence of henrietta temple irresistible emotion impelled him softly he took her gentle hand and bending his head he murmured to her most beautiful i love thee  as in the oppressive stillness of some tropic night a single drop is the refreshing harbinger of a slower that clears the heavens so even this slight expression relieved in an instant the intensity of his overburthened feelings and warm quick and gushing flowed the words that breathed his fervid adoration yes he continued in this fair scene oh let me turn to something fairer still beautiful beloved henrietta i can repress no longer the emotions that since i first beheld you have vanquished my existence i love you i adore you life in your society is heaven without you i cannot live deem me oh deem me not too bold sweet lady i am not worthy of you yet let me love i am not worthy of you but who can be ah if i dared but venture to offer you my heart if that humblest of all possessions might indeed be yours if my adoration if my devotion if the consecration of my life to you might in some degree compensate for its little worth if i might live even but to hope  you do not speak miss temple henrietta admirable henrietta have i offended you am i indeed the victim of hopes too high and fancies too supreme oh pardon me most beautiful i pray your pardon is it a crime to feel perchance too keenly the sense of beauty like to thine dear lady ah tell me i am forgiven tell me indeed you do not hate me i will be silent i will never speak again yet let me walk with you cease not to be my companion because i have been too bold pity me pity me dearest dearest henrietta if you but knew how i have suffered if you but knew the nights that brought no sleep the days of fever that have been mine since first we met if you but knew how i have fed but upon one sweet idea one sacred image of absorbing life since first i gazed on your transcendent form indeed i think that you would pity that you would pardon that you might even  tell me is it my fault that you are beautiful oh how beautiful my wretched and exhausted soul too surely feels is it my fault those eyes are like the dawn that thy sweet voice thrills through my frame and but the slightest touch of that light hand falls like a spell on my entranced form ah henrietta be merciful be kind  he paused for a second and yet she did not answer but her cheek fell upon his shoulder and the gentle pressure of her hand was more eloquent than language that slight sweet signal was to him as the sunrise on the misty earth full of hope and joy and confidence he took her in his arms sealed her cold lips with a burning kiss and vowed to her his eternal and almighty love  he bore her to an old stone bench placed on the terrace still she was silent but her hand clasped his and her head rested on his bosom the gleaming moon now glittered the hills and woods were silvered by its beam and the far meads were bathed with its clear fair light not a single cloud curtained the splendour of the stars what a rapturous soul was ferdinand armines as he sat that night on the old bench on ducie terrace shrouding from the rising breeze the trembling form of henrietta temple and yet it was not cold that made her shiver  the clock of ducie church struck ten she moved saying in a faint voice we must go home my ferdinand     book iii     chapter i       in which captain armine proves himself a complete      tactician  the midnight moon flung its broad beams over the glades and avenues of armine as ferdinand riding miss temples horse reentered the park his countenance was paler than the spectral light that guided him on his way he looked little like a pledged and triumphant lover but in his contracted brow and compressed lip might be read the determination of his soul there was no longer a contest between poverty and pride between the maintenance or destruction of his ancient house between his old engagement and his present passion that was past henrietta temple was the light in the pharos amid all his stormy fortunes thither he directed all the energies of his being and to gain that port or sink was his unflinching resolution  it was deep in the night before he again beheld the towers and turrets of his castle and the ivycovered fragment of the old place seemed to sleep in peace under its protecting influence a wild and beautiful event had happened since last he quitted those ancient walls and what would be its influence upon them but it is not for the passionate lover to moralise for him the regrets of the past and the chances of the future are alike lost in the ravishing and absorbing present for a lover that has but just secured the object of his long and tumultuous hopes is as a diver who has just plucked a jewel from the bed of some rare sea panting and wild he lies upon the beach and the gem that he clutches is the sole idea that engrosses his existence  ferdinand is within his little chamber that little chamber where his mother had bid him so passionate a farewell ah he loves another woman better than his mother now nay even a feeling of embarrassment and pain is associated with the recollection of that fond and elegant being whom he had recognised once as the model of all feminine perfection and who had been to him so gentle and so devoted he drives his mother from his thoughts it is of another voice that he now muses it is the memory of anothers glance that touches his eager heart he falls into a reverie the passionate past is acted again before him in his glittering eye and the rapid play of his features may be traced the tumult of his soul a doubt crosses his brow is he indeed so happy is it not all a dream he takes from his bosom the handkerchief of henrietta temple he recognises upon it her magical initials worked in her own fine dark hair a smile of triumphant certainty irradiates his countenance as he rapidly presses the memorial to his lips and imprints upon it a thousand kisses and holding this cherished testimony of his felicity to his heart sleep at length descended upon the exhausted frame of ferdinand armine  but the night that brought dreams to ferdinand armine brought him not visions more marvellous and magical than his waking life he who loves lives in an ecstatic trance the world that surrounds him is not the world of working man it is fairy land he is not of the same order as the labouring myriads on which he seems to tread they are to him but a swarm of humbleminded and humblemannered insects for him the human species is represented by a single individual and of her he makes an idol all that is bright and rare is but invented and devised to adorn and please her flowers for her were made so sweet and birds so musical all nature seems to bear an intimate relation to the being we adore and as to us life would now appear intolerable a burthen of insupportable and wearying toil without this transcendent sympathy so we cannot help fancying that were its sweet and subtle origin herself to quit this inspired scene the universe itself would not be unconscious of its deprivation and somewhat of the worlds lustre might be missed even by the most callous  the morning burst as beautiful as such love a rosy tint suffused the soft and tremulous sky and tinted with a delicate hue the tall trees and the wide lawns freshened with the light and vanishing dew the air was vocal with a thousand songs all was bright and clear cheerful and golden ferdinand awoke from delicious dreams and gazed upon the scene that responded to his own bright and glad emotions and inhaled the balmy air ethereal as his own soul love that can illumine the dark hovel and the dismal garret that sheds a ray of enchanting light over the close and busy city seems to mount with a lighter and more glittering pinion in an atmosphere as brilliant as its own plumes fortunate the youth the romance of whose existence is placed in a scene befitting its fair and marvellous career fortunate the passion that is breathed in palaces amid the ennobling creations of surrounding art and greets the object of its fond solicitude amid perfumed gardens and in the shade of green and silent woods whatever may be the harsher course of his career however the cold world may cast its dark shadows upon his future path he may yet consider himself thrice blessed to whom this graceful destiny has fallen and amid the storms and troubles of afterlife may look back to these hours fair as the dawn beautiful as the twilight with solace and satisfaction disappointment may wither up his energies oppression may bruise his spirit but baulked daunted deserted crushed lone where once all was sympathy gloomy where all was light still he has not lived in vain  business however rises with the sun the morning brings cares and although with rebraced energies and renovated strength then is the season that we are best qualified to struggle with the harassing brood still ferdinand armine the involved son of a ruined race seldom rose from his couch seldom recalled consciousness after repose without a pang nor was there indeed magic withal in the sweet spell that now bound him to preserve him from this black invasion anxiety was one of the ingredients of the charm he might have forgotten his own broken fortunes his audacious and sanguine spirit might have built up many a castle for the future as brave as that of armine but the very inspiring recollection of henrietta temple the very remembrance of the past and triumphant eve only the more forced upon his memory the conviction that he was at this moment engaged also to another and bound to be married to two women  something must be done miss grandison might arrive this very day it was an improbable incident but still it might occur while he was thus musing his servant brought him his letters which had arrived the preceding day letters from his mother and katherine his katherine they brought present relief the invalid had not amended their movements were still uncertain katherine his own kate expressed even a faint fond wish that he would return his resolution was taken in an instant he decided with the prescient promptitude of one who has his dearest interests at stake he wrote to katherine that he would instantly fly to her only that he daily expected his attendance would be required in town on military business of urgent importance to their happiness this might this must necessarily delay their meeting the moment he received his summons to attend the horse guards he should hurry off in the meantime she was to write to him here and at all events not to quit bath for armine without giving him a notice of several days having despatched this letter and another to his mother ferdinand repaired to the tower to communicate to glastonbury the necessity of his immediate departure for london but he also assured that good old man of his brief visit to that city the pang of this unexpected departure was softened by the positive promise of returning in a very few days and returning with his family  having made these arrangements ferdinand now felt that come what might he had at least secured for himself a certain period of unbroken bliss he had a faithful servant an italian in whose discretion he had justly unlimited confidence to him ferdinand intrusted the duty of bringing each day his letters to his retreat which he had fixed upon should be that same picturesque farmhouse in whose friendly porch he had found the preceding day such a hospitable shelter and where he had experienced that charming adventure which now rather delighted than perplexed him     chapter ii       a day of love  meanwhile the beautiful henrietta sat in her bower her music neglected her drawing thrown aside even her birds were forgotten and her flowers untended a soft tumult filled her frame now rapt in reverie she leaned her head upon her fair hand in charmed abstraction now rising from her restless seat she paced the chamber and thought of his quick coming what was this mighty revolution that a few short days a few brief hours had occasioned how mysterious yet how irresistible how overwhelming her father was absent that father on whose fond idea she had alone lived from whom the slightest separation had once been pain and now that father claims not even her thoughts another and a strangers image is throned in her soul she who had moved in the world so variously who had received so much homage and been accustomed from her childhood to all that is considered accomplished and fascinating in man and had passed through the ordeal with a calm clear spirit behold she is no longer the mistress of her thoughts or feelings she had fallen before a glance and yielded in an instant to a burning word  but could she blame herself did she repent the rapid and ravishing past did regret mingle with her wonder was there a pang of remorse however slight blending its sharp tooth with all her bliss no her love was perfect and her joy was full she offered her vows to that heaven that had accorded her happiness so supreme she felt only unworthy of a destiny so complete she marvelled in the meekness and purity of her spirit why one so gifted had been reserved for her and what he could recognise in her imperfect and inferior qualities to devote to them the fondness of his rare existence  ferdinand armine did there indeed ever breathe had the wit of poet ever yet devised a being so choice so young so beautiful so lively and accomplished so deeply and variously interesting was that sweet voice indeed only to sound in her enchanted ear that graceful form to move only for the pleasure of her watchful eye that quick and airy fancy but to create for her delight and that soft gentle heart to own no solicitude but for her will and infinite gratification and could it be possible that he loved her that she was indeed his pledged bride that the accents of his adoration still echoed in her ear and his fond embrace still clung to her mute and trembling lips would he always love her would he always be so fond would he be as faithful as he was now devoted ah she would not lose him that heart should never escape her her life should be one long vigilant device to enchain his being  what was she five days past is it possible that she lived before she met him of what did she think what do could there be pursuits without this companion plans or feelings without this sweet friend life must have been a blank vapid and dull and weary she could not recall herself before that morning ride to armine how rolled away the day how heavy must have been the hours all that had been uttered before she listened to ferdinand seemed without point all that was done before he lingered at her side aimless and without an object  o love in vain they moralise in vain they teach us thou art a delusion in vain they dissect thine inspiring sentiment and would mortify us into misery by its degrading analysis the sage may announce that gratified vanity is thine aim and end but the lover glances with contempt at his coldblooded philosophy nature assures him thou art a beautiful and sublime emotion and he answers canst thou deprive the sun of its heat because its ray may be decomposed or does the diamond blaze with less splendour because thou canst analyse its effulgence  a gentle rustling sounded at the window henrietta looked up but the sight deserted her fading vision as ferdinand seized with softness her softer hand and pressed it to his lips  a moment since and she had longed for his presence as the infant for its mother a moment since and she had murmured that so much of the morn had passed without his society a moment since and it had seemed that no time could exhaust the expression of her feelings how she had sighed for his coming how she had hoped that this day she might convey to him what last night she had so weakly so imperfectly attempted and now she sat trembling and silent with downcast eyes and changing countenance  my henrietta exclaimed ferdinand my beautiful henrietta it seemed we never should meet again and yet i rose almost with the sun  my ferdinand replied miss temple scarcely daring to meet his glance i cannot speak i am so happy that i cannot speak  ah tell me have you thought of me did you observe i stole your handkerchief last night see here it is when i slept i kissed it and wore it next my heart  ah give it me she faintly murmured extending her hand and then she added in a firmer and livelier tone and did you really wear it near your heart  near thine for thine it is love sweet you look so beautiful today it seems to me you never yet looked half so fair those eyes are so brilliant so very blue so like the violet there is nothing like your eyes  except your own  you have taken away your hand give me back my hand my henrietta i will not quit it the whole day it shall be clasped in mine ah what a hand so soft so very soft there is nothing like your hand  yours is as soft dear ferdinand  o henrietta i do love you so i wish that i could tell you how i love you as i rode home last night it seemed that i had not conveyed to you a tithe nay a thousandth part of what i feel  you cannot love me ferdinand more than i love you  say so again tell me very often tell me a thousand times how much you love me unless you tell me a thousand times henrietta i never can believe that i am so blessed  they went forth into the garden nature with the splendid sky and the sweet breeze seemed to smile upon their passion henrietta plucked the most beautiful flowers and placed them in his breast  do you remember the rose at armine said ferdinand with a fond smile  ah who would have believed that it would have led to this said henrietta with downcast eyes  i am not more in love now than i was then said ferdinand  i dare not speak of my feelings said miss temple is it possible that it can be but five days back since we first met it seems another era  i have no recollection of anything that occurred before i saw you beneath the cedar replied ferdinand that is the date of my existence i saw you and i loved my love was at once complete i have no confidence in any other i have no confidence in the love that is the creature of observation and reflection and comparison and calculation love in my opinion should spring from innate sympathy it should be superior to all situations all ties all circumstances  such then we must believe is ours replied henrietta in a somewhat grave and musing tone i would willingly embrace your creed i know not why i should be ashamed of my feelings they are natural and they are pure and yet i tremble but so long as you do not think lightly of me ferdinand for whom should i care  my henrietta my angel my adored and beautiful i worship you i reverence you ah my henrietta if you only knew how i dote upon you you would not speak thus come let us ramble in our woods  so saying he withdrew her from the more public situation in which they were then placed and entered by a winding walk those beautiful bowers that had given so fair and fitting a name to ducie ah that was a ramble of rich delight as winding his arm round her light waist he poured into her palpitating ear all the eloquence of his passion each hour that they had known each other was analysed and the feelings of each moment were compared what sweet and thrilling confessions eventually it was settled to the complete satisfaction of both that both had fallen in love at the same time and that they had been mutually and unceasingly thinking of each other from the first instant of their meeting  the conversation of lovers is inexhaustible hour glided away after hour as ferdinand alternately expressed his passion and detailed the history of his past life for the curiosity of woman lively at all times is never so keen so exacting and so interested as in her anxiety to become acquainted with the previous career of her lover she is jealous of all that he has done before she knew him of every person to whom he has spoken she will be assured a thousand times that he never loved before yet she credits the first affirmation she envies the mother who knew him as a child even the nurse who may have rocked his cradle she insists upon a minute and finished portraiture of his character and life  why did he not give it more than once it was upon his lips to reveal all more than once he was about to pour forth all his sorrows all the entanglements of his painful situation more than once he was about to make the full and mortifying confession that though his heart was hers there existed another who even at that moment might claim the hand that henrietta clasped with so much tenderness but he checked himself he would not break the charm that surrounded him he would not disturb the clear and brilliant stream in which his life was at this moment flowing he had not courage to change by a worldly word the scene of celestial enchantment in which he now moved and breathed let us add in some degree for his justification that he was not altogether unmindful of the feelings of miss grandison sufficient misery remained at all events for her without adding the misery of making her rival cognizant of her mortification the deed must be done and done promptly but at least there should be no unnecessary witnesses to its harrowing achievement  so he looked upon the radiant brow of his henrietta wreathed with smiles of innocent triumph sparkling with unalloyed felicity and beaming with unbroken devotion should the shade of a dark passion for a moment cloud that heaven so bright and so serene should even a momentary pang of jealousy or distrust pain that pure and unsullied breast in the midst of contending emotions he pressed her to his heart with renewed energy and bending down his head imprinted an embrace upon her blushing forehead  they seated themselves on a bank which it would seem nature had created for the convenience of lovers the softest moss and the brightest flowers decked its elastic and fragrant side a spreading beech tree shaded their heads from the sun which now was on the decline and occasionally its wide branches rustled with the soft breeze that passed over them in renovating and gentle gusts the woods widened before them and at the termination of a wellcontrived avenue they caught the roofs of the village and the tall grey tower of ducie church they had wandered for hours without weariness yet the repose was grateful while they listened to the birds and plucked wildflowers  ah i remember said ferdinand that it was not far from here while slumbering indeed in the porch of my pretty farmhouse that the fairy of the spot dropped on my breast these beautiful flowers that i now wear did you not observe them my sweet henrietta do you know that i am rather mortified that they have not made you at least a little jealous  i am not jealous of fairies dear ferdinand  and yet i half believe that you are a fairy my henrietta  a very substantial one i fear my ferdinand is this a compliment to my form  well then a sylvan nymph much more i assure you to my fancy perhaps the rosy dryad of this fair tree rambling in woods and bounding over commons scattering beautiful flowers and dreams as bright  and were your dreams bright yesterday morning  i dreamed of you  and when you awoke  i hastened to the source of my inspiration  and if you had not dreamt of me  i should have come to have enquired the reason why  miss temple looked upon the ground a blended expression of mirth and sentiment played over her features and then looking up with a smile contending with her tearful eye she hid her face in his breast and murmured i watched him sleeping did he indeed dream of me  darling of my existence exclaimed the enraptured ferdinand exquisite enchanting being why am i so happy what have i done to deserve bliss so ineffable but tell me beauty tell me how you contrived to appear and vanish without witnesses for my enquiries were severe and these good people must have been less artless than i imagined to have withstood them successfully  i came said miss temple to pay them a visit with me not uncommon when i entered the porch i beheld my ferdinand asleep i looked upon him for a moment but i was frightened and stole away unperceived but i left the flowers more fortunate than your henrietta  sweet love  never did i return home continued miss temple more sad and more dispirited a thousand times i wished that i was a flower that i might be gathered and worn upon your heart you smile my ferdinand indeed i feel i am very foolish yet i know not why i am now neither ashamed nor afraid to tell you anything i was so miserable when i arrived home my ferdinand that i went to my room and wept and he then came oh what heaven was mine i wiped the tears from my face and came down to see him he looked so beautiful and happy  and you sweet child oh who could have believed at that moment that a tear had escaped from those bright eyes  love makes us hypocrites i fear my ferdinand for a moment before i was so wearied that i was lying on my sofa quite wretched and then when i saw him i pretended that i had not been out and was just thinking of a stroll oh my ferdinand will you pardon me  it seems to me that i never loved you until this moment is it possible that human beings ever loved each other as we do  now came the hour of twilight while in this fond strain the lovers interchanged their hearts the sun had sunk the birds grown silent and the star of evening twinkled over the tower of ducie the bat and the beetle warned them to return they rose reluctantly and retraced their steps to ducie with hearts softer even than the melting hour  must we then part exclaimed ferdinand oh must we part how can i exist even an instant without your presence without at least the consciousness of existing under the same roof oh would i were one of your servingmen to listen to your footstep to obey your bell and ever and anon to catch your voice oh now i wish indeed mr temple were here and then i might be your guest  my father exclaimed miss temple in a somewhat serious tone i ought to have written to him today oh talk not of my father speak only of yourself  they stood in silence as they were about to emerge upon the lawn and then miss temple said dear ferdinand you must go indeed you must press me not to enter if you love me now let us part i shall retire immediately that the morning may sooner come god bless you my ferdinand may he guard over you and keep you for ever and ever you weep indeed you must not you so distress me ferdinand be good be kind for my sake do not this i love you what can i do more the time will come we will not part but now we must good night my ferdinand nay if you will these lips indeed are yours promise me you will not remain here well then when the light is out in my chamber leave ducie promise me this and early tomorrow earlier than you think i will pay a visit to your cottage now be good and tomorrow we will breakfast together there now she added in a gay tone you see womans wit has the advantage and so without another word she ran away     chapter iii       which on the whole is found very consoling  the separation of lovers even with an immediate prospect of union involves a sentiment of deep melancholy the reaction of our solitary emotions after a social impulse of such peculiar excitement very much disheartens and depresses us mutual passion is complete sympathy under such an influence there is no feeling so strong no fancy so delicate that it is not instantly responded to our heart has no secrets though our life may under such an influence each unconsciously labours to enchant the other each struggles to maintain the reality of that ideal which has been reached in a moment of happy inspiration then is the season when the voice is ever soft the eye ever bright and every movement of the frame airy and picturesque each accent is full of tenderness each glance of affection each gesture of grace we live in a heaven of our own creation all happens that can contribute to our perfect satisfaction and can ensure our complete selfcomplacency we give and we receive felicity we adore and we are adored love is the mayday of the heart  but a cloud nevertheless will dim the genial lustre of that soft and brilliant sky when we are alone when the soft voice no longer sighs and the bright eye no longer beams and the form we worship no longer moves before our enraptured vision our happiness becomes too much the result of reflection our faith is not less devout but it is not so fervent we believe in the miracle but we no longer witness it  and as the light was extinguished in the chamber of henrietta temple ferdinand armine felt for a moment as if his sun had set for ever there seemed to be now no evidence of her existence would tomorrow ever come and if it came would the rosy hours indeed bring her in their radiant car what if this night she died he shuddered at this wild imagination yet it might be such dire calamities had been and now he felt his life was involved in hers and that under such circumstances his instant death must complete the catastrophe there was then much at stake had it been yet his glorious privilege that her fair cheek should have found a pillow on his heart could he have been permitted to have rested without her door but as her guard even if the same roof at any distance had screened both their heads such dark conceptions would not perhaps have risen up to torture him but as it was they haunted him like evil spirits as he took his lonely way over the common to gain his new abode  ah the morning came and such a morn bright as his love ferdinand had passed a dreamy night and when he woke he could not at first recognise the locality it was not armine could it be ducie as he stretched his limbs and rubbed his eyes he might be excused for a moment fancying that all the happiness of yesterday was indeed a vision he was in truth sorely perplexed as he looked around the neat but humble chamber and caught the first beam of the sun struggling through a casement shadowed by the jessamine but on his heart there rested a curl of dark and flowing hair and held together by that very turquoise of which he fancied he had been dreaming happy happy ferdinand why shouldst thou have cares and may not the course even of thy true love run smooth  he recks not of the future what is the future to one so blessed the sun is up the lark is singing the sky is bluer than the lovejewel at his heart she will be here soon no gloomy images disturb him now cheerfulness is the dowry of the dawn  will she indeed be here will henrietta temple indeed come to visit him will that consummate being before whom but a few days back he stood entranced to whose mind the very idea of his existence had not then even occurred will she be here anon to visit him to visit her beloved what has he done to be so happy what fairy has touched him and his dark fortunes with her wand what talisman does he grasp to call up such bright adventures of existence he does not err he is an enchanted being a spell indeed pervades his frame he moves in truth in a world of marvels and miracles for what fairy has a wand like love what talisman can achieve the deeds of passion  he quitted the rustic porch and strolled up the lane that led to ducie he started at a sound it was but the spring of a wandering bird then the murmur of a distant wheel turned him pale and he stopped and leant on a neighbouring gate with a panting heart was she at hand there is not a moment when the heart palpitates with such delicate suspense as when a lover awaits his mistress in the spring days of his passion man watching the sun rise from a mountain awaits not an incident to him more beautiful more genial and more impressive with her presence it would seem that both light and heat fall at the same time upon his heart his emotions are warm and sunny that a moment ago seemed dim and frigid a thrilling sense of joy pervades his frame the air is sweeter and his ears seem to echo with the music of a thousand birds  the sound of the approaching wheel became more audible it drew near nearer but lost the delicacy that distance lent it alas it did not propel the car of a fairy or the chariot of a heroine but a cart whose taxed springs bowed beneath the portly form of an honest yeoman who gave captain armine a cheerful goodmorrow as he jogged by and flanked his jolly whip with unmerciful dexterity the loudness of the unexpected salute the crack of the echoing thong shook the fine nerves of a fanciful lover and ferdinand looked so confused that if the honest yeoman had only stopped to observe him the passenger might have really been excused for mistaking him for a poacher at the least by his guilty countenance  this little worldly interruption broke the wings of ferdinands soaring fancy he fell to earth doubt came over him whether henrietta would indeed come he was disappointed and so he became distrustful he strolled on however in the direction of ducie yet slowly as there was more than one road and to miss each other would have been mortifying  his quick eye was in every quarter his watchful ear listened in every direction still she was not seen and not a sound was heard except the hum of day he became nervous agitated and began to conjure up a crowd of unfortunate incidents perhaps she was ill that was very bad perhaps her father had suddenly returned was that worse perhaps something strange had happened perhaps  why why does his face turn so pale and why is his step so suddenly arrested ah ferdinand armine is not thy conscience clear that pang was sharp no no it is impossible clearly absolutely impossible this is weak indeed see he smiles he smiles at his weakness he waves his arm as if in contempt he casts away with defiance his idle apprehensions his step is more assured and the colour returns to his cheek and yet her father must return was he prepared for that occurrence this was a searching question it induced a long dark train of harassing recollections he stopped to ponder in what a web of circumstances was he now involved howsoever he might act selfextrication appeared impossible perfect candour to miss temple might be the destruction of her love even modified to her father would certainly produce his banishment from ducie as the betrothed of miss grandison miss temple would abjure him as the lover of miss temple under any circumstances mr temple would reject him in what light would he appear to henrietta were he to dare to reveal the truth would she not look upon him as the unresisting libertine of the hour engaging in levity her heart as he had already trifled with anothers for that absorbing and overwhelming passion pure primitive and profound to which she now responded with an enthusiasm as fresh as ardent and as immaculate she would only recognise the fleeting fancy of a vain and worldly spirit eager to add another triumph to a long list of conquests and proud of another evidence of his irresistible influence what security was there for her that she too should not in turn be forgotten for another that another eye should not shine brighter than hers and another voice sound to his ear with a sweeter tone  oh no he dared not disturb and sully the bright flow of his present existence he shrank from the fatal word that would dissolve the spell that enchanted them and introduce all the calculating cares of a harsh world into the thoughtless eden in which they now wandered and for her father even if the sad engagement with miss grandison did not exist with what front could ferdinand solicit the hand of his daughter what prospect could he hold out of worldly prosperity to the anxious consideration of a parent was he himself independent was he not worse than a beggar could he refer mr temple to sir ratcliffe alas it would be an insult to both in the meantime every hour mr temple might return or something reach the ear of henrietta fatal to all his aspirations armine with all its cares bath with all its hopes his melancholy father his fond and sanguine mother the tenderhearted katherine the devoted glastonbury all rose up before him and crowded on his tortured imagination in the agony of his mind he wished himself alone in the world he sighed for some earthquake to swallow up armine and all its fatal fortunes and as for those parents so affectionate and virtuous and to whom he had hitherto been so dutiful and devoted he turned from their idea with a sensation of weariness almost of dislike  he sat down on the trunk of a tree and buried his face in his hands his reverie had lasted some time when a gentle sound disturbed him he looked up it was henrietta she had driven over the common in her ponychair and unattended she was but a few steps from him and as he looked up he caught her fond smile he sprang from his seat he was at her side in an instant his heart beat so tumultuously that he could not speak all dark thoughts were forgotten he seized with a trembling touch her extended hand and gazed upon her with a glance of ecstasy for indeed she looked so beautiful that it seemed to him he had never before done justice to her surpassing loveliness there was a bloom upon her cheek as upon some choice and delicate fruit her violet eyes sparkled like gems while the dimples played and quivered on her cheeks as you may sometimes watch the sunbeam on the pure surface of fair water her countenance indeed was wreathed with smiles she seemed the happiest thing on earth the very personification of a poetic spring lively and fresh and innocent sparkling and sweet and soft when he beheld her ferdinand was reminded of some gay bird or airy antelope she looked so bright and joyous  he is to get in said henrietta with a smile and drive her to their cottage have i not managed well to come alone we shall have such a charming drive today  you are so beautiful murmured ferdinand  i am content if you but think so you did not hear me approach what were you doing plunged in meditation now tell me truly were you thinking of her  indeed i have no other thought oh my henrietta you are so beautiful today i cannot talk of anything but your beauty  and how did you sleep are you comfortable i have brought you some flowers to make your room look pretty  they soon reached the farmhouse the goodwife seemed a little surprised when she observed her guest driving miss temple but far more pleased henrietta ran into the house to see the children spoke some kind words to the little maiden and asked if their guest had breakfasted then turning to ferdinand she said have you forgotten that you are to give me a breakfast it shall be in the porch is it not sweet and pretty see here are your flowers and i have brought you some fruit  the breakfast was arranged but you do not play your part sweet henrietta he said i cannot breakfast alone  she affected to share his repast that he might partake of it but in truth she only busied herself in arranging the flowers yet she conducted herself with so much dexterity that ferdinand had an opportunity of gratifying his appetite without being placed in a position awkward at all times insufferable for a lover that of eating in the presence of others who do not join you in the occupation  now she suddenly said sitting by his side and placing a rose in his dress i have a little plan today which i think will be quite delightful you shall drive me to armine  ferdinand started he thought of glastonbury  his miserable situation recurred to him this was the bitter drop in the cup yes in the very plenitude of his rare felicity he expressed a pang his confusion was not unobserved by miss temple for she was very quick in her perception but she could not comprehend it it did not rest on her mind particularly when ferdinand assented to her proposition but added i forgot that armine is more interesting to you than to me all my associations with armine are painful ducie is my delight  ah my romance is at armine yours at ducie what we live among we do not always value and yet i love my home she added in a somewhat subdued even serious tone all my associations with ducie are sweet and pleasant will they always be so  she hit upon a key to which the passing thoughts of ferdinand too completely responded but he restrained the mood of his mind as she grew grave he affected cheerfulness my henrietta must always be happy he said at least if her ferdinands love can make her so  she did not reply but she pressed his hand then after a moments silence she said my ferdinand must not be lowspirited about dear armine i have confidence in our destiny i see a happy a very happy future  who could resist so fair a prophet not the sanguine mind of the enamoured ferdinand armine he drank inspiration from her smiles and dwelt with delight on the tender accents of her animating sympathy i never shall be lowspirited with you he replied you are my good genius o henrietta what heaven it is to be together  i bless you for these words we will not go to armine today let us walk and to speak the truth for i am not ashamed of saying anything to you it would be hardly discreet perhaps to be driving about the country in this guise and yet she added after a moments hesitation what care i for what people say o ferdinand i think only of you  that was a delicious ramble which these young and enamoured creatures took that sunny morn the air was sweet the earth was beautiful and yet they were insensible to everything but their mutual love inexhaustible is the converse of fond hearts a simple story too and yet there are so many ways of telling it  how strange that we should have ever met said henrietta temple  indeed i think it most natural said ferdinand i will believe it the fulfilment of a happy destiny for all that i have sighed for now i meet and more much more than my imagination could ever hope for  only think of that morning drive resumed henrietta such a little time ago and yet it seems an age let us believe in destiny dear ferdinand or you must think of me i fear that which i would not wish  my own henrietta i can think of you only as the noblest and the sweetest of beings my love is ever equalled by my gratitude  my ferdinand i had read of such feelings but did not believe in them i did not believe at least that they were reserved for me and yet i have met many persons and seen something more much more than falls to the lot of women of my age believe me indeed my eye has hitherto been undazzled and my heart untouched he pressed her hand  and then she resumed in a moment but it seemed not like common life that beautiful wilderness that ruinous castle as i gazed around i felt not as is my custom i felt as if some fate were impending as if my life and lot were bound up as it were with that strange and silent scene and then he came forward and i beheld him so unlike all other men so beautiful so pensive o ferdinand pardon me for loving you and she gently turned her head and hid her face on his breast  darling henrietta lowly breathed the enraptured lover best and sweetest and loveliest of women your ferdinand at that moment was not less moved than you were speechless and pale i had watched my henrietta and i felt that i beheld the being to whom i must dedicate my existence  i shall never forget the moment when i stood before the portrait of sir ferdinand do you know my heart was prophetic i wanted not that confirmation of a strange conjecture i felt that you must be an armine i had heard so much of your grandfather so much of your family i loved them for their glory and for their lordly sorrows  ah my henrietta tis that alone which galls me it is bitter to introduce my bride to our house of cares  you shall never think it so she replied with animation i will prove a true armine happier in the honour of that name than in the most rich possessions you do not know me yet your wife shall not disgrace you or your lineage i have a spirit worthy of you ferdinand at least i dare to hope so i can break but i will not bend we will wrestle together with all our cares and my ferdinand animated by his henrietta shall restore the house  alas my nobleminded girl i fear a severe trial awaits us i can offer you only love  is there anything else in this world  but to bear you from a roof of luxury where you have been cherished from your cradle with all that ministers to the delicate delights of woman tooh my henrietta you know not the disheartening and depressing burthen of domestic cares his voice faltered as he recalled his melancholy father and the disappointment perhaps the destruction that his passion was preparing for his roof  there shall be no cares i will endure everything i will animate all i have energy indeed i have my ferdinand i have young as i may be i have often inspirited often urged on my father sometimes he says that had it not been for me he would not have been what he is he is my father the best and kindest parent that ever loved his child yet what are fathers to you my ferdinand and if i could assist him what may i not do for  alas my henrietta we have no theatre for action you forget our creed  it was the great sir ferdinands he made a theatre  my henrietta is ambitious said ferdinand smiling  dearest i would be content nay that is a weak phrase i would if the choice were in my power now to select a life most grateful to my views and feelings choose some delightful solitude even as armine and pass existence with no other aim but to delight you but we were speaking of other circumstances such happiness it is said is not for us and i wished to show you that i have a spirit that can struggle with adversity and a soul prescient of overwhelming it  you have a spirit i reverence and a soul i worship nor is there a happier being in the world this moment than ferdinand armine with such a woman as you every fate must be a triumph you have touched upon a chord of my heart that has sounded before though in solitude it was but the wind that played on it before but now that tone rings with a purpose this is glorious sympathy let us leave armine to its fate i have a sword and it shall go hard if i do not carve out a destiny worthy even of henrietta temple     chapter iv       henrietta visits armine which  leads to a rather      perplexing encounter  the communion of this day of the spirit of which the conversation just noticed may convey an intimation produced an inspiriting effect on the mind of ferdinand love is inspiration it encourages to great deeds and develops the creative faculty of our nature few great men have flourished who were they candid would not acknowledge the vast advantages they have experienced in the earlier years of their career from the spirit and sympathy of woman it is woman whose prescient admiration strings the lyre of the desponding poet whose genius is afterwards to be recognised by his race and which often embalms the memory of the gentle mistress whose kindness solaced him in less glorious hours how many an official portfolio would never have been carried had it not been for her sanguine spirit and assiduous love how many a depressed and despairing advocate has clutched the great seal and taken his precedence before princes borne onward by the breeze of her inspiring hope and illumined by the sunshine of her prophetic smile a female friend amiable clever and devoted is a possession more valuable than parks and palaces and without such a muse few men can succeed in life none be content  the plans and aspirations of henrietta had relieved ferdinand from a depressing burthen inspired by her creative sympathy a new scene opened to him adorned by a magnificent perspective his sanguine imagination sought refuge in a triumphant future that love for which he had hitherto schooled his mind to sacrifice every worldly advantage appeared suddenly to be transformed into the very source of earthly success henrietta temple was to be the fountain not only of his bliss but of his prosperity in the revel of his audacious fancy he seemed as it were by a beautiful retribution to be already rewarded for having devoted with such unhesitating readiness his heart upon the altar of disinterested affection lying on his cottagecouch he indulged in dazzling visions he wandered in strange lands with his beautiful companion and offered at her feet the quick rewards of his unparalleled achievements  recurring to his immediate situation he resolved to lose no time in bringing his affairs to a crisis he was even working himself up to his instant departure solaced by the certainty of his immediate return when the arrival of his servant announced to him that glastonbury had quitted armine on one of those antiquarian rambles to which he was accustomed gratified that it was now in his power to comply with the wish of henrietta to visit his home and perhaps in truth not very much mortified that so reasonable an excuse had arisen for the postponement of his intended departure ferdinand instantly rose and as speedily as possible took his way to ducie  he found henrietta in the garden he had arrived perhaps earlier than he was expected yet what joy to see him and when he himself proposed an excursion to armine her grateful smile melted his very heart indeed ferdinand this morning was so gay and lighthearted that his excessive merriment might almost have been as suspicious as his passing gloom the previous day not less tender and fond than before his sportive fancy indulged in infinite expressions of playful humour and delicate pranks of love when he first recognised her gathering a nosegay too for him himself unobserved he stole behind her on tiptoe and suddenly clasping her delicate waist and raising her gently in the air well ladybird he exclaimed i too will pluck a flower  ah when she turned round her beautiful face full of charming confusion and uttered a faint cry of fond astonishment as she caught his bright glance what happiness was ferdinand armines as he felt this enchanting creature was his and pressed to his bosom her noble and throbbing form  perhaps this time next year we may be travelling on mules said ferdinand as he flourished his whip and the little pony trotted along henrietta smiled and then continued he we shall remember our ponychair that we turn up our noses at now donna henrietta jogged to death over dull vegas and picking her way across rocky sierras will be a very different person from miss temple of ducie bower i hope you will not be very irritable my child and pray vent your spleen upon your muleteer and not upon your husband  now ferdinand how can you be so ridiculous  oh i have no doubt i shall have to bear all the blame you brought me here it will be ungrateful man is this your love not even posthorses  as for that said henrietta perhaps we shall have to walk i can fancy ourselves you with an andalusian jacket a long gun and i fear a cigar and i with all the baggage  children and all added ferdinand  miss temple looked somewhat demure turned away her face a little but said nothing  but what think you of vienna sweetest enquired ferdinand in a more serious tone upon my honour i think we might do great things there a regiment and a chamberlainship at the least  in mountains or in cities i shall be alike content provided you be my companion replied miss temple  ferdinand let go the reins and dropped his whip my henrietta he exclaimed looking in her face what an angel you are  this visit to armine was so delightful to miss temple she experienced so much gratification in wandering about the park and over the old castle and gazing on glastonburys tower and wondering when she should see him and talking to her ferdinand about every member of his family that captain armine unable to withstand the irresistible current postponed from day to day his decisive visit to bath and confident in the future would not permit his soul to be the least daunted by any possible conjuncture of ill fortune a week a whole happy week glided away and spent almost entirely at armine their presence there was scarcely noticed by the single female servant who remained and if her curiosity had been excited she possessed no power of communicating it into somersetshire besides she was unaware that her young master was nominally in london sometimes an hour was snatched by henrietta from roaming in the pleasaunce and interchanging vows of mutual love and admiration to the picturegallery where she had already commenced a miniature copy of the portrait of the great sir ferdinand as the sun set they departed in their little equipage ferdinand wrapped his henrietta in his fur cloak for the autumn dews began to rise and thus protected the journey of ten miles was ever found too short it is the habit of lovers however innocent their passion to grow every day less discreet for every day their almost constant companionship becomes more a necessity miss temple had almost unconsciously contrived at first that captain armine in the absence of her father should not be observed too often at ducie but now ferdinand drove her home every evening and drank tea at the bower and the evening closed with music and song each night he crossed over the common to his farmhouse more fondly and devotedly in love  one morning at armine henrietta being alone in the gallery busied with her drawing ferdinand having left her for a moment to execute some slight commission for her she heard some one enter and looking up to catch his glance of love she beheld a venerable man of a mild and benignant appearance and dressed in black standing as if a little surprised at some distance herself not less confused she nevertheless bowed and the gentleman advanced with hesitation and with a faint blush returned her salute and apologised for his intrusion he thought captain armine might be there  he was here but this moment replied miss temple and doubtless will instantly return then she turned to her drawing with a trembling hand  i perceive madam said the gentleman advancing and speaking in a soft and engaging tone while looking at her labour with a mingled air of diffidence and admiration that you are a fine artist  my wish to excel may have assisted my performance replied miss temple  you are copying the portrait of a very extraordinary personage said the stranger  do you think that it is like captain armine enquired miss temple with some hesitation  it is always so considered replied the stranger henriettas hand faltered she looked at the door of the gallery then at the portrait never was she yet so anxious for the reappearance of ferdinand there was a silence which she was compelled to break for the stranger was both mute and motionless and scarcely more assured than herself  captain armine will be here immediately i have no doubt  the stranger bowed if i might presume to criticise so finished a performance he remarked i should say that you had conveyed madam a more youthful character than the original presents  henrietta did not venture to confess that such was her intention she looked again at the door mixed some colour and then cleared it immediately off her palette what a beautiful gallery is this she exclaimed as she changed her brush which was however without a fault  it is worthy of armine said the stranger  indeed there is no place so interesting said miss temple  it pleases me to hear it praised said the stranger  you are well acquainted with it enquired miss temple  i have the happiness to live here said the stranger  i am not then mistaken in believing that i speak to mr glastonbury  indeed madam that is my name replied the gentleman i fancy we have often heard of each other this a most unexpected meeting madam but for that reason not less delightful i have myself just returned from a ramble of some days and entered the gallery little aware that the family had arrived you met i suppose my ferdinand on the road ah you wonder perhaps at my familiar expression madam he has been my ferdinand so many years that i cannot easily school myself no longer to style him so but i am aware that there are now other claims  my dearest glastonbury exclaimed ferdinand armine starting as he reentered the gallery and truly in as great a fright as a man could well be who perhaps but a few hours ago was to conquer in spain or germany at the same time pale and eager and talking with excited rapidity he embraced his tutor and scrutinised the countenance of henrietta to ascertain whether his fatal secret had been discovered  that countenance was fond and if not calm not more confused than the unexpected appearance under the circumstances might account for you have often heard me mention mr glastonbury he said addressing himself to henrietta let me now have the pleasure of making you acquainted my oldest my best friend my second father an admirable artist too i can assure you he is qualified to decide even upon your skill and when did you arrive my dearest friend and where have you been our old haunts many sketches what abbey have you explored what antique treasures have you discovered i have such a fine addition for your herbal the barbary cactus just what you wanted i found it in my volume of shelley and beautifully dried beautifully it will quite charm you what do you think of this drawing is it not beautiful quite the character is it not ferdinand paused for lack of breath  i was just observing as you entered said glastonbury very quietly to miss  i have several letters for you said ferdinand interrupting him and trembling from head to foot lest he might say miss grandison do you know you are just the person i wanted to see how fortunate that you should just arrive i was annoyed to find you were away i cannot tell you how much i was annoyed  your dear parents enquired glastonbury  are quite well said ferdinand perfectly well they will be so glad to see you so very glad they do so long to see you my dearest glastonbury you cannot imagine how they long to see you  i shall find them within think you enquired glastonbury  oh they are not here said ferdinand they have not yet arrived i expect them every day every day i expect them i have prepared everything for them everything what a wonderful autumn it has been  and glastonbury fell into the lure and talked about the weather for he was learned in the seasons and prophesied by many circumstances a hard winter while he was thus conversing ferdinand extracted from henrietta that glastonbury had not been in the gallery more than a very few minutes and he felt assured that nothing fatal had transpired all this time ferdinand was reviewing his painful situation with desperate rapidity and prescience all that he aspired to now was that henrietta should quit armine in as happy ignorance as she had arrived as for glastonbury ferdinand cared not what he might suspect or ultimately discover these were future evils that subsided into insignificance compared with any discovery on the part of miss temple  comparatively composed ferdinand now suggested to henrietta to quit her drawing which indeed was so advanced that it might be finished at ducie and never leaving her side and watching every look and hanging on every accent of his old tutor he even ventured to suggest that they should visit the tower the proposal he thought might lull any suspicion that might have been excited on the part of miss temple glastonbury expressed his gratification at the suggestion and they quitted the gallery and entered the avenue of beech trees  i have heard so much of your tower mr glastonbury said miss temple i am sensible i assure you of the honour of being admitted  the extreme delicacy that was a characteristic of glastonbury preserved ferdinand armine from the dreaded danger it never for an instant entered glastonburys mind that henrietta was not miss grandihe thought it a little extraordinary indeed that she should arrive at armine only in the company of ferdinand but much might be allowed to plighted lovers besides there might be some female companion some aunt or cousin for aught he knew at the place it was only his parents that ferdinand had said had not yet arrived at all events he felt at this moment that ferdinand perhaps even because he was alone with his intended bride had no desire that any formal introduction or congratulations should take place and only pleased that the intended wife of his pupil should be one so beautiful so gifted and so gracious one apparently so worthy in every way of his choice and her lot glastonbury relapsed into his accustomed ease and simplicity and exerted himself to amuse the young lady with whom he had become so unexpectedly acquainted and with whom in all probability it was his destiny in future to be so intimate as for henrietta nothing had occurred in any way to give rise to the slightest suspicion in her mind the agitation of ferdinand at this unexpected meeting between his tutor and his betrothed was in every respect natural their engagement as she knew was at present a secret to all and although under such circumstances she herself at first was disposed not to feel very much at her ease still she was so well acquainted with mr glastonbury from report and he was so unlike the common characters of the censorious world that she was from the first far less annoyed than she otherwise would have been and soon regained her usual composure and was even gratified and amused with the adventure  a load however fell from the heart of ferdinand when he and his beloved bade glastonbury a good afternoon this accidental and almost fatal interview terribly reminded him of his difficult and dangerous position it seemed the commencement of a series of misconceptions mortifications and misfortunes which it was absolutely necessary to prevent by instantly arresting them with the utmost energy and decision it was bitter to quit armine and all his joys but in truth the arrival of his family was very doubtful and until the confession of his real situation was made every day might bring some disastrous discovery some ominous clouds in the horizon formed a capital excuse for hurrying henrietta off to ducie they quitted armine at an unusually early hour as they drove along ferdinand revolved in his mind the adventure of the morning and endeavoured to stimulate himself to the exertion of instantly repairing to bath but he had not courage to confide his purpose to henrietta when however they arrived at ducie they were welcomed with intelligence which rendered the decision on his part absolutely necessary but we will reserve this for the next chapter     chapter v       which contains something very unexpected  miss temple had run up stairs to take off her bonnet ferdinand stood before the wood fire in the salon its clear fragrant flame was agreeable after the cloudy sky of their somewhat chill drive he was musing over the charms of his henrietta and longing for her reappearance when she entered but her entrance filled him with alarm she was pale her lips nearly as white as her forehead an expression of dread was impressed on her agitated countenance ere he could speak she held forth her hand to his extended grasp it was cold it trembled  good god you are ill he exclaimed no she faintly murmured not ill and then she paused as if stifled leaning down her head with eyes fixed upon the ground  the conscience of ferdinand pricked him had she heard  but he was reassured by her accents of kindness pardon me dearest she said i am agitated i shall soon be better  he held her hand with firmness while she leant upon his shoulder after a few minutes of harrowing silence she said in a smothered voice papa returns tomorrow  ferdinand turned as pale as she the blood fled to his heart his frame trembled his knees tottered his passive hand scarcely retained hers he could not speak all the possible results of this return flashed across his mind and presented themselves in terrible array to his alarmed imagination he could not meet mr temple that was out of the question some explanation must immediately and inevitably ensue and that must precipitate the fatal discovery the great object was to prevent any communication between mr temple and sir ratcliffe before ferdinand had broken his situation to his father how he now wished he had not postponed his departure for bath had he only quitted armine when first convinced of the hard necessity the harrowing future would now have been the past the impending scenes however dreadful would have ensued perhaps he might have been at ducie at this moment with a clear conscience and a frank purpose and with no difficulties to overcome but those which must necessarily arise from mr temples natural consideration for the welfare of his child these however difficult to combat seemed light in comparison with the perplexities of his involved situation ferdinand bore henrietta to a seat and hung over her in agitated silence which she ascribed only to his sympathy for her distress but which in truth was rather to be attributed to his own uncertain purpose and to the confusion of an invention which he now ransacked for desperate expedients  while he was thus revolving in his mind the course which he must now pursue he sat down on the ottoman on which her feet rested and pressed her hand to his lips while he summoned to his aid all the resources of his imagination it at length appeared to him that the only mode by which he could now gain time and secure himself from dangerous explanations was to involve henrietta in a secret engagement there was great difficulty he was aware in accomplishing this purpose miss temple was devoted to her father and though for a moment led away by the omnipotent influence of an irresistible passion to enter into a compact without the sanction of her parent her present agitation too clearly indicated her keen sense that she had not conducted herself towards him in her accustomed spirit of unswerving and immaculate duty that if not absolutely indelicate her behaviour must appear to him very inconsiderate very rash perhaps even unfeeling unfeeling what to that father that fond and widowed father of whom she was the only and cherished child all his goodness all his unceasing care all his anxiety his ready sympathy his watchfulness for her amusement her comfort her happiness his vigilance in her hours of sickness his pride in her beauty her accomplishments her affection the smiles and tears of long long years all passed before her till at last she released herself with a quick movement from the hold of ferdinand and clasping her hands together burst into a sigh so bitter so profound so full of anguish that ferdinand started from his seat  illustration page226jpg  henrietta he exclaimed my beloved henrietta  leave me she replied in a tone almost of sternness  he rose and walked up and down the room overpowered by contending emotions the severity of her voice that voice that hitherto had fallen upon his ear like the warble of a summer bird filled him with consternation the idea of having offended her of having seriously offended her of being to her to henrietta to henrietta that divinity to whom his idolatrous fancy clung with such rapturous devotion in whose very smiles and accents it is no exaggeration to say he lived and had his being the idea of being to her even for a transient moment an object of repugnance seemed something too terrible for thought too intolerable for existence all his troubles all his cares all his impending sorrows vanished into thin air compared with this unforeseen and sudden visitation oh what was future evil what was tomorrow pregnant as it might be with misery compared with the quick agony of the instant so long as she smiled every difficulty appeared surmountable so long as he could listen to her accents of tenderness there was no dispensation with which he could not struggle come what may throned in the palace of her heart he was a sovereign who might defy the world in arms but thrust from that great seat he was a fugitive without a hope an aim a desire dull timid exhausted brokenhearted  and she had bid him leave her leave her henrietta temple had bid him leave her did he live was this the same world in which a few hours back he breathed and blessed his god for breathing what had happened what strange event what miracle had occurred to work this awful this portentous change why if she had known all if she had suddenly shared that sharp and perpetual woe ever gnawing at his own secret heart even amid his joys if he had revealed to her if anyone had betrayed to her his distressing secret could she have said more why it was to shun this it was to spare himself this horrible catastrophe that he had involved himself in his agonising his inextricable difficulties inextricable they must be now for where now was the inspiration that before was to animate him to such great exploits how could he struggle any longer with his fate how could he now carve out a destiny all that remained for him now was to die and in the madness of his sensations death seemed to him the most desirable consummation  the temper of a lover is exquisitely sensitive mortified and miserable at any other time ferdinand in a fit of harassed love might have instantly quitted the presence of a mistress who had treated him with such unexpected and such undeserved harshness but the thought of the morrow the mournful conviction that this was the last opportunity for their undisturbed communion the recollection that at all events their temporary separation was impending all these considerations had checked his first impulse besides it must not be concealed that more than once it occurred to him that it was utterly impossible to permit henrietta to meet her father in her present mood with her determined spirit and strong emotions and her difficulty of concealing her feelings smarting too under the consciousness of having parted with ferdinand in anger and of having treated him with injustice and therefore doubly anxious to bring affairs to a crisis a scene in all probability would instantly ensue and ferdinand recoiled at present from the consequences of any explanations  unhappy ferdinand it seemed to him that he had never known misery before he wrung his hands in despair his mind seemed to desert him suddenly he stopped he looked at henrietta her face was still pale her eyes fixed upon the decaying embers of the fire her attitude unchanged either she was unconscious of his presence or she did not choose to recognise it what were her thoughts  still of her father perhaps she contrasted that fond and faithful friend of her existence to whom she owed such an incalculable debt of gratitude with the acquaintance of the hour to whom in a moment of insanity she had pledged the love that could alone repay it perhaps in the spirit of selftorment she conjured up against this too successful stranger all the menacing spectres of suspicion distrust and deceit recalled to her recollection the too just and too frequent tales of mans impurity and ingratitude and tortured herself by her own apparition the merited victim of his harshness his neglect or his desertion and when she had at the same time both shocked and alarmed her fancy by these distressful and degrading images exhausted by these imaginary vexations and eager for consolation in her dark despondency she may have recurred to the yet innocent cause of her sorrow and apprehension and perhaps accused herself of cruelty and injustice for visiting on his head the mere consequences of her own fitful and morbid temper she may have recalled his unvarying tenderness his unceasing admiration she may have recollected those impassioned accents that thrilled her heart those glances of rapturous affection that fixed her eye with fascination she may have conjured up that form over which of late she had mused in a trance of love that form bright with so much beauty beaming with so many graces adorned with so much intelligence and hallowed by every romantic association that could melt the heart or mould the spirit of woman she may have conjured up this form that was the god of her idolatry and rushed again to the altar in an ecstasy of devotion  the shades of evening were fast descending the curtains of the chamber were not closed the blaze of the fire had died away the flickering light fell upon the solemn countenance of henrietta temple now buried in the shade now transiently illumined by the fitful flame  on a sudden he advanced with a step too light even to be heard knelt at her side and not venturing to touch her hand pressed his lips to her arm and with streaming eyes and in a tone of plaintive tenderness murmured what have i done  she turned her eyes met his a wild expression of fear surprise delight played over hen countenance then bursting into tears she threw her arms round his neck and hid her face upon his breast  he did not disturb this effusion of her suppressed emotions his throbbing heart responded to her tumultuous soul at length when the strength of her passionate affections had somewhat decreased when the convulsive sobs had subsided into gentle sighs and ever and anon he felt the pressure of her sweet lips sealing her remorseful love and her charming repentance upon his bosom he dared to say oh my henrietta you did not doubt your ferdinand  dearest ferdinand you are too good too kind too faultless and i am very wicked  taking her hand and covering it with kisses he said in a distinct but very low voice now tell me why were you unhappy  papa sighed henrietta dearest papa that the day should come when i should grieve to meet him  and why should my darling grieve said ferdinand  i know not i ask myself what have i done what have i to fear it is no crime to love it may be a misfortune god knows that i have almost felt tonight that such it was but no i never will believe it can be either wrong or unhappy to love you  bless you for such sweet words replied ferdinand if my heart can make you happy felicity shall be your lot  it is my lot i am happy quite happy and grateful for my happiness  and your fatherour father let me call him she pressed his hand when he said thishe will be happy too  so i would hope  if the fulfilment of my duty can content him continued ferdinand mr temple shall not repent his soninlaw  oh do not call him mr temple call him father i love to hear you call him father  then what alarms my child  i hardly know said henrietta in a hesitating tone i thinki think it is the suddenness of all this he has gone he comes again he went he returns and all has happened so short a time too ferdinand it is a life to us to him i fear and she hid her face it is onlya fortnight  we have seen more of each other and known more of each other in this fortnight than we might have in an acquaintance which had continued a life  thats true thats very true we feel this ferdinand because we know it but papa will not feel like us we cannot expect him to feel like us he does not know my ferdinand as i know him papa too though the dearest kindest fondest father that ever lived though he has no thought but for my happiness and lives only for his daughter papa naturally is not so young as we are he is too what is called a man of the world he has seen a great deal he has formed his opinions of men and life we cannot expect that he will change them in your i mean in our favour men of the world are of the world worldly i do not think they are always right i do not myself believe in their infallibility there is no person more clever and more judicious than papa no person is more considerate but there are characters so rare that men of the world do not admit them into their general calculations and such is yours ferdinand  here ferdinand seemed plunged in thought but he pressed her hand though he said nothing  he will think we have known each other too short a time continued miss temple he will be mortified perhaps alarmed when i inform him i am no longer his  then do not inform him said ferdinand  she started  let me inform him continued ferdinand giving another turn to his meaning and watching her countenance with an unfaltering eye  dearest ferdinand always prepared to bear every burthen exclaimed miss temple how generous and good you are no it would be better for me to speak first to my father my soul i will never have a secret from you and you i am sure will never have one from your henrietta this is the truth i do not repent the past i glory in it i am yours and i am proud to be yours were the past to be again acted i would not falter but i cannot conceal from myself that so far as my father is concerned i have not conducted myself towards him with frankness with respect or with kindness there is no fault in loving you even were he to regret he could not blame such an occurrence but he will regret he will blame he has a right both to regret and blame my doing more than love youmy engagementwithout his advice his sanction his knowledge or even his suspicion  you take too refined a view of our situation replied ferdinand why should you not spare your father the pain of such a communication if painful it would be what has passed is between ourselves and ought to be between ourselves if i request his permission to offer you my hand and he yields his consent is not that ceremony enough  i have never concealed anything from papa said henrietta but i will be guided by you  leave then all to me said ferdinand be guided but by the judgment of your own ferdinand my henrietta and believe me all will go right i will break this intelligence to your father so we will settle it he continued enquiringly  it shall be so  then arises the question said ferdinand when it would be most advisable for me to make the communication now your father henrietta who is a man of the world will of course expect that when i do make it i shall be prepared to speak definitely to him upon all matters of business he will think otherwise that i am trifling with him to go and request of a man like your father a shrewd experienced man of the world like mr temple permission to marry his daughter without showing to him that i am prepared with the means of maintaining a family is little short of madness he would be offended with me he would be prejudiced against me i must therefore settle something first with sir ratcliffe  much you know unfortunately i cannot offer your father but still sweet love there must at least be an appearance of providence and management we must not disgust your father with our union  oh how can he be disgusted  dear one this then is what i propose that as tomorrow we must comparatively be separated i should take advantage of the next few days and get to bath and bring affairs to some arrangement until my return i would advise you to say nothing to your father  how can i live under the same roof with him under such circumstances exclaimed miss temple how can i meet his eye how can i speak to him with the consciousness of a secret engagement with the recollection that all the time he is lavishing his affection upon me my heart is yearning for another and that while he is laying plans of future companionship i am meditating perhaps an eternal separation  sweet henrietta listen to me one moment suppose i had quitted you last night for bath merely for this purpose as indeed we had once thought of and that your father had arrived at ducie before i had returned to make my communication would you style your silence under such circumstances a secret engagement no no dear love this is an abuse of terms it would be a delicate consideration for a parents feelings  o ferdinand would we were united and had no cares  you would not consider our projected union a secret engagement if after passing tomorrow with your father you expected me on the next day to communicate to him our position is it any more a secret engagement because six or seven days are to elapse before this communication takes place instead of one my henrietta is indeed fighting with shadows  ferdinand i cannot reason like you but i feel unhappy when i think of this  dearest henrietta feel only that you are loved think darling the day will come when we shall smile at all these cares all will flow smoothly yet and we shall all yet live at armine mr temple and all  papa likes you so much too ferdinand i should be miserable if you offended him  which i certainly should do if i were not to speak to sir ratcliffe first  do you indeed think so  indeed i am certain  but cannot you write to sir ratcliffe ferdinand must you really go must we indeed be separated i cannot believe it it is inconceivable it is impossible i cannot endure it  it is indeed terrible said ferdinand this consideration alone reconciles me to the necessity i know my father well his only answer to a communication of this kind would be an immediate summons to his side now is it not better that this meeting should take place when we must necessarily be much less together than before than at a later period when we may perhaps be constant companions with the sanction of our parents  o ferdinand you reason i only feel  such an observation from ones mistress is rather a reproach than a compliment it was made in the present instance to a man whose principal characteristic was perhaps a too dangerous susceptibility a man of profound and violent passions yet of a most sweet and tender temper capable of deep reflection yet ever acting from the impulse of sentiment and ready at all times to sacrifice every consideration to his heart the prospect of separation from henrietta for however short a period was absolute agony to him he found difficulty in conceiving existence without the influence of her perpetual presence their parting even for the night was felt by him as an onerous deprivation the only process indeed that could at present prepare and console him for the impending sorrow would have been the frank indulgence of the feelings which it called forth yet behold him behold this unhappy victim of circumstances forced to deceive even for her happiness the being whom he idolised compelled at this hour of anguish to bridle his heart lest he should lose for a fatal instant his command over his head and while he was himself conscious that not in the wide world perhaps existed a man who was sacrificing more for his mistress obliged to endure even from her lips a remark which seemed to impute to him a deficiency of feeling and yet it was too much he covered his eyes with his hand and said in a low and broken voice alas my henrietta if you knew all you would not say this  my ferdinand she exclaimed touched by that tender and melancholy tone why what is this you weep what have i said what done dearest ferdinand do not do this and she threw herself on her knees before him and looked up into his face with scrutinising affection  he bent down his head and pressed his lips to her forehead o henrietta he exclaimed we have been so happy  and shall be so my own doubt not my word all will go right i am so sorry i am so miserable that i made you unhappy tonight i shall think of it when you are gone i shall remember how naughty i was it was so wicked so very very wicked and he was so good  gone what a dreadful word and shall we not be together tomorrow henrietta oh what a morrow think of me dearest do not let me for a moment escape from your memory  tell me exactly your road let me know exactly where you will be at every hour write to me on the road if it be only a line only a little word only his dear name only ferdinand  and how shall i write to you shall i direct to you here  henrietta looked perplexed papa opens the bag every morning and every morning you must write or i shall die ferdinand what is to be done  i will direct to you at the postoffice you must send for your letters  i tremble believe me it will be noticed it will look sososoclandestine  i will direct them to your maid she must be our confidante  ferdinand  tis only for a week  o ferdinand love teaches us strange things  my darling believe me it is wise and well think how desolate we should be without constant correspondence as for myself i shall write to you every hour and unless i hear from you as often i shall believe only in evil  let it be as you wish god knows my heart is pure i pretend no longer to regulate my destiny i am yours ferdinand be you responsible for all that affects my honour or my heart  a precious trust my henrietta and dearer to me than all the glory of my ancestors  the clock sounded eleven miss temple rose it is so late and we in darkness here what will they think ferdinand sweetest rouse the fire i ring the bell lights will come and then her voice faltered  and then echoed ferdinand he took up his guitar but he could not command his voice  tis your guitar said henrietta i am happy that it is left behind  the servant entered with lights drew the curtains renewed the fire arranged the room and withdrew  little knows he our misery said henrietta it seemed strange when i felt my own mind that there could be anything so calm and mechanical in the world  ferdinand was silent he felt that the hour of departure had indeed arrived yet he had not courage to move henrietta too did not speak she reclined on the sofa as it were exhausted and placed her handkerchief over her face ferdinand leant over the fire he was nearly tempted to give up his project confess all to his father by letter and await his decision then he conjured up the dreadful scenes at bath and then he remembered that at all events tomorrow he must not appear at ducie henrietta he at length said  a minute ferdinand yet a minute she exclaimed in an excited tone do not speak i am preparing myself  he remained in his leaning posture and in a few moments miss temple rose and said now ferdinand i am ready he looked round her countenance was quite pale but fixed and calm  let us embrace she said but let us say nothing  he pressed her to his arms she trembled he imprinted a thousand kisses on her cold lips she received them with no return then she said in a low voice let me leave the room first and giving him one kiss upon his forehead henrietta temple disappeared  when ferdinand with a sinking heart and a staggering step quitted ducie he found the night so dark that it was with extreme difficulty he traced or rather groped his way through the grove the absolute necessity of watching every step he took in some degree diverted his mind from his painful meditations the atmosphere of the wood was so close that he congratulated himself when he had gained its skirts but just as he was about to emerge upon the common and was looking forward to the light of some cottage as his guide in this gloomy wilderness a flash of lightning that seemed to cut the sky in twain and to descend like a flight of fiery steps from the highest heavens to the lowest earth revealed to him for a moment the whole broad bosom of the common and showed to him that nature tonight was as disordered and perturbed as his own heart a clap of thunder that might have been the herald of doomsday woke the cattle from their slumbers they began to moan and low to the rising wind and cluster under the trees that sent forth with their wailing branches sounds scarcely less dolorous and wild avoiding the woods and striking into the most open part of the country ferdinand watched the progress of the tempest  for the wind had now risen to such a height that the leaves and branches of the trees were carried about in vast whirls and eddies while the waters of the lake where in serener hours ferdinand was accustomed to bathe were lifted out of their bed and inundated the neighbouring settlements lights were now seen moving in the cottages and then the forked lightning pouring down at the same time from opposite quarters of the sky exposed with an awful distinctness and a fearful splendour the widespreading scene of danger and devastation  now descended the rain in such overwhelming torrents that it was as if a waterspout had burst and ferdinand gasped for breath beneath its oppressive power while the blaze of the variegated lightning the crash of the thunder and the roar of the wind all simultaneously in movement indicated the fulness of the storm succeeded then that strange lull that occurs in the heart of a tempest when the unruly and disordered elements pause as it were for breath and seem to concentrate their energies for an increased and final explosion it came at last and the very earth seemed to rock in the passage of the hurricane  exposed to all the awful chances of the storm one solitary being alone beheld them without terror the mind of ferdinand armine grew calm as nature became more disturbed he moralised amid the whirlwind he contrasted the present tumult and distraction with the sweet and beautiful serenity which the same scene had presented when a short time back he first beheld it his love too had commenced in stillness and in sunshine was it also to end in storm and in destruction     book iv     chapter i       which contains a loveletter  let us pause we have endeavoured to trace in the preceding portion of this history the development of that passion which is at once the principle and end of our existence that passion compared to whose delights all the other gratifications of our naturewealth and power and fame sink into insignificance and which nevertheless by the ineffable beneficence of our creator is open to his creatures of all conditions qualities and climes whatever be the lot of man however unfortunate however oppressed if he only love and be loved he must strike a balance in favour of existence for love can illumine the dark roof of poverty and can lighten the fetters of the slave  but if the most miserable position of humanity be tolerable with its support so also the most splendid situations of our life are wearisome without its inspiration the golden palace requires a mistress as magnificent and the fairest garden besides the song of birds and the breath of flowers calls for the sigh of sympathy it is at the foot of woman that we lay the laurels that without her smile would never have been gained it is her image that strings the lyre of the poet that animates our voice in the blaze of eloquent faction and guides our brain in the august toils of stately councils  but this passion so charming in its nature so equal in its dispensation so universal in its influence never assumes a power so vast or exerts an authority so captivating as when it is experienced for the first time then it is truly irresistible and enchanting fascinating and despotic and whatever may be the harsher feelings that life may develop there is no one however callous or constrained he may have become whose brow will not grow pensive at the memory of first love  the magic of first love is our ignorance that it can ever end it is the dark conviction that feelings the most ardent may yet grow cold and that emotions the most constant and confirmed are nevertheless liable to change that taints the feebler spell of our later passions though they may spring from a heart that has lost little of its original freshness and be offered to one infinitely more worthy of the devotion than was our first idol to gaze upon a face and to believe that for ever we must behold it with the same adoration that those eyes in whose light we live will for ever meet ours with mutual glances of rapture and devotedness to be conscious that all conversation with others sounds vapid and spiritless compared with the endless expression of our affection to feel our heart rise at the favoured voice and to believe that life must hereafter consist of a ramble through the world pressing but one fond hand and leaning but upon one faithful breast oh must this sweet credulity indeed be dissipated is there no hope for them so full of hope no pity for them so abounding with love  and can it be possible that the hour can ever arrive when the former votaries of a mutual passion so exquisite and engrossing can meet each other with indifference almost with unconsciousness and recall with an effort their vanished scenes of felicity that quick yet profound sympathy that ready yet boundless confidence all that charming abandonment of self and that vigilant and prescient fondness that anticipates all our wants and all our wishes it makes the heart ache but to picture such vicissitudes to the imagination they are images full of distress and misery and gloom the knowledge that such changes can occur flits over the mind like the thought of death obscuring all our gay fancies with its batlike wing and tainting the healthy atmosphere of our happiness with its venomous expirations it is not so much ruined cities that were once the capital glories of the world or mouldering temples breathing with oracles no more believed or arches of triumph which have forgotten the heroic name they were piled up to celebrate that fill the mind with half so mournful an expression of the instability of human fortunes as these sad spectacles of exhausted affections and as it were traditionary fragments of expired passion  the morning which broke sweet and soft and clear brought ferdinand with its first glimmer a letter from henrietta        henrietta to ferdinand  mine own i have not lain down the whole night what a terrible what an awful night to think that he was in the heart of that fearful storm what did what could you do how i longed to be with you and i could only watch the tempest from my window and strain my eyes at every flash of lightning in the vain hope that it might reveal him is he well is he unhurt until my messenger return i can imagine only evil how often i was on the point of sending out the household and yet i thought it must be useless and might displease him i knew not what to do i beat about my chamber like a silly bird in a cage tell me the truth my ferdinand conceal nothing do not think of moving today if you feel the least unwell send immediately for advice write to me one line only one line to tell me you are well i shall be in despair until i hear from you do not keep the messenger an instant he is on my pony he promises to return in a very very short time i pray for you as i prayed for you the whole long night that seemed as if it would never end god bless you my ferdinand write only one word to your own  henrietta        ferdinand to henrietta  sweetest dearest henrietta  i am quite well and love you if that could be more than ever darling to send to see after her ferdinand a wet jacket and i experienced no greater evil does not frighten me the storm was magnificent i would not have missed it for the world but i regret it now because my henrietta did not sleep sweetest love let me come on to you your page is inexorable he will not let me write another line god bless you my henrietta my beloved my matchless henrietta words cannot tell you how i love you how i dote upon you my darling thy  ferdinand        henrietta to ferdinand  no you must not come here it would be unwise it would be silly we could only be together a moment and though a moment with you is heaven i cannot endure again the agony of parting o ferdinand what has that separation not cost me pangs that i could not conceive any human misery could occasion my ferdinand may we some day be happy it seems to me now that happiness can never come again and yet i ought to be grateful that he was uninjured last night i dared not confess to you before what evils i anticipated do you know i was so foolish that i thought every flash of lightning must descend on your head i dare not now own how foolish i was god be praised that he is well but is he sure that he is quite well if you have the slightest cold dearest do not move postpone that journey on which all our hopes are fixed colds bring fever but you laugh at me you are a man and a soldier you laugh at a womans caution  ohl my ferdinand i am so selfish that i should not care if you were ill if i might only be your nurse what happiness what exquisite happiness would that be  do not be angry with your henrietta but i am nervous about concealing our engagement from papa what i have promised i will perform fear not that i will never deceive you no not even for your fancied benefit but i feel the burthen of this secrecy more than i can express more than i wish to express i do not like to say anything that can annoy you especially at this moment when i feel from my own heart how you must require all the support and solace of unbroken fondness i have such confidence in your judgment my ferdinand that i feel convinced you have acted wisely but come back as soon as you can i know it must be more than a week i know that that prospect was only held out by your affection days must elapse before you can reach bath and i know ferdinand i know your office is more difficult than you will confess but come back my own as soon as you can and write to me at the postoffice as you settled  if you are well as you say leave the farm directly the consciousness that you are so near makes me restless remember in a few hours papa will be here i wish to meet him with as much calmness as i can command  ferdinand i must bid you adieu my tears are too evident see they fall upon the page think of me always never let your henrietta be absent from your thoughts if you knew how desolate this house is your guitar is on the sofa a ghost of departed joy  farewell ferdinand i cannot write i cannot restrain my tears i know not what to do i almost wish papa would return though i dread to see him i feel the desolation of this house i am so accustomed to see you here  heaven be with you and guard over you and cherish you and bless you think always of me would that this pen could express the depth and devotion of my feelings  henrietta     chapter ii       which supposing the reader is interested in the      correspondence pursues it  dearest a thousand thousand thanks a thousand thousand blessings for your letter from armine dear dear armine where some day we shall be so happy it was such a darling letter so long so kind and so clear how could you for a moment fancy that your henrietta would not be able to decipher that dear dear handwriting always cross dearest your handwriting is so beautiful that i never shall find the slightest difficulty in making it out if your letters were crossed a thousand times besides to tell the truth i should rather like to experience a little difficulty in reading your letters for i read them so often over and over again till i get them by heart and it is such a delight every now and then to find out some new expression that escaped me in the first fever of perusal and then it is sure to be some darling word fonder than all the rest  oh my ferdinand how shall i express to you my love it seems to me now that i never loved you until this separation that i have never been half grateful enough to you for all your goodness it makes me weep to remember all the soft things you have said all the kind things you have done for me and to think that i have not conveyed to you at the time a tithe of my sense of all your gentle kindness you are so gentle ferdinand i think that is the greatest charm of your character my gentle gentle love so unlike all other persons that i have met with your voice is so sweet your manner so tender i am sure you have the kindest heart that ever existed and then it is a daring spirit too and that i love  be of good cheer my ferdinand all will go well i am full of hope and would be of joy if you were here and yet i am joyful too when i think of all your love i can sit for hours and recall the past it is so sweet when i received your dear letter from armine yesterday and knew indeed that you had gone i went and walked in our woods and sat down on the very bank we loved so and read your letter over and over again and then i thought of all you had said it is so strange i think i could repeat every word you have uttered since we first knew each other the morning that began so miserably wore away before i dreamed it could be noon  papa arrived about an hour before dinner so kind and good and why should he not be i was ashamed of myself afterwards for seeming surprised that he was the same as ever he asked me if your family had returned to armine i said that you had expected them daily then he asked me if i had seen you i said very often but that you had now gone to bath as their return had been prevented by the illness of a relative did i right in this i looked as unconcerned as i could when i spoke of you but my heart throbbed oh how it throbbed i hope however i did not change colour i think not for i had schooled myself for this conversation i knew it must ensue believe me ferdinand papa really likes you and is prepared to love you he spoke of you in a tone of genuine kindness i gave him your message about the shooting at armine that you regretted his unexpected departure had prevented you from speaking before but that it was at his entire command only that after ducie all you could hope was that the extent of the land might make up for the thinness of the game he was greatly pleased adieu all good angels guard over you i will write every day to the postoffice bath think of me very much your own faithful  henrietta   letter ii       henrietta to ferdinand  o ferdinand what heaven it is to think of you and to read your letters this morning brought me two the one from london and the few lines you wrote me as the mail stopped on the road do you know you will think me very ungrateful but those dear few lines i believe i must confess i prefer them even to your beautiful long letter it was so kind so tender so sweetly considerate so like my ferdinand to snatch the few minutes that should have been given to rest and food to write to his henrietta i love you for it a thousand times more than ever i hope you are really well i hope you tell me truth this is a great fatigue even for you it is worse than our mules that we once talked of does he recollect oh what joyous spirits my ferdinand was in that happy day i love him when he laughs and yet i think he won my heart with those pensive eyes of his  papa is most kind and suspects nothing yesterday i mentioned you first i took up your guitar and said to whom it belonged i thought it more natural not to be silent about you besides dearest papa really likes you and i am sure will love you very much when he knows all and it is such a pleasure to me to hear you praised and spoken of with kindness by those i love i have of course little to say about myself i visit my birds tend my flowers and pay particular attention to all those i remember that you admired or touched sometimes i whisper to them and tell them that you will soon return for indeed they seem to miss you and to droop their heads like their poor mistress oh my ferdinand shall we ever again meet shall i indeed ever again listen to that sweet voice and will it tell me again that it loves me with the very selfsame accents that ring even now in my fascinated ear  o ferdinand this love is a fever a fever of health i cannot sleep i can scarcely countenance my father at his meals i am wild and restless but i am happy happy in the consciousness of your fond devotion tomorrow i purpose visiting our farmhouse i think papa will shoot tomorrow my heart will throb i fancy when i see our porch god bless my own love the idol of his fond and happy  henrietta   letter iii       henrietta to ferdinand  dearest no letter since the few lines on the road but i suppose it was impossible tomorrow will bring me one i suppose from bath i know not why i tremble when i write that word all is well here papa most kind the same as ever he went a little on your land today a very little but it pleased me he has killed an armine hare oh what a morning have i spent so happy so sorrowful so full of tears and smiles i hardly know whether i laughed or wept most that dear dear farmhouse and then they all talked of you how they do love my ferdinand but so must everyone the poor woman has lost her heart to you i suspect and i am half inclined to be a little jealous she did so praise you so kind so gentle giving such little trouble and as i fear so much too generous exactly like my ferdinand but really this was unnecessary pardon me love but i am learning prudence  do you know i went into your room i contrived to ascend alone the good woman followed me but i was there alone a moment and and and what do you think i did i pressed my lips to your pillow i could not help it when i thought that his dear head had rested there so often and so lately i could not refrain from pressing my lips to that favoured restingplace and i am afraid i shed a tear besides  when mine own love receives this he will be at bath how i pray that you may find all your family well and happy i hope they will love me i already love them and dear dear armine i shall never have courage to go there again until your return it is night and i am writing this in my own room perhaps the hour may have its influence but i feel depressed oh that i were at your side this house is so desolate without you everything reminds me of the past my ferdinand how can i express to you what i feelthe affection the love the rapture the passionate joy with which your image inspires me i will not be miserable i will be grateful to heaven that i am loved by one so rare and gifted your portrait is before me i call it yours it is so like tis a great consolation my heart is with you think of me as i think of you awake or asleep my thoughts are alike yours and now i am going to pray for you thine own  henrietta      letter ix  my best beloved the week is long past but you say nothing of returning oh my ferdinand your henrietta is not happy i read your dear letters over and over again they ought to make me happy i feel in the consciousness of your affection that i ought to be the happiest person in the world and yet i know not why i am very depressed you say that all is going well but why do you not enter into detail there are difficulties i am prepared for them believe me my ferdinand that your henrietta can endure as well as enjoy your father he frowns upon our affection tell me tell me all only do not leave me in suspense i am entitled to your confidence ferdinand it makes me hate myself to think that i do not share your cares as well as your delights i am jealous of your sorrows ferdinand if i may not share them  do not let your brow be clouded when you read this i could kill myself if i thought i could increase your difficulties i love you god knows how i love you i will be patient and yet my ferdinand i feel wretched when i think that all is concealed from papa and my lips are sealed until you give me permission to open them  pray write to me and tell me really how affairs are be not afraid to tell your henrietta everything there is no misery so long as we love so long as your heart is mine there is nothing which i cannot face nothing which i am persuaded we cannot overcome god bless you ferdinand words cannot express my love henrietta   letter x  mine own i wrote to you yesterday a letter of complaints i am so sorry for your dear letter has come today and it is so kind so fond so affectionate that it makes me miserable that i should occasion you even a shade of annoyance dearest how i long to prove my love there is nothing that i would not do nothing that i would not endure to convince you of my devotion i will do all that you wish i will be calm i will be patient i will try to be content you say that you are sure all will go right but you tell me nothing what said your dear father your mother be not afraid to speak  you bid me tell you all that i am doing oh my ferdinand life is a blank without you i have seen no one i have spoken to no one save papa he is very kind and yet somehow or other i dread to be with him this house seems so desolate so very desolate it seems a deserted place since your departure a spot that some good genius has quitted and all the glory has gone i never care for my birds or flowers now they have lost their music and their sweetness and the woods i cannot walk in them and the garden reminds me only of the happy past i have never been to the farmhouse again i could not go now dearest ferdinand it would only make me weep i think only of the morning for it brings me your letters i feed upon them i live upon them they are my only joy and solace and yet but no complaints today no complaints dearest ferdinand let me only express my devoted love oh that my weak pen could express a tithe of my fond devotion ferdinand i love you with all my heart and all my soul and all my spirits strength i have no thought but for you i exist only on your idea write write tell me that you love me tell me that you are unchanged it is so long since i heard that voice so long since i beheld that fond soft eye pity me my ferdinand this is captivity a thousand thousand loves your devoted  henrietta   letter xi  ferdinand dearest ferdinand the post today has brought me no letter i cannot credit my senses i think the postmaster must have thought me mad no letter i could not believe his denial i was annoyed too at the expression of his countenance this mode of correspondence ferdinand i wish not to murmur but when i consented to this clandestine method of communication it was for a few days a few few days and then but i cannot write i am quite overwhelmed oh will tomorrow ever come  henrietta   letter xii  dearest ferdinand i wish to be calm your letter occasions me very serious uneasiness i quarrel not with its tone of affection it is fond very fond and there were moments when i could have melted over such expressions but ferdinand it is not candid why are we separated for a purpose is that purpose effected were i to judge only from your letters i should even suppose that you had not spoken to your father but that is of course impossible your father disapproves of our union i feel it i know it i was even prepared for it come then and speak to my father it is due to me not to leave him any more in the dark it will be better believe me for yourself that he should share our confidence papa is not a rich man but he loves his daughter let us make him our friend ah why did i ever conceal anything from one so kind and good in this moment of desolation i feel i keenly feel my folly my wickedness i have no one to speak to no one to console me this constant struggle to conceal my feelings will kill me it was painful when all was joy but now o ferdinand i can endure this life no longer my brain is weak my spirit perplexed and broken i will not say if you love but ferdinand if you pity me write and write definitely to your unhappy  henrietta      letter xviii  you tell me that in compliance with my wishes you will write definitely you tell me that circumstances have occurred since your arrival at bath of a very perplexing and annoying nature and that they retard that settlement with your father that you had projected and partly arranged that it is impossible to enter into detail in letters and assuring me of your love you add that you have been anxious to preserve me from sharing your anxiety o ferdinand what anxiety can you withhold like that you have occasioned me dearest dearest ferdinand i will i must still believe that you are faultless but believe me a want of candour in our situation and i believe in every situation is a want of common sense never conceal anything from your henrietta  i now take it for granted that your father has forbidden our union indeed this is the only conclusion that i can draw from your letter ferdinand i can bear this even this sustained by your affection i will trust to time to events to the kindness of my friends and to that overruling providence which will not desert affections so pure as ours to bring about sooner or later some happier result confident in your love i can live in solitude and devote myself to your memory i  o ferdinand kneel to your father kneel to your kind mother tell them all tell them how i love you how i will love them tell them your henrietta will have no thought but for their happiness tell them she will be as dutiful to them as she is devoted to you ask not for our union ask them only to permit you to cherish our acquaintance let them return to armine let them cultivate our friendship let them know papa let them know me let them know me as i am with all my faults i trust not worldly not selfish not quite insignificant not quite unprepared to act the part that awaits a member of their family either in its splendour or its proud humility and if not worthy of their son as who can be yet conscious deeply conscious of the value and blessing of his affection and prepared to prove it by the devotion of my being do this my ferdinand and happiness will yet come  but my gentle love on whatever course you may decide remember your henrietta i do not reproach you never will i reproach you but remember the situation in which you have placed me all my happy life i have never had a secret from my father and now i am involved in a private engagement and a clandestine correspondence be just to him be just to your henrietta return i beseech you on my knees return instantly to ducie reveal everything he will be kind and gracious he will be our best friend in his hand and bosom we shall find solace and support god bless you ferdinand all will yet go well mine own own love i smile amid my tears when i think that we shall so soon meet oh what misery can there be in this world if we may but share it together  thy fond thy faithful thy devoted  henrietta     chapter iii       containing the arrival at ducie of a distinguished guest  it was about three weeks after ferdinand armine had quitted ducie that mr temple entered the breakfastroom one morning with an open note in his hand and told henrietta to prepare for visitors as her old friend lady bellair had written to apprise him of her intention to rest the night at ducie on her way to the north  she brings with her also the most charming woman in the world added mr temple with a smile  i have little doubt lady bellair deems her companion so at present said miss temple whoever she may be but at any rate i shall be glad to see her ladyship who is certainly one of the most amusing women in the world  this announcement of the speedy arrival of lady bellair made some bustle in the household of ducie bower for her ladyship was in every respect a memorable character and the butler who had remembered her visits to mr temple before his residence at ducie very much interested the curiosity of his fellowservants by his intimations of her ladyships eccentricities  you will have to take care of the parrot mary said the butler and you susan must look after the page we shall all be well crossexamined as to the state of the establishment and so i advise you to be prepared her ladyship is a rum one and thats the truth  in due course of time a handsome travelling chariot emblazoned with a viscounts coronet and carrying on the seat behind a portly manservant and a ladys maid arrived at ducie they immediately descended and assisted the assembled household of the bower to disembark the contents of the chariot but mr temple and his daughter were too well acquainted with lady bellairs character to appear at this critical moment first came forth a stately dame of ample proportions and exceedingly magnificent attire being dressed in the extreme of gorgeous fashion and who after being landed on the marble steps was for some moments absorbed in the fluttering arrangement of her plumage smoothing her maroon pelisse shaking the golden riband of her emerald bonnet and adjusting the glittering pelerine of point device that shaded the fall of her broad but wellformed shoulders in one hand the stately dame lightly swung a bag that was worthy of holding the great seal itself so rich and so elaborate were its materials and embroidery and in the other she at length took a glass which was suspended from her neck by a chaincable of gold and glanced with a flashing eye as dark as her ebon curls and as brilliant as her wellrouged cheek at the surrounding scene  the green parrot in its sparkling cage followed next and then came forth the prettiest liveliest smallest bestdressed and stranger than all oldest little lady in the world lady bellair was of childlike stature and quite erect though ninety years of age the tasteful simplicity of her costume her little plain white silk bonnet her grey silk dress her apron her grey mittens and her cinderella shoes all admirably contrasted with the vast and flaunting splendour of her companion not less than her ladyships small yet exquisitely proportioned form her highlyfinished extremities and her keen sarcastic grey eye the expression of her countenance now however was somewhat serious an arrival was an important moment that required all her practised circumspection there was so much to arrange so much to remember and so much to observe  the portly servingman had advanced and taking his little mistress in his arms as he would a child had planted her on the steps and then her ladyships clear shrill and now rather fretful voice was heard  here wheres the butler i dont want you stupid addressing her own servant but the butler of the house misters butler what is his name mr twoshoes butler i cannot remember names oh you are there are you i dont want you how is your master how is your charming lady where is the parrot i dont want it wheres the lady why dont you answer why do you stare so miss temple no not miss temple the lady my lady my charming friend mrs floyd to be sure so why did not you say so before but she has got two names why dont you say both names my dear continued lady bellair addressing her travelling companion i dont know your name tell all these good people your name your two names i like people with two names tell them my dear tell them tell them your name mrs thingabob or whatever it is mrs thingabob twoshoes  mrs montgomery floyd though rather annoyed by this appeal still contrived to comply with the request in the most dignified manner and all the servants bowed to mrs montgomery floyd  to the great satisfaction of this stately dame lady bellair after scanning everything and everybody with the utmost scrutiny indicated some intention of entering when suddenly she turned round  man theres something wanting i had three things to take charge of the parrot and my charming friend that is only two there is a third what is it you dont know here you man who are you mr temples servant i knew your master when he was not as high as that cage what do you think of that continued her ladyship with a triumphant smile what do you laugh at sir did you ever see a woman ninety years old before that i would wager you have not what do i want i want something why do you tease me by not remembering what i want now i knew a gentleman who made his fortune by once remembering what a very great man wanted but then the great man was a minister of state i dare say if i were a minister of state instead of an old woman ninety years of age you would contrive somehow or other to find out what i wanted never mind never mind come my charming friend let me take your arm now i will introduce you to the prettiest the dearest the most innocent and charming lady in the world she is my greatest favourite she is always my favourite you are my favourite too but you are only my favourite for the moment i always have two favourites one for the moment and one that i never change and that is my sweet henrietta temple you see i can remember her name though i couldnt yours but you are a good creature a dear good soul though you live in a bad set my dear a very bad set indeed vulgar people my dear they may be rich but they have no ton this is a fine place stop stop lady bellair exclaimed stamping her little foot and shaking her little arm dont drive away i remember what it was gregory run gregory it is the page there was no room for him behind and i told him to lie under the seat poor dear boy he must be smothered i hope he is not dead oh there he is has miss temple got a page does her page wear a feather my page has not got a feather but he shall have one because he was not smothered here woman who are you the housemaid i thought so i always know a housemaid you shall take care of my page take him at once and give him some milk and water and page be very good and never leave this good young woman unless i send for you and woman good young woman perhaps you may find an old feather of miss temples page give it to this good little boy because he was not smothered     chapter iv       containing some account of the viscountess dowager      bellair  the viscountess dowager bellair was the last remaining link between the two centuries herself born of a noble family and distinguished both for her beauty and her wit she had reigned for a quarter of a century the favourite subject of sir joshua had flirted with lord carlisle and chatted with dr johnson but the most remarkable quality of her ladyships destiny was her preservation time that had rolled on nearly a century since her birth had spared alike her physical and mental powers she was almost as active in body and quite as lively in mind as when seventy years before she skipped in marylebone gardens or puzzled the gentlemen of the tuesday night club at mrs cornelys masquerades these wonderful seventy years indeed had passed to lady bellair like one of those very masked balls in which she had formerly sparkled she had lived in a perpetual crowd of strange and brilliant characters all that had been famous for beauty rank fashion wit genius had been gathered round her throne and at this very hour a fresh and admiring generation distinguished for these qualities cheerfully acknowledged her supremacy and paid to her their homage the heroes and heroines of her youth her middle life even of her old age had vanished brilliant orators profound statesmen inspired bards ripe scholars illustrious warriors beauties whose dazzling charms had turned the world mad choice spirits whose flying words or whose fanciful manners made every saloon smile or wonderall had disappeared she had witnessed revolutions in every country in the world she remembered brighton a fishingtown and manchester a village she had shared the pomp of nabobs and the profusion of loanmongers she had stimulated the early ambition of charles fox and had sympathised with the last aspirations of george canning she had been the confidant of the loves alike of byron and alfieri had worn mourning for general wolfe and given a festival to the duke of wellington had laughed with george selwyn and smiled at lord alvanley had known the first macaroni and the last dandy remembered the gunnings and introduced the sheridans but she herself was unchanged still restless for novelty still eager for amusement still anxiously watching the entrance on the stage of some new stream of characters and indefatigable in attracting the notice of everyone whose talents might contribute to her entertainment or whose attention might gratify her vanity and really when one recollected lady bellairs long career and witnessed at the same time her diminutive form and her unrivalled vitality he might almost be tempted to believe that if not absolutely immortal it was at least her strange destiny not so much vulgarly to die as to grow like the heroine of the fairy tale each year smaller and smaller       fine by degrees and beautifully less  until her ladyship might at length subside into airy nothingness and so rather vanish than expire  it was the fashion to say that her ladyship had no heart in most instances an unmeaning phrase in her case certainly an unjust one ninety years of experience had assuredly not been thrown away on a mind of remarkable acuteness but lady bellairs feelings were still quick and warm and could be even profound her fancy was so lively that her attention was soon engaged her taste so refined that her affection was not so easily obtained hence she acquired a character for caprice because she repented at leisure those first impressions which with her were irresistible for in truth lady bellair though she had nearly completed her century and had passed her whole life in the most artificial circles was the very creature of impulse her first homage she always declared was paid to talent her second to beauty her third to blood the favoured individual who might combine these three splendid qualifications was with lady bellair a nymph or a demigod as for mere wealth she really despised it though she liked her favourites to be rich  her knowledge of human nature which was considerable her acquaintance with human weaknesses which was unrivalled were not thrown away upon lady bellair her ladyships perception of character was fine and quick and nothing delighted her so much as making a person a tool capable where her heart was touched of the finest sympathy and the most generous actions where her feelings were not engaged she experienced no compunction in turning her companions to account or indeed sometimes in honouring them with her intimacy for that purpose but if you had the skill to detect her plots and the courage to make her aware of your consciousness of them you never displeased her and often gained her friendship for lady bellair had a fine taste for humour and when she chose to be candid an indulgence which was not rare with her she could dissect her own character and conduct with equal spirit and impartiality in her own instance it cannot be denied that she comprised the three great qualifications she so much prized for she was very witty had blood in her veins to use her own expression and was the prettiest woman in the world for her years for the rest though no person was more highly bred she could be very impertinent but if you treated her with servility she absolutely loathed you  lady bellair after the london season always spent two or three months at bath and then proceeded to her great grandsons the present viscounts seat in the north where she remained until london was again attractive part of her domestic diplomacy was employed each year during her bath visit in discovering some old friend or making some new acquaintance who would bear her in safety and save her harmless from all expenses and dangers of the road to northumberland and she displayed often in these arrangements talents which talleyrand might have envied during the present season mrs montgomery floyd the widow of a rich east indian whose intention it was to proceed to her estate in scotland at the end of the autumn had been presented to lady bellair by a friend well acquainted with her ladyships desired arrangements what an invaluable acquaintance at such a moment for lady bellair mrs montgomery floyd very rich and very anxious to be fashionable was intoxicated with the flattering condescension and anticipated companionship of lady bellair at first lady bellair had quietly suggested that they should travel together to northumberland mrs montgomery floyd was enchanted with the proposal then lady bellair regretted that her servant was very ill and that she must send her to town immediately in her own carriage and then mrs montgomery floyd insisted in spite of the offers of lady bellair that her ladyship should take a seat in her carriage and would not for an instant hear of lady bellair defraying under such circumstances any portion of the expense lady bellair held out to the dazzled vision of mrs montgomery floyd a brilliant perspective of the noble lords and wealthy squires whose splendid seats under the auspices of lady bellair they were to make their restingplaces during their progress and in time lady bellair who had a particular fancy for her own carriage proposed that her servants should travel in that of mrs montgomery floyd mrs montgomery floyd smiled a too willing assent it ended by mrs montgomery floyds servants travelling to lord bellairs where their mistress was to meet them in that ladys own carriage and lady bellair travelling in her own chariot with her own servants and mrs montgomery floyd defraying the expenditure of both expeditions     chapter v       in which lady bellair gives some account of some of her      friends  lady bellair really loved henrietta temple she was her prime and her permanent favourite and she was always lamenting that henrietta would not come and stay with her in london and marry a duke lady bellair was a great matchmaker when therefore she was welcomed by the fair mistress of ducie bower lady bellair was as genuine as she was profuse in her kind phrases my sweet sweet young friend she said as henrietta bowed her head and offered her lips to the little old lady it is something to have such a friend as you what old woman has such a sweet friend as i have now let me look at you it does my heart good to see you i feel younger you are handsomer than ever i declare you are why will you not come and stay with me and let me find you a husband there is the duke of derandale he is in love with you already for i do nothing but talk of you no you should not marry him he is not good enough he is not good enough he is not refined i love a duke but i love a duke that is refined more you shall marry lord fitzwarrene  he is my favourite he is worthy of you you laugh i love to see you laugh you are so fresh and innocent there is your worthy father talking to my friend mrs twoshoes a very good creature my love a very worthy soul but no ton i hate french words but what other can i use and she will wear gold chains which i detest you never wear gold chains i am sure the duke ofwould not have me so i came to you continued her ladyship returning the salutation of mr temple dont ask me if i am tired i am never tired there is nothing i hate so much as being asked whether i am well i am always well there i have brought you a charming friend give her your arm and you shall give me yours said the old lady smiling to henrietta we make a good contrast i like a good contrast but not an ugly one i cannot bear anything that is ugly unless it is a very ugly man indeed who is a genius and very fashionable i liked wilkes and i liked curran but they were famous the best company in the world when i was as young as you lady lavington and i always hunted in couples because she was tall and i was called the queen of the fairies pretty women my sweet child should never be alone not that i was very pretty but i was always with pretty women and at last the men began to think that i was pretty too  a superbly pretty place simpered the magnificent mrs montgomery floyd to mr temple and of all the sweetly pretty persons i ever met i assure you i think miss temple the most charming such a favourite too with lady bellair you know she calls miss temple her real favourite added the lady with a playful smile  the ladies were ushered to their apartments by henrietta for the hour of dinner was at hand and mrs montgomery floyd indicated some anxiety not to be hurried in her toilet indeed when she reappeared it might have been matter of marvel how she could have effected such a complete transformation in so short a period except a train she was splendid enough for a birthday at st jamess and wore so many brilliants that she glittered like a chandelier however as lady bellair loved a contrast this was perhaps not unfortunate for certainly her ladyship in her simple costume which had only been altered by the substitution of a cap that should have been immortalised by mieris or gerard douw afforded one not a little startling to her sumptuous fellowtraveller  your dinner is very good said lady bellair to mr temple i eat very little and very plainly but i hate a bad dinner it dissatisfies everybody else and they are all dull the best dinners now are a new mans i forget his name the man who is so very rich you never heard of him and she pointing with her fork to mrs montgomery knows nobody what is his name gregory what is the name of the gentleman i dine with so often the gentleman i send to when i have no other engagement and he always gives me a dinner but who never dines with me he is only rich and i hate people who are only rich but i must ask him next year i ask him to my evening parties mind i dont care about them but i will not have stupid people who are only rich at my dinners gregory what is his name  mr million de stockville my lady  yes that is the man good gregory you have no deer have you enquired her ladyship of mr temple i thought not i wish you had deer you should send a haunch in my name to mr million de stockville and that would be as good as a dinner to him if your neighbour the duke had received me i should have sent it from thence i will tell you what i will do i will write a note from this place to the duke and get him to do it for me he will do anything for me he loves me the duke and i love him but his wife hates me  and you have had a gay season in town this year lady bellair enquired miss temple my dear i always have a gay season what happiness softly exclaimed mrs montgomery floyd i think nothing is more delightful than gaiety  and how is our friend mr bonmot this year said mr temple  my dear bonmot is growing very old he tells the same stories over again and therefore i never see him i cannot bear wits that have run to seed i cannot ask bonmot to my dinners and i told him the reason why but i said i was at home every morning from two till six and that he might come then for he does not go out to evening parties and he is huffy and so we have quarrelled  poor mr bonmot said miss temple  my dear there is the most wonderful man in the world i forget his name but everybody is mad to have him he is quite the fashion i have him to my parties instead of bonmot and it is much better everybody has bonmot but my man is new and i love something new lady frederick berrington brought him to me do you know lady frederick berrington oh i forgot poor dear you are buried alive in the country i must introduce you to lady frederick she is charming she will taste you she will be your friend and you cannot have a better friend my dear for she is very pretty very witty and has got blood in her veins i wont introduce you to lady frederick continued lady bellair to mrs montgomery floyd she is not in your way i shall introduce you to lady splash and dashaway she is to be your friend  mrs montgomery floyd seemed consoled by the splendid future of being the friend of lady splash and dashaway and easily to endure with such a compensation the somewhat annoying remarks of her noble patroness  but as for bonmot continued lady bellair i will have nothing to do with him general faneville he is a dear good man and gives me dinners i love dinners i never dine at home except when i have company general faneville not only gives me dinners but lets me always choose my own party and he said to me the other day now lady bellair fix your day and name your party i said directly general anybody but bonmot you know bonmot is his particular friend  but surely that is cruel said henrietta temple smiling  i am cruel said lady bellair when i hate a person i am very cruel and i hate bonmot mr fox wrote me a copy of verses once and called me cruel fair but i was not cruel to him for i dearly loved charles fox and i love you and i love your father the first party your father ever was at was at my house there what do you think of that and i love my grandchildren i call them all my grandchildren i think greatgrandchildren sounds silly i am so happy that they have married so well my dear selina is a countess you shall be a countess too added lady bellair laughing i must see you a countess before i die mrs grenville is not a countess and is rather poor but they will be rich some day and grenville is a good name it sounds well that is a great thing i hate a name that does not sound well     chapter vi       containing a conversation not quite so amusing as the      last  in the evening henrietta amused her guests with music mrs montgomery floyd was enthusiastically fond of music and very proud of her intimate friendship with pasta oh you know her do you very well you shall bring her to my house she shall sing at all my parties i love music at my evenings but i never pay for it never if she will not come in the evening i will try to ask her to dinner once at least i do not like singers and tumblers at dinner but she is very fashionable and young men like her and what i want at my dinners are young men young men of very great fashion i rather want young men at my dinners i have some lord languid always comes to me and he is very fine you know very fine indeed he goes to very few places but he always comes to me mrs montgomery floyd quitted the piano and seated herself by mr temple mr temple was gallant and mrs montgomery floyd anxious to obtain the notice of a gentleman whom lady bellair had assured her was of the first ton her ladyship herself beckoned henrietta temple to join her on the sofa and taking her hand very affectionately explained to her all the tactics by which she intended to bringabout a match between her and lord fitzwarrene very much regretting at the same time that her dear grandson lord bellair was married for he after all was the only person worthy of her he would taste you my dear he would understand you dear bellair he is so very handsome and so very witty why did he go and marry and yet i love his wife do you know her oh she is charming so very pretty so very witty and such good blood in her veins i made the match why were you not in england if you had only come to england a year sooner you should have married bellair how provoking  but really dear lady bellair your grandson is very happy what more can you wish  well my dear it shall be lord fitzwarrene then i shall give a series of parties this year and ask lord fitzwarrene to every one not that it is very easy to get him my child there is nobody so difficult as lord fitzwarrene that is quite right men should always be difficult i cannot bear men who come and dine with you when you want them  what a charming place is ducie sighed mrs montgomery floyd to mr temple the country is so delightful  but you would not like to live in the country only said mr temple  ah you do not know me sighed the sentimental mrs montgomery floyd if you only knew how i love flowers i wish you could but see my conservatory in parklane  and how did you find bath this year lady bellair enquired miss temple  oh my dear i met a charming man there i forget his name but the most distinguished person i ever met so very handsome so very witty and with blood in his veins only i forget his name and it is a very good name too my dear addressing herself to mrs montgomery floyd tell me the name of my favourite  mrs montgomery floyd looked a little puzzled my great favourite exclaimed the irritated lady bellair rapping her fan against the sofa oh why do you not remember names i love people who remember names my favourite my bath favourite what is his name he is to dine with me in town what is the name of my bath favourite who is certainly to dine with me in town  do you mean captain armine enquired mrs montgomery floyd miss temple turned pale that is the man said lady bellair oh such a charming man you shall marry him my dear you shall not marry lord fitzwarrene  but you forget he is going to be married said mrs montgomery floyd  miss temple tried to rise but she could not she held down her head she felt the fever in her cheek is our engagement then so notorious she thought to herself  ah yes i forgot he was going to be married said lady bellair well then it must be lord fitzwarrene besides captain armine is not rich but he has got a very fine place though and i will go and stop there some day and besides he is over headandears in debt so they say however he is going to marry a very rich woman and so all will be right i like old families in decay to get round again  henrietta dreaded that her father should observe her confusion she had recourse to every art to prevent it dear ferdinand she thought to herself thy very rich wife will bring thee i fear but a poor dower ah would he were here  whom is captain armine going to marry enquired mr temple  oh a very proper person said lady bellair i forget her name miss twoshoes or something what is her name my dear  you mean miss grandison madam responded mrs montgomery floyd  to be sure miss grandison the great heiress the only one left of the grandisons i knew her grandfather he was my sons schoolfellow  captain armine is a near neighbour of ours said mr temple  oh you know him said lady bellair is not he charming  are you certain he is going to be married to miss grandison enquired mr temple  oh there is no doubt in the world said mrs montgomery floyd everything is quite settled my most particular friend lady julia harteville is to be one of the bridesmaids i have seen all the presents both the families are at bath at this very moment i saw the happy pair together every day they are related you know it is an excellent match for the armines have great estates mortgaged to the very last acre i have heard that sir ratcliffe armine has not a thousand a year he can call his own we are all so pleased added mrs montgomery floyd as if she were quite one of the family is it not delightful  they are to be married next month said lady bellair i did not quite make the match but i did something i love the grandisons because lord grandison was my sons friend fifty years ago  i never knew a person so pleased as lady armine is continued mrs montgomery floyd the truth is captain armine has been wild very wild indeed a little of a roue but then such a fine young man so very handsome so truly distinguished as lady bellair says what could you expect but he has sown his wild oats now they have been engaged these six months ever since he came from abroad he has been at bath all the time except for a fortnight or so when he went to his place to make the necessary preparations we all so missed him captain armine was quite the life of bath i am almost ashamed to repeat what was said of him added mrs montgomery floyd blushing through her rouge but they said every woman was in love with him  fortunate man said mr temple bowing but with a grave expression  and he says he is only going to marry because he is wearied of conquests continued mrs montgomery floyd how impertinent is it not but captain armine says such things he is quite a privileged person at bath  miss temple rose and left the room when the hour of general retirement had arrived she had not returned her maid brought a message that her mistress was not very well and offered her excuses for not again descending     chapter vii       in which mr temple pays a visit to his daughters      chamber  henrietta when she quitted the room never stopped until she had gained her own chamber she had no light but a straggling moonbeam revealed sufficient  she threw herself upon her bed choked with emotion she was incapable of thought a chaos of wild images flitted over her brain thus had she remained perchance an hour with scarcely selfconsciousness when her servant entered with a light to arrange her chamber and nearly shrieked when on turning round she beheld her mistress  this intrusion impressed upon miss temple the absolute necessity of some exertion if only to preserve herself at this moment from renewed interruptions she remembered where she was she called back with an effort some recollection of her guests and she sent that message to her father which we have already noticed then she was again alone how she wished at that moment that she might ever be alone that the form and shape of human being should no more cross her vision that she might remain in this dark chamber until she died there was no more joy for her her sun was set the lustre of her life was gone the lute had lost its tone the flower its perfume the bird its airy wing what a fleet as well as fatal tragedy how swift upon her improvidence had come her heartbreaking pang there was an end of faith for he was faithless there was an end of love for love had betrayed her there was an end of beauty for beauty had been her bane all that hitherto made life delightful all the fine emotions all the bright hopes and the rare accomplishments of our nature were dark delusions now cruel mockeries and false and cheating phantoms what humiliation what despair and he had seemed so true so pure so fond so gifted what could it be could it be that a few short weeks back this man had knelt to her had adored her and she had hung upon his accents and lived in the light of his enraptured eyes and pledged to him her heart dedicated to him her life devoted to him all her innocent and passionate affections worshipped him as an idol why what was life that it could bring upon its swift wing such dark such agonising vicissitudes as these it was not life it was frenzy  some one knocked gently at her door she did not answer she feigned sleep yet the door opened she felt though her eyes were shut and her back turned that there was a light in the room a tender step approached her bed it could be but one person that person whom she had herself deceived she knew it was her father  mr temple seated himself by her bedside he bent his head and pressed his lips upon her forehead in her desolation some one still loved her she could not resist the impulse she held forth her hand without opening her eyes her father held it clasped in his  henrietta he at length said in a tone of peculiar sweetness  oh do not speak my father do not speak you alone have cause to reproach me spare me spare your child  i came to console not to reproach said mr temple but if it please you i will not speak let me however remain  father we must speak it relieves me even to confess my indiscretion my fatal folly father i feel yet why i know not i feel that you know all  i know much my henrietta but i do not know all  and if you knew all you would not hate me  hate you my henrietta these are strange words to use to a father to a father i would add like me no one can love you henrietta as your father loves you yet speak to me not merely as a father speak to me as your earliest your best your fondest your most faithful friend  she pressed his hand but answer that she could not  henrietta dearest dearest henrietta answer me one question  i tremble sir  then we will speak tomorrow  oh no tonight tomorrow may never come there is no night for me i cannot sleep i should go mad if it were not for you i will speak i will answer any questions my conscience is quite clear except to you no one no power on earth or heaven can reproach me except my father  he never will but dearest tell me summon up your courage to meet my question are you engaged to this person  i was  positively engaged  long ere this i had supposed we should have claimed your sanction he left me only to speak to his father  this may be the idle tattle of women  no no said henrietta in a voice of deep melancholy my fears had foreseen this dark reality this week has been a week of terror to me and yet i hoped and hoped and hoped oh what a fool have i been  i know this person was your constant companion in my absence that you have corresponded with him has he written very recently  within two days  and his letters  have been of late most vague oh my father indeed indeed i have not conducted myself so ill as you perhaps imagine i shrunk from this secret engagement i opposed by every argument in my power this clandestine correspondence but it was only for a week a single week and reasons plausible and specious reasons were plentiful alas alas all is explained now all that was strange mysterious perplexed in his views and conduct and which when it crossed my mind i dismissed with contemptall is now too clear  henrietta he is unworthy of you  hush hush dear father an hour ago i loved him spare him if you only wish to spare me  cling to my heart my child a fathers love has comfort is it not so  i feel it is i feel calmer since you came and we have spoken i never can be happy again my spirit is quite broken and yet i feel i have a heart now which i thought i had not before you came dear dear father she said rising and putting her arms round mr temples neck and leaning on his bosom and speaking in a sweet yet very mournful voice henceforth your happiness shall be mine i will not disgrace you you shall not see me grieve i will atone i will endeavour to atone for my great sins for sins they were towards you  my child the time will come when we shall remember this bitterness only as a lesson but i know the human heart too well to endeavour to stem your sorrow now i only came to soothe it my blessing is upon you my child let us talk no more henrietta i will send your maid to you try to sleep try to compose yourself  these peopletomorrowwhat shall i do  leave all to me keep your chamber until they have gone you need appear no more  oh that no human being might again see me  hush that is not a wise wish be calm we shall yet be happy tomorrow we will talk and so good night my child good night my own henrietta  mr temple left the room he bade the maid go to her mistress in as calm a tone as if indeed her complaint had been only a headache and then he entered his own apartment over the mantelpiece was a portrait of his daughter gay and smiling as the spring the room was adorned with her drawings he drew the chair near the fire and gazed for some time abstracted upon the flame and then hid his weeping countenance in his hands he sobbed convulsively     chapter viii       in which glastonbury is very much astonished  it was a gusty autumnal night glastonbury sat alone in his tower every now and then the wind amid a chorus of groaning branches and hissing rain dashed against his window then its power seemed gradually lulled and perfect stillness succeeded until a low moan was heard again in the distance which gradually swelled into storm the countenance of the good old man was not so serene as usual occasionally his thoughts seemed to wander from the folio opened before him and he fell into fits of reverie which impressed upon his visage an expression rather of anxiety than study  the old man looked up to the portrait of the unhappy lady armine and heaved a deep sigh were his thoughts of her or of her child he closed his book he replaced it upon its shelf and taking from a cabinet an ancient crucifix of carved ivory he bent down before the image of his redeemer  even while he was buried in his devotions praying perchance for the soul of that sinning yet sainted lady whose memory was never absent from his thoughts or the prosperity of that family to whom he had dedicated his faithful life the noise of ascending footsteps was heard in the sudden stillness and immediately a loud knocking at the door of his outer chamber  surprised at this unaccustomed interruption glastonbury rose and enquired the object of his yet unseen visitor but on hearing a wellknown voice the door was instantly unbarred and ferdinand armine pale as a ghost and deluged to the skin appeared before him glastonbury ushered his guest into his cell replenished the fire retrimmed the lamp and placed ferdinand in his own easy seat  you are wet i fear thoroughly  it matters not said captain armine in a hollow voice  from bath enquired glastonbury  but his companion did not reply at length he said in a voice of utter wretchedness glastonbury you see before you the most miserable of human beings  the good father started  yes continued ferdinand this is the end of all your care all your affection all your hopes all your sacrifices it is over our house is fated my life draws to an end  speak my ferdinand said glastonbury for his pupil seemed to have relapsed into moody silence speak to your friend and father disburden your mind of the weight that presses on it life is never without hope and while this remains pointing to the crucifix never without consolation  i cannot speak i know not what to say my brain sinks under the effort it is a wild a complicated tale it relates to feelings with which you cannot sympathise thoughts that you cannot share o glastonbury there is no hope there is no solace  calm yourself my ferdinand not merely as your friend but as a priest of our holy church i call upon you to speak to me even to me the humblest of its ministers is given a power that can sustain the falling and make whole the broken in spirit speak and speak fearlessly nor shrink from exposing the very inmost recesses of your breast for i can sympathise with your passions be they even as wild as i believe them  ferdinand turned his eyes from the fire on which he was gazing and shot a scrutinising glance at his kind confessor but the countenance of glastonbury was placid though serious  you remember ferdinand at length murmured that we met we met unexpectedly some six weeks back  i have not forgotten it replied glastonbury  there was a lady ferdinand continued in a hesitating tone  whom i mistook for miss grandison observed glastonbury but who it turned out bore another name  you know it  i know all for her father has been here  where are they exclaimed ferdinand eagerly starting from his seat and seizing the hand of glastonbury only tell me where they are only tell me where henrietta is and you will save me glastonbury you will restore me to life to hope to heaven  i cannot said glastonbury shaking his head it is more than ten days ago that i saw this ladys father for a few brief and painful moments for what purpose your conscience may inform you from the unexpected interview between ourselves in the gallery my consequent misconception and the conversation which it occasioned i was not so unprepared for this interview with him as i otherwise might have been believe me ferdinand i was as tender to your conduct as was consistent with my duty to my god and to my neighbour  you betrayed me then said ferdinand  ferdinand said glastonbury reproachfully i trust that i am free from deceit of any kind in the present instance i had not even to communicate anything your own conduct had excited suspicion some visitors from bath to this gentleman and his family had revealed everything and in deference to the claims of an innocent lady i could not refuse to confirm what was no secret to the world in general what was already known to them in particular what was not even doubted and alas not dubitable  oh my father pardon me pardon me pardon the only disrespectful expression that ever escaped the lips of your ferdinand towards you most humbly do i ask your forgiveness but if you knew allgod  god my heart is breaking you have seen her glastonbury you have seen her was there ever on earth a being like her so beautiful so highlygifted with a heart as fresh as fragrant as the dawn of eden and that heart mine and all lost all gone and lost oh why am i alive he threw himself back in his chair and covered his face and wept  i would that deed or labour of mine could restore you both to peace said glastonbury with streaming eyes  so innocent so truly virtuous continued ferdinand it seemed to me i never knew what virtue was till i knew her so frank so generous i think i see her now with that dear smile of hers that never more may welcome me  my child i know not what to say i know not what advice to give i know not what even to wish your situation is so complicated so mysterious that it passes my comprehension there are others whose claims whose feelings should be considered you are not of course married  ferdinand shook his head  does miss grandison know all  nothing  your family  ferdinand shook his head again  what do you yourself wish what object are you aiming at what game have you yourself been playing i speak not in harshness but i really do not understand what you have been about if you have your grandfathers passions you have his brain too i did not ever suppose that you were infirm of purpose  i have only one wish only one object since i first saw henrietta my heart and resolution have never for an instant faltered and if i do not now succeed in them i am determined not to live  the god of all goodness have mercy on this distracted house exclaimed glastonbury as he piously lifted his hands to heaven  you went to bath to communicate this great change to your father he continued why did you not painful as the explanation must be to miss grandison the injustice of your conduct towards her is aggravated by delay  there were reasons said ferdinand reasons which i never intended anyone to know but now i have no secrets dear glastonbury even amid all this overwhelming misery my cheek burns when i confess to you that i have and have had for years private cares of my own of no slight nature  debts enquired glastonbury  debts replied ferdinand and considerable ones  poor child exclaimed glastonbury and this drove you to the marriage  to that every worldly consideration impelled me my heart was free then in fact i did not know i had a heart and i thought the marriage would make all happy but now so far as i am myself concerned oh i would sooner be the commonest peasant in this county with henrietta temple for the partner of my life than live at armine with all the splendour of my ancestors  honour be to them they were great men exclaimed glastonbury  i am their victim replied ferdinand i owe my ancestors nothing nay worse than nothing i owe them  hush hush said glastonbury if only for my sake ferdinand be silent  for yours then not for theirs  but why did you remain at bath enquired glastonbury  i had not been there more than a day or two when my principal creditor came down from town and menaced me he had a power of attorney from an usurer at malta and talked of applying to the horse guards the report that i was going to marry an heiress had kept these fellows quiet but the delay and my absence from bath had excited his suspicion instead therefore of coming to an immediate explanation with katherine brought about as i had intended by my coldness and neglect i was obliged to be constantly seen with her in public to prevent myself from being arrested yet i wrote to ducie daily i had confidence in my energy and skill i thought that henrietta might be for a moment annoyed or suspicious i thought however she would be supported by the fervour of my love i anticipated no other evil who could have supposed that these infernal visitors would have come at such a moment to this retired spot  and now is all known now enquired glastonbury  nothing replied ferdinand the difficulty of my position was so great that i was about to cut the knot by quitting bath and leaving a letter addressed to katherine confessing all but the sudden silence of henrietta drove me mad day after day elapsed two three four five six days and i heard nothing the moon was bright the mail was just going off i yielded to an irresistible impulse i bid adieu to no one i jumped in i was in london only ten minutes i dashed to ducie it was deserted an old woman told me the family had gone had utterly departed she knew not where but she thought for foreign parts i sank down i tottered to a seat in that hall where i had been so happy then it flashed across my mind that i might discover their course and pursue them i hurried to the nearest posting town i found out their route i lost it for ever at the next stage the clue was gone it was marketday and in a great city where horses are changed every minute there is so much confusion that my enquiries were utterly baffled and here i am mr glastonbury added ferdinand with a kind of mad smile i have travelled four days i have not slept a wink i have tasted no food but i have drunk i have drunk well here i am and i have half a mind to set fire to that accursed pile called armine castle for my funeral pyre  ferdinand you are not well said mr glastonbury grasping his hand you need rest you must retire indeed you must i must be obeyed my bed is yours  no let me go to my own room murmured ferdinand in a faint voice that room where my mother said the day would comeoh what did my mother say would there were only mothers love and then i should not be here or thus  i pray you my child rest here  no let us to the place for an hour i shall not sleep more than an hour i am off again directly the storm is over if it had not been for this cursed rain i should have caught them and yet perhaps they are in countries where there is no rain ah who would believe what happens in this world not i for one now give me your arm good glastonbury you are always the same you seem to me the only thing in the world that is unchanged  glastonbury with an air of great tenderness and anxiety led his former pupil down the stairs the weather was more calm there were some dark blue rifts in the black sky which revealed a star or two ferdinand said nothing in their progress to the place except once when he looked up to the sky and said as it were to himself she loved the stars  glastonbury had some difficulty in rousing the man and his wife who were the inmates of the place but it was not very late and fortunately they had not retired for the night lights were brought into lady armines drawingroom glastonbury led ferdinand to a sofa on which he rather permitted others to place him than seated himself he took no notice of anything that was going on but remained with his eyes open gazing feebly with a rather vacant air  then the good glastonbury looked to the arrangement of his sleepingroom drawing the curtains seeing that the bed was well aired and warmed and himself adding blocks to the wood fire which soon kindled nor did he forget to prepare with the aid of the good woman some hot potion that might soothe and comfort his stricken and exhausted charge who in this moment of distress and desolation had come as it were and thrown himself on the bosom of his earliest friend when all was arranged glastonbury descended to ferdinand whom he found in exactly the same position as that in which he left him he offered no resistance to the invitation of glastonbury to retire to his chamber he neither moved nor spoke and yet seemed aware of all they were doing glastonbury and the stout servingman bore him to his chamber relieved him from his wet garments and placed him in his earliest bed when glastonbury bade him good night ferdinand faintly pressed his hand but did not speak and it was remarkable that while he passively submitted to their undressing him and seemed incapable of affording them the slightest aid yet he thrust forth his hand to guard a lock of dark hair that was placed next to his heart     chapter ix       in which glastonbury finds that a serene temper does not      always bring a serene life  those quiet slumbers that the regular life and innocent heart of the good glastonbury generally ensured were sadly broken this night as he lay awake meditating over the distracted fortunes of the of armine house they seemed now to be most turbulent and clouded and that brilliant and happy future in which of late he had so fondly indulged offered nothing but gloom and disquietude nor was it the menaced disruption of those ties whose consummation was to restore the greatness and splendour of the family and all the pain and disappointment and mortification and misery that must be its consequence that alone made him sorrowful glastonbury had a reverence for that passion which sheds such a lustre over existence and is the pure and prolific source of much of our better conduct the time had been when he too had loved and with a religious sanctity worthy of his character and office he had been for a long life the silent and hopeless votary of a passion almost ideal yet happy though he never told his love and indeed although the unconscious mistress of his affections had been long removed from that world where his fidelity was almost her only comfort that passion had not waned and the feelings that had been inspired by her presence were now cherished by her memory his tender and romantic nature which his venerable grey hairs had neither dulled nor hardened made him deeply sympathise with his unhappy pupil the radiant image of henrietta temple too vividly impressed on his memory as it was rose up before him he recollected his joy that the chosen partner of his ferdinands bosom should be worthy of her destiny he thought of this fair creature perchance in solitude and sickness a prey to the most mortifying and miserable emotions with all her fine and generous feelings thrown back upon herself deeming herself deceived deserted outraged where she had looked for nothing but fidelity and fondness and support losing all confidence in the world and the worlds ways but recently so lively with expectation and airy with enjoyment and now aimless hopeless wretched perhaps brokenhearted the tears trickled down the pale cheek of glastonbury as he revolved in his mind these mournful thoughts and almost unconsciously he wrung his hands as he felt his utter want of power to remedy these sad and piteous circumstances yet he was not absolutely hopeless there was ever open to the pious glastonbury one perennial source of trust and consolation this was a fountain that was ever fresh and sweet and he took refuge from the worlds harsh courses and exhausting cares in its salutary flow and its refreshing shade when kneeling before his crucifix he commended the unhappy ferdinand and his family to the superintending care of a merciful omnipotence  the morning brought fresh anxieties glastonbury was at the place at an early hour and found ferdinand in a high state of fever he had not slept an instant was very excited talked of departing immediately and rambled in his discourse glastonbury blamed himself for having left him a moment and resolved to do so no more he endeavoured to soothe him assured him that if he would be calm all would yet go well that they would consult together what was best to be done and that he would make enquiries after the temple family in the meantime he despatched the servant for the most eminent physician of the county but as hours must necessarily elapse before his arrival the difficulty of keeping ferdinand still was very great talk he would and of nothing but henrietta it was really agonising to listen to his frantic appeals to glastonbury to exert himself to discover her abode yet glastonbury never left his side and with promises expressions of confidence and the sway of an affected calmness for in truth dear glastonbury was scarcely less agitated than his patient ferdinand was prevented from rising and the physician at length arrived  after examining ferdinand with whom he remained a very short space this gentleman invited glastonbury to descend and they left the patient in charge of a servant  this is a bad case said the physician  almighty god preserve him exclaimed the agitated glastonbury tell me the worst  where are sir ratcliffe and lady armine  at bath  they must be sent for instantly  is there any hope  there is hope that is all i shall now bleed him copiously and then blister but i can do little we must trust to nature i am afraid of the brain i cannot account for his state by his getting wet or his rapid travelling has he anything on his mind  much said glastonbury  the physician shook his head  it is a precious life said glastonbury seizing his arm my dear doctor you must not leave us  they returned to the bedchamber  captain armine said the physician taking his hand and seating himself on the bed you have a bad cold and some fever i think you should lose a little blood  can i leave armine today if i am bled enquired ferdinand eagerly for go i must  i would not move today said the physician  i must indeed i must mr glastonbury will tell you i must  if you set off early tomorrow you will get over as much ground in fourandtwenty hours as if you went this evening said the physician fixing the bandage on the arm as he spoke and nodding to mr glastonbury to prepare the basin  tomorrow morning said ferdinand  yes tomorrow said the physician opening his lancet  are you sure that i shall be able to set off tomorrow said ferdinand  quite said the physician opening the vein  the dark blood flowed sullenly the physician exchanged an anxious glance with glastonbury at length the arm was bandaged up a composing draught with which the physician had been prepared given to his patient and the doctor and glastonbury withdrew the former now left armine for three hours and glastonbury prepared himself for his painful office of communicating to the parents the imminent danger of their only child  never had a more difficult task devolved upon an individual than that which now fell to the lot of the good glastonbury in conducting the affairs of a family labouring under such remarkable misconceptions as to the position and views of its various members it immediately occurred to him that it was highly probable that miss grandison at such a crisis would choose to accompany the parents of her intended husband what incident under the present circumstances could be more awkward and more painful yet how to prevent its occurrence how crude to communicate the real state of such affairs at any time by letter how impossible at the moment he was preparing the parents for the alarming perhaps fatal illness of their child to enter on such subjects at all much more when the very revelation at a moment which required all their energy and promptitude would only be occasioning at bath scenes scarcely less distracting and disastrous than those occurring at armine it was clearly impossible to enter into any details at present and yet glastonbury while he penned the sorrowful lines and softened the sad communication with his sympathy added a somewhat sly postscript wherein he impressed upon lady armine the advisability for various reasons that she should only be accompanied by her husband     chapter x       in which ferdinand armine is much concerned  the contingency which glastonbury feared surely happened miss grandison insisted upon immediately rushing to her ferdinand and as the maiden aunt was still an invalid and was incapable of enduring the fatigues of a rapid and anxious journey she was left behind within a few hours of the receipt of glastonburys letter sir ratcliffe and lady armine and their niece were on their way they found letters from glastonbury in london which made them travel to armine even through the night  in spite of all his remedies the brain fever which the physician foresaw had occurred and when his family arrived the life of ferdinand was not only in danger but desperate it was impossible that even the parents could see their child and no one was allowed to enter his chamber but his nurse the physician and occasionally glastonbury for this name with others less familiar to the household sounded so often on the frenzied lips of the sufferer that it was recommended that glastonbury should often be at his bedside yet he must leave it to receive the wretched sir ratcliffe and his wife and their disconsolate companion never was so much unhappiness congregated together under one roof and yet perhaps glastonbury though the only one who retained the least command over himself was with his sad secret the most woebegone of the tribe  as for lady armine she sat without the door of her sons chamber the whole day and night clasping a crucifix in her hands and absorbed in silent prayer sir ratcliffe remained below prostrate the unhappy katherine in vain offered the consolation she herself so needed and would have wandered about that armine of which she had heard so much and where she was to have been so happy a forlorn and solitary being had it not been for the attentions of the considerate glastonbury who embraced every opportunity of being her companion his patience his heavenly resignation his pious hope his vigilant care his spiritual consolation occasionally even the gleams of agreeable converse with which he attempted to divert her mind consoled and maintained her how often did she look at his benignant countenance and not wonder that the armines were so attached to this engaging and devoted friend  for three days did the unhappy family expect in terrible anticipation that each moment would witness the last event in the life of their son his distracted voice caught too often the vigilant and agonised ear of his mother yet she gave no evidence of the pang except by clasping her crucifix with increased energy she had promised the physician that she would command herself that no sound should escape her lips and she rigidly fulfilled the contract on which she was permitted to remain  on the eve of the fourth day ferdinand who had never yet closed his eyes but who had become during the last twelve hours somewhat more composed fell into a slumber the physician lightly dropped the hand which he had scarcely ever quitted and stealing out of the room beckoned his finger pressed to his lips to lady armine to follow him assured by the symbol that the worst had not yet happened she followed the physician to the end of the gallery and he then told her that immediate danger was past  and now my dear madam said the physician to her you must breathe some fresh air oblige me by descending  lady armine no longer refused she repaired with a slow step to sir ratcliffe she leant upon her husbands breast as she murmured to him her hopes they went forth together katherine and glastonbury were in the garden the appearance of lady armine gave them hopes there was a faint smile on her face which needed not words to explain it katherine sprang forward and threw her arms round her aunts neck  he may be saved he may be saved whispered the mother for in this hushed house of impending death they had lost almost the power as well as the habit of speaking in any other tone  he sleeps said the physician all present danger is past  it is too great joy murmured katherine and glastonbury advanced and caught in his arms her insensible form     chapter xi       in which ferdinand begins to be a little troublesome  from the moment of this happy slumber ferdinand continued to improve each day the bulletin was more favourable until his progress though slow was declared certain and even relapse was no longer apprehended but his physician would not allow him to see any one of his family it was at night and during his slumbers that lady armine stole into his room to gaze upon her beloved child and if he moved in the slightest degree faithful to her promise and the injunction of the physician she instantly glided behind his curtain or a large indian screen which she had placed there purposely often indeed did she remain in this fond lurkingplace silent and trembling when her child was even awake listening to every breath and envying the nurse that might gaze on him undisturbed nor would she allow any sustenance that he was ordered to be prepared by any but her own fair fond hands and she brought it herself even to his door for ferdinand himself though his replies to the physician sufficiently attested the healthy calmness of his mind he indeed otherwise never spoke but lay on his bed without repining and seemingly plunged in mild and pensive abstraction at length one morning he enquired for glastonbury who with the sanction of the physician immediately attended him  when he met the eye of that faithful friend he tried to extend his hand it was so wan that glastonbury trembled while he touched it  i have given you much trouble he said in a faint voice  i think only of the happiness of your recovery said glastonbury  yes i am recovered murmured ferdinand it was not my wish  oh be grateful to god for this great mercy my ferdinand  you have heard nothing enquired ferdinand  glastonbury shook his head  fear not to speak i can struggle no more i am resigned i am very much changed  you will be happy dear ferdinand said glastonbury to whom this mood gave hopes  never he said in a more energetic tone never  there are so many that love you said glastonbury leading his thoughts to his family  love exclaimed ferdinand with a sigh and in a tone almost reproachful  your dear mother said glastonbury  yes my dear mother replied ferdinand musingly then in a quicker tone does she know of my illness did you write to them  she knows of it  she will be coming then i dread her coming i can bear to see no one you dear glastonbury you it is a consolation to see you because you have seen and here his voice faltered you have seenher  my ferdinand think only of your health and happiness believe me will yet be yours  if you could only find out where she is continued ferdinand and go to her yes my dear glastonbury good dear glastonbury go to her he added in an imploring tone she would believe you everyone believes you i cannot go i am powerless and if i went alas she would not believe me  it is my wish to do everything you desire said glastonbury i should be content to be ever labouring for your happiness but i can do nothing unless you are calm  i am calm i will be calm i will act entirely as you wish only i beseech you see her  on that head let us at present say no more replied glastonbury who feared that excitement might lead to relapse yet anxious to soothe him he added trust in my humble services ever and in the bounty of a merciful providence  i have had frightful dreams said ferdinand i thought i was in a farmhouse everything was so clear so vivid night after night she seemed to me sitting on this bed i touched her her hand was in mine it was so burning hot once oh once once i thought she had forgiven me  hush hush hush  no more we will speak of her no more when comes my mother  you may see her tomorrow or the day after  ah glastonbury she is here  she is  is she alone  your father is with her  my mother and my father it is well then after a minutes pause he added with some earnestness do not deceive me glastonbury see what deceit has brought me to are you sure that they are quite alone  there are none here but your dearest friends none whose presence should give you the slightest care  there is one said ferdinand  dear ferdinand let me now leave you or sit by your side in silence tomorrow you will see your mother  tomorrow ah tomorrow once to me tomorrow was brighter even than today he turned his back and spoke no more glastonbury glided out of the room     chapter xii       containing the intimation of a somewhat mysterious      adventure  it was absolutely necessary that lady armines interview with her son be confined merely to observations about his health any allusion to the past might not only produce a relapse of his fever but occasion explanations at all times most painful but at the present full of difficulty and danger it was therefore with feelings of no common anxiety that glastonbury prepared the mother for this first visit to her son and impressed upon her the absolute necessity of not making any allusion at present to miss grandison and especially to her presence in the house he even made for this purpose a sort of halfconfidant of the physician who in truth had heard enough during the fever to excite his suspicions but this is a class of men essentially discreet and it is well for few are the family secrets ultimately concealed from them  the interview occurred without any disagreeable results the next day ferdinand saw his father for a few minutes in a short time lady armine was established as nurse to her son sir ratcliffe easy in mind amused himself with his sports and glastonbury devoted himself to miss grandison the intimacy indeed between the tutor of ferdinand and his intended bride became daily more complete and glastonbury was almost her inseparable companion she found him a very interesting one he was the most agreeable guide amid all the haunts of armine and its neighbourhood and drove her delightfully in lady armines pony phaeton he could share too all her pursuits and open to her many new ones though time had stolen something of its force from the voice of adrian glastonbury it still was wondrous sweet his musical accomplishments were complete and he could guide the pencil or prepare the herbal and indite fair stanzas in his fine italian handwriting in a ladys album all his collections too were at miss grandisons service she handled with rising curiosity his medals copied his choice drawings and even began to study heraldry his interesting conversation his mild and benignant manners his captivating simplicity and the elegant purity of his mind secured her confidence and won her heart she loved him as a father and he soon exercised over her an influence almost irresistible  every morning as soon as he awoke every evening before he composed himself again for the nights repose ferdinand sent for glastonbury and always saw him alone at first he requested his mother to leave the room but lady armine who attributed these regular visits to a spiritual cause scarcely needed the expression of this desire his first questions to glastonbury were ever the same had he heard anything were there any letters he thought there might be a letter was he sure had he sent to bath to london for his letters when he was answered in the negative he usually dwelt no more upon the subject one morning he said to glastonbury i know katherine is in the house  miss grandison is here replied glastonbury  why dont they mention her is all known  nothing is known said glastonbury  why dont they mention her then are you sure all is not known  at my suggestion her name has not been mentioned i was unaware how you might receive the intelligence but the true cause of my suggestion is still a secret  i must see her said ferdinand i must speak to her  you can see her when you please replied glastonbury but i would not speak upon the great subject at present  but she is existing all this time under a delusion every day makes my conduct to her more infamous  miss grandison is a wise and most admirable young lady said glastonbury i love her from the bottom of my heart i would recommend no conduct that could injure her assuredly none that can disgrace you  dear glastonbury what shall i do  be silent the time will come when you may speak at present however anxious she may be to see you there are plausible reasons for your not meeting be patient my ferdinand  good glastonbury good dear glastonbury i am too quick and fretful pardon me dear friend you know not what i feel thank god you do not but my heart is broken  when glastonbury returned to the library he found sir ratcliffe playing with his dogs and miss grandison copying a drawing  how is ferdinand enquired the father  he mends daily replied glastonbury if only mayday were at hand instead of christmas he would soon be himself again but i dread the winter  and yet the sun shines said miss grandison  glastonbury went to the window and looked at the sky i think my dear lady we might almost venture upon our promised excursion to the abbey today such a day as this may not quickly be repeated we might take our sketchbook  it would be delightful said miss grandison but before i go i must pick some flowers for ferdinand so saying she sprang from her seat and ran out into the garden  kate is a sweet creature said sir ratcliffe to glastonbury ah my dear glastonbury you know not what happiness i experience in the thought that she will soon be my daughter  glastonbury could not refrain from sighing he took up the pencil and touched her drawing  do you know dear glastonbury resumed sir ratcliffe i had little hope in our late visitation i cannot say i had prepared myself for the worst but i anticipated it we have had so much unhappiness in our family that i could not persuade myself that the cup was not going to be dashed from our lips  god is merciful said glastonbury  you are his minister dear glastonbury and a worthy one i know not what we should have done without you in this awful trial but indeed what could i have done throughout life without you  let us hope that everything is for the best said glastonbury  and his mother his poor mother what would have become of her she never could have survived his loss as for myself i would have quitted england for ever and gone into a monastery  let us only remember that he lives said glastonbury  and that we shall soon all be happy said sir ratcliffe in a more animated tone the future is indeed full of solace but we must take care of him he is too rapid in his movements he has my fathers blood in him that is clear i never could well make out why he left bath so suddenly and rushed down in so strange a manner to this place  youth is impetuous said glastonbury  it was lucky you were here glastonbury  i thank god that i was said glastonbury earnestly then checking himself he added that i have been of any use  you are always of use what should we do without you i should long ago have sunk ah glastonbury god in his mercy sent you to us  see here said katherine entering her fair cheek glowing with animation only dahlias but they will look pretty and enliven his room oh that i might write him a little word and tell him i am here do not you think i might mr glastonbury  he will know that you are here today said glastonbury tomorrow  ah you always postpone it said miss grandison in a tone half playful half reproachful and yet it is selfish to murmur it is for his good that i bear this bereavement and that thought should console me heigho  sir ratcliffe stepped forward and kissed his niece glastonbury was busied on the drawing he turned away his face  sir ratcliffe took up his gun god bless you dear kate he said a pleasant drive and a choice sketch we shall meet at dinner  at dinner dear uncle and better sport than yesterday  ha ha said sir ratcliffe but armine is not like grandison if i were in the old preserves you should have no cause to jeer at my sportsmanship  miss grandisons good wishes were prophetic sir ratcliffe found excellent sport and returned home very late and in capital spirits it was the dinnerhour and yet katherine and glastonbury had not returned he was rather surprised the shades of evening were fast descending and the distant lawns of armine were already invisible the low moan of the rising wind might be just distinguished and the coming night promised to be raw and cloudy perhaps tempestuous sir ratcliffe stood before the crackling fire in the diningroom otherwise in darkness but the flame threw a bright yet glancing light upon the snyders so that the figures seemed really to move in the shifting shades the eye of the infuriate boar almost to emit sparks of rage and there wanted but the shouts of the huntsmen and the panting of the dogs to complete the tumult of the chase  just as sir ratcliffe was anticipating some mischance to his absent friends and was about to steal upon tiptoe to lady armine who was with ferdinand to consult her the practised ear of a man who lived much in the air caught the distant sound of wheels and he went out to welcome them  why you are late said sir ratcliffe as the phaeton approached the house all right i hope  he stepped forward to assist miss grandison the darkness of the evening prevented him from observing her swollen eyes and agitated countenance she sprang out of the carriage in silence and immediately ran up into her room as for glastonbury he only observed it was very cold and entered the house with sir ratcliffe  this fire is hearty said glastonbury warming himself before it you have had good sport i hope we are not to wait dinner for miss grandison sir ratcliffe she will not come down this evening she is not very well  not very well ah the cold i fear you have been imprudent in staying so late i must run and tell lady armine  oblige me i pray by not doing so said glastonbury miss grandison most particularly requested that she should not be disturbed  it was with some difficulty that glastonbury could contrive that miss grandisons wishes should be complied with but at length he succeeded in getting sir ratcliffe to sit down to dinner and affecting a cheerfulness which was far from his spirit the hour of ten at length arrived and glastonbury before retiring to his tower paid his evening visit to ferdinand     chapter xiii       in which   the  family  perplexities   rather   increase      than diminish  if ever there were a man who deserved a serene and happy life it was adrian glastonbury he had pursued a long career without injuring or offending a human being his character and conduct were alike spotless he was void of guile he had never told a falsehood never been entangled in the slightest deceit he was easy in his circumstances he had no relations to prey upon his purse or his feelings and though alone in the world was blessed with such a sweet and benignant temper gifted with so many resources and adorned with so many accomplishments that he appeared to be always employed amused and contented and yet by a strange contrariety of events it appeared that this excellent person was now placed in a situation which is generally the consequence of impetuous passions not very scrupulous in obtaining their ends that breast which heretofore would have shrunk from being analysed only from the refined modesty of its nature had now become the depository of terrible secrets the day could scarcely pass over without finding him in a position which rendered equivocation on his part almost a necessity while all the anxieties inseparable from pecuniary embarrassments were forced upon his attention and his feelings were racked from sympathy with individuals who were bound to him by no other tie but to whose welfare he felt himself engaged to sacrifice all his pursuits and devote all his time and labour and yet he did not murmur although he had scarcely hope to animate him in whatever light he viewed coming events they appeared ominous only of evil all that he aimed at now was to soothe and support and it was his unshaken confidence in providence that alone forbade him to despair  when he repaired to the place in the morning he found everything in confusion miss grandison was very unwell and lady armine frightened by the recent danger from which they had escaped very alarmed she could no longer conceal from ferdinand that his katherine was here and perhaps lady armine was somewhat surprised at the calmness with which her son received the intelligence but miss grandison was not only very unwell but very obstinate she would not leave her room but insisted that no medical advice should be called in lady armine protested supplicated adjured miss grandison appealed to mr glastonbury and glastonbury who was somewhat of a physician was called in and was obliged to assure lady armine that miss grandison was only suffering from a cold and only required repose a warm friendship subsisted between lady armine and her niece she had always been katherines favourite aunt and during the past year there had been urgent reasons why lady armine should have cherished this predisposition in her favour lady armine was a fascinating person and all her powers had been employed to obtain an influence over the heiress they had been quite successful miss grandison looked forward almost with as much pleasure to being lady armines daughter as her sons bride the intended motherinlaw was in turn as warmhearted as her niece was engaging and eventually lady armine loved katherine for herself alone  in a few days however miss grandison announced that she was quite recovered and lady armine again devoted her unbroken attention to her son who was now about to rise for the first time from his bed but although miss grandison was no longer an invalid it is quite certain that if the attention of the other members of the family had not been so entirely engrossed a very great change in her behaviour could not have escaped their notice her flowers and drawings seemed to have lost their relish her gaiety to have deserted her she passed a great portion of the morning in her room and although it was announced to her that ferdinand was aware of her being an inmate of the place and that in a day or two they might meet she scarcely evinced at this prospect of resuming his society so much gratification as might have been expected and though she daily took care that his chamber should still be provided with flowers it might have been remarked that the note she had been so anxious to send him was never written but how much under the commonest course of circumstances happens in all domestic circles that is never observed or never remarked till the observation is too late  at length the day arrived when lady armine invited her niece to visit her son miss grandison expressed her readiness to accompany her aunt but took an opportunity of requesting glastonbury to join them and all three proceeded to the chamber of the invalid  the white curtain of the room was drawn but though the light was softened the apartment was by no means obscure ferdinand was sitting in an easychair supported by pillows a black handkerchief was just twined round his forehead for his head had been shaved except a few curls on the side and front which looked stark and lustreless he was so thin and pale and his eyes and cheeks were so wan and hollow that it was scarcely credible that in so short a space of time a man could have become such a wreck when he saw katherine he involuntarily dropped his eyes but extended his hand to her with some effort of earnestness she was almost as pale as he but she took his hand it was so light and cold it felt so much like death that the tears stole down her cheek  you hardly know me katherine said ferdinand feebly this is good of you to visit a sick man  miss grandison could not reply and lady armine made an observation to break the awkward pause  and how do you like armine said ferdinand i wish i could be your guide but glastonbury is so kind  a hundred times miss grandison tried to reply to speak to make the commonest observation but it was in vain she grew paler every moment her lips moved but they sent forth no sound  kate is not well said lady armine she has been very unwell this visit she added in a whisper to ferdinand is a little too much for her  ferdinand sighed  mother he at length said you must ask katherine to come and sit here with you if indeed she will not feel the imprisonment  miss grandison turned in her chair and hid her face with her handkerchief  my sweet child said lady armine rising and kissing her this is too much for you you really must restrain yourself ferdinand will soon be himself again he will indeed  miss grandison sobbed aloud glastonbury was much distressed but ferdinand avoided catching his eye and yet at last ferdinand said with an effort and in a very kind voice dear kate come and sit by me  miss grandison went into hysterics ferdinand sprang from his chair and seized her hand lady armine tried to restrain her son glastonbury held the agitated katherine  for gods sake ferdinand be calm exclaimed lady armine this is most unfortunate dear dear katherine but she has such a heart all the women have in our family and none of the men tis so odd mr glastonbury water if you please that glass of water sal volatile where is the sal volatile my own own katherine pray pray restrain yourself ferdinand is here remember ferdinand is here and he will soon be well soon quite well believe me he is already quite another thing there drink that darling drink that you are better now  i am so foolish said miss grandison in a mournful voice i never can pardon myself for this let me go  glastonbury bore her out of the room lady armine turned to her son he was lying back in his chair his hands covering his eyes the mother stole gently to him and wiped tenderly his brow on which hung the light drops of perspiration occasioned by his recent exertion  we have done too much my own dear ferdinand yet who could have expected that dear girl would have been so affected glastonbury was indeed right in preventing you so long from meeting and yet it is a blessing to see that she has so fond a heart you are fortunate my ferdinand you will indeed be happy with her  ferdinand groaned  i shall never be happy he murmured  never happy my ferdinand oh you must not be so lowspirited think how much better you are think my ferdinand what a change there is for the better you will soon be well dearest and then my love you know you cannot help being happy  mother said ferdinand you are deceived you are all deceived ii  no ferdinand indeed we are not i am confident and i praise god for it that you are getting better every day but you have done too much that is the truth i will leave you now love and send the nurse for my presence excites you try to sleep love and lady armine rang the bell and quitted the room     chapter xiv       in which some light is thrown upon some circumstances which      were before rather mysterious  lady armine now proposed that the family should meet in ferdinands room after dinner but glastonbury whose opinion on most subjects generally prevailed scarcely approved of this suggestion it was therefore but once acted upon during the week that followed the scene described in our last chapter and on that evening miss grandison had so severe a headache that it was quite impossible for her to join the circle at length however ferdinand made his appearance below and established himself in the library it now therefore became absolutely necessary that miss grandison should steel her nerves to the altered state of her betrothed which had at first apparently so much affected her sensibility and by the united influence of habit and mr glastonbury it is astonishing what progress she made she even at last could so command her feelings that she apparently greatly contributed to his amusement she joined in the family concerts once even read to him  every morning too she brought him a flower and often offered him her arm and yet ferdinand could not resist observing a great difference in her behaviour towards him since he had last quitted her at bath far from conducting herself as he had nervously apprehended as if her claim to be his companion were irresistible her carriage on the contrary indicated the most retiring disposition she annoyed him with no expressions of fondness and listened to the kind words which he occasionally urged himself to bestow upon her with a sentiment of grave regard and placid silence which almost filled him with astonishment  one morning the weather being clear and fine ferdinand insisted that his mother who had as yet scarcely quitted his side should drive out with sir ratcliffe and as he would take no refusal lady armine agreed to comply the carriage was ordered was at the door and as lady armine bade him adieu ferdinand rose from his seat and took the arm of miss grandison who seemed on the point of retiring for glastonbury remained and therefore ferdinand was not without a companion  i will see you go off said ferdinand  adieu said lady armine take care of him dear kate and the phaeton was soon out of sight  it is more like may than january said ferdinand to his cousin i fancy i should like to walk a little  shall i send for mr glastonbury said katherine  not if my arm be not too heavy for you said ferdinand so they walked slowly on perhaps some fifty yards until they arrived at a gardenseat very near the rosetree whose flowers henrietta temple so much admired it had no flowers now but seemed as desolate as their unhappy loves  illustration page323jpg  a moments rest said ferdinand and sighed dear kate i wish to speak to you  miss grandison turned pale  i have something on my mind katherine of which i would endeavour to relieve myself  miss grandison did not reply but she trembled it concerns you katherine  still she was silent and expressed no astonishment at this strange address  if i were anything now but an object of pity a miserable and brokenhearted man continued ferdinand i might shrink from this communication i might delegate to another this office humiliating as it then might be to me painful as it must under any circumstances be to you but and here his voice faltered but i am far beyond the power of any mortification now the world and the worlds ways touch me no more there is a duty to fulfil i will fulfil it i have offended against you my sweet and gentle cousin grievously bitterly infamously offended  no no no murmured miss grandison  katherine i am unworthy of you i have deceived you it is neither for your honour nor your happiness that these ties which our friends anticipate should occur between us but katherine you are avenged  oh i want no vengeance muttered miss grandison her face pale as marble her eyes convulsively closed cease cease ferdinand this conversation is madness you will be ill again  no katherine i am calm fear not for me there is much to tell it must be told if only that you should not believe that i was a systematic villain or that my feelings were engaged to another when i breathed to you those vows  oh anything but that speak of anything but that  ferdinand took her hand  katherine listen to me i honour you my gentle cousin i admire i esteem you i could die content if i could but see you happy with your charms and virtues i thought that we might be happy my intentions were as sincere as my belief in our future felicity oh no dear katherine i could not trifle with so pure and gentle a bosom  have i accused you ferdinand  but you will when you know all  i do know all said miss grandison in a hollow voice  her hand fell from the weak and trembling grasp of her cousin  you do know all he at length exclaimed and can you knowing all live under the same roof with me can you see me can you listen to me is not my voice torture to you do you not hate and despise me  it is not my nature to hate anything least of all could i hate you  and could you knowing all still minister to my wants and watch my sad necessities this gentle arm of yours could you knowing all let me lean upon it this morning o katherine a happy lot be yours for you deserve one  ferdinand i have acted as duty religion and it may be some other considerations prompted me my feelings have not been so much considered that they need now be analysed  reproach me katherine i deserve your reproaches  mine may not be the only reproaches that you have deserved ferdinand but permit me to remark from me you have received none i pity you i sincerely pity you  glastonbury has told you said ferdinand  that communication is among the other good offices we owe him replied miss grandison  he told you said ferdinand enquiringly  all that it was necessary i should know for your honour or as some might think for my own happiness no more i would listen to no more i had no idle curiosity to gratify it is enough that your heart is anothers i seek not i wish not to know that persons name  i cannot mention it said ferdinand but there is no secret from you glastonbury mayshould tell all  amid the wretched she is not the least miserable said miss grandison  o katherine said ferdinand after a moments pause tell me that you do not hate me tell me that you pardon me tell me that you think me more mad than wicked  ferdinand said miss grandison i think we are both unfortunate  i am without hope said ferdinand but you katherine your life must still be bright and fair  i can never be happy ferdinand if you are not i am alone in the world your family are my only relations i cling to them your mother is my mother i love her with the passion of a child i looked upon our union only as the seal of that domestic feeling that had long bound us all my happiness now entirely depends upon your family theirs i feel is staked upon you it is the conviction of the total desolation that must occur if our estrangement be suddenly made known to them and you who are so impetuous decide upon any rash course in consequence that has induced me to sustain the painful part that i now uphold this is the reason that i would not reproach you ferdinand that i would not quarrel with you that i would not desert them in this hour of their affliction  katherine beloved katherine exclaimed the distracted ferdinand why did we ever part  no ferdinand let us not deceive ourselves for me that separation however fruitful at the present moment in mortification and unhappiness must not be considered altogether an event of unmingled misfortune in my opinion ferdinand it is better to be despised for a moment than to be neglected for a life  despised katherine for gods sake spare me for gods sake do not use such language despised katherine at this moment i declare most solemnly all that i feel is how thoroughly how infamously unworthy i am of you dearest katherine we cannot recall the past we cannot amend it but let me assure you that at this very hour there is no being on earth i more esteem more reverence than yourself  it is well ferdinand i would not willingly believe that your feelings towards me were otherwise than kind and generous but let us understand each other i shall remain at present under this roof do not misapprehend my views i seek not to recall your affections the past has proved to me that we are completely unfitted for each other i have not those dazzling qualities that could enchain a fiery brain like yours i know myself i know you and there is nothing that would fill me with more terror now than our anticipated union and now after this frank conversation let our future intercourse be cordial and unembarrassed let us remember we are kinsfolk the feelings between us should by nature be amiable no incident has occurred to disturb them for i have not injured or offended you and as for your conduct towards me from the bottom of my heart i pardon and forget it  katherine said ferdinand with streaming eyes kindest most generous of women my heart is too moved my spirit too broken to express what i feel we are kinsfolk let us be more you say my mother is your mother let me assert the privilege of that admission let me be a brother to you you shall find me if i live a faithful one     chapter xv       which leaves affairs in general in a scarcely more      satisfactory position than the former one  ferdinand felt much calmer in his mind after this conversation with his cousin her affectionate attention to him now instead of filling him as it did before with remorse was really a source of consolation if that be not too strong a phrase to describe the state of one so thoroughly wretched as captain armine for his terrible illness and impending death had not in the slightest degree allayed or affected his profound passion for henrietta temple her image unceasingly engaged his thoughts he still clung to the wild idea that she might yet be his but his health improved so slowly that there was faint hope of his speedily taking any steps to induce such a result all his enquiries after her and glastonbury at his suggestion had not been idle were quite fruitless he made no doubt that she had quitted england what might not happen far away from him and believing herself betrayed and deserted often when he brooded over these terrible contingencies he regretted his recovery  yet his family thanks to the considerate conduct of his admirable cousin were still contented and happy his slow convalescence was now their only source of anxiety they regretted the unfavourable season of the year they looked forward with hope to the genial influence of the coming spring that was to cure all their cares and yet they might well suspect when they watched his ever pensive and often suffering countenance that there were deeper causes than physical debility and bodily pain to account for that moody and woebegone expression alas how changed from that ferdinand armine so full of hope and courage and youth and beauty that had burst on their enraptured vision on his return from malta where was that gaiety now that made all eyes sparkle that vivacious spirit that kindled energy in every bosom how miserable to see him crawling about with a wretched stick with his thin pale face and tottering limbs and scarcely any other pursuit than to creep about the pleasaunce where when the day was fair his servant would place a campstool opposite the cedar tree where he had first beheld henrietta temple and there he would sit until the unkind winter breeze would make him shiver gazing on vacancy yet peopled to his minds eye with beautiful and fearful apparitions  and it is love it is the most delightful of human passions that can bring about such misery why will its true course never run smooth is there a spell over our heart that its finest emotions should lead only to despair when ferdinand armine in his reveries dwelt upon the past when he recalled the hour that he had first seen her her first glance the first sound of her voice his visit to ducie all the passionate scenes to which it led those sweet wanderings through its enchanted bowers those bright mornings so full of expectation that was never baulked those soft eyes so redolent of tenderness that could never cease when from the bright and glowing and gentle scenes his memory conjured up and all the transport and the thrill that surrounded them like an atmosphere of love he turned to his shattered and brokenhearted self the rigid heaven above and what seemed to his perhaps unwise and ungrateful spirit the mechanical sympathy and commonplace affection of his companions it was as if he had wakened from some too vivid and too glorious dream or as if he had fallen from some brighter and more favoured planet upon our cold dull earth  and yet it would seem the roof of armine place protected a family that might yield to few in the beauty and engaging qualities of its inmates their happy accomplishments their kind and cordial hearts and all were devoted to him it was on him alone the noble spirit of his father dwelt still with pride and joy it was to soothe and gratify him that his charming mother exerted all her graceful care and all her engaging gifts it was for him and his sake the generous heart of his cousin had submitted to mortification without a murmur or indulged her unhappiness only in solitude and it was for him that glastonbury exercised a devotion that might alone induce a man to think with complacency both of his species and himself but the heart the heart the jealous and despotic heart it rejects all substitutes it spurns all compromise and it will have its purpose or it will break     book v     chapter i       containing the appearance on our stage of a new and      important character  the marquis of montfort was the grandson of that nobleman who had been glastonburys earliest patron the old duke had been dead some years his son had succeeded to his title and digby that youth whom the reader may recollect was about the same age as ferdinand armine and was his companion during the happy week in london which preceded his first military visit to the mediterranean now bore the second title of the family  the young marquis was an excellent specimen of a class inferior in talents intelligence and accomplishments in public spirit and in private virtues to none in the world the english nobility his complete education had been carefully conducted and although his religious creed for it will be remembered he was a catholic had deprived him of the advantage of matriculating at an english university the zeal of an able and learned tutor and the resources of a german alma mater had afforded every opportunity for the development of his considerable talents nature had lavished upon him other gifts besides his distinguished intelligence and his amiable temper his personal beauty was remarkable and his natural grace was not less evident than his many acquired accomplishments  on quitting the university of bonn lord montfort had passed several years on the continent of europe and had visited and resided at most of its courts and capitals an admired and cherished guest for debarred at the period of our story from occupying the seat of his ancestors in the senate his native country offered no very urgent claims upon his presence he had ultimately fixed upon rome as his principal residence for he was devoted to the arts and in his palace were collected some of the rarest specimens of ancient and modern invention  at pisa lord montfort had made the acquaintance of mr temple who was residing in that city for the benefit of his daughters health who it was feared by her physicians was in a decline i say the acquaintance of mr temple for lord montfort was aware of the existence of his daughter only by the occasional mention of her name as miss temple was never seen the agreeable manners varied information and accomplished mind of mr temple had attracted and won the attention of the young nobleman who shrank in general from the travelling english and all their arrogant ignorance mr temple was in turn equally pleased with a companion alike refined amiable and enlightened and their acquaintance would have ripened into intimacy had not the illness of henrietta and her repugnance to see a third person and the unwillingness of her father that she should be alone offered in some degree a bar to its cultivation  yet henrietta was glad that her father had found a friend and was amused and impressed upon him not to think of her but to accept lord montforts invitations to his villa but mr temple invariably declined them  i am always uneasy when i am away from you dearest said mr temple i wish you would go about a little believe me it is not for myself that i make the suggestion but i am sure you would derive benefit from the exertion i wish you would go with me and see lord montforts villa there would be no one there but himself he would not in the least annoy you he is so quiet and he and i could stroll about and look at the busts and talk to each other you would hardly know he was present he is such a very quiet person  henrietta shook her head and mr temple could not urge the request  fate however had decided that lord montfort and henrietta temple should become acquainted she had more than once expressed a wish to see the campo santo it was almost the only wish that she had expressed since she left england her father pleased to find that anything could interest her was in the habit of reminding her of this desire and suggesting that she should gratify it but there was ever an excuse for procrastination when the hour of exertion came she would say with a faint smile not today dearest papa and then arranging her shawl as if even in this soft clime she shivered composed herself upon that sofa which now she scarcely ever quitted  and this was henrietta temple that gay and glorious being so full of graceful power and beautiful energy that seemed born for a throne and to command a nation of adoring subjects what are those political revolutions whose strange and mighty vicissitudes we are ever dilating on compared with the moral mutations that are passing daily under our own eye uprooting the hearts of families shattering to pieces domestic circles scattering to the winds the plans and prospects of a generation and blasting as with a mildew the ripening harvest of long cherished affection  it is here that i would be buried said henrietta temple  they were standing the father and the daughter in the campo santo she had been gayer that morning her father had seized a happy moment and she had gone forth to visit the dead  that vast and cloistered cemetery was silent and undisturbed not a human being was there save themselves and the keeper the sun shone brightly on the austere and ancient frescoes and henrietta stood opposite that beautiful sarcophagus that seemed prepared and fitting to receive her destined ashes  it is here that i would be buried said she  her father almost unconsciously turned his head to gaze upon the countenance of his daughter to see if there were indeed reason that she should talk of death that countenance was changed since the moment we first feebly attempted to picture it that flashing eye had lost something of its brilliancy that superb form something of its roundness and its staglike state the crimson glory of that mantling cheek had faded like the fading eve and yet it might be thought it might be suffering perhaps the anticipation of approaching death and as it were the imaginary contact with a serener existence but certainly there was a more spiritual expression diffused over the whole appearance of henrietta temple and which by many might be preferred even to that more lively and glowing beauty which in her happier hours made her the very queen of flowers and sunshine  it is strange dear papa she continued that my first visit should be to a cemetery  at this moment their attention was attracted by the sound of the distant gates of the cemetery opening and several persons soon entered this party consisted of some of the authorities of the city and some porters bearing on a slab of verd antique a magnificent cinerary vase that was about to be placed in the campo in reply to his enquiries mr temple learned that the vase had been recently excavated in catania and that it had been purchased and presented to the campo by the marquis of montfort henrietta would have hurried her father away but with all her haste they had not reached the gates before lord montfort appeared  mr temple found it impossible although henrietta pressed his arm in token of disapprobation not to present lord montfort to his daughter he then admired his lordships urn and then his lordship requested that he might have the pleasure of showing it to them himself they turned lord montfort explained to them its rarity and pointed out to them its beauty his voice was soft and low his manner simple but rather reserved while he paid that deference to henrietta which her sex demanded he addressed himself chiefly to her father she was not half so much annoyed as she had imagined she agreed with her father that he was a very quiet man she was even a little interested by his conversation which was refined and elegant and she was pleased that he did not seem to require her to play any part in the discourse but appeared quite content in being her fathers friend lord montfort seemed to be attached to her father and to appreciate him and this was always a recommendation to henrietta temple  the cinerary urn led to a little controversy between mr temple and his friend and lord montfort wished that mr temple would some day call on him at his house in the lung arno and he would show him some specimens which he thought might influence his opinion i hardly dare to ask you to come now said his lordship looking at miss temple and yet miss temple might like to rest  it was evident to henrietta that her father would be pleased to go and yet that he was about to refuse for her sake she could not bear that he should be deprived of so much and such refined amusement and be doomed to an uninteresting morning at home merely to gratify her humour she tried to speak but could not at first command her voice at length she expressed her wish that mr temple should avail himself of the invitation lord montfort bowed lowly mr temple seemed gratified and they all turned together and quitted the cemetery  as they walked along to the house conversation did not flag lord montfort expressed his admiration of pisa silence and art are two great charms said his lordship  at length they arrived at his palace a venerable italian received them they passed through a vast hall in which were statues ascended a magnificent double staircase and entered a range of saloons one of them was furnished with more attention to comfort than an italian cares for and herein was the cabinet of urns and vases his lordship had mentioned  this is little more than a barrack said lord montfort but i can find a sofa for miss temple so saying he arranged with great care the cushions of the couch and when she seated herself placed a footstool near her i wish you would allow me some day to welcome you at rome said the young marquis it is there that i indeed reside  lord montfort and mr temple examined the contents of the cabinet there was one vase which mr temple greatly admired for the elegance of its form his host immediately brought it and placed it on a small pedestal near miss temple yet he scarcely addressed himself to her and henrietta experienced none of that troublesome attention from which in the present state of her health and mind she shrank while mr temple was interested with his pursuit lord montfort went to a small cabinet opposite and brought forth a curious casket of antique gems perhaps he said placing it by miss temple the contents of this casket might amuse you and he walked away to her father  in the course of an hour a servant brought in some fruits and wine  the grapes are from my villa said lord montfort i ventured to order them because i have heard their salutary effects have been marvellous besides at this season even in italy they are rare at least \ you cannot accuse me of prescribing a disagreeable remedy he added with a slight smile as he handed a plate to miss temple she moved to receive them her cushions slipped from behind her lord montfort immediately arranged them with skill and care he was so kind that she really wished to thank him but before she could utter a word he was again conversing with her father  at length mr temple indicated his intention to retire and spoke to his daughter  this has been a great exertion for you henrietta he said this has indeed been a busy day  i am not wearied and we have been much pleased it was the firmest tone in which she had spoken for a long time there was something in her manner which recalled to mr temple her vanished animation the affectionate father looked for a moment happy the sweet music of these simple words dwelt on his ear  he went forward and assisted henrietta to rise she closed the casket with care and delivered it herself to her considerate host mr temple bade him adieu henrietta bowed and nearly extended her hand lord montfort attended them to the gate a carriage was waiting there  ah we have kept your lordship at home said mr temple  i took the liberty of ordering the carriage for miss temple he replied i feel a little responsible for her kind exertion today     chapter ii       in which lord montfort contrives that miss temple should be      left alone  and how do you like my friend henrietta said mr temple as they drove home  i like your friend much papa he is quite as quiet as you said he is almost the only person i have seen since i quitted england who has not jarred my nerves i felt quite sorry that i had so long prevented you both from cultivating each others acquaintance he does not interfere with me in the least  i wish i had asked him to look in upon us in the evening said mr temple rather enquiringly  not today said henrietta another day dearest papa  the next day lord montfort sent a note to mr temple to enquire after his daughter and to impress upon him the importance of her eating his grapes his servant left a basket the rest of the note was about cinerary urns mr temple while he thanked him assured him of the pleasure it would give both his daughter and himself to see him in the evening  this was the first invitation to his house that mr temple had ventured to give him though they had now known each other some time  in the evening lord montfort appeared henrietta was lying on her sofa and her father would not let her rise lord montfort had brought mr temple some english journals which he had received from leghorn the gentlemen talked a little on foreign politics and discussed the character of several of the most celebrated foreign ministers lord montfort gave an account of his visit to prince esterhazy henrietta was amused german politics and society led to german literature lord montfort on this subject seemed completely informed henrietta could not refrain from joining in a conversation for which she was fully qualified she happened to deplore her want of books lord montfort had a library but it was at rome no matter it seemed that he thought nothing of sending to rome he made a note very quietly of some books that henrietta expressed a wish to see and begged that mr temple would send the memorandum to his servant  but surely tomorrow will do said mr temple rome is too far to send to this evening  that is an additional reason for instant departure said his lordship calmly  mr temple summoned a servant  send this note to my house said his lordship my courier will bring us the books in four days he added turning to miss temple i am sorry you should have to wait but at pisa i really have nothing  from this day lord montfort passed every evening at mr temples house his arrival never disturbed miss temple she remained on the sofa if she spoke to him he was always ready to converse with her yet he never obtruded his society he seemed perfectly contented with the company of her father yet with all this calmness and reserve there was no air of affected indifference no intolerable nonchalance he was always attentive always considerate often kind however apparently engaged with her father it seemed that his vigilance anticipated all her wants if she moved he was at her side if she required anything it would appear that he read her thoughts for it was always offered she found her sofa arranged as if by magic and if a shawl were for a moment missing lord montfort always knew where it had been placed in the meantime every morning brought something for the amusement of mr temple and his daughter books prints drawings newspapers journals of all countries and caricatures from paris and london were mingled with engravings of henriettas favourite campo santo  one evening mr temple and his guest were speaking of a celebrated professor of the university lord montfort described his extraordinary acquirements and discoveries and his rare simplicity he was one of those eccentric geniuses that are sometimes found in decayed cities with ancient institutions of learning henrietta was interested in his description almost without thought she expressed a wish to see him  he shall come tomorrow said lord montfort if you please believe me he added in a tone of great kindness that if you could prevail upon yourself to cultivate italian society a little it would repay you  the professor was brought miss temple was much entertained in a few days he came again and introduced a friend scarcely less distinguished the society was so easy that even henrietta found it no burthen she remained upon her sofa the gentlemen drank their coffee and conversed one morning lord montfort had prevailed upon her to visit the studio of a celebrated sculptor the artist was full of enthusiasm for his pursuit and showed them with pride his great work a diana that might have made one envy endymion the sculptor declared it was the perfect resemblance of miss temple and appealed to her father mr temple could not deny the striking likeness miss temple smiled she looked almost herself again even the reserved lord montfort was in raptures  oh it is very like said his lordship yes now it is exactly like miss temple does not often smile but now one would believe she really was the model  they were bidding the sculptor farewell  do you like him whispered lord montfort of miss temple  extremely he is full of ideas  shall i ask him to come to you this evening  yes do  and so it turned out that in time henrietta found herself the centre of a little circle of eminent and accomplished men her health improved as she brooded less over her sorrows it gratified her to witness the pleasure of her father she was not always on her sofa now lord montfort had sent her an english chair which suited her delightfully  they even began to take drives with him in the country an hour or so before sunset the country around pisa is rich as well as picturesque and their companion always contrived that there should be an object in their brief excursions he spoke too the dialect of the country and they paid under his auspices a visit to a tuscan farmer all this was agreeable even henrietta was persuaded that it was better than staying at home the variety of pleasing objects diverted her mind in spite of herself she had some duties to perform in this world yet remaining there was her father her father who had been so devoted to her who had never uttered a single reproach to her for all her faults and follies and who in her hour of tribulation had clung to her with such fidelity was it not some source of satisfaction to see him again comparatively happy how selfish for her to mar this graceful and innocent enjoyment she exerted herself to contribute to the amusement of her father and his kind friend as well as to share it the colour returned a little to her cheek sometimes she burst for a moment into something like her old gaiety and though these ebullitions were often followed by a gloom and moodiness against which she found it in vain to contend still on the whole the change for the better was decided and mr temple yet hoped that in time his sight might again be blessed and his life illustrated by his own brilliant henrietta     chapter iii       in which mr temple and his daughter with their new      friend make an unexpected excursion  one delicious morning remarkable even in the south lord montfort called upon them in his carriage and proposed a little excursion mr temple looked at his daughter and was charmed that henrietta consented she rose from her seat indeed with unwonted animation and the three friends had soon quitted the city and entered its agreeable environs  it was wise to pass the winter in italy said lord montfort but to see tuscany in perfection i should choose the autumn i know nothing more picturesque than the carts laden with grapes and drawn by milkwhite steers  they drove gaily along at the foot of green hills crowned ever and anon by a convent or a beautiful stonepine the landscape attracted the admiration of miss temple a palladian villa rose from the bosom of a gentle elevation crowned with these picturesque trees a broad terrace of marble extended in front of the villa on which were ranged orange trees on either side spread an olivegrove the sky was without a cloud and deeply blue bright beams of the sun illuminated the building the road had wound so curiously into this last branch of the apennines that the party found themselves in a circus of hills clothed with spanish chestnuts and olive trees from which there was apparently no outlet a soft breeze which it was evident had passed over the wild flowers of the mountains refreshed and charmed their senses  could you believe we were only two hours drive from a city said lord montfort  indeed said henrietta if there be peace in this world one would think that the dweller in that beautiful villa enjoyed it  he has little to disturb him said lord montfort thanks to his destiny and his temper  i believe we make our miseries said henrietta with a sigh after all nature always offers us consolation but who lives here  i sometimes steal to this spot replied his lordship  oh this then is your villa ah you have surprised us  i only aimed to amuse you  you are very kind lord montfort said mr temple and we owe you much  they stopped they ascended the terrace they entered the villa a few rooms only were furnished but their appearance indicated the taste and pursuits of its occupier busts and books were scattered about a table was covered with the implements of art and the principal apartment opened into an english garden  this is one of my native tastes said lord montfort that will i think never desert me  the memory of henrietta was recalled to the flowers of ducie and of armine amid all the sweets and sunshine she looked sad she walked away from her companions she seated herself on the terrace her eyes were suffused with tears lord montfort took the arm of mr temple and led him away to a bust of germanicus  let me show it to henrietta said mr temple i must fetch her  lord montfort laid his hand gently on his companion the emotion of henrietta had not escaped his quick eye  miss temple has made a great exertion he said do not think me pedantic but i am something of a physician i have long perceived that although miss temple should be amused she must sometimes be left alone  mr temple looked at his companion but the countenance of lord montfort was inscrutable his lordship offered him a medal and then opened a portfolio of marc antonios  these are very rare said lord montfort i bring them into the country with me for really at rome there is no time to study them bythebye i have a plan continued his lordship in a somewhat hesitating tone i wish i could induce you and miss temple to visit me at rome  mr temple shrugged his shoulders and sighed  i feel confident that a residence at rome would benefit miss temple said his lordship in a voice a little less calm than usual there is much to see and i would take care that she should see it in a manner which would not exhaust her it is the most delightful climate too at this period the sun shines here today but the air of these hills at this season is sometimes treacherous a calm life with a variety of objects is what she requires pisa is calm but for her it is too dull believe me there is something in the blended refinement and interest of rome that she would find exceedingly beneficial she would see no one but ourselves society shall be at her command if she desire it  my dear lord said mr temple i thank you from the bottom of my heart for all your considerate sympathy but i cannot flatter myself that henrietta could avail herself of your really friendly offer my daughter is a great invalid she  but here miss temple joined them  we have a relic of a delicate temple here said lord montfort directing her gaze to another window you see it now to advantage the columns glitter in the sun there perhaps was worshipped some woodnymph or some rivergod  the first classic ruin that she had yet beheld attracted the attention of miss temple it was not far and she acceded to the proposition of lord montfort to visit it that little ramble was delightful the novelty and the beauty of the object greatly interested her it was charming also to view it under the auspices of a guide so full of information and feeling  ah said lord montfort if i might only be your cicerone at rome  what say you henrietta said mr temple with a smile shall we go to rome  the proposition did not alarm miss temple as much as her father anticipated lord montfort pressed the suggestion with delicacy he hinted at some expedients by which the journey might be rendered not very laborious but as she did not reply his lordship did not press the subject sufficiently pleased perhaps that she had not met it with an immediate and decided negative  when they returned to the villa they found a collation prepared for them worthy of so elegant an abode in his capacity of a host lord montfort departed a little from that placid and even constrained demeanour which generally characterised him his manner was gay and flowing and he poured out a goblet of monte pulciano and presented it to miss temple  you must pour a libation he said to the nymph of the fane     chapter iv       showing that it is the first step that is ever the most      difficult  about a week after this visit to the villa mr temple and his daughter were absolutely induced to accompany lord montfort to rome it is impossible to do justice to the tender solicitude with which he made all the arrangements for the journey wherever they halted they found preparations for their reception and so admirably had everything been concerted that miss temple at length found herself in the eternal city with almost as little fatigue as she had reached the tuscan villa  the palace of lord montfort was in the most distinguished quarter of the city and situate in the midst of vast gardens full of walls of laurel arches of ilex and fountains of lions they arrived at twilight and the shadowy hour lent even additional space to the huge halls and galleries yet in the suite of rooms intended for mr temple and his daughter every source of comfort seemed to have been collected the marble floors were covered with indian mats and carpets the windows were well secured from the air which might have proved fatal to an invalid while every species of chair and couch and sofa courted the languid or capricious form of miss temple and she was even favoured with an english stove and guarded by an indian screen the apartments were supplied with every book which it could have been supposed might amuse her there were guitars of the city and of florence and even an english piano a library of the choicest music and all the materials of art the air of elegance and cheerful comfort that pervaded these apartments so unusual in this land the bright blaze of the fire evert the pleasant waxlights all combined to deprive the moment of that feeling of gloom and exhaustion which attends an arrival at a strange place at a late hour and henrietta looked around her and almost fancied she was once more at ducie lord montfort introduced his fellowtravellers to their apartments presented to them the servant who was to assume the management of their little household and then reminding them of their mutual promises that they were to be entirely their own masters and not trouble themselves about him any more than if they were at pisa he shook them both by the hand and bade them goodnight  it must be confessed that the acquaintance of lord montfort had afforded consolation to henrietta temple it was impossible to be insensible to the sympathy and solicitude of one so highly gifted and so very amiable nor should it be denied that this homage from one of his distinguished rank was entirely without its charm to find ourselves when deceived and deserted unexpectedly an object of regard and consideration will bring balm to most bosoms but to attract in such a situation the friendship of an individual whose deferential notice under any circumstances must be flattering and to be admired by one whom all admire these are accidents of fortune which few could venture to despise and henrietta had now few opportunities to brood over the past a stream of beautiful and sublime objects passed unceasingly before her vision her lively and refined taste and her highly cultured mind could not refrain from responding to these glorious spectacles she saw before her all that she had long read of all that she had long mused over her mind became each day more serene and harmonious as she gazed on these ideal creations and dwelt on their beautiful repose her companion too exerted every art to prevent these amusements from degenerating into fatiguing expeditions the vatican was open to lord montfort when it was open to none others short visits but numerous ones was his system sometimes they entered merely to see a statue or a picture they were reading or conversing about the preceding eve and then they repaired to some modern studio where their entrance always made the sculptors eyes sparkle at dinner there was always some distinguished guest whom henrietta wished to see and as she thoroughly understood the language and spoke it with fluency and grace she was tempted to enter into conversations where all seemed delighted that she played her part sometimes indeed henrietta would fly to her chamber to sigh but suddenly the palace resounded with tones of the finest harmony or the human voice with its most felicitous skill stole upon her from the distant galleries although lord montfort was not himself a musician and his voice could not pour forth those fatal sounds that had ravished her soul from the lips of ferdinand armine he was well acquainted with the magic of music and while he hated a formal concert the most eminent performers were often at hand in his palace to contribute at the fitting moment to the delight of his guests who could withstand the soft influence of a life so elegant and serene or refuse to yield up the spirit to its gentle excitement and its mild distraction the colour returned to henriettas cheek and the lustre to her languid eye her form regained its airy spring of health the sunshine of her smile burst forth once more  it would have been impossible for an indifferent person not to perceive that lord montfort witnessed these changes with feelings of no slight emotion perhaps he prided himself upon his skill as a physician but he certainly watched the apparent convalescence of his friends daughter with zealous interest and yet henrietta herself was not aware that lord montforts demeanour to her differed in any degree from what it was at pisa she had never been alone with him in her life she certainly spoke more to him than she used but then she spoke more to everybody and lord montfort certainly seemed to think of nothing but her pleasure and convenience and comfort but he did and said everything so quietly that all this kindness and solicitude appeared to be the habitual impulse of his generous nature he certainly was more intimate much more intimate than during the first week of their acquaintance but scarcely more kind for she remembered he had arranged her sofa the very first day they met though he did not even remain to receive her thanks  one day a discussion rose about italian society between mr temple and his host his lordship was a great admirer of the domestic character and private life of the italians he maintained that there was no existing people who more completely fulfilled the social duties than this much scandalised nation respecting whom so many silly prejudices are entertained by the english whose travelling fellowcountrymen bythebye seldom enter into any society but that tainted circle that must exist in all capitals  you have no idea he said turning to henrietta what amiable and accomplished people are the better order of italians i wish you would let me light up this dark house some night and give you an italian party  i should like it very much said mr temple  whenever henrietta did not enter her negative lord montfort always implied her assent and it was resolved that the italian party should be given  all the best families in rome were present and not a single english person there were some perhaps whom lord montfort might have wished to invite but miss temple had chanced to express a wish that no english might be there and he instantly acted upon her suggestion  the palace was magnificently illuminated henrietta had scarcely seen before its splendid treasures of art lord montfort in answer to her curiosity had always playfully depreciated them and said that they must be left for rainy days the most splendid pictures and long rows of graceful or solemn statues were suddenly revealed to her rooms and galleries were opened that had never been observed before on all sides cabinets of vases groups of imperial busts rare bronzes and vivid masses of tesselated pavement over all these choice and beautiful objects a clear yet soft light was diffused and henrietta never recollected a spectacle more complete and effective  these rooms and galleries were soon filled with guests and henrietta could not be insensible to the graceful and engaging dignity with which lord montfort received the roman world of fashion that constraint which at first she had attributed to reserve but which of late she had ascribed to modesty now entirely quitted him frank yet always dignified smiling apt and ever felicitous it seemed that he had a pleasing word for every ear and a particular smile for every face she stood at some distance leaning on her fathers arm and watching him suddenly he turned and looked around it was they whom he wished to catch he came up to henrietta and said i wish to introduce you to the princess  she is an old lady but of the first distinction here i would not ask this favour of you unless i thought you would be pleased  henrietta could not refuse his request lord montfort presented her and her father to the princess the most agreeable and important person in rome and having now provided for their immediate amusement he had time to attend to his guests in general an admirable concert now in some degree hushed the general conversation the voices of the most beautiful women in rome echoed in those apartments when the music ceased the guests wandered about the galleries and at length the principal saloons were filled with dancers lord montfort approached miss temple there is one room in the palace you have never yet visited he said my tribune tis open tonight for the first time  henrietta accepted his proffered arm and how do you like the princess he said as they walked along it is agreeable to live in a country where your guests amuse themselves  at the end of the principal gallery henrietta perceived an open door which admitted them into a small octagon chamber of ionic architecture the walls were not hung with pictures and one work of art alone solicited their attention elevated on a pedestal of porphyry surrounded by a rail of bronze arrows of the lightest workmanship was that statue of diana which they had so much admired at pisa the cheek by an ancient process the secret of which has been recently regained at rome was tinted with a delicate glow  do you approve of it said lord montfort to the admiring henrietta ah dearest miss temple he continued it is my happiness that the rose has also returned to a fairer cheek than this     chapter v       which contains some rather painful explanations  the reader will not perhaps be much surprised that the marquis of montfort soon became the declared admirer of miss temple he made the important declaration after a very different fashion from the unhappy ferdinand armine he made it to the ladys father long persuaded that miss temples illness had its origin in the mind and believing that in that case the indisposition of the young lady had probably arisen from one cause or another in the disappointment of her affections lord montfort resolved to spare her feelings unprepared the pain of a personal appeal the beauty the talent the engaging disposition and the languid melancholy of miss temple had excited his admiration and pity and had finally won a heart capable of deep affections but gifted with great selfcontrol he did not conceal from mr temple the conviction that impelled him to the course which he had thought proper to pursue and this delicate conduct relieved mr temple greatly from the unavoidable embarrassment of his position mr temple contented himself with communicating to lord montfort that his daughter had indeed entered into an engagement with one who was not worthy of her affections and that the moment her father had been convinced of the character of the individual he had quitted england with his daughter he expressed his unqualified approbation of the overture of lord montfort to whom he was indeed sincerely attached and which gratified all those worldly feelings from which mr temple was naturally not exempt in such an alliance mr temple recognised the only mode by which his daughters complete recovery could be secured lord montfort in himself offered everything which it would seem that the reasonable fancy of woman could desire he was young handsome amiable accomplished sincere and exceedingly clever while at the same time as mr temple was well aware his great position would insure that reasonable gratification of vanity from which none are free which is a fertile source of happiness and which would at all times subdue any bitter recollections which might occasionally arise to cloud the retrospect of his daughter  it was mr temple who exerting all the arts of his abandoned profession now indulging in intimations and now in panegyric conveying to his daughter with admirable skill how much the intimate acquaintance with lord montfort contributed to his happiness gradually fanning the feeling of gratitude to so kind a friend which already had been excited in his daughters heart into one of zealous regard and finally seizing his opportunity with practised felicity it was mr temple who had at length ventured to communicate to his daughter the overture which had been confided to him  henrietta shook her head  i have too great a regard for lord montfort to accede to his wishes said miss temple he deserves something better than a bruised spirit if not a broken heart  but my dearest henrietta you really take a wrong an impracticable view of affairs lord montfort must be the best judge of what will contribute to his own happiness  lord montfort is acting under a delusion replied miss temple if he knew all that had occurred he would shrink from blending his life with mine  lord montfort knows everything said the father that is everything he should know  indeed said miss temple i wonder he does not look upon me with contempt at the least with pity  he loves you henrietta said her father  ah love love love name not love to me no lord montfort cannot love me it is not love that he feels  you have gained his heart and he offers you his hand are not these proofs of love  generous good young man exclaimed henrietta i respect i admire him i might have loved him but it is too late  my beloved daughter oh do not say so for my sake do not say so exclaimed mr temple i have no wish i have had no wish my child but for your happiness lean upon your father listen to him be guided by his advice lord montfort possesses every quality which can contribute to the happiness of woman a man so rarely gifted i never met there is not a woman in the world however exalted her rank however admirable her beauty however gifted her being who might not feel happy and honoured in the homage of such a man believe me my dearest daughter that this is an union which must lead to happiness indeed were it to occur i could die content i should have no more cares no more hopes all would then have happened that the most sanguine parent even with such a child as you could wish or imagine we should be so happy for his sake for my sake for all our sakes dearest henrietta grant his wish believe me believe me he is indeed worthy of you  i am not worthy of him said henrietta in a melancholy voice  ah henrietta who is like you exclaimed the fond and excited father  at this moment a servant announced that lord montfort would with their permission wait upon them henrietta seemed plunged in thought suddenly she said i cannot rest until this is settled papa leave me with him a few moments alone mr temple retired  a faint blush rose to the cheek of her visitor when he perceived that miss temple was alone he seated himself at her side but he was unusually constrained  my dear lord montfort said miss temple calmly i have to speak upon a painful subject but i have undergone so much suffering that i shall not shrink from this papa has informed me this morning that you have been pleased to pay me the highest compliment that a man can pay a woman i wish to thank you for it i wish to acknowledge it in terms the strongest and the warmest i can use i am sensible of the honour the high honour that you have intended me it is indeed an honour of which any woman might be proud you have offered me a heart of which i know the worth no one can appreciate the value of your character better than myself i do justice full justice to your virtues your accomplishments your commanding talents and your generous soul except my father there is no one who holds so high a place in my affection as yourself you have been my kind and true friend and a kind and true friendship faithful and sincere i return you more than friends we never can be for i have no heart to give  ah dearest miss temple said lord montfort agitated i ask nothing but that friendship but let me enjoy it in your constant society let the world recognise my right to be your consoler  you deserve a better and a brighter fate i should not be your friend if i could enter into such an engagement  the only aim of my life is to make you happy said lord montfort  i am sure that i ought to be happy with such a friend said henrietta temple and i am happy how different is the world to me from what it was before i knew you ah why will you disturb this life of consolation why will you call me back to recollections that i would fain banish why  dearest miss temple said lord montfort do not reproach me you make me wretched remember dear lady that i have not sought this conversation that if i were presumptuous in my plans and hopes i at least took precautions that i should be the only sufferer by their nonfulfilment  best and most generous of men i would not for the world be unkind to you pardon my distracted words but you know all has papa told you all it is my wish  it is not mine replied lord montfort i wish not to penetrate your sorrows but only to soothe them  oh if we had but met earlier said henrietta temple if we had but known each other a year ago when i was not worthy of you but more worthy of you but now with health shattered the lightness of my spirit vanished the freshness of my feelings gone no my kind friend my dear and gentle friend my affection for you is too sincere to accede to your request and a year hence lord montfort will thank me for my denial  i scarcely dare to speak said lord montfort in a low tone as if suppressing his emotion if i were to express my feelings i might agitate you i will not then venture to reply to what you have urged to tell you i think you the most beautiful and engaging being that ever breathed or how i dote upon your pensive spirit and can sit for hours together gazing on the language of those dark eyes o miss temple to me you never could have been more beautiful more fascinating alas i may not even breathe my love i am unfortunate and yet sweet lady pardon this agitation i have occasioned you try to love me yet endure at least my presence and let me continue to cherish that intimacy that has thrown over my existence a charm so inexpressible so saying he ventured to take her hand and pressed it with devotion to his lips     chapter vi       which contains an event not  less important than the one      which concluded our second book  lord montfort was scarcely disheartened by this interview with miss temple his lordship was a devout believer in the influence of time it was unnatural to suppose that one so young and so gifted as henrietta could ultimately maintain that her career was terminated because her affections had been disappointed by an intimacy which was confessedly of so recent an origin as the fatal one in question lord montfort differed from most men in this respect that the consciousness of this intimacy did not cost him even a pang he preferred indeed to gain the heart of a woman like miss temple who without having in the least degree forfeited the innate purity of her nature and the native freshness of her feelings had yet learnt in some degree to penetrate the mystery of the passions to one so untutored in the worlds ways that she might have bestowed upon him a heart less experienced indeed but not more innocent he was convinced that the affection of henrietta if once obtained might be relied on and that the painful past would only make her more finely appreciate his highminded devotion and amid all the dazzling characters and seducing spectacles of the world cling to him with a firmer gratitude and a more faithful fondness and yet lord montfort was a man of deep emotions and of a very fastidious taste he was a man of as romantic a temperament as ferdinand armine but with lord montfort life was the romance of reason with ferdinand the romance of imagination the first was keenly alive to all the imperfections of our nature but he also gave that nature credit for all its excellencies he observed finely he calculated nicely and his result was generally happiness ferdinand on the contrary neither observed nor calculated his imagination created fantasies and his impetuous passions struggled to realise them  although lord montfort carefully abstained from pursuing the subject which nevertheless engrossed his thoughts he had a vigilant and skilful ally in mr temple that gentleman lost no opportunity of pleading his lordships cause while he appeared only to advocate his own and this was the most skilful mode of controlling the judgment of his daughter  henrietta temple the most affectionate and dutiful of children left to reflect sometimes asked herself whether she were justified from what she endeavoured to believe was a mere morbid feeling in not accomplishing the happiness of that parent who loved her so well there had been no concealment of her situation or of her sentiments there had been no deception as to the past lord montfort knew all she told him that she could bestow only a broken spirit lord montfort aspired only to console it she was young it was not probable that the death which she had once sighed for would be accorded to her was she always to lead this life was her father to pass the still long career which probably awaited him in ministering to the wearisome caprices of a querulous invalid this was a sad return for all his goodness a gloomy catastrophe to all his bright hopes and if she could ever consent to blend her life with anothers what individual could offer pretensions which might ensure her tranquillity or even happiness equal to those proffered by lord montfort ah who was equal to him so amiable so generous so interesting it was in such a mood of mind that henrietta would sometimes turn with a glance of tenderness and gratitude to that being who seemed to breathe only for her solace and gratification if it be agonising to be deserted there is at least consolation in being cherished and who cherished her one whom all admired one to gain whose admiration or even attention every woman sighed what was she before she knew montfort if she had not known montfort what would she have been even at this present she recalled the hours of anguish the long days of bitter mortification the dull the wearisome the cheerless hopeless uneventful hours that were her lot when lying on her solitary sofa at pisa brooding over the romance of armine and all its passion the catastrophe of ducie and all its baseness and now there was not a moment without kindness without sympathy without considerate attention and innocent amusement if she were querulous no one murmured if she were capricious everyone yielded to her fancies but if she smiled everyone was happy dear noble montfort thine was the magic that had worked this change and for whom were all these choice exertions made for one whom another had trifled with deserted betrayed and montfort knew it he dedicated his life to the consolation of a despised woman leaning on the arm of lord montfort henrietta temple might meet the eye of ferdinand armine and his rich bride at least without feeling herself an object of pity  time had flown the italian spring with all its splendour illumined the glittering palaces and purple shores of naples lord montfort and his friends were returning from capua in his galley miss temple was seated between her father and their host the ausonian clime the beautiful scene the sweet society had all combined to produce a day of exquisite enjoyment henrietta temple could not refrain from expressing her delight her eye sparkled like the star of eve that glittered over the glowing mountains her cheek was as radiant as the sunset  ah what a happy day this has been she exclaimed  the gentle pressure of her hand reminded her of the delight her exclamation had afforded one of her companions with a trembling heart lord montfort leant back in the galley and yet ere the morning sun had flung its flaming beams over the city henrietta temple was his betrothed     book vi     chapter i       which contains a remarkable change of fortune  although lord montfort was now the received and recognised admirer of miss temple their intended union was not immediate henrietta was herself averse from such an arrangement but it was not necessary for her to urge this somewhat ungracious desire as lord montfort was anxious that she should be introduced to his family before their marriage and that the ceremony should be performed in his native country their return to england therefore was now meditated the event was hastened by an extraordinary occurrence  good fortune in this world they say is seldom single mr temple at this moment was perfectly content with his destiny easy in his own circumstances with his daughters future prosperity about to be provided for by an union with the heir to one of the richest peerages in the kingdom he had nothing to desire his daughter was happy he entertained the greatest esteem and affection for his future soninlaw and the world went well with him in every respect  it was in this fulness of happiness that destiny with its usual wild caprice resolved to gild refined gold and paint the lily and it was determined that mr temple should wake one morning among the wealthiest commoners of england  there happened to be an old baronet a great humourist without any very near relations who had been a godson of mr temples grandfather he had never invited or encouraged any intimacy or connection with the temple family but had always throughout life kept himself aloof from any acquaintance with them mr temple indeed had only seen him once but certainly under rather advantageous circumstances it was when mr temple was minister at the german court to which we have alluded that sir temple devereux was a visitor at the capital at which mr temple was resident the minister had shown him some civilities which was his duty and henrietta had appeared to please him but he had not remained long at this place and refused at the time to be more than their ordinary guest and had never by any letter message or other mode of communication conveyed to them the slightest idea that the hospitable minister and his charming daughter had dwelt a moment on his memory and yet sir temple devereux had now departed from the world where it had apparently been the principal object of his career to avoid ever making a friend and had left the whole of his large fortune to the right honourable pelham temple by this bequest proprietor of one of the finest estates in the county of york and a very considerable personal property the accumulated savings of a large rental and a long life  this was a great event mr temple had the most profound respect for property it was impossible for the late baronet to have left his estate to an individual who could more thoroughly appreciate its possession even personal property was not without its charms but a large landed estate and a large landed estate in the county of york and that large landed estate flanked by a good round sum of three per cent consols duly recorded in the rotunda of threadneedle streetit was a combination of wealth power consideration and convenience which exactly hit the ideal of mr temple and to the fascination of which perhaps the taste of few men would be insensible mr temple being a man of family had none of the awkward embarrassments of a parvenu to contend with it was the luckiest thing in the world he would say that poor sir temple was my grandfathers godson not only because in all probability it obtained us his fortune but because he bore the name of temple we shall settle down in yorkshire scarcely as strangers we shall not be looked upon as a new family and in a little time the whole affair will be considered rather one of inheritance than bequest but after all what is it to me it is only for your sake digby that i rejoice i think it will please your family i will settle everything immediately on henrietta they shall have the gratification of knowing that their son is about to marry the richest heiress in england  the richest heiress in england henrietta temple the richest heiress in england ah how many feelings with that thought arise strange to say the announcement of this extraordinary event brought less joy than might have been supposed to the heiress herself  it was in her chamber and alone that henrietta temple mused over this freak of destiny it was in vain to conceal it her thoughts recurred to ferdinand they might have been so happy why was he not true and perhaps he had sacrificed himself to his family perhaps even personal distress had driven him to the fatal deed her kind feminine fancy conjured up every possible extenuation of his dire offence she grew very sad she could not believe that he was false at ducie oh no she never could believe it he must have been sincere and if sincere oh what a heart was lost there what would she not have given to have been the means of saving him from all his sorrows she recalled his occasional melancholy his desponding words and how the gloom left his brow and his eye brightened when she fondly prophesied that she would restore the house she might restore it now and now he was anothers and she what was she a slave like him no longer her own mistress at the only moment she had the power to save him say what they like there is a pang in balked affection for which no wealth power or place watchful indulgence or sedulous kindness can compensate ah the heart the heart     chapter ii       in which the  reader is again introduced to  captain      armine during his visit to london  miss grandison had resolved upon taking a house in london for the season and had obtained a promise from her uncle and aunt to be her guests lady armines sister was to join them from bath as for ferdinand the spring had gradually restored him to health but not to his former frame of mind he remained moody and indolent incapable of exertion and a prey to the darkest humours circumstances however occurred which rendered some energy on his part absolutely necessary his creditors grew importunate and the arrangement of his affairs or departure from his native land was an alternative now inevitable the month of april which witnessed the arrival of the temples and lord montfort in england welcomed also to london miss grandison and her guests a few weeks after ferdinand who had evaded the journey with his family and who would not on any account become a guest of his cousin settled himself down at a quiet hotel in the vicinity of grosvenorsquare but not quite alone for almost at the last hour glastonbury had requested permission to accompany him and ferdinand who duly valued the society of the only person with whom he could converse about his broken fortunes and his blighted hopes without reserve acceded to his wish with the greatest satisfaction  a sudden residence in a vast metropolis after a life of rural seclusion has without doubt a very peculiar effect upon the mind the immense population the multiplicity of objects the important interests hourly impressed upon the intelligence the continually occurring events the noise the bustle the general and widelyspread excitement all combine to make us keenly sensible of our individual insignificance and those absorbing passions that in our solitude fed by our imagination have assumed such gigantic and substantial shapes rapidly subside by an almost imperceptible process into less colossal proportions and seem invested as it were with a more shadowy aspect as ferdinand armine jostled his way through the crowded streets of london urged on by his own harassing and inexorable affairs and conscious of the impending peril of his career while power and wealth dazzled his eyes in all directions he began to look back upon the passionate past with feelings of less keen sensation than heretofore and almost to regret that a fatal destiny or his impetuous soul had entailed upon him so much anxiety and prompted him to reject the glittering cup of fortune that had been proffered to him so opportunely he sighed for enjoyment and repose the memory of his recent sufferings made him shrink from that reckless indulgence of the passions of which the consequences had been so severe  it was in this mood exhausted by a visit to his lawyer that he stepped into a military club and took up a newspaper caring little for politics his eye wandered over uninterested its pugnacious leading articles and tedious parliamentary reports and he was about to throw it down when a paragraph caught his notice which instantly engrossed all his attention it was in the morning post that he thus read  the marquis of montfort the eldest son of the duke of whose return to england we recently noticed has resided for several years in italy his lordship is considered one of the most accomplished noblemen of the day and was celebrated at rome for his patronage of the arts lord montfort will shortly be united to the beautiful miss temple the only daughter of the right honourable pelham temple miss temple is esteemed one of the richest heiresses in england as she will doubtless inherit the whole of the immense fortune to which her father so unexpectedly acceded mr temple is a widower and has no son mr temple was formerly our minister at several of the german courts where he was distinguished by his abilities and his hospitality to his travelling countrymen it is said that the rentroll of the yorkshire estates of the late sir temple devereux is not less than 15000l per annum the personal property is also very considerable we understand that mr temple has purchased the mansion of the duke of  in grosvenorsquare lord montfort accompanied mr temple and his amiable daughter to this country  what a wild and fiery chaos was the mind of ferdinand armine when he read this paragraph the wonders it revealed succeeded each other with such rapidity that for some time he was deprived of the power of reflection henrietta temple in england henrietta temple one of the greatest heiresses in the country henrietta temple about to be immediately married to another his henrietta temple the henrietta temple whom he adored and by whom he had been worshipped the henrietta temple whose beautiful lock of hair was at this very moment on his heart the henrietta temple for whom he had forfeited fortune family power almost life  o woman woman put not thy trust in woman and yet could he reproach her did she not believe herself trifled with by him outraged deceived deluded deserted and did she could she love another was there another to whom she had poured forth her heart as to him and all that beautiful flow of fascinating and unrivalled emotion was there another to whom she had pledged her pure and passionate soul ah no he would not he could not believe it light and false henrietta could never be she had been seen she had been admired she had been loved who that saw her would not admire and love and he was the victim of her pique perhaps of her despair  but she was not yet married they were according to these lines to be soon united it appeared they had travelled together that thought gave him a pang could he not see her could he not explain all could he not prove that his heart had ever been true and fond could he not tell her all that had happened all that he had suffered all the madness of his misery and could she resist that voice whose accents had once been her joy that glance which had once filled her heart with rapture and when she found that ferdinand her own ferdinand had indeed never deceived her was worthy of her choice affection and suffering even at this moment for her sweet sake what were all the coldblooded ties in which she had since involved herself she was his by an older and more ardent bond should he not claim his right could she deny it  claim what the hand of an heiress should it be said that an armine came crouching for lucre where he ought to have commanded for love never whatever she might think his conduct had been faultless to her it was not for henrietta to complain she was not the victim if one indeed there might chance to be he had loved her she had returned his passion for her sake he had made the greatest of sacrifices forfeited a splendid inheritance and a fond and faithful heart when he had thought of her before pining perhaps in some foreign solitude he had never ceased reproaching himself for his conduct and had accused himself of deception and cruelty but now in this moment of her flush prosperity esteemed one of the richest heiresses in england he ground his teeth as he recalled that phrase and the affianced bride of a great noble his old companion lord montfort too what a strange thing is life proud smiling and prosperous while he was alone with a broken heart and worse than desperate fortunes and all for her sake his soul became bitter he reproached her with want of feeling he pictured her as void of genuine sensibility he dilated on her indifference since they had parted her silence so strange now no longer inexplicable the total want of interest she had exhibited as to his career he sneered at the lightness of her temperament he cursed her caprice he denounced her infernal treachery in the distorted phantom of his agonised imagination she became to him even an object of hatred  poor ferdinand armine it was the first time he had experienced the maddening pangs of jealousy  yet how he had loved this woman how he had doated on her and now they might have been so happy there is nothing that depresses a man so much as the conviction of bad fortune there seemed in this sudden return great wealth and impending marriage of henrietta temple such a combination so far as ferdinand armine was concerned of vexatious circumstances it would appear that he had been so near perfect happiness and missed it that he felt quite weary of existence and seriously meditated depriving himself of it  it so happened that he had promised this day to dine at his cousins for glastonbury who was usually his companion had accepted an invitation this day to dine with the noble widow of his old patron ferdinand however found himself quite incapable of entering into any society and he hurried to his hotel to send a note of excuse to brookstreet as he arrived glastonbury was just about to step into a hackneycoach so that ferdinand had no opportunity of communicating his sorrows to his friend even had he been inclined     chapter iii       in which glastonbury meets the very last person in the      world he expected and the strange consequences  when glastonbury arrived at the mansion of the good old duchess he found nobody in the drawingroom but a young man of distinguished appearance whose person was unknown to him but who nevertheless greeted him with remarkable cordiality the good glastonbury returned with some confusion his warm salutation  it is many years since we last met mr glastonbury said the young man i am not surprised you have forgotten me i am digby perhaps you recollect me  my dear child my dear lord you have indeed changed you are a man and i am a very old one nay my dear sir i observe little change believe me i have often recalled your image in my long absence and i find now that my memory has not deceived me  glastonbury and his companion fell into some conversation about the latters travels and residence at rome in the midst of which their hostess entered  i have asked you my dear sir to meet our family circle said her grace for i do not think i can well ask you to meet any who love you better it is long since you have seen digby  mr glastonbury did not recognise me grandmamma said lord montfort  these sweet children have all grown out of your sight mr glastonbury said the duchess but they are very good and as for digby i really think he comes to see his poor grandmother every day  the duke and duchess and two young daughters were now announced  i was so sorry that i was not at home when you called glastonbury said his grace but i thought i should soon hear of you at grandmammas  and dear mr glastonbury why did you not come up and see me said the younger duchess  and dear mr glastonbury do you remember me said one beautiful daughter  and me mr glastonbury me i am isabella  blushing smiling bowing constrained from the novelty of his situation and yet every now and then quite at ease when his ear recalled a familiar voice dear mr glastonbury was gratified and happy the duke took him aside and they were soon engaged in conversation  how is henrietta today digby enquired isabella  i left her an hour ago we have been riding and expected to meet you all she will be here immediately  there was a knock and soon the drawingroom door opened and miss temple was announced  i must make papas apologies said henrietta advancing and embracing the old duchess i hope he may get here in the evening but he bade me remind your grace that your kind invitation was only provisionally accepted  he is quite right said the old lady and indeed i hardly expected him for he told me there was a public dinner which he was obliged to attend i am sure that our dinner is a very private one indeed continued the old lady with a smile it is really a family party though there is one member of the family here whom you do not know my dear miss temple and whom i am sure you will love as much as all of us do digby where is  at this moment dinner was announced lord montfort offered his arm to henrietta there lead the way said the old lady the girls must beau themselves for i have no young men today for them i suppose man and wife must be parted so i must take my sons arm mr glastonbury you will hand down the duchess but before glastonburys name was mentioned henrietta was halfway down stairs  the duke and his son presided at the dinner henrietta sat on one side of lord montfort his mother on the other glastonbury sat on the right hand of the duke and opposite their hostess the two young ladies in the middle all the guests had been seated without glastonbury and henrietta recognising each other and as he sat on the same side of the table as miss temple it was not until lord montfort asked mr glastonbury to take wine with him that henrietta heard a name that might well indeed turn her pale  glastonbury it never entered into her head at the moment that it was the mr glastonbury whom she had known glastonbury what a name what dreadful associations did it not induce she looked forward she caught the wellremembered visage she sunk back in her chair but henrietta temple had a strong mind this was surely an occasion to prove it mr glastonburys attention was not attracted to her he knew indeed that there was a lady at the table called henrietta but he was engrossed with his neighbours and his eye never caught the daughter of mr temple it was not until the ladies rose to retire that mr glastonbury beheld that form which he had not forgotten and looked upon a lady whose name was associated in his memory with the most disastrous and mournful moments of his life miss temple followed the duchess out of the room and glastonbury perplexed and agitated resumed his seat  but henrietta was the prey of emotions far more acute and distracting it seemed to her that she had really been unacquainted with the state of her heart until this sudden apparition of glastonbury how his image recalled the past she had schooled herself to consider it all a dream now it lived before her here was one of the principal performers in that fatal tragedy of armine glastonbury in the house under the same roof as she where was ferdinand there was one at hand who could tell her was he married she had enjoyed no opportunity of ascertaining it since her return she had not dared to ask of course he was married but was he happy and glastonbury who if he did not know all knew so much how strange it must be to glastonbury to meet her dear glastonbury she had not forgotten the days when she so fondly listened to ferdinands charming narratives of all his amiable and simple life dear dear glastonbury whom she was so to love and she met him now and did not speak to him or looked upon him as a stranger and hehe would perhaps look upon her with pity certainly with pain o life what a heartbreaking thing is life and our affections our sweet and pure affections fountains of such joy and solace that nourish all things and make the most barren and rigid soil teem with life and beauty oh why do we disturb the flow of their sweet waters and pollute their immaculate and salutary source ferdinand ferdinand armine why were you false  the door opened mr glastonbury entered followed by the duke and his son henrietta was sitting in an easy chair one of lord montforts sisters seated on an ottoman at her side held her hand henriettas eye met glastonburys she bowed to him  how your hand trembles henrietta said the young lady  glastonbury approached her with a hesitating step he blushed faintly he looked exceedingly perplexed at length he reached her and stood before her and said nothing  you have forgotten me mr glastonbury said henrietta for it was absolutely necessary that some one should break the awkward silence and she pointed to a chair at her side  that would indeed be impossible said glastonbury  oh you knew mr glastonbury before said the young lady grandmamma only think henrietta knew mr glastonbury before  we were neighbours in nottinghamshire said henrietta in a quick tone  isabella said her sister who was seated at the piano the harp awaits you isabella rose lord montfort was approaching henrietta when the old duchess called to him  henrietta and glastonbury were alone  this is a strange meeting mr glastonbury said henrietta  what could poor glastonbury say something he murmured but not very much to the purpose have you been in nottinghamshire lately said henrietta  i left it about ten days back with and here glastonbury stopped with a friend he concluded  i trust all your friends are well said henrietta in a tremulous voice  no yes that is said glastonbury something better than they were  i am sorry that my father is not here said miss temple he has a lively remembrance of all your kindness  kindness i fear said glastonbury in a melancholy tone that was most unfortunate  we do not deem it so sir was the reply  my dear young lady said glastonbury but his voice faltered as he added we have had great unhappiness  i regret it said henrietta you had a marriage i believe expected in your family  it has not occurred said glastonbury  indeed  alas madam said her companion if i might venture indeed to speak of one whom i will not name and yet  pray speak sir said miss temple in a kind yet hushed voice  the child of our affections madam is not what he was god in his infinite mercy has visited him with great afflictions  you speak of captain armine sir  i speak indeed of my brokenhearted ferdinand i would i could say yours o miss temple he is a wreck yes yes said henrietta in a low tone  what he has endured continued glastonbury passes all description of mine his life has indeed been spared but under circumstances that almost make me regret he lives  he has not married muttered henrietta  he came to ducie to claim his bride and she was gone said glastonbury his mind sunk under the terrible bereavement for weeks he was a maniac and though providence spared him again to us and his mind thanks to god is again whole he is the victim of a profound melancholy that seems to defy alike medical skill and worldly vicissitude  digby digby exclaimed isabella who was at the harp henrietta is fainting lord montfort rushed forward just in time to seize her cold hand  the room is too hot said one sister  the coffee is too strong said the other  air said the young duchess  lord montfort carried henrietta into a distant room there was a balcony opening into a garden he seated her on a bench and never quitted her side but contrived to prevent anyone approaching her the women clustered together  sweet creature said the old duchess she often makes me tremble she has but just recovered mr glastonbury from a long and terrible illness  indeed said glastonbury  poor dear digby continued her grace this will quite upset him again he was in such spirits about her health the other day  lord montfort enquired glastonbury  our digby you know that he is to be married to henrietta next month  holy virgin muttered glastonbury and seizing advantage of the confusion he effected his escape    illustration frontistitle2jpg  illustration pageimage2jpg     book vi continued     chapter iv       in which mr glastonbury informs captain armine of his      meeting with miss temple  it was still an early hour when mr glastonbury arrived at his hotel he understood however that captain armine had already returned and retired glastonbury knocked gently at his door and was invited to enter the good man was pale and agitated ferdinand was already in bed glastonbury took a chair and seated himself by his side  my dear friend what is the matter said ferdinand  i have seen her i have seen her said glastonbury  henrietta seen henrietta enquired ferdinand  glastonbury nodded assent but with a most rueful expression of countenance  what has happened what did she say asked ferdinand in a quick voice  you are two innocent lambs said glastonbury rubbing his hands  speak speak my glastonbury  i wish that my death could make you both happy said glastonbury but i fear that would do you no good  is there any hope said ferdinand none said glastonbury prepare yourself my dear child for the worst  is she married enquired ferdinand  no but she is going to be  i know it said ferdinand  glastonbury stared  you know it what to digby  digby or whatever his name may be damn him  hush hush said glastonbury  may all the curses  god forbid said glastonbury interrupting him  unfeeling fickle false treacherous  she is an angel said glastonbury a very angel she has fainted and nearly in my arms  fainted nearly in your arms oh tell me all tell me all glastonbury exclaimed ferdinand starting up in his bed with an eager voice and sparkling eyes does she love me  i fear so said glastonbury fear  oh how i pity her poor innocent heart said glastonbury  when i told her of all your sufferings  did you tell her what then  and she herself has barely recovered from a long and terrible illness  my own henrietta now i could die happy said ferdinand  i thought it would break your heart said glastonbury  it is the only happy moment i have known for months said ferdinand  i was so overwhelmed that i lost my presence of mind said glastonbury i really never meant to tell you anything i do not know how i came into your room  dear dear glastonbury i am myself again  only think said glastonbury i never was so unhappy in my life  i have endured for the last four hours the tortures of the damned said ferdinand to think that she was going to be married to be married to another that she was happy proud prosperous totally regardless of me perhaps utterly forgetful of the past and that i was dying like a dog in this cursed caravanserai o glastonbury nothing that i have ever endured has been equal to the hell of this day and now you have come and made me comparatively happy i shall get up directly  glastonbury looked quite astonished he could not comprehend how his fatal intelligence could have produced effects so directly contrary from those he had anticipated however in answer to ferdinands reiterated enquiries he contrived to give a detailed account of everything that had occurred and ferdinands running commentary continued to be one of constant selfcongratulation  there is however one misfortune said ferdinand with which you are unacquainted my dear friend  indeed said glastonbury i thought i knew enough  alas she has become a great heiress  is that it said glastonbury  there is the blow said ferdinand were it not for that by the soul of my grandfather i would tear her from the arms of this stripling  stripling said glastonbury i never saw a truer nobleman in my life  ah exclaimed ferdinand  nay second scarcely to yourself i could not believe my eyes continued glastonbury he was but a child when i saw him last but so were you ferdinand believe me he is no ordinary rival  goodlooking  altogether of a most princely presence i have rarely met a personage so highly accomplished or who more quickly impressed you with his moral and intellectual excellence  and they are positively engaged  to be married next month replied glastonbury  o glastonbury why do i live exclaimed ferdinand why did i recover  my dear child but just now you were comparatively happy  happy you cannot mean to insult me happy oh is there in this world a thing so deplorable as i am  i thought i did wrong to say anything said glastonbury speaking as it were to himself  ferdinand made no observation he turned himself in his bed with his face averted from glastonbury  good night said glastonbury after remaining some time in silence  good night said ferdinand in a faint and mournful tone     chapter v       which on the whole is  perhaps as remarkable a chapter as      any in the work  wretched as he was the harsh business of life could not be neglected captain armine was obliged to be in lincolns inn by ten oclock the next morning it was on his return from his lawyer as he was about to cross berkeleysquare that a carriage suddenly stopped in the middle of the road and a female hand apparently beckoned to him from the window he was at first very doubtful whether he were indeed the person to whom the signal was addressed but as on looking around there was not a single human being in sight he at length slowly approached the equipage from which a white handkerchief now waved with considerable agitation somewhat perplexed by this incident the mystery was however immediately explained by the voice of lady bellair  you wicked man said her little ladyship in a great rage oh how i hate you i could cut you up into minced meat that i could here i have been giving parties every night all for you too and you have been in town and never called on me tell me your name how is your wife oh you are not married you should marry i hate a cidevant jeune homme however you can wait a little here james thomas peter what is your name open the door and let him in there get in get in i have a great deal to say to you and ferdinand found that it was absolutely necessary to comply  now where shall we go said her ladyship i have got till two oclock i make it a rule to be at home every day from two till six to receive my friends you must come and call upon me you may come every day if you like do not leave your card i hate people who leave cards i never see them i order all to be burnt i cannot bear people who leave bits of paper at my

grandison  are they early risers said her ladyship i get up every morning at six i dare say they will not receive me but do you show yourself and then they cannot refuse  in consequence of this diplomatic movement lady bellair effected an entrance leaning on the arm of ferdinand her ladyship was ushered into the morningroom where she found lady armine and katherine  my dear lady how do you

bidding them all farewell very cordially her ladyship took ferdinands arm and retired  captain armine returned to his mother and cousin and sat an hour with them until their carriage was announced just as he was going away he observed lady bellairs little red book which she had left behind  poor lady bellair what will she do said miss grandison we must take it to her immediately  i will leave it said ferdinand i shall pass her house  bellair house was the prettiest mansion in may fair it was a long building in the italian style situate in the midst of gardens which though not very extensive were laid out with so much art and taste that it was very difficult to believe that you were in a great city the house was furnished and adorned with all that taste for which lady bellair was distinguished all the reception rooms were on the ground floor and were all connected ferdinand who remembered lady bellairs injunctions not to leave cards attracted by the spot and not knowing what to do with himself determined to pay her ladyship a visit and was ushered into an octagon library lined with wellladen dwarf cases of brilliant volumes crowned with no lack of marble busts bronzes and etruscan vases on each side opened a magnificent saloon furnished in that classic style which the late accomplished and ingenious mr hope first rendered popular in this country the wings projecting far into the gardens comprised respectively a diningroom and a conservatory of considerable dimensions isolated in the midst of the gardens was a long building called the summerroom lined with indian matting and screened on one side from the air merely by venetian blinds the walls of this chamber were almost entirely covered with caricatures and prints of the country seats of lady bellairs friends all of which she took care to visit here also were her parrots and some birds of a sweeter voice a monkey and the famous squirrel  lady bellair was seated in a chair the back of which was much higher than her head at her side was a little table with writing materials on which also was placed a magnificent bell by benvenuto cellini with which her ladyship summoned her page who in the meantime loitered in the hall  you have brought me my book she exclaimed as ferdinand entered with the mystical volume give it me give it me here i cannot tell mrs fancourt what day i can dine with her i am engaged all this week and all next and i am to dine with your dear family when i like but mrs fancourt must choose her day because they will keep you do not know this gentleman she said turning to mrs fancourt well i shall not introduce you he will not suit you he is a fine gentleman and only dines with dukes  mrs fancourt consequently looked very anxious for an introduction  general faneville lady bellair continued to a gentleman on her left what day do i dine with you wednesday is our party full you must make room for him he is my greatest favourite all the ladies are in love with him  general faneville expressed his deep sense of the high honour ferdinand protested he was engaged on wednesday mrs fancourt looked very disappointed that she had thus lost another opportunity of learning the name of so distinguished a personage  there was another knock mrs fancourt departed lady maxbury and her daughter lady selina were announced  have you got him asked lady bellair very eagerly as her new visitors entered  he has promised most positively answered lady maxbury  dear good creature exclaimed lady bellair you are the dearest creature that i know and you are charming she continued addressing herself to lady selina if i were a man i would marry you directly there now he turning to ferdinand cannot marry you because he is married already but he should if he were not and how will he come enquired lady bellair  he will find his way said lady maxbury  and i am not to pay anything enquired lady bellair  not anything said lady maxbury  i cannot bear paying said lady bellair but will he dance and will he bring his bows and arrows lord dorfield protests tis nothing without the bows and arrows  what the new zealand chief lady bellair enquired the general  have you seen him enquired lady bellair eagerly  not yet replied the gentleman  well then you will see him tonight said lady bellair with an air of triumph he is coming to me tonight  ferdinand rose and was about to depart  you must not go without seeing my squirrel said her ladyship that my dear funny grandson gave me he is such a funny boy you must see it you must see it added her ladyship in a peremptory tone there go out of that door and you will find your way to my summerroom and there you will find my squirrel  the restless ferdinand was content to quit the library even with the stipulation of first visiting the squirrel he walked through a saloon entered the conservatory emerged into the garden and at length found himself in the long summerroom at the end of the room a lady was seated looking over a book of prints as she heard a footstep she raised her eyes and ferdinand beheld henrietta temple  he was speechless he felt rooted to the ground all power of thought and motion alike deserted him  there he stood confounded and aghast nor indeed was his companion less disturbed she remained with her eyes fixed on ferdinand with an expression of fear astonishment and distress impressed upon her features at length ferdinand in some degree rallied and he followed the first impulse of his mind when mind indeed returned to him he moved to retire  he had retraced half his steps when a voice if human voice indeed it were that sent forth tones so full of choking anguish pronounced his name  captain armine said the voice  how he trembled yet mechanically obedient to his first impulse he still proceeded to the door  ferdinand said the voice  he stopped he turned she waved her hand wildly and then leaning her arm on the table buried her face in it ferdinand walked to the table at which she was sitting she heard his footstep near her yet she neither looked up nor spoke at length he said in a still yet clear voice i am here  i have seen mr glastonbury she muttered  i know it he replied  your illness has distressed me she said after a slight pause her face still concealed and speaking in a hushed tone ferdinand made no reply and there was another pause which miss temple broke  i would that we were at least friends she said the tears came into ferdinands eyes when she said this for her tone though low was now sweet it touched his heart  our mutual feelings now are of little consequence he replied  she sighed but made no reply at length ferdinand said farewell miss temple  she started she looked up her mournful countenance harrowed his heart he knew not what to do what to say he could not bear her glance he in his turn averted his eyes  our misery ishas been great she said in a firmer tone but was it of my making  the miserable can bear reproaches do not spare me my situation however proves my sincerity i have erred certainly said ferdinand i could not believe that you could have doubted me it was a mistake he added in a tone of great bitterness  miss temple again covered her face as she said i cannot recall the past i wish not to dwell on it i desire only to express to you the interest i take in your welfare my hope that you may yet be happy yes you can be happy ferdinand ferdinand for my sake you will be happy  o henrietta if henrietta i indeed may call you this is worse than that death i curse myself for having escaped  no ferdinand say not that exert yourself only exert yourself bear up against irresistible fate your cousin everyone says she is so amiable surely  farewell madam i thank you for your counsel  no ferdinand you shall not go you shall not go in anger pardon me pity me i spoke for your sake i spoke for the best  i at least will never be false said ferdinand with energy it shall not be said of me that i broke vows consecrated by the finest emotions of our nature no no i have had my dream it was but a dream but while i live i will live upon its sweet memory  ah ferdinand why were you not frank why did you conceal your situation from me  no explanation of mine can change our respective situations said ferdinand i content myself therefore by saying that it was not miss temple who had occasion to criticise my conduct  you are bitter  the lady whom i injured pardoned me she is the most generous the most amiable of her sex if only in gratitude for all her surpassing goodness i would never affect to offer her a heart which never can be hers katherine is indeed more than woman amid my many and almost unparalleled sorrows one of my keenest pangs is the recollection that i should have clouded the life even for a moment of that admirable person alas alas that in all my misery the only woman who sympathises with my wretchedness is the woman i have injured and so delicate as well as so generous she would not even enquire the name of the individual who had occasioned our mutual desolation  would that she knew all murmured henrietta would that i knew her  your acquaintance could not influence affairs my very affection for my cousin the complete appreciation which i now possess of her character before so little estimated and so feebly comprehended by me is the very circumstance that with my feelings would prevent our union she may i am confident she will yet be happy i can never make her so our engagement in old days was rather the result of family arrangements than of any sympathy i love her far better now than i did then and yet she is the very last person in the world that i would marry i trust i believe that my conduct if it have clouded for a moment her life will not ultimately will not long obscure it and she has every charm and virtue and accident of fortune to attract the admiration and attention of the most favoured her feelings towards me at any time could have been but mild and calm it is a mere abuse of terms to style such sentiments love but added he sarcastically this is too delicate a subject for me to dilate on to miss temple  for gods sake do not be so bitter she exclaimed and then she added in a voice half of anguish half of tenderness let me never be taunted by those lips o ferdinand why cannot we be friends  because we are more than friends to me such a word from your lips is mere mockery let us never meet that alone remains for us little did i suppose that we ever should have met again i go nowhere i enter no single house my visit here this morning was one of those whimsical vagaries which cannot be counted on this old lady indeed seems somehow or other connected with our destiny i believe i am greatly indebted to her  the page entered the room miss temple said the lad my lady bid me say the duchess and lord montfort were here  ferdinand started and darting almost unconsciously a glance of fierce reproach at the miserable henrietta he rushed out of the room and made his escape from bellair house without reentering the library     chapter vi       containing an evening assembly at bellair house  seated on an ottoman in the octagon library occasionally throwing a glance at her illuminated and crowded saloons or beckoning with a fan almost as long as herself to a distant guest lady bellair received the world on the evening of the day that had witnessed the strange rencontre between henrietta temple and ferdinand armine her page who stood at the librarydoor in a new fancy dress received the announcement of the company from the other servants and himself communicated the information to his mistress  mr million de stockville my lady said the page  hem said her ladyship rather gruffly as with no very amiable expression of countenance she bowed with her haughtiest dignity to a rather commonlooking personage in a gorgeouslyembroidered waistcoat  lady ionia colonnade my lady lady bellair bestowed a smiling nod on this fair and classic dame and even indicated by a movement of her fan that she might take a seat on her ottoman  sir ratcliffe and lady armine my lady and miss grandison  dear good people exclaimed lady bellair how late you are and where is your wicked son there go into the next room go go and see the wonderful man lady ionia you must know lady armine she is like you she is one of my favourites now then there all of you go together i will not have anybody stay here except my niece this is my niece lady bellair added pointing to a young lady seated by her side i give this party for her general faneville my lady you are very late said lady bellair i dined at lord rochforts said the general bowing  rochforts oh where are they where are the rochforts they ought to be here i must i will see them do you think lady rochfort wants a nursery governess because i have a charming person who would just suit her go and find her out general and enquire and if she do not want one find out some one who does ask lady maxbury there go go  mr and miss temple my lady  oh my darling said lady bellair my real darling sit by me i sent lady ionia away because i determined to keep this place for you i give this party entirely in your honour so you ought to sit here you are a good man she continued addressing mr temple but i cant love you so well as your daughter  i should be too fortunate said mr temple smiling  i knew you when you ate pap said lady bellair laughing  mrs montgomery floyd my lady  lady bellair assumed her coldest and haughtiest glance mrs montgomery appeared more gorgeous than ever the splendour of her sweeping train almost required a page to support it she held a bouquet which might have served for the centrepiece of a dinnertable a slender youth rather distinguished in appearance simply dressed with a rosebud just twisted into his black coat but whose person distilled odours whose essence might have exhausted a conservatory lounged at her side  may i have the honour to present to your ladyship lord catchimwhocan breathed forth mrs montgomery exulting in her companion perhaps in her conquest  lady bellair gave a short and ungracious nod mrs montgomery recognised mr and miss temple there go go said lady bellair interrupting her nobody must stop here go and see the wonderful man in the next room  lady bellair is so strange whimpered mrs montgomery in an apologetical whisper to miss temple and she moved away covering her retreat by the graceful person of lord catchimwhocan  some irish guardsman i suppose said lady bellair i never heard of him i hate guardsmen  rather a distinguishedlooking man i think said mr temple  do you think so said lady bellair who was always influenced by the last word i will ask him for thursday and saturday i think i must have known his grandfather i must tell him not to go about with that horrid woman she is so very fine and she uses musk she puts me in mind of the queen of sheba said the little lady laughing all precious stones and frankincense i quite hate her  i thought she was quite one of your favourites lady bellair said henrietta temple rather maliciously  a bath favourite my dear a bath favourite i wear my old bonnets at bath and use my new friends but in town i have old friends and new dresses  lady frederick berrington my lady oh my dear lady frederick now i will give you a treat i will introduce you to my sweet sweet friend whom i am always talking to you of you deserve to know her you will taste her there sit down sit by her and talk to her and make love to her  lady womandeville my lady  ah she will do for the lord she loves a lord my dear lady you come so late and yet i am always so glad to see you i have such a charming friend for you the handsomest most fashionable witty person quite captivating and his grandfather was one of my dearest friends what is his name what is his name lord catchimwhocan mind i introduce you to him and ask him to your house very often  lady womandeville smiled expressed her delight and moved on  lord montfort who had arrived before the temples approached the ottoman  is the duchess here enquired henrietta as she shook hands with him  and isabella he replied henrietta rose and taking his arm bid adieu to lady bellair  god bless you said her ladyship with great emphasis i will not have you speak to that odious mrs floyd mind  when lord montfort and henrietta succeeded in discovering the duchess she was in the conservatory which was gaily illuminated with coloured lamps among the shrubs her grace was conversing with cordiality with a lady of very prepossessing appearance in whom the traces of a beauty once distinguished were indeed still considerable and her companion an extremely pretty person in the very bloom of girlhood lord montfort and henrietta were immediately introduced to these ladies as lady armine and miss grandison after the scene of the morning it was not easy to deprive miss temple of her equanimity after that shock no incident connected with the armine family could be surprising she was even desirous of becoming acquainted with miss grandison and she congratulated herself upon the opportunity which had so speedily offered itself to gratify her wishes the duchess was perfectly delighted with lady armine whose manners were fascinating between the families there was some connection of blood and lady armine too had always retained a lively sense of the old dukes services to her son henrietta had even to listen to enquiries made after ferdinand and she learnt that he was slowly recovering from an almost fatal illness that he could not endure the fatigues of society and that he was even living at an hotel for the sake of quiet henrietta watched the countenance of katherine as lady armine gave this information it was serious but not disturbed her grace did not separate from her new friends the whole of the evening and they parted with a mutually expressed wish that they might speedily and often meet the duchess pronounced lady armine the most charming person she had ever met while on the other hand miss grandison was warm in her admiration of henrietta temple and lord montfort whom she thought quite worthy even of so rare a prize     chapter vii       containing a very important communication  between the unexpected meeting with captain armine in the morning and the evening assembly at bellair house a communication had been made by miss temple to lord montfort which ought not to be quite unnoticed she had returned home with his mother and himself and her silence and depression had not escaped him soon after their arrival they were left alone and then henrietta said digby i wish to speak to you  my own said lord montfort as he seated himself by her on the sofa and took her hand  miss temple was calm but he would have been a light observer who had not detected her suppressed agitation  dearest digby she continued you are so generous and so kind that i ought to feel no reluctance in speaking to you upon this subject and yet it pains me very much she hesitated  i can only express my sympathy with any sorrow of yours henrietta said lord montfort speak to me as you always do with that frankness which so much delights me  let your thoughts recur to the most painful incident of my life then said henrietta  if you require it said lord montfort in a serious tone  it is not my fault dearest digby that a single circumstance connected with that unhappy event should be unknown to you i wished originally that you should know all i have a thousand times since regretted that your consideration for my feelings should ever have occasioned an imperfect confidence between us and something has occurred today which makes me lament it bitterly  no no dearest henrietta you feel too keenly said lord montfort  indeed digby it is so said henrietta very mournfully  speak then dearest henrietta  it is necessary that you should know the name of that person who once exercised an influence over my feelings which i never affected to disguise to you  is it indeed necessary enquired lord montfort  it is for my happiness replied henrietta  then indeed i am anxious to learn it  he is in this country said henrietta he is in this town he may be in the same room with you tomorrow he has been in the same room with me even this day  indeed said lord montfort  he bears a name not unknown to you said henrietta a name too that i must teach myself to mention and yet  lord montfort rose and took a pencil and a sheet of paper from the table write it he said in a kind tone  henrietta took the pencil and wrote  armine  the son of sir ratcliffe said lord montfort  the same replied henrietta  you heard then of him last night enquired her companion  even so of that too i was about to speak  i am aware of the connection of mr glastonbury with the armine family said lord montfort quietly  illustration frontispage025jpg  there was a dead pause at length lord montfort said is there anything you wish me to do  much said henrietta dearest digby she continued after a moments hesitation do not misinterpret me my heart if such a heart be worth possessing is yours i can never forget who solaced me in my misery i can never forget all your delicate tenderness digby would that i could make a return to you more worthy of all your goodness but if the grateful devotion of my life can repay you you shall be satisfied  he took her hand and pressed it to his lips it is of you and of your happiness that i can alone think he murmured  now let me tell you all said henrietta with desperate firmness i have done this person great injustice  hah said lord montfort  it cuts me to the heart said henrietta  you have then misconceived his conduct enquired lord montfort  utterly  it is indeed a terrible situation for you said lord montfort for all of us he added in a lower tone  no digby not for all of us not even for myself for if you are happy i will be but for him yes i will not conceal it from you i feel for him  your destiny is in your own hands henrietta  no no digby do not say so exclaimed miss temple very earnestly do not speak in that tone of sacrifice there is no need of sacrifice there shall be none i will not i do not falter be you firm do not desert me in this moment of trial it is for support i speak it is for consolation we are bound together by ties the purest the holiest who shall sever them no digby we will be happy but i am interested in the destiny of this unhappy person you you can assist me in rendering it more serene in making him perhaps not less happy than ourselves  i would spare no labour said lord montfort  oh that you would not exclaimed miss temple you are so good so noble you would sympathise even with him what other man in your situation would  what can be done  listen he was engaged to his cousin even on that fatal day when we first met a lady with every charm and advantage that one would think could make a man happy young noble and beautiful of a most amiable and generous disposition as her subsequent conduct has proved and of great wealth  miss grandison said lord montfort  yes his parents looked forward to their union with delight not altogether unmixed with anxiety  the armines with all their princely possessions are greatly embarrassed from the conduct of the last head of their house ferdinand himself has i grieve to say inherited too much of his grandfathers imprudent spirit his affairs i fear are terribly involved when i knew him papa was as you are aware a poor man this marriage would have cured all my digby i wish it to take place  how can we effect it asked lord montfort  become his friend dear digby i always think you can do anything yes my only trust is in you oh my digby make us all happy  lord montfort rose and walked up and down the room apparently in profound meditation at length he said rest assured henrietta that to secure your happiness nothing shall ever be wanting on my part i will see mr glastonbury on this subject at present dearest let us think of lighter things     chapter viii       which is rather strange  it was on the morning after the assembly at bellair house that ferdinand was roused from his welcome slumbers for he had passed an almost sleepless night by his servant bringing him a note and telling him that it had been left by a lady in a carriage he opened it and read as follows  silly silly captain armine why did you not come to my vauxhall last night i wanted to present you to the fairest damsel in the world who has a great fortune too but that you dont care about when are you going to be married miss grandison looked charming but disconsolate without her knight your mother is an angel and the duchess ofis quite in love with her your father too is a worthy man i love your family very much come and call upon poor old doting bedridden h b who is at home every day from two to six to receive her friends has charming lady armine got a page i have one that would just suit her he teases my poor squirrel so that i am obliged to turn him away but he is a real treasure that fine lady mrs montgomery floyd would give her ears for him but i love your mother much more and so she shall have him he shall come to her tonight all the world takes tea with h b on thursday and saturday  one oclock said ferdinand i may as well get up and call in brookstreet and save my mother from this threatened infliction heigho day after day and each more miserable than the other how will this end  when ferdinand arrived in brookstreet he went up stairs without being announced and found in the drawingroom besides his mother and katherine the duchess lord montfort and henrietta temple  the young ladies were in their ridinghabits henrietta appeared before him the same henrietta whom he had met for the first time in the pleasaunce at armine retreat was impossible her grace received ferdinand cordially and reminded him of old days henrietta bowed but she was sitting at some distance with miss grandison looking at some work her occupation covered her confusion lord montfort came forward with extended hand  i have the pleasure of meeting an old friend said his lordship  ferdinand just touched his lordships finger and bowed rather stiffly then turning to his mother he gave her lady bellairs note it concerns you more than myself he observed  you were not at lady bellairs last night captain armine said her grace  i never go anywhere was the answer  he has been a great invalid said lady armine  where is glastonbury ferdinand said lady armine he never comes near us  he goes every day to the british museum  i wish he would take me said katherine i have never been there have you she enquired turning to henrietta  i am ashamed to say never replied henrietta it seems to me that london is the only city of which i know nothing  ferdinand said katherine i wish you would go with us to the museum some day miss temple would like to go you know miss temple she added as if she of course supposed he had not that pleasure  ferdinand bowed lord montfort came forward and turned the conversation to egyptian antiquities when a quarter of an hour had passed ferdinand thought that he might now withdraw  do you dine at home katherine today he enquired  miss grandison looked at miss temple the young ladies whispered  ferdinand said katherine what are you going to do  nothing particular  we are going to ride and miss temple wishes you would come with us  i should be very happy but i have some business to attend to  dear ferdinand that is what you always say you really appear to me to be the most busy person in the world  pray come captain armine said lord montfort  thank you it is really not in my power his hat was in his hand he was begging her grace to bear his compliments to the duke when henrietta rose from her seat and coming up to him said do captain armine come with us i ask you as a favour  that voice oh it came oer his ear like the sweet south it unmanned him quite he scarcely knew where he was he trembled from head to foot his colour deserted him and the unlucky hat fell to the floor and yet she stood before him awaiting his reply calm quite calm serious apparently a little anxious the duchess was in earnest conversation with his mother lord montfort had walked up to miss grandison and was engaged in arranging a pattern for her ferdinand and henrietta were quite unobserved he looked up he caught her eye and then he whispered this is hardly fair  she stretched forth her hand took his hat and laid it on the table then turning to katherine she said in a tone which seemed to admit no doubt captain armine will ride with us and she seated herself by lady armine  the expedition was a little delayed by ferdinand having to send for his horse the others had in the meantime arrived yet this halfhour by some contrivance did at length disappear lord montfort continued talking to miss grandison henrietta remained seated by lady armine ferdinand revolved a great question in his mind and it was this was lord montfort aware of the intimate acquaintance between himself and miss temple and what was the moving principle of her present conduct he conjured up a thousand reasons but none satisfied him his curiosity was excited and instead of regretting his extracted promise to join the cavalcade he rejoiced that an opportunity was thus afforded him of perhaps solving a problem in the secret of which he now began to feel extremely interested  and yet in truth when ferdinand found himself really mounted and riding by the side of henrietta temple once more for lord montfort was very impartial in his attentions to his fair companions and ferdinand continually found himself next to henrietta he really began to think the world was bewitched and was almost sceptical whether he was or was not ferdinand armine the identity of his companion too was so complete henrietta temple in her ridinghabit was the very image most keenly impressed upon his memory he looked at her and stared at her with a face of curious perplexity she did not indeed speak much the conversation was always general and chiefly maintained by lord montfort who though usually silent and reserved made on this occasion successful efforts to be amusing his attention to ferdinand too was remarkable it was impossible to resist such genuine and unaffected kindness it smote ferdinands heart that he had received his lordships first advances so ungraciously compunction rendered him now doubly courteous he was even once or twice almost gay  the day was as fine as a clear sky a warm sun and a western breeze could render it tempted by so much enjoyment their ride was long it was late much later than they expected when they returned home by the green lanes of pretty willesden and the park was quite empty when they emerged from the edgwareroad into oxfordstreet  now the best thing we can all do is to dine in st jamessquare said lord montfort it is ten minutes past eight we shall just be in time and then we can send messages to grosvenorsquare and brookstreet what say you armine you will come of course  thank you if you would excuse me  no no why excuse you said lord montfort i think it shabby to desert us now after all our adventures  really you are very kind but i never dine out  dine out what a phrase you will not meet a human being perhaps not even my father if you will not come it will spoil everything  i cannot dine in a frock said ferdinand  i shall said lord montfort and these ladies must dine in their habits i suspect  oh certainly certainly said the ladies  do come ferdinand said katherine  i ask you as a favour said henrietta turning to him and speaking in a low voice  well said ferdinand with a sigh  that is well said montfort now let us trot through the park and the groom can call in grosvenorsquare and brookstreet and gallop after us this is amusing is it not     chapter ix       which is on the whole almost as perplexing as the preceding      one  when ferdinand found himself dining in st jamessquare in the very same room where he had passed so many gay hours during that boyish month of glee which preceded his first joining his regiment and then looked opposite him and saw henrietta temple it seemed to him that by some magical process or other his life was acting over again and the order of the scenes and characters had by some strange mismanagement got confused yet he yielded himself up to the excitement which had so unexpectedly influenced him he was inflamed by a species of wild delight which he could not understand nor stop to analyse and when the duchess retired with the young ladies to their secret conclave in the drawingroom she said i like captain armine very much he is so full of spirit and imagination when we met him this morning do you know i thought him rather stiff and fine i regretted the bright boyish flow that i so well recollected but i see i was mistaken  ferdinand is much changed said miss grandison he was once the most brilliant person i think that ever lived almost too brilliant everybody by him seemed so tame but since his illness he has quite changed i have scarcely heard him speak or seen him smile these six months there is not in the whole world a person so wretchedly altered he is quite a wreck i do not know what is the matter with him today he seemed once almost himself  he indulged his feelings too much perhaps said henrietta he lived perhaps too much alone after so severe an illness  oh no it is not that said miss grandison it is not exactly that poor ferdinand he is to be pitied i fear he will never be happy again  miss grandison should hardly say that said the duchess if report speaks truly  katherine was about to reply but checked herself  henrietta rose from her seat rather suddenly and asked katherine to touch the piano  the duchess took up the morning post  poor ferdinand he used to sing once so beautifully too said katherine to miss temple in a hushed voice he never sings now  you must make him said henrietta  miss grandison shook her head  you have influence with him you should exert it said henrietta  i neither have nor desire to have influence with him said miss grandison dearest miss temple the world is in error with respect to myself and my cousin and yet i ought not to say to you what i have not thought proper to confess even to my aunt  henrietta leant over and kissed her forehead say what you like dearest miss grandison you speak to a friend who loves you and will respect your secret  the gentlemen at this moment entered the room and interrupted this interesting conversation  you must not quit the instrument miss grandison said lord montfort seating himself by her side ferdinand fell into conversation with the duchess and miss temple was the amiable victim of his graces passion for √©cart√©  captain armine is a most agreeable person said lord montfort  miss grandison rather stared we were just speaking of ferdinand she replied and i was lamenting his sad change  severe illness illness so severe as his must for the moment change anyone we shall soon see him himself again  never said miss grandison mournfully  you must inspire him said lord montfort i perceive you have great influence with him  i give lord montfort credit for much acuter perception than that said miss grandison  their eyes met even lord montforts dark vision shrank before the searching glance of miss grandison it conveyed to him that his purpose was not undiscovered  but you can exert influence if you please said lord montfort  but it may not please me said miss grandison  at this moment mr glastonbury was announced he had a general invitation and was frequently in the habit of paying an evening visit when the family were disengaged when he found ferdinand henrietta and katherine all assembled together and in so strange a garb his perplexity was wondrous the tone of comparative ease too with which miss temple addressed him completed his confusion he began to suspect that some critical explanation had taken place he looked around for information  we have all been riding said lord montfort  so i perceive said glastonbury  and as we were too late for dinner took refuge here continued his lordship  i observe it said glastonbury  miss grandison is an admirable musician sir  she is an admirable lady in every respect said glastonbury  perhaps you will join her in some canzonette i am so stupid as not to be able to sing i wish i could induce captain armine  he has left off singing said glastonbury mournfully but miss temple added glastonbury bowing to that lady  miss temple has left off singing too said lord montfort quietly  come mr glastonbury said the duchess time was when you and i have sung together let us try to shame these young folks so saying her grace seated herself at the piano and the gratified glastonbury summoned all his energies to accompany her  lord montfort seated himself by ferdinand you have been severely ill i am sorry to hear  yes i have been rather shaken  this spring will bring you round  so everyone tells me i cannot say i feel its beneficial influence  you should said lord montfort at our age we ought to rally quickly  yes time is the great physician i cannot say i have much more faith in him than in the spring  well then there is hope what think you of that  i have no great faith said ferdinand affecting to smile  believe then in optimism said henrietta temple without taking her eyes off the cards whatever is is best  that is not my creed miss temple said ferdinand and he rose and was about to retire  must you go let us all do something tomorrow said lord montfort interchanging a glance with henrietta the british museum miss grandison wishes to go to the british museum pray come with us  you are very good but  well i will write you a little note in the morning and tell you our plans said lord montfort i hope you will not desert us  ferdinand bowed and retired he avoided catching the eye of henrietta  the carriages of miss temple and miss grandison were soon announced and fatigued with their ridingdresses these ladies did not long remain  today has been a day of trial said henrietta as she was about to bid lord montfort farewell what do you think of affairs i saw you speaking to katherine what do you think  i think ferdinand armine is a formidable rival do you know i am rather jealous  digby can you be ungenerous  my sweet henrietta pardon my levity i spoke in the merest playfulness nay he continued for she seemed really hurt say good night very sweetly  is there any hope said henrietta  alls well that ends well said lord montfort smiling god bless you  glastonbury was about to retire when lord montfort returned and asked him to come up to his lordships own apartments as he wished to show him a curious antique carving  you seemed rather surprised at the guests you found here tonight said lord montfort when they were alone  glastonbury looked a little confused it was certainly a curious meeting all things considered continued lord montfort henrietta has never concealed anything of the past from me but i have always wished to spare her details i told her this morning i should speak to you upon the subject and that is the reason why i have asked you here  it is a painful history said glastonbury  as painful to me as anyone said his lordship nevertheless it must be told when did you first meet miss temple  i shall never forget it said glastonbury sighing and moving very uneasily in his chair i took her for miss grandison and glastonbury now entered into a complete history of everything that had occurred  it is a strange a wonderful story said lord montfort and you communicated everything to miss grandison  everything but the name of her rival to that she would not listen it was not just she said to one so unfortunate and so unhappy  she seems an admirable person that miss grandison said lord montfort  she is indeed as near an angel as anything earthly can be said glastonbury  then it is still a secret to the parents  thus she would have it said glastonbury she clings to them who love her indeed as a daughter and she shrank from the desolation that was preparing for them  poor girl said lord montfort and poor armine by heavens i pity him from the bottom of my heart  if you had seen him as i have said glastonbury wilder than the wildest bedlamite it was an awful sight  ah the heart the heart said lord montfort it is a delicate organ mr glastonbury and think you his father and mother suspect nothing  i know not what they think said glastonbury but they must soon know all and he seemed to shudder at the thought  why must they asked lord montfort  glastonbury stared  is there no hope of softening and subduing all their sorrows said lord montfort cannot we again bring together these young and parted spirits  it is my only hope said glastonbury and yet i sometimes deem it a forlorn one  it is the sole desire of henrietta said lord montfort cannot you assist us will you enter into this conspiracy of affection with us  i want no spur to such a righteous work said glastonbury but i cannot conceal from myself the extreme difficulty ferdinand is the most impetuous of human beings his passions are a whirlwind his volition more violent than becomes a suffering mortal  you think then there is no difficulty but with him  i know not what to say said glastonbury calm as appears the temperament of miss grandison she has heroic qualities oh what have i not seen that admirable young lady endure alas my digby my dear lord few passages of this terrible story are engraven on my memory more deeply than the day when i revealed to her the fatal secret yet and chiefly for her sake it was my duty  it was at armine  at armine i seized an opportunity when we were alone together and without fear of being disturbed we had gone to view an old abbey in the neighbourhood we were seated among its ruins when i took her hand and endeavoured to prepare her for the fatal intelligence all is not right with ferdinand she immediately said there is some mystery i have long suspected it she listened to my recital softened as much as i could for her sake in silence yet her paleness i never can forget she looked like a saint in a niche when i had finished she whispered me to leave her for some short time and i walked away out of sight indeed but so near that she might easily summon me i stood alone until it was twilight in a state of mournful suspense that i recall even now with anguish at last i heard my name sounded in a low yet distinct voice and i looked round and she was there she had been weeping i took her hand and pressed it and led her to the carriage when i approached our unhappy home she begged me to make her excuses to the family and for two or three days we saw her no more at length she sent for me and told me she had been revolving all these sad circumstances in her mind and she felt for others more even than for herself that she forgave ferdinand and pitied him and would act towards him as a sister that her heart was distracted with the thoughts of the unhappy young lady whose name she would never know but that if by her assistance i could effect their union means should not be wanting though their source must be concealed that for the sake of her aunt to whom she is indeed passionately attached she would keep the secret until it could no longer be maintained and that in the meantime it was to be hoped that health might be restored to her cousin and providence in some way interfere in favour of this unhappy family  angelic creature said lord montfort so young too i think so beautiful good god with such a heart what could armine desire  alas said glastonbury and he shook his head you know not the love of ferdinand armine for henrietta temple it is a wild and fearful thing it passeth human comprehension  lord montfort leant back in his chair and covered his face with his hands after some minutes he looked up and said in his usual placid tone and with an unruffled brow will you take anything before you go mr glastonbury     chapter x       in which captain armine  increases his knowledge of the      value of money and also becomes aware of the advantage of      an acquaintance who burns coals  ferdinand returned to his hotel in no very good humour revolving in his mind miss temples advice about optimism what could she mean was there really a conspiracy to make him marry his cousin and was miss temple one of the conspirators he could scarcely believe this and yet it was the most probable deduction from all that had been said and done he had lived to witness such strange occurrences that no event ought now to astonish him only to think that he had been sitting quietly in a drawingroom with henrietta temple and she avowedly engaged to be married to another person who was present and that he ferdinand armine should be the selected companion of their morning ride and be calmly invited to contribute to their daily amusement by his social presence what next if this were not an insult a gross flagrant and unendurable outrage he was totally at a loss to comprehend what was meant by offended pride optimism indeed he felt far more inclined to embrace the faith of the manichee and what a fool was he to have submitted to such a despicable such a degrading situation what infinite weakness not to be able to resist her influence the influence of a woman who had betrayed him yes betrayed him he had for some period reconciled his mind to entertain the idea of henriettas treachery to him softened by time atoned for by long suffering extenuated by the constant sincerity of his purpose his original imprudence to use his own phrase in describing his misconduct had gradually ceased to figure as a valid and sufficient cause for her behaviour to him when he recollected how he had loved this woman what he had sacrificed for her and what misery he had in consequence entailed upon himself and all those dear to him when he contrasted his present perilous situation with her triumphant prosperity and remembered that while he had devoted himself to a love which proved false she who had deserted him was by a caprice of fortune absolutely rewarded for her fickleness he was enraged he was disgusted he despised himself for having been her slave he began even to hate her terrible moment when we first dare to view with feelings of repugnance the being that our soul has long idolised it is the most awful of revelations we start back in horror as if in the act of profanation  other annoyances however of a less ethereal character awaited our hero on his return to his hotel there he found a letter from his lawyer informing him that he could no longer parry the determination of one of captain armines principal creditors to arrest him instantly for a considerable sum poor ferdinand mortified and harassed with his heart and spirit alike broken could scarcely refrain from a groan however some step must be taken he drove henrietta from his thoughts and endeavouring to rally some of his old energy revolved in his mind what desperate expedient yet remained  his sleep was broken by dreams of bailiffs and a vague idea of henrietta temple triumphing in his misery but he rose early wrote a diplomatic note to his menacing creditor which he felt confident must gain him time and then making a careful toilet for when a man is going to try to borrow money it is wise to look prosperous he took his way to a quarter of the town where lived a gentleman with whose brother he had had some previous dealings at malta and whose acquaintance he had made in england in reference to them  it was in that gloomy quarter called goldensquare the murky repose of which strikes so mysteriously on the senses after the glittering bustle of the adjoining regentstreet that captain armine stopped before a noble yet now dingy mansion that in old and happier days might probably have been inhabited by his grandfather or some of his gay friends a brass plate on the door informed the world that here resided messrs morris and levison following the not very ambitious calling of coal merchants but if all the pursuers of that somewhat humble trade could manage to deal in coals with the same dexterity as messrs morris and levison what very great coal merchants they would be  the ponderous portal obeyed the signal of the bell and apparently opened without any human means and captain armine proceeding down a dark yet capacious passage opened a door which invited him by an inscription on ground glass that assured him he was entering the countinghouse here several clerks ensconced within lofty walls of the darkest and dullest mahogany were busily employed yet one advanced to an aperture in this fortification and accepted the card which the visitor offered him the clerk surveyed the ticket with a peculiar glance and then begging the visitor to be seated disappeared he was not long absent but soon invited ferdinand to follow him captain armine was ushered up a noble staircase and into a saloon that once was splendid the ceiling was richly carved and there still might be detected the remains of its once gorgeous embellishment in the faint forms of faded deities and the traces of murky gilding the walls of this apartment were crowded with pictures arranged however with little regard to taste effect or style a sprawling copy of titians venus flanked a somewhat prim peeress by hoppner a landscape that smacked of gainsborough was the companion of a dauby moonlight that must have figured in the last exhibition and insipid roman matrons by hamilton and stiff english heroes by northcote contrasted with a vast quantity of secondrate delineations of the orgies of dutch boors and portraits of favourite racers and fancy dogs the room was crowded with ugly furniture of all kinds very solid and chiefly of mahogany among which were not less than three escritoires to say nothing of the huge horsehair sofas a sideboard of babylonian proportions was crowned by three massive and enormous silver salvers and immense branch candlesticks of the same precious metal and a china punchbowl which might have suited the dwarf in brobdignag the floor was covered with a faded turkey carpet but amid all this solid splendour there were certain intimations of feminine elegance in the veil of finelycut pink paper which covered the nakedness of the empty but highlypolished fireplace and in the handscreens which were profusely ornamented with ribbon of the same hue and one of which afforded a most accurate if not picturesque view of margate while the other glowed with a huge wreath of cabbageroses and jonquils  ferdinand was not long alone and mr levison the proprietor of all this splendour entered he was a short stout man with a grave but handsome countenance a little bald but nevertheless with an elaborateness of raiment which might better have become a younger man he wore a plumcolored frock coat of the finest cloth his green velvet waistcoat was guarded by a gold chain which would have been the envy of a new town council an immense opal gleamed on the breast of his embroidered shirt and his fingers were covered with very fine rings  your sarvant captin said mr levison and he placed a chair for his guest  how are you levison responded our hero in an easy voice any news  mr levison shrugged his shoulders as he murmured times is very bad captin  oh i dare say said ferdinand i wish they were as well with me as with you by jove levison you must be making an immense fortune  mr levison shook his head as he groaned out i work hard captin but times is terrible  fiddlededee come i want you to assist me a little old fellow no humbug between us  oh groaned mr levison you could not come at a worse time i dont know what money is  of course however the fact is money i must have and so old fellow we are old friends and you must get it  what do you want captin slowly spoke mr levison with an expression of misery  oh i want rather a tolerable sum and that is the truth but i only want it for a moment  it is not the time tis the money said mr levison you know me and my pardner captin are always anxious to do what we can to sarve you  well now you can do me a real service and by jove you shall never repent it to the point i must have 1500l  one thousand five hundred pounds exclaimed mr levison taynt in the country  humbug it must be found what is the use of all this stuff with me i want 1500l and you must give it me  i tell you what it is captin said mr levison leaning over the back of a chair and speaking with callous composure i tell you what it is me and my pardner are very willing always to assist you but we want to know when the marriage is to come off and thats the truth  damn the marriage said captain armine rather staggered  there it is though said mr levison very quietly you know captin there is the arrears on that ere annuity three years next michaelmas i think its michaelmas let me see so saying mr levison opened an escritoire and brought forward an awfullooking volume and consulting the terrible index turned to the fatal name of armine yes three years next michaelmas captin  well you will be paid said ferdinand  we hope so said mr levison but it is a long figure  well but you get capital interest  pish said mr levison ten per cent why it is giving away the money why thats the raw captin with this here new bill annuities is nothink me and my pardner dont do no annuities now its giving money away and all this here money locked up and all to sarve you  well you will not help me said ferdinand rising  do you raly want fifteen hundred asked mr levison  by jove i do  well now captin when is this marriage to come off  have i not told you a thousand times and morris too that my cousin is not to marry until one year has passed since my grandfathers death it is barely a year but of course at this moment of all others i cannot afford to be short  very true captin and we are the men to sarve you if we could but we cannot never was such times for money there is no seeing it however we will do what we can things is going very bad at malta and thats the truth theres that young catchimwhocan we are in with him wery deep and now he has left the fusiliers and got into parliament he dont care this for us if he would only pay us you should have the money so help me you should  but he wont pay you said ferdinand what can you do  why i have a friend said mr levison who i know has got three hundred pound at his bankers and he might lend it us but we shall have to pay for it  i suppose so said ferdinand well three hundred  i have not got a shilling myself said mr levison young touchemup left us in the lurch yesterday for 750l so help me and never gave us no notice now you are a gentleman captin you never pay but you always give us notice  ferdinand could not help smiling at mr levisons idea of a gentleman  well what else can you do  why there is two hundred coming in tomorrow said mr levison i can depend on that  well that is five  and you want fifteen hundred said mr levison well me and my pardner always like to sarve you and it is very awkward certainly for you to want money at this moment but if you want to buy jewels i can get you any credit you like you know  we will talk of that by and by said ferdinand  fifteen hundred pound ejaculated mr levison well i suppose we must make it 700l somehow or other and you must take the rest in coals  oh by jove levison that is too bad  i dont see no other way said mr levison rather doggedly  but damn it my good fellow my dear levison what the deuce am i to do with 800l worth of coals  lord my dear captin 800l worth of coals is a mere nothink with your connection you will get rid of them in a morning all you have got to do you know is to give your friends an order on us and we will let you have cash at a little discount  then you can let me have the cash now at a little discount or even a great i cannot get rid of 800l worth of coals  why taynt four hundred chaldron captin rejoined mr levison three or four friends would do the thing why baron squash takes ten thousand chaldron of us every year but he has such a knack he gits the clubs to take them  baron squash indeed do you know whom you are talking to mr levison do you think that i am going to turn into a coal merchant your working partner by jove no sir give me the 700l without the coals and charge what interest you please we could not do it captin taynt our way i ask you once more mr levison will you let me have the money or will you not  now captin dont be so high and mighty taynt the way to do business me and my pardner wish to sarve you we does indeed and if a hundred pound will be of any use to you you shall have it on your acceptance and we wont be curious about any name that draws we wont indeed  well mr levison said ferdinand rising i see we can do nothing today the hundred pounds would be of no use to me i will think over your proposition good morning to you  ah do said mr levison bowing and opening the door do captin we wish to sarve you we does indeed see how we behave about that arrears think of the coals now do now for a bargin come come captin i dare say now you could get us the business of the junior sarvice club and then you shall have the seven hundred on your acceptance for three months at two shillings in the pound come     chapter xi       in  which captain armine  unexpectedly resumes his      acquaintance with lord catchimwhocan who  introduces  him      to mr bond sharpe  ferdinand quitted his kind friend mr levison in no very amiable mood but just as he was leaving the house a cabriolet beautifully painted of a brilliant green colour picked out with a somewhat creamcoloured white and drawn by a showy holstein horse of tawny tint with a flowing and milkwhite tail and mane and caparisoned in harness almost as precious as mr levisons sideboard dashed up to the door  armine by jove exclaimed the driver with great cordiality  ah catch is it you said ferdinand what have you been here said lord catchimwhocan at the old work eh is me and my pardner troublesome for your countenance is not very radiant  by jove old fellow said ferdinand in a depressed tone i am in a scrape and also in a rage nothing is to be done here  never mind said his lordship keep up your spirits jump into my cab and we will see how we can carry on the war i am only going to speak one word to me and my pardner  so saying his lordship skipped into the house as gay as a lark although he had a bill for a good round sum about to be dishonoured in the course of a few hours  well my dear armine he resumed when he reappeared and took the reins now as i drive along tell me all about it for if there be a man in the world whom i should like to sarve it is thyself my noble ferdinand  with this encouragement captain armine was not long in pouring his cares into a congenial bosom  i know the man to sarve you said catchimwhocan  the fact is these fellows here are regular oldfashioned humbugs the only idea they have is money money they have no enlightened notions i will introduce you to a regular trump and if he does not do our business i am much mistaken courage old fellow how do you like this start  deuced neat bythebye catch my boy you are going it rather i see  to be sure i have always told you there is a certain system in affairs which ever prevents men being floored no fellow is ever dished who has any connection what man that ever had his run was really ever fairly put hors de combat unless he was some one who ought never to have entered the arena blazing away without any set making himself a damned fool and everybody his enemy so long as a man bustles about and is in a good set something always turns up i got into parliament you see and you you are going to be married  all this time the cabriolet was dashing down regentstreet twisting through the quadrant whirling along pall mall until it finally entered clevelandrow and stopped before a newly painted newly pointed and exceedingly compact mansion the long brass knocker of whose dark green door sounded beneath the practised touch of his lordships tiger even the tawny holstein horse with the white flowing mane seemed conscious of the locality and stopped before the accustomed restingplace in the most natural manner imaginable a tall servingman wellpowdered and in a dark and wellappointed livery immediately appeared  at home enquired lord catchimwhocan with a peculiarly confidential expression  to you my lord responded the attendant  jump out armine said his lordship and they entered the house  alone said his lordship  not alone said the servant ushering the friends into the diningroom but he shall have your lordships card immediately there are several gentlemen waiting in the third drawingroom so i have shown your lordship in here and shall take care that he sees your lordship before anyone  thats a devilish good fellow said lord catchimwhocan putting his hand into his waistcoat pocket to give him a sovereign but not finding one he added i shall remember you  the diningroom into which they were shown was at the back of the house and looked into agreeable gardens the apartment was in some little confusion at this moment for their host gave a dinner today and his dinners were famous the table was arranged for eight guests its appointments indicated refined taste a candelabrum of dresden china was the centre piece there was a whole service of the same material even to the handles of the knives and forks and the choice variety of glass attracted ferdinands notice the room was lofty and spacious it was simply and soberly furnished not an object which could distract the taste or disturb the digestion but the sideboard which filled a recess at the end of the apartment presented a crowded group of gold plate that might have become a palace magnificent shields tall vases ancient tankards goblets of carved ivory set in precious metal and cups of old ruby glass mounted on pedestals glittering with gems this accidental display certainly offered an amusing contrast to the perpetual splendour of mr levisons buffet and ferdinand was wondering whether it would turn out that there was as marked a difference between the two owners when his companion and himself were summoned to the presence of mr bond sharpe  they ascended a staircase perfumed with flowers and on each landingplace was a classic tripod or pedestal crowned with a bust and then they were ushered into a drawingroom of parisian elegance buhl cabinets marqueterie tables hangings of the choicest damask suspended from burnished cornices of old carving the chairs had been rifled from a venetian palace the couches were part of the spoils of the french revolution there were glass screens in golden frames and a clock that represented the death of hector the chariot wheel of achilles conveniently telling the hour a round table of mosaic mounted on a golden pedestal was nearly covered with papers and from an easychair supported by air cushions half rose to welcome them mr bond sharpe he was a man not many years the senior of captain armine and his friend of elegant appearance pale pensive and prepossessing deep thought was impressed upon his clear and protruding brow and the expression of his grey sunken eyes which were delicately arched was singularly searching his figure was slight but compact his dress was plain but a model in its fashion he was habited entirely in black and his only ornament were his studs which were turquoise and of great size but there never were such boots so brilliant and so small  he welcomed lord catchimwhocan in a voice scarcely above a whisper and received captain armine in a manner alike graceful and dignified  my dear sharpe said his lordship i am going to introduce to you my most particular friend and an old brother officer this is captain armine the only son of sir ratcliffe and the heir of armine castle he is going to be married very soon to his cousin miss grandison the greatest heiress in england  hush hush said ferdinand shrinking under this false representation and mr sharpe with considerate delicacy endeavoured to check his lordship  well never mind i will say nothing about that continued lord catchimwhocan the long and the short of it is this that my friend armine is hard up and we must carry on the war till we get into winter quarters you are just the man for him and by jove my dear sharpe if you wish sensibly to oblige me who i am sure am one of your warmest friends you will do everything for armine that human energy can possibly effect  what is the present difficulty that you have enquired mr sharpe of our hero in a calm whisper  why the present difficulty that he has said lord catchimwhocan is that he wants 1500l  i suppose you have raised money captain armine said mr sharpe  in every way said captain armine  of course said mr sharpe at your time of life one naturally does and i suppose you are bothered for this 1500l  i am threatened with immediate arrest and arrest in execution  who is the party  why i fear an unmanageable one even by you it is a house at malta  mr bolus i suppose  exactly  i thought so  well what can be done said lord catchimwhocan  oh there is no difficulty said mr sharpe quietly captain armine can have any money he likes  i shall be happy said captain armine to pay any consideration you think fit  oh my dear sir i cannot think of that money is a drug now i shall be happy to accommodate you without giving you any trouble you can have the 1500l if you please this moment  really you are very generous said ferdinand much surprised but i feel i am not entitled to such favours what security can i give you  i lend the money to you i want no security you can repay me when you like give me your note of hand so saying mr sharpe opened a drawer and taking out his chequebook drew a draft for the 1500l i believe i have a stamp in the house he continued looking about yes here is one if you will fill this up captain armine the affair may be concluded at once  upon my honour mr sharpe said ferdinand very confused i do not like to appear insensible to this extraordinary kindness but really i came here by the merest accident and without any intention of soliciting or receiving such favours and my kind friend here has given you much too glowing an account of my resources it is very probable i shall occasion you great inconvenience  really captain armine said mr sharpe with a slight smile if we were talking of a sum of any importance why one might be a little more punctilious but for such a bagatelle we have already wasted too much time in its discussion i am happy to serve you  ferdinand stared remembering mr levison and the coals mr sharpe himself drew up the note and presented it to ferdinand who signed it and pocketed the draft  i have several gentlemen waiting said mr bond sharpe i am sorry i cannot take this opportunity of cultivating your acquaintance captain armine but i should esteem it a great honour if you would dine with me today your friend lord catchimwhocan favours me with his company and you might meet a person or two who would amuse you  i really shall be very happy said ferdinand  and mr bond sharpe again slightly rose and bowed them out of the room  well is not he a trump said lord catchimwhocan when they were once more in the cab  i am so astonished said ferdinand that i cannot speak who in the name of fortune is this great man  a genius said lord catchimwhocan dont you think he is a deuced goodlooking fellow  the bestlooking fellow i ever saw said the grateful ferdinand  and capital manners  most distinguished  neatest dressed man in town  exquisite taste  what a house  capital  did you ever see such furniture it beats your rooms at malta  i never saw anything more complete in my life  what plate miraculous and believe me we shall have the best dinner in town  well he has given me an appetite said ferdinand but who is he  why by business he is what is called a conveyancer that is to say he is a lawyer by inspiration  he is a wonderful man said ferdinand he must be very rich  yes sharpe must be worth his quarter of a million and he has made it in such a deuced short time  why he is not much older than we are  ten years ago that man was a prizefighter said lord catchimwhocan  a prizefighter exclaimed ferdinand  yes and licked everybody but he was too great a genius for the ring and took to the turf  ah  then he set up a hell  hum  and then he turned it into a subscriptionhouse  hoh  he keeps his hell still but it works itself now in the mean time he is the first usurer in the world and will be in the next parliament  but if he lends money on the terms he accommodates me he will hardly increase his fortune  oh he can do the thing when he likes he took a fancy to you the fact is my dear fellow sharpe is very rich and wants to get into society he likes to oblige young men of distinction and can afford to risk a few thousands now and then by dining with him today you have quite repaid him for his loan besides the fellow has a great soul and though born on a dunghill nature intended him for a palace and he has placed himself there  well this has been a remarkable morning said ferdinand armine as lord catchimwhocan set him down at his club i am very much obliged to you dear catch  not a word my dear fellow you have helped me before this and glad am i to be the means of assisting the best fellow in the world and that we all think you au revoir we dine at eight     chapter xii       miss grandison makes a remarkable discovery  in the mean time while the gloomy morning which ferdinand had anticipated terminated with so agreeable an adventure henrietta and miss grandison accompanied by lord montfort and glastonbury paid their promised visit to the british museum  i am sorry that captain armine could not accompany us said lord montfort i sent to him this morning early but he was already out  he has many affairs to attend to said glastonbury  miss temple looked grave she thought of poor ferdinand and all his cares she knew well what were those affairs to which glastonbury alluded the thought that perhaps at this moment he was struggling with rapacious creditors made her melancholy the novelty and strangeness of the objects which awaited her diverted however her mind from these painful reflections miss grandison who had never quitted england was delighted with everything she saw but the egyptian gallery principally attracted the attention of miss temple lord montfort regardful of his promise to henrietta was very attentive to miss grandison  i cannot help regretting that your cousin is not here said his lordship returning to a key that he had already touched but katherine made no answer  he seemed so much better for the exertion he made yesterday resumed lord montfort i think it would do him good to be more with us  he seems to like to be alone said katherine  i wonder at that said lord montfort i cannot conceive a happier life than we all lead  you have cause to be happy and ferdinand has not said miss grandison calmly  i should have thought that he had very great cause said lord montfort enquiringly  no person in the world is so unhappy as ferdinand said katherine  but cannot we cure his unhappiness said his lordship we are his friends it seems to me with such friends as miss grandison and miss temple one ought never to be unhappy  miss temple can scarcely be called a friend of ferdinand said katherine  indeed a very warm one i assure you  ah that is your influence  nay it is her own impulse  but she only met him yesterday for the first time  i assure you miss temple is an older friend of captain armine than i am said his lordship  indeed said miss grandison with an air of considerable astonishment  you know they were neighbours in the country  in the country repeated miss grandison  yes mr temple you know resided not far from armine  not far from armine still repeated miss grandison  digby said miss temple turning to him at this moment tell mr glastonbury about your sphinx at rome it was granite was it not  and most delicately carved i never remember having observed an expression of such beautiful serenity the discovery that after all they are male countenances is quite mortifying i loved their mysterious beauty  what lord montfort had mentioned of the previous acquaintance of henrietta and her cousin made miss grandison muse miss temples address to ferdinand yesterday had struck her at the moment as somewhat singular but the impression had not dwelt upon her mind but now it occurred to her as very strange that henrietta should have become so intimate with the armine family and herself and never have mentioned that she was previously acquainted with their nearest relative lady armine was not acquainted with miss temple until they met at bellair house that was certain miss grandison had witnessed their mutual introduction nor sir ratcliffe and yet henrietta and ferdinand were friends warm friends old friends intimately acquainted so said lord montfort and lord montfort never coloured never exaggerated all this was very mysterious and if they were friends old friends warm friends and lord montfort said they were and therefore there could be no doubt of the truth of the statement their recognition of each other yesterday was singularly frigid  it was not indicative of a very intimate acquaintance katherine had ascribed it to the natural disrelish of ferdinand now to be introduced to anyone and yet they were friends old friends warm friends henrietta temple and ferdinand armine miss grandison was so perplexed that she scarcely looked at another object in the galleries  the ladies were rather tired when they returned from the museum lord montfort walked to the travellers and henrietta agreed to remain and dine in brookstreet katherine and herself retired to miss grandisons boudoir a pretty chamber where they were sure of being alone henrietta threw herself upon a sofa and took up the last new novel miss grandison seated herself on an ottoman by her side and worked at a purse which she was making for mr temple  do you like that book said katherine  i like the lively parts but not the serious ones replied miss temple the author has observed but he has not felt  it is satirical said miss grandison i wonder why all this class of writers aim now at the sarcastic i do not find life the constant sneer they make it  it is because they do not understand life said henrietta but have some little experience of society therefore their works give a perverted impression of human conduct for they accept as a principal that which is only an insignificant accessory and they make existence a succession of frivolities when even the career of the most frivolous has its profounder moments  how vivid is the writers description of a ball or a dinner said miss grandison everything lives and moves and yet when the hero makes love nothing can be more unnatural his feelings are neither deep nor ardent nor tender all is stilted and yet ludicrous  i do not despise the talent which describes so vividly a dinner and a ball said miss temple as far as it goes it is very amusing but it should be combined with higher materials in a fine novel manners should be observed and morals should be sustained we require thought and passion as well as costume and the lively representation of conventional arrangements and the thought and passion will be the better for these accessories for they will be relieved in the novel as they are relieved in life and the whole will be more true  but have you read that love scene henrietta it appeared to me so ridiculous  i never read love scenes said henrietta temple  oh i love a love story said miss grandison smiling if it be natural and tender and touch my heart when i read such scenes i weep  ah my sweet katherine you are softhearted  and you henrietta what are you  hardhearted the most callous of mortals  oh what would lord montfort say  lord montfort knows it we never have love scenes  and yet you love him  dearly i love and esteem him  well said miss grandison i may be wrong but if i were a man i do not think i should like the lady of my love to esteem me  and yet esteem is the only genuine basis of happiness believe me kate love is a dream  and how do you know dear henrietta  all writers agree it is  the writers you were just ridiculing  a fair retort and yet though your words are the more witty believe me mine are the more wise  i wish my cousin would wake from his dream said katherine to tell you a secret love is the cause of his unhappiness dont move dear henrietta added miss grandison we are so happy here for miss temple in truth seemed not a little discomposed  you should marry your cousin said miss temple  you little know ferdinand or myself when you give that advice said katherine we shall never marry nothing is more certain than that in the first place to be frank ferdinand would not marry me nothing would induce him and in the second place i would not marry him nothing would induce me  why not said henrietta in a low tone holding her book very near to her face  because i am sure that we should not be happy said miss grandison i love ferdinand and once could have married him he is so brilliant that i could not refuse his proposal and yet i feel it is better for me that we have not married and i hope it may yet prove better for him for i love him very dearly he is indeed my brother  but why should you not be happy enquired miss temple  because we are not suited to each other ferdinand must marry some one whom he looks up to somebody brilliant like himself some one who can sympathise with all his fancies i am too calm and quiet for him you would suit him much better henrietta  you are his cousin it is a misfortune if you were not he would adore you and you would sympathise with him  i think not i should like to marry a very clever man said katherine i could not endure marrying a fool or a commonplace person i should like to marry a person very superior in talent to myself some one whose opinion would guide me on all points one from whom i could not differ but not ferdinand he is too imaginative too impetuous he would neither guide me nor be guided by me  miss temple did not reply but turned over a page of her book  did you know ferdinand before you met him yesterday at our house enquired miss grandison very innocently  yes said miss temple  i thought you did said miss grandison i thought there was something in your manner that indicated you had met before i do not think you knew my aunt before you met her at bellair house  i did not  nor sir ratclifle  nor sir ratclifle  but you did know mr glastonbury  i did know mr glastonbury  how very odd said miss grandison  what is odd enquired henrietta  that you should have known ferdinand before  not at all odd he came over one day to shoot at papas i remember him very well  oh said miss grandison and did mr glastonbury come over to shoot  i met mr glastonbury one morning that i went to see the picture gallery at armine it is the only time i ever saw him  oh said miss grandison again armine is a beautiful place is it not  most interesting  you know the pleasaunce  yes  i did not see you when i was at armine  no we had just gone to italy  how beautiful you look today henrietta said miss grandison who could believe that you ever were so ill  i am grateful that i have recovered said henrietta and yet i never thought that i should return to england  you must have been so very ill in italy about the same time as poor ferdinand was at armine only think how odd you should both have been so ill about the same time and now that we should all be so intimate  miss temple looked perplexed and annoyed is it so odd she at length said in a low tone  henrietta temple said miss grandison with great earnestness i have discovered a secret you are the lady with whom my cousin is in love     chapter xiii       in which ferdinand has the honour of dining with mr bond      sharpe  when ferdinand arrived at mr bond sharpes he was welcomed by his host in a magnificent suite of saloons and introduced to two of the guests who had previously arrived the first was a stout man past middle age whose epicurean countenance twinkled with humour this was lord castlefyshe an irish peer of great celebrity in the world of luxury and play keen at a bet still keener at a dinner nobody exactly knew who the other gentleman mr blandford really was but he had the reputation of being enormously rich and was proportionately respected he had been about town for the last twenty years and did not look a day older than at his first appearance he never spoke of his family was unmarried and apparently had no relations but he had contrived to identify himself with the first men in london was a member of every club of great repute and of late years had even become a sort of authority which was strange for he had no pretension was very quiet and but humbly ambitious seeking indeed no happier success than to merge in the brilliant crowd an accepted atom of the influential aggregate as he was not remarkable for his talents or his person and as his establishment though well appointed offered no singular splendour it was rather strange that a gentleman who had apparently dropped from the clouds or crept out of a kennel should have succeeded in planting himself so vigorously in a soil which shrinks from anything not indigenous unless it be recommended by very powerful qualities but mr blandford was goodtempered and was now easy and experienced and there was a vague tradition that he was immensely rich a rumour which mr blandford always contradicted in a manner which skilfully confirmed its truth  does mirabel dine with you sharpe enquired lord castlefyshe of his host who nodded assent  you wont wait for him i hope said his lordship bythebye blandford you shirked last night  i promised to look in at the poor dukes before he went off said mr blandford  oh he has gone has he said lord castlefyshe does he take his cook with him  but here the servant ushered in count alcibiades de mirabel charles doricourt and mr bevil  excellent sharpe how do you do exclaimed the count castlefyshe what b√™tises have you been talking to crocky about felix winchester good blandford excellent blandford how is my good blandford  mr bevil was a tall and handsome young man of a great family and great estate who passed his life in an imitation of count alcibiades de mirabel he was always dressed by the same tailor and it was his pride that his cab or his vis√†vis was constantly mistaken for the equipage of his model and really now as the shade stood beside its substance quite as tall almost as goodlooking with the satinlined coat thrown open with the same style of flowing grandeur and revealing a breastplate of starched cambric scarcely less broad and brilliant the uninitiated might have held the resemblance as perfect the wristbands were turned up with not less compact precision and were fastened by jewelled studs that glittered with not less radiancy the satin waistcoat the creaseless hosen were the same and if the foot were not quite as small its parisian polish was not less bright but here unfortunately mr bevils mimetic powers deserted him  we start for soul is wanting there  the count mirabel could talk at all times and at all times well mr bevil never opened his mouth practised in the world the count mirabel was nevertheless the child of impulse though a native grace and an intuitive knowledge of mankind made every word pleasing and every act appropriate mr bevil was all art and he had not the talent to conceal it the count mirabel was gay careless generous mr bevil was solemn calculating and rather a screw it seemed that the count mirabels feelings grew daily more fresh and his faculty of enjoyment more keen and relishing it seemed that mr bevil could never have been a child but that he must have issued to the world ready equipped like minerva with a cane instead of a lance and a fancy hat instead of a helmet his essence of high breeding was never to be astonished and he never permitted himself to smile except in the society of intimate friends  charles doricourt was another friend of the count mirabel but not his imitator his feelings were really worn but it was a fact he always concealed he had entered life at a remarkably early age and had experienced every scrape to which youthful flesh is heir any other man but charles doricourt must have sunk beneath these accumulated disasters but charles doricourt always swam nature had given him an intrepid soul experience had cased his heart with iron but he always smiled and audacious cool and cutting and very easy he thoroughly despised mankind upon whose weaknesses he practised without remorse but he was polished and amusing and faithful to his friends the world admired him and called him charley from which it will be inferred that he was a privileged person and was applauded for a thousand actions which in anyone else would have been met with decided reprobation  who is that young man enquired the count mirabel of mr bond sharpe taking his host aside and pretending to look at a picture  he is captain armine the only son of sir ratcliffe armine he has just returned to england after a long absence  hum i like his appearance said the count it is very distinguished  dinner and lord catchimwhocan were announced at the same moment captain armine found himself seated next to the count mirabel the dinners at mr bond sharpes were dinners which his guests came to eat mr bond sharpe had engaged for his clubhouse the most celebrated of living artists a gentleman who it was said received a thousand ayear whose convenience was studied by a chariot and amusement secured by a box at the french play there was therefore at first little conversation save criticism on the performances before them and that chiefly panegyrical each dish was delicious each wine exquisite and yet even in these occasional remarks ferdinand was pleased with the lively fancy of his neighbour affording an elegant contrast to the somewhat gross unction with which lord castlefyshe whose very soul seemed wrapped up in his occupation occasionally expressed himself  will you take some wine captain armine said the count mirabel with a winning smile you have recently returned here  very recently said ferdinand  and you are glad  as it may be i hardly know whether to rejoice or not  then by all means rejoice said the count for if you are in doubt it surely must be best to decide upon being pleased  i think this is the most infernal country there ever was said lord catchimwhocan  my dear catch said the count mirabel you think so do you you make a mistake you think no such thing my dear catch why is it the most infernal is it because the women are the handsomest or because the horses are the best is it because it is the only country where you can get a good dinner or because it is the only country where there are fine wines or is it because it is the only place where you can get a coat made or where you can play without being cheated or where you can listen to an opera without your ears being destroyed now my dear catch you pass your life in dressing and in playing hazard in eating good dinners in drinking good wines in making love in going to the opera and in riding fine horses of what then have you to complain  oh the damned climate  on the contrary it is the only good climate there is in england you can go out every day and at all hours and then to those who love variety like myself you are not sure of seeing the same sky every morning you rise which for my part i think the greatest of all existing sources of ennui  you reconcile me to my country count said ferdinand smiling  ah you are a sensible man but that dear catch is always repeating nonsense which he hears from somebody else tomorrow he added in a low voice he will be for the climate  the conversation of men when they congregate together is generally dedicated to one of two subjects politics or women in the present instance the party was not political and it was the fair sex and particularly the most charming portion of it in the good metropolis of england that were subject to the poignant criticism or the profound speculation of these practical philosophers there was scarcely a celebrated beauty in london from the proud peeress to the vain operadancer whose charms and conduct were not submitted to their masterly analysis and yet it would be but fair to admit that their critical ability was more eminent and satisfactory than their abstract reasoning upon this interesting topic for it was curious to observe that though everyone present piqued himself upon his profound knowledge of the sex not two of the sages agreed in the constituent principles of female character one declared that women were governed by their feelings another maintained that they had no heart a third propounded that it was all imagination a fourth that it was all vanity lord castlefyshe muttered something about their passions and charley doricourt declared that they had no passions whatever but they all agreed in one thing to wit that the man who permitted himself a moments uneasiness about a woman was a fool  all this time captain armine spoke little but ever to the purpose and chiefly to the count mirabel who pleased him being very handsome and moreover of a distinguished appearance this silence on the part of ferdinand made him a general favourite and even mr bevil whispered his approbation to lord catchimwhocan  the fact is said charles doricourt it is only boys and old men who are plagued by women they take advantage of either state of childhood eh castlefyshe  in that respect then somewhat resembling you charley replied his lordship who did not admire the appeal for no one can doubt you plagued your father i was out of my teens fortunately before you played √©cart√©  come good old fyshe said count mirabel take a glass of claret and do not look so fierce you know very well that charley learned everything of you  he never learned from me to spend a fortune upon an actress said his lordship i ave spent a fortune but thank heaven it was on myself  well as for that said the count i think there is something great in being ruined for ones friends if i were as rich as i might have been i would not spend much on myself my wants are few a fine house fine carriages fine horses a complete wardrobe the best operabox the first cook and pocketmoney that is all i require i have these and i get on pretty well but if i had a princely fortune i would make every good fellow i know quite happy  well said charles doricourt you are a lucky fellow mirabel i have had horses houses carriages operaboxes and cooks and i have had a great estate but pocketmoney i never could get pocketmoney was the thing which always cost me the most to buy of all  the conversation now fell upon the theatre mr bond sharpe was determined to have a theatre he believed it was reserved for him to revive the drama mr bond sharpe piqued himself upon his patronage of the stage he certainly had a great admiration of actresses there was something in the management of a great theatre which pleased the somewhat imperial fancy of mr bond sharpe the manager of a great theatre is a kind of monarch mr bond sharpe longed to seat himself on the throne with the prettiest women in london for his court and all his fashionable friends rallying round their sovereign he had an impression that great results might be obtained with his organising energy and illimitable capital mr bond sharpe had unbounded confidence in the power of capital capital was his deity he was confident that it could always produce alike genius and triumph mr bond sharpe was right capital is a wonderful thing but we are scarcely aware of this fact until we are past thirty and then by some singular process which we will not now stop to analyse ones capital is in general sensibly diminished as men advance in life all passions resolve themselves into money love ambition even poetry end in this  are you going to shropshires this autumn charley said lord catchimwhocan  yes i shall go  i dont think i shall said his lordship it is such a bore  it is rather a bore but he is a good fellow  i shall go said count mirabel  you are not afraid of being bored said ferdinand smiling  between ourselves i do not understand what this being bored is said the count he who is bored appears to me a bore to be bored supposes the inability of being amused you must be a dull fellow wherever i may be i thank heaven that i am always diverted  but you have such nerves mirabel said lord catchimwhocan by jove i envy you you are never floored  floored what an idea what should floor me i live to amuse myself and i do nothing that does not amuse me why should i be floored  why i do not know but every other man is floored now and then as for me my spirits are sometimes something dreadful  when you have been losing  well we cannot always win can we sharpe that would not do but by jove you are always in good humour mirabel when you lose  fancy a man ever being in low spirits said the count mirabel life is too short for such b√™tises the most unfortunate wretch alive calculates unconsciously that it is better to live than to die well then he has something in his favour existence is a pleasure and the greatest the world cannot rob us of that and if it is better to live than to die it is better to live in a good humour than a bad one if a man be convinced that existence is the greatest pleasure his happiness may be increased by good fortune but it will be essentially independent of it he who feels that the greatest source of pleasure always remains to him ought never to be miserable the sun shines on all every man can go to sleep if you cannot ride a fine horse it is something to look upon one if you have not a fine dinner there is some amusement in a crust of bread and gruy√®re feel slightly think little never plan never brood everything depends upon the circulation take care of it take the world as you find it enjoy everything vive la bagatelle  here the gentlemen rose took their coffee and ordered their carriages  come with us said count mirabel to ferdinand  our hero accepted the offer of his agreeable acquaintance there was a great prancing and rushing of cabs and vis√†vis at mr bond sharpes door and in a few minutes the whole party were dashing up st jamesstreet where they stopped before a splendid building resplendent with lights and illuminated curtains  come we will make you an honorary member mon cher captain armine said the count and do not say lasciate ogni speranza when you enter here  they ascended a magnificent staircase and entered a sumptuous and crowded saloon in which the entrance of count mirabel and his friends made no little sensation mr bond sharpe glided along dropping oracular sentences without condescending to stop to speak to those whom he addressed charley doricourt and mr blandford walked away together towards a further apartment lord castlefyshe and lord catchimwhocan were soon busied with √©cart√©  well faneville good general how do you do said count mirabel where have you dined today at the balcombes you are a very brave man mon general ah stock good stock excellent stock he continued addressing mr million de stockville that burgundy you sent me is capital how are you my dear fellow quite well fitzwarrene i did that for you your business is all right ah my good massey mon cher mon brave anderson will let you have that horse and what is doing here is there any fun fitzwarrene let me introduce you to my friend captain armine in a lower tone excellent gar√ßon you will like him very much we have been all dining at bonds  a good dinner  of course a good dinner i should like to see a man who would give me a bad dinner that would be a b√™tiseto ask me to dine and then give me a bad dinner  i say mirabel exclaimed a young man have you seen horace poppington about the match  it is arranged tis the day after tomorrow at nine oclock  well i bet on you you know  of course you bet on me would you think of betting on that good pop with that gun pah eh bien i shall go in the next room and the count walked away followed by mr bevil  ferdinand remained talking for some time with lord fitzwarrene by degrees the great saloon had become somewhat thinner some had stolen away to the house where a division was expected quiet men who just looked in after dinner had retired and the playmen were engaged in the contiguous apartments mr bond sharpe approached ferdinand and lord fitzwarrene took this opportunity of withdrawing  i believe you never play captain armine said mr bond sharpe  never said ferdinand  you are quite right  i am rather surprised at your being of that opinion said ferdinand with a smile  mr bond sharpe shrugged his shoulders there will always be votaries enough said mr bond sharpe whatever may be my opinion  this is a magnificent establishment of yours said ferdinand  yes it is a very magnificent establishment i have spared no expense to produce the most perfect thing of the kind in europe and it is the most perfect thing of the kind i am confident that no noble in any country has an establishment better appointed i despatched an agent to the continent to procure this furniture his commission had no limit and he was absent two years my cook was with charles x the cellar is the most choice and considerable that was ever collected i take a pride in the thing but i lose money by it  indeed  i have made a fortune there is no doubt of that but i did not make it here  it is a great thing to make a fortune said ferdinand  very great said mr bond sharpe there is only one thing greater and that is to keep it when made  ferdinand smiled  many men make fortunes few can keep them said mr bond sharpe money is power and rare are the heads that can withstand the possession of great power  at any rate it is to be hoped that you have discovered this more important secret said ferdinand though i confess to judge from my own experience i should fear that you are too generous  i had forgotten that to which you allude said his companion quietly but with regard to myself whatever may be my end i have not yet reached my acme  you have at least my good wishes said ferdinand  i may some day claim them said mr bond sharpe my position he continued is difficult i have risen by pursuits which the world does not consider reputable yet if i had not had recourse to them i should be less than nothing my mind i think is equal to my fortune i am still young and i would now avail myself of my power and establish myself in the land a recognised member of society but this cannot be society shrinks from an obscure foundling a prizefighter a leg a hellkeeper and an usurer debarred therefore from a fair theatre for my energy and capital i am forced to occupy perhaps exhaust myself in multiplied speculations hitherto they have flourished and perhaps my theatre or my newspaper may be as profitable as my stud but i would gladly emancipate myself these efforts seem to me as it were unnecessary and unnatural the great object has been gained it is a tempting of fate i have sometimes thought myself the napoleon of the sporting world i may yet find my st helena forewarned forearmed mr sharpe i move in a magic circle it is difficult to extricate myself from it now for instance there is not a man in the room who is not my slave you see how they treat me they place me upon an equality with them they know my weakness they fool me to the top of my bent and yet there is not a man in that room who if i were to break tomorrow would walk down st jamesstreet to serve me yes there is one there is the count he has a great and generous soul i believe count mirabel sympathises with my situation i believe he does not think because a man has risen from an origin the most ignoble and obscure to a powerful position by great courage and dexterity and let me add also by some profound thought by struggling too be it remembered with a class of society as little scrupulous though not so skilful as himself that he is necessarily an infamous character what if at eighteen years of age without a friend in the world trusting to the powerful frame and intrepid spirit with which nature had endowed me i flung myself into the ring who should be a gladiator if i were not is that a crime what if at a later period with a brain for calculation which none can rival i invariably succeeded in that in which the greatest men in the country fail am i to be branded because i have made half a million by a good book what if i have kept a gamblinghouse from the back parlour of an oystershop my hazard table has been removed to this palace had the play been foul this metamorphosis would never have occurred it is true i am an usurer my dear sir if all the usurers in this great metropolis could only pass in procession before you at this moment how you would start you might find some right honourables among them many a great functionary many a grave magistrate fathers of families the very models of respectable characters patrons and presidents of charitable institutions and subscribers for the suppression of those very gaminghouses whose victims in nine cases out of ten are their principal customers i speak not in bitterness on the whole i must not complain of the world but i have seen a great deal of mankind and more than most of what is considered its worst portion the world captain armine believe me is neither so bad nor so good as some are apt to suppose and after all said mr bond sharpe shrugging up his shoulders perhaps we ought to say with our friend the count vive la bagatelle will you take some supper     chapter xiv       miss grandison piques the curiosity of lord montfort and      count mirabel drives  ferdinand down to richmond which      drive  ends in an agreeable  adventure and an unexpected      confidence  the discovery that henrietta temple was the secret object of ferdinands unhappy passion was a secret which miss grandison prized like a true woman not only had she made this discovery but from her previous knowledge and her observation during her late interview with miss temple katherine was persuaded that henrietta must still love her cousin as before miss grandison was attached to henrietta she was interested in her cousins welfare and devoted to the armine family all her thoughts and all her energies were engaged in counteracting if possible the consequences of those unhappy misconceptions which had placed them all in this painful position  it was on the next day that she had promised to accompany the duchess and henrietta on a water excursion lord montfort was to be their cavalier in the morning she found herself alone with his lordship in st jamessquare  what a charming day said miss grandison i anticipate so much pleasure who is our party  ourselves alone said lord montfort lady armine cannot come and captain armine is engaged i fear you will find it very dull miss grandison  oh not at all bythebye do you know i was surprised yesterday at finding that ferdinand and henrietta were such old acquaintances  were you said lord montfort in a peculiar tone  it is odd that ferdinand never will go with us anywhere i think it is very bad taste  i think so too said lord montfort  i should have thought that henrietta was the very person he would have admired that he would have been quite glad to be with us i can easily understand his being wearied to death with a cousin said miss grandison but henriettait is so strange that he should not avail himself of the delight of being with her  do you really think that such a cousin as miss grandison can drive him away  why to tell you the truth dear lord montfort ferdinand is placed in a very awkward position with me you are our friend and so i speak to you in confidence sir ratcliffe and lady armine both expect that ferdinand and myself are going to be married now neither of us has the slightest intention of anything of the sort  very strange indeed said lord montfort the world will be much astonished more so than myself for i confess to a latent suspicion on the subject  yes i was aware of that said miss grandison or i should not have spoken with so much frankness for my own part i think we are very wise to insist upon having our own way for an illassorted marriage must be a most melancholy business miss grandison spoke with an air almost of levity which was rather unusual with her  an illassorted marriage said lord montfort and what do you call an illassorted marriage miss grandison  why many circumstances might constitute such an union said katherine but i think if one of the parties were in love with another person that would be quite sufficient to ensure a tolerable portion of wretchedness  i think so too said lord montfort an union under such circumstances would be illassorted but miss grandison is not in that situation he added with a faint smile  that is scarcely a fair question said katherine with gaiety but there is no doubt ferdinand armine is  indeed  yes he is in love desperately in love that i have long discovered i wonder with whom it can be  i wonder said lord montfort  do you said miss grandison well i have sometimes thought that you might have a latent suspicion of that subject too i thought you were his confidant  i said lord montfort i of all men in the world  and why not you of all men in the world said miss grandison  our intimacy is so slight said lord montfort  hum said miss grandison and now i think of it it does appear to me very strange how we have all become suddenly such intimate friends the armines and your family not previously acquainted miss temple too unknown to my aunt and uncle and yet we never live now out of each others sight i am sure i am grateful for it i am sure it is very agreeable but still it does appear to me to be very odd i wonder what the reason can be  it is that you are so charming miss grandison said lord montfort  a compliment from you  indeed no compliment dearest miss grandison said lord montfort drawing near her favoured as miss temple is in so many respects in none in my opinion is she more fortunate than in the possession of so admirable a friend  not even in the possession of so admirable a lover my lord  all must love miss temple who are acquainted with her said lord montfort seriously  indeed i think so said katherine in a more subdued voice i love her her career fills me with a strange and singular interest may she be happy for happiness she indeed deserves  i have no fonder wish than to secure that happiness miss grandison said lord montfort by any means he added  she is so interesting said katherine when you first knew her she was very ill  very  she seems quite recovered  i hope so  mr temple says her spirits are not what they used to be i wonder what was the matter with her  lord montfort was silent  i cannot bear to see a fine spirit broken continued miss grandison there was ferdinand oh if you had but known my cousin before he was unhappy oh that was a spirit he was the most brilliant being that ever lived and then i was with him during all his illness it was so terrible i almost wish we could have loved each other it is very strange he must have been ill at armine at the very time henrietta was ill in italy and i was with him in england while you were solacing her and now we are all friends there seems a sort of strange destiny in our lots does there not  a happy lot that can in any way be connected with miss grandison said lord montfort  at this moment her grace and henrietta entered the carriage was ready and in a few minutes they were driving to whitehall stairs where a beautiful boat awaited them  in the mean time ferdinand armine was revolving the strange occurrences of yesterday altogether it was an exciting and satisfactory day in the first place he had extricated himself from his most pressing difficulties in the next he had been greatly amused and thirdly he had made a very interesting acquaintance for such he esteemed count mirabel just at the moment when lounging over a very late breakfast he was thinking of bond sharpe and his great career and then turning in his mind whether it were possible to follow the gay counsels of his friends of yesterday and never plague himself about a woman again the count mirabel was announced  mon cher armine said the count you see i kept my promise and would find you at home  the count stood before him the bestdressed man in london fresh and gay as a bird with not a care on his sparkling visage and his eye bright with bonhomie and yet count mirabel had been the very last to desert the recent mysteries of mr bond sharpe and as usual the dappled light of dawn had guided him to his luxurious bed that bed which always afforded him serene slumbers whatever might be the adventures of the day or the result of the nights campaign how the count mirabel did laugh at those poor devils who wake only to moralise over their own folly with broken spirits and aching heads care he knew nothing about time he defied indisposition he could not comprehend he had never been ill in his life even for five minutes  ferdinand was really very glad to see him there was something in count mirabels very presence which put everybody in good spirits his lightheartedness was caught by all melancholy was a farce in the presence of his smile and there was no possible combination of scrapes that could withstand his kind and brilliant raillery at the present moment ferdinand was in a sufficiently good humour with his destiny and he kept up the ball with effect so that nearly an hour passed in amusing conversation  you were a stranger among us yesterday said count mirabel i think you were rather diverted i saw you did justice to that excellent bond sharpe that shows that you have a mind above prejudice do you know he was by far the best man at the table except ourselves  ferdinand smiled  it is true he has a heart and a brain old castlefyshe has neither as for the rest of our friends some have hearts without brains and the rest brains without hearts which do you prefer  tis a fine question said ferdinand and yet i confess i should like to be callous  ah but you cannot be said the count you have a soul of great sensibility i see that in a moment  you see very far and very quickly count mirabel said ferdinand with a little reserve  yes in a minute said the count in a minute i read a persons character i know you are very much in love because you changed countenance yesterday when we were talking of women  ferdinand changed countenance again you are a very extraordinary man count he at length observed  of course but mon cher armine what a fine day this is what are you going to do with yourself  nothing i never do anything said ferdinand in an almost mournful tone  a melancholy man quelle b√™tise i will cure you i will be your friend and put you all right now we will just drive down to richmond we will have a light dinner a flounder a cutlet and a bottle of champagne and then we will go to the french play i will introduce you to jenny vertpr√© she is full of wit perhaps she will ask us to supper allons mon ami mon cher armine allons mon brave ceremony was a farce with alcibiades de mirabel  ferdinand had nothing to do he was attracted to his companion the effervescence produced by yesterdays fortunate adventure had not quite subsided he was determined to forget his sorrows and if only for a day join in the lively chorus of vive la bagatelle so in a few moments he was safely ensconced in the most perfect cabriolet in london whirled along by a horse that stepped out with a proud consciousness of its master  the count mirabel enjoyed the drive to richmond as if he had never been to richmond in his life the warm sun the western breeze every object he passed and that passed him called for his praise or observation he inoculated ferdinand with his gaiety as ferdinand listened to his light lively tales and his flying remarks so full of merriment and poignant truth and daring fancy when they had arrived at the star and garter and ordered their dinner they strolled into the park along the terrace walk and they had not proceeded fifty paces when they came up with the duchess and her party who were resting on a bench and looking over the valley  ferdinand would gladly have bowed and passed on but that was impossible he was obliged to stop and speak to them and it was difficult to disembarrass himself of friends who greeted him so kindly ferdinand presented his companion the ladies were charmed to know so celebrated a gentleman of whom they had heard so much count mirabel who had the finest tact in the world but whose secret spell after all was perhaps only that he was always natural adapted himself in a moment to the characters the scene and the occasion he was quite delighted at these sources of amusement that had so unexpectedly revealed themselves and in a few minutes they had all agreed to walk together and in due time the duchess was begging ferdinand and his friend to dine with them before ferdinand could frame an excuse count mirabel had accepted the proposition after passing the morning together so agreeably to go and dine in separate rooms it would be a b√™tise this word b√™tise settled everything with count mirabel when once he declared that anything was a b√™tise he would hear no more  it was a charming stroll never was count mirabel more playful more engaging more completely winning henrietta and katherine alike smiled upon him and the duchess was quite enchanted even lord montfort who might rather have entertained a prejudice against the count before he knew himthough none could afterand who was prepared for something rather brilliant but pretending presumptuous fantastic and affected quite yielded to his amiable gaiety and his racy and thoroughly genuine and simple manner so they walked and talked and laughed and all agreed that it was the most fortunately fine day and the most felicitous rencontre that had ever occurred until the dinner hour was at hand the count was at her graces side and she was leaning on miss temples arm lord montfort and miss grandison had fallen back apace as their party had increased ferdinand fluttered between miss temple and his cousin but would have attached himself to the latter had not miss temple occasionally addressed him he was glad however when they returned to dinner  we have only availed ourselves of your graces permission to join our dinners said count mirabel offering the duchess his arm he placed himself at the head of the table lord montfort took the other end to the surprise of ferdinand miss grandison with a heedlessness that was quite remarkable seated herself next to the duchess so that ferdinand was obliged to sit by henrietta temple who was thus separated from lord montfort  the dinner was as gay as the stroll ferdinand was the only person who was silent  how amusing he is said miss temple turning to ferdinand and speaking in an undertone  yes i envy him his gaiety  be gay  i thank you i dare say i shall in time i have not yet quite embraced all count mirabels philosophy he says that the man who plagues himself for five minutes about a woman is an idiot when i think the same which i hope i may soon i dare say i shall be as gay  miss temple addressed herself no more to ferdinand  they returned by water to ferdinands great annoyance the count did not hesitate for a moment to avail himself of the duchesss proposal that he and his companion should form part of the crew he gave immediate orders that his cabriolet should meet him at whitehall stairs and ferdinand found there was no chance of escape  it was a delicious summer evening the setting sun bathed the bowers of fulham with refulgent light just as they were off delicate rosebank but the air long continued warm and always soft and the last few miles of their pleasant voyage were tinted by the young and glittering moon  i wish we had brought a guitar said miss grandison count mirabel i am sure would sing to us and you you will sing to us without a guitar will you not said the count smiling  henrietta will you sing said miss grandison with you  of course now you must said the count so they did  this gliding home to the metropolis on a summer eve so soft and still with beautiful faces as should always be the case and with sweet sounds as was the presentthere is something very ravishing in the combination the heart opens it is a dangerous moment as ferdinand listened once more to the voice of henrietta even though it was blended with the sweet tones of miss grandison the passionate past vividly recurred to him fortunately he did not sit near her he had taken care to be the last in the boat he turned away his face but its stern expression did not escape the observation of the count mirabel  and now count mirabel you must really favour us said the duchess  without a guitar said the count and he began thrumming on his arm for an accompaniment well when i was with the duc dangoul√™me in spain we sometimes indulged in a serenade at seville i will try to remember one        a  serenade  of  seville       i       come forth come   forth the star we love      is high oer guadalquivirs grove      and tints each tree with golden light      ah rosalie one smile from thee were far more bright        ii       come forth come forth the flowers that fear      to blossom in the suns career      the moonlight with their odours greet      ah rosalie one sigh from thee were far more sweet        iii       come forth come forth one hour of night      when flowers are fresh and stars are bright      were worth an age of gaudy day      then rosalie fly fly to me nor longer stay   i hope the lady came said miss temple after such a pretty song  of course said the count they always come  ferdinand will you sing said miss grandison  i cannot katherine  henrietta ask ferdinand to sing said miss grandison he makes it a rule never to do anything i ask him but i am sure you have more influence  lord montfort came to the rescue of miss temple miss temple has spoken so often to us of your singing captain armine said his lordship and yet lord montfort in this allegation a little departed front the habitual exactitude of his statements  how very strange thought ferdinand her callousness or her candour baffles me i will try to sing he continued aloud but it is a year really since i have sung  in a voice of singular power and melody and with an expression which increased as he proceeded until the singer seemed scarcely able to control his emotions captain armine thus proceeded        captain  armines  song       i       my heart is like a silent lute      some faithless hand has thrown aside      those chords are dumb those tones are mute      that once sent forth a voice of pride      yet even oer the lute neglected      the wind of heaven will sometimes fly      and even thus the heart dejected      will sometimes answer to a sigh       ii       and yet to feel anothers power      may grasp the prize for which i pine      and others now may pluck the flower      i cherished for this heart of mine      no more no more  the hand forsaking      the lute must fall and shivered lie      in silence and my heart thus breaking      responds not even to a sigh   miss temple seemed busied with her shawl perhaps she felt the cold count mirabel next whom she sat was about to assist her her face was turned to the water it was streaming with tears without appearing to notice her count mirabel leant forward and engaged everybodys attention so that she was unobserved and had time to recover and yet she was aware that the count mirabel had remarked her emotion and was grateful for his quick and delicate consideration it was fortunate that westminsterbridge was now in sight for after this song of captain armine everyone became dull or pensive even count mirabel was silent  the ladies and lord montfort entered their britzka they bid a cordial adieu to count mirabel and begged him to call upon them in st jamessquare and the count and ferdinand were alone  cher armine said the count as he was driving up charingcross catch told me you were going to marry your cousin which of those two young ladies is your cousin  the fair girl miss grandison  so i understood she is very pretty but you are not going to marry her are you  no i am not  and who is miss temple  she is going to be married to lord montfort  diable but what a fortunate man what do you think of miss temple  i think of her as all i suppose must  she is beautiful she is the most beautiful woman i ever saw she marries for money i suppose  she is the richest heiress in england she is much richer than my cousin  cest dr√¥le but she does not want to marry lord montfort  why  because my dear fellow she is in love with you  by jove mirabel what a fellow you are what do you mean  mon cher armine i like you more than anybody i wish to be i am your friend here is some cursed contretemps there is a mystery and both of you are victims of it tell me everything i will put you right  ah my dear mirabel it is past even your skill i thought i could never speak on these things to human being but i am attracted to you by the same sympathy which you flatter me by expressing for myself i want a confidant i need a friend i am most wretched  eh bien we will not go to the french play as for jenny vertpr√© we can sup with her any night come to my house and we will talk over everything but trust me if you wish to marry henrietta temple you are an idiot if you do not have her  so saying the count touched his bright horse and in a few minutes the cabriolet stopped before a small but admirably appointed house in berkeleysquare  now mon cher said the count coffee and confidence     chapter xv       in which the count mirabel commences his  operations with      great success  is there a more gay and graceful spectacle in the world than hyde park at the end of a long sunny morning in the merry months of may and june where can we see such beautiful women such gallant cavaliers such fine horses and such brilliant equipages the scene too is worthy of such agreeable accessories the groves the gleaming waters and the triumphal arches in the distance the misty heights of surrey and the bowery glades of kensington  it was the day after the memorable voyage from richmond eminent among the glittering throng count mirabel cantered along on his arabian scattering gay recognitions and bright words he reined in his steed beneath a tree under whose shade was assembled a knot of listless cavaliers the count received their congratulations for this morning he had won his pigeon match  only think of that old fool castlefyshe betting on poppington said the count i want to see him old idiot who knows where charley is  i do mirabel said lord catchimwhocan he has gone to richmond with blandford and the two little furzlers  that good blandford whenever he is in love he always gives a dinner it is a droll way to succeed  apropos will you dine with me today mirabel said mr de stockville  impossible my dear fellow i dine with fitzwarrene  i say mirabel drawled out a young man i saw you yesterday driving a man down to richmond yourself who is your friend  no one you know or will know tis the best fellow that ever lived but he is under my guidance and i shall be very particular to whom he is introduced  lord i wonder who he can be said the young man  i say mirabel you will be done on goshawk if you dont take care i can tell you that  thank you good coventry if you like to bet the odds i will take them  no my dear fellow i do not want to bet but at the same time  you have an opinion that you will not back that is a luxury for certainly it is of no use i would advise you to enjoy it  well i must say mirabel said lord catchimwhocan i think the same about goshawk  oh no catch you do not think so you think you think go and take all the odds you can get upon goshawk come now tomorrow you will tell me you have a very pretty book eh mon cher catch  but do you really think goshawk will win asked lord cathimwhocan earnestly  certain  well damned if i dont go and take the odds said his lordship  mirabel said a young noble moving his horse close to the count and speaking in a low voice shall you be at home tomorrow morning  certainly but what do you want  i am in a devil of a scrape i do not know what to do i want you to advise me  the count moved aside with this cavalier and what is it said he have you been losing  no no said the young man shaking his head much worse it is the most infernal business i do not know what i shall do i think i shall cut my throat  b√™tise it cannot be very bad if it be not money  oh my dear mirabel you do not know what trouble i am in  mon cher henri soyez tranquille said the count in a kind voice i am your friend rest assured i will arrange it think no more of it until tomorrow at one oclock and then call on me if you like i am at your service at present  no no not here there are letters  ha ha well tomorrow at one in the meantime do not write any nonsense  at this moment the duchess with a party of equestrians passed and bowed to the count mirabel  i say mirabel exclaimed a young man who is that girl i want to know i have seen her several times lately by jove she is a fine creature  do not you know miss temple said the count fancy a man not knowing miss temple she is the only woman in london to be looked at  now there was a great flutter in the band and nothing but the name of miss temple was heard all vowed they knew her very well at least by sight and never thought of anybody else some asked the count to present them others meditated plans by which that great result might be obtained but in the midst of all this agitation count mirabel rode away and was soon by the very ladys side  what a charming voyage yesterday said the count to miss temple you were amused  very  and to think you should all know my friend armine so well i was astonished for he will never go anywhere or speak to anyone  you know him intimately said miss temple  he is my brother there is not a human being in the world i love so much if you only knew him as i know him ah ch√®re miss temple there is not a man in london to be compared with him so clever and so good what a heart so tender and what talent there is no one so spirituel  you have known him long count  always but of late i find a great change in him i cannot discover what is the matter with him he has grown melancholy i think he will not live  indeed  no i am never wrong that cher armine will not live  you are his friend surely  ah yes but i do not know what it is even me he cares not for i contrive sometimes to get him about a little yesterday for instance but today you see he will not move there he is sitting alone in a dull hotel with his eyes fixed on the ground dark as night never was a man so changed i suppose something has happened to him abroad when you first knew him i daresay now he was the gayest of the gay  he was indeed very different said miss temple turning away her face  you have known that dear armine a long time  it seems a long time said miss temple  if he dies and die he must i do not think i shall ever be in very good spirits again said the count it is the only thing that would quite upset me now do not you think miss temple that our cher armine is the most interesting person you ever met  i believe captain armine is admired by all those who know him  he is so good so tender and so clever lord montfort he knows him very well  they were companions in boyhood i believe but they have resumed their acquaintance only recently  we must interest lord montfort in his case lord montfort must assist in our endeavours to bring him out a little  lord montfort needs no prompting count we are all alike interested in captain armines welfare  i wish you would try to find out what is on his mind said count mirabel after all men cannot do much it requires a more delicate sympathy than we can offer and yet i would do anything for the cher armine because i really love him the same as if he were my brother  he is fortunate in such a friend  ah he does not think so any longer said the count he avoids me he will not tell me anything ch√®re miss temple this business haunts me it will end badly i know that dear armine so well no one knows him like me his feelings are too strong no one has such strong feelings now of all my friends he is the only man i know who is capable of committing suicide  god forbid said henrietta temple with emphasis  i rise every morning with apprehension said the count when i call upon him every day i tremble as i approach his hotel  are you indeed serious  most serious i knew a man once in the same state it was the duc de crillon he was my brother friend like this dear armine we were at college together we were in the same regiment he was exactly like this dear armine young beautiful and clever but with a heart all tenderness terrible passions he loved mademoiselle de guise my cousin the most beautiful girl in france pardon me but i told armine yesterday that you reminded me of her they were going to be married but there was a contretemps he sent for me i was in spain she married the viscount de marsagnac until that dreadful morning he remained exactly in the same state as our dear armine never was a melancholy so profound after the ceremony he shot himself  no no exclaimed miss temple in great agitation  perfectly true it is the terrible recollection of that dreadful adventure that overcomes me when i see our dear friend here because i feel it must be love i was in hopes it was his cousin but it is not so it must be something that has happened abroad love alone can account for it it is not his debts that would so overpower him what are his debts i would pay them myself it is a heartrending business i am going to him how i tremble how good you are exclaimed miss temple with streaming eyes i shall ever be grateful i mean we all must oh do go to him go to him directly tell him to be happy  it is the song i ever sing said the count i wish some of you would come and see him or send him a message it is wise to show him that there are some who take interest in his existence now give me that flower for instance and let me give it to him from you  he will not care for it said miss temple try it is a fancy i have let me bear it miss temple gave the flower to the count who rode off with his prize  it was about eight oclock ferdinand was sitting alone in his room having just parted with glastonbury who was going to dine in brookstreet the sun had set and yet it was scarcely dark enough for artificial light particularly for a person without a pursuit it was just that dreary dismal moment when even the most gay grow pensive if they be alone and ferdinand was particularly dull a reaction had followed the excitement of the last eightandforty hours and he was at this moment feeling singularly disconsolate and upbraiding himself for being so weak as to permit himself to be influenced by mirabels fantastic promises and projects when his door flew open and the count full dressed and graceful as a versailles apollo stood before him  cher ami i cannot stop one minute i dine with fitzwarrene and i am late i have done your business capitally here is a pretty flower who do you think gave it me she did pardy on condition however that i should bear it to you with a message and what a message that you should be happy  nonsense my dear count  it is true but i romanced at a fine rate for it it is the only way with women she thinks we have known each other since the deluge do not betray me but my dear fellow i cannot stop now only mind all is changed instead of being gay and seeking her society and amusing her and thus attempting to regain your influence as we talked of last night mind suicide is the system tomorrow i will tell you all she has a firm mind and a high spirit which she thinks is principle if we go upon the tack of last night she will marry montfort and fall in love with you afterwards that will never do so we must work upon her fears her generosity pity remorse and so on call upon me tomorrow morning at halfpast two not before because i have an excellent boy coming to me at one who is in a scrape at halfpast two cher cher armine we will talk more in the meantime enjoy your flower and rest assured that it is your own fault if you do not fling the good montfort in a very fine ditch     chapter xvi       in which mr temple surprises his daughter weeping  the count mirabel proceeded with his projects with all the ardour address and audacity of one habituated to success by some means or other he contrived to see miss temple almost daily he paid assiduous court to the duchess on whom he had made a favourable impression from the first in st jamessquare he met mr temple who was partial to the society of a distinguished foreigner he was delighted with count mirabel as for miss grandison the count absolutely made her his confidante though he concealed this bold step from ferdinand he established his intimacy in the three families and even mystified sir ratcliffe and lady armine so completely that they imagined he must be some acquaintance that ferdinand had made abroad and they received him accordingly as one of their sons oldest and most cherished friends but the most amusing circumstance of all was that the count who even in business never lost sight of what might divert or interest him became great friends with mr glastonbury count mirabel comprehended and appreciated that good mans character  all count mirabels efforts were directed to restore the influence of ferdinand armine over henrietta temple and with this view he omitted no opportunity of impressing the idea of his absent friend on that ladys susceptible brain his virtues his talents his accomplishments his sacrifices but above all his mysterious sufferings and the fatal end which the count was convinced awaited him were placed before her in a light so vivid that they engrossed her thought and imagination she could not resist the fascination of talking about ferdinand armine to count mirabel he was the constant subject of their discourse all her feelings now clustered round his image she had quite abandoned her old plan of marrying him to his cousin that was desperate did she regret it she scarcely dared urge to herself this secret question and yet it seemed that her heart too would break were ferdinand anothers but then what was to become of him was he to be left desolate was he indeed to die and digby the amiable generous digby ah why did she ever meet him unfortunate unhappy woman and yet she was resolved to be firm she could not falter she would be the victim of her duty even if she died at the altar almost she wished that she had ceased to live and then the recollection of armine came back to her so vividly and those long days of passionate delight all his tenderness and all his truth for he had been true to her always had he been true to her she was not the person who ought to complain of his conduct and yet she was the person who alone punished him how different was the generous conduct of his cousin she had pardoned all she sympathised with him she sorrowed for him she tried to soothe him she laboured to unite him to her rival what must he think of herself how hardhearted how selfish must the contrast prove her could he indeed believe now that she had ever loved him oh no he must despise her he must believe that she was sacrificing her heart to the splendour of rank oh could he believe this her ferdinand her romantic ferdinand who had thrown fortune and power to the winds but to gain that very heart what a return had she made him and for all his fidelity he was punished lone disconsolate forlorn overpowered by vulgar cares heartbroken meditating even death the picture was too terrible too harrowing she hid her face in the pillow of the sofa on which she was seated and wept bitterly  she felt an arm softly twined round her waist she looked up it was her father  my child he said you are agitated  yes yes i am agitated she said in a low voice  you are unwell  worse than unwell  tell me what ails you henrietta  grief for which there is no cure  indeed i am greatly astonished  his daughter only sighed  speak to me henrietta tell me what has happened  i cannot speak nothing has happened i have nothing to say  to see you thus makes me quite unhappy said mr temple if only for my sake let me know the cause of this overwhelming emotion  it is a cause that will not please you forget sir what you have seen  a father cannot i entreat you tell me if you love me henrietta speak  sir sir i was thinking of the past  is it so bitter  ah that i should live said miss temple  henrietta my own henrietta my child i beseech you tell me all something has occurred something must have occurred to revive such strong feelings hashas i know not what to say but so much happens that surprises me i know i have heard that you have seen one who once influenced your feelings that you have been thrown in unexpected contact with him he has nothe has not dared  say nothing harshly of him said miss temple wildly i will not bear it even from you  my daughter  ay your daughter but still a woman do i murmur do i complain have i urged you to compromise your honour i am ready for the sacrifice my conduct is yours but my feelings are my own  sacrifice henrietta what sacrifice i have heard only of your happiness i have thought only of your happiness this is a strange return  father forget what you have seen forgive what i have said but let this subject drop for ever  it cannot drop here captain armine prefers his suit continued mr temple in a tone of stern enquiry  what if he did he has a right to do so  as good a right as he had before you are rich now henrietta and he perhaps would be faithful  o ferdinand exclaimed miss temple lifting up her hands and eyes to heaven and you must endure even this  henrietta said mr temple in a voice of affected calmness as he seated himself by her side listen to me i am not a harsh parent you cannot upbraid me with insensibility to your feelings they have ever engrossed my thought and care and how to gratify and when necessary how to soothe them has long been the principal occupation of my life if you have known misery girl you made that misery yourself it was not i that involved you in secret engagements and clandestine correspondence it was not i that made you you my daughter on whom i have lavished all the solicitude of long years the dupe of the first calculating libertine who dared to trifle with your affections and betray your heart  tis false exclaimed miss temple interrupting him he is as true and pure as i am more much more she added in a voice of anguish  no doubt he has convinced you of it said mr temple with a laughing sneer now mark me he continued resuming his calm tone you interrupted me listen to me you are the betrothed bride of lord montfort lord montfort my friend the man i love most in the world the most generous the most noble the most virtuous the most gifted of human beings you gave him your hand freely under circumstances which even if he did not possess every quality that ought to secure the affection of a woman should bind you to him with an unswerving faith falter one jot and i whistle you off for ever you are no more daughter of mine i am as firm as i am fond nor would i do this but that i know well i am doing rightly yes take this armine once more to your heart and you receive my curse the deepest the sternest the deadliest that ever descended on a daughters head  my father my dear dear father my beloved father exclaimed miss temple throwing herself at his feet oh do not say so oh recall those words those wild those terrible words indeed indeed my heart is breaking pity me pity me for gods sake pity me  i would do more than pity you i would save you  it is not as you think she continued with streaming eyes indeed it is not he has not preferred his suit he has urged no claim he has behaved in the most delicate the most honourable the most considerate manner he has thought only of my situation he met me by accident my friends are his friends they know not what has taken place between us he has not breathed it to human being he has absented himself from his home that we might not meet  you must marry lord montfort at once  oh my father even as you like but do not curse me dream not of such terrible things recall those fearful words love me love me say i am your child and digby i am true to digby but indeed can i recall the past can i alter it its memory overcame me digby knows all digby knows we met he did not curse me he was kind and gentle oh my father  my henrietta said mr temple moved my child  oh my father i will do all you wish but speak not again as you have spoken of ferdinand we have done him great injustice i have done him great injury he is good and pure indeed he is if you knew all you would not doubt it he was ever faithful indeed indeed he was once you liked him speak kindly of him father he is the victim if you meet him be gentle to him sir for indeed if you knew all you would pity him     chapter xvii       in which ferdinand  has a very stormy  interview with his      father  if we pause now to take a calm and comprehensive review of the state and prospects of the three families in whose feelings and fortunes we have attempted to interest the reader it must be confessed that however brilliant and satisfactory they might appear on the surface the elements of discord gloom and unhappiness might be more profoundly discovered and might even be held as rapidly stirring into movement miss temple was the affianced bride of lord montfort but her heart was captain armines captain armine in the estimation of his parents was the pledged husband of miss grandison while he and his cousin had in fact dissolved their engagement mr temple more than suspected his daughters partiality for ferdinand sir ratcliffe very much surprised at seeing so little of his son and resolved that the marriage should be no further delayed was about to precipitate confessions of which he did not dream and which were to shipwreck all the hopes of his life the count mirabel and miss grandison were both engaged in an active conspiracy lord montfort alone was calm and if he had a purpose to conceal inscrutable all things however foreboded a crisis  sir ratcliffe astonished at the marked manner in which his son absented himself from brookstreet resolved upon bringing him to an explanation at first he thought there might be some lovers quarrel but the demeanour of katherine and the easy tone in which she ever spoke of her cousin soon disabused him of this fond hope he consulted his wife now to tell the truth lady armine who was a shrewd woman was not without her doubts and perplexities but she would not confess them to her husband many circumstances had been observed by her which filled her with disquietude but she had staked all her hopes upon this cast and she was of a sanguine temper she was leading an agreeable life katherine appeared daily more attached to her and lady armine was quite of opinion that it is always very injudicious to interfere she endeavoured to persuade sir ratcliffe that everything was quite right and she assured him that the season would terminate as all seasons ought to terminate by the marriage  and perhaps sir ratcliffe would have followed her example only it so happened that as he was returning home one morning he met his son in grosvenorsquare  why ferdinand we never see you now said sir ratcliffe  oh you are all so gay said ferdinand how is my mother  she is very well katherine and herself have gone to see the balloon with lord montfort and count mirabel come in said sir ratcliffe for he was now almost at his door  the father and son entered sir ratcliffe walked into a little library on the ground floor which was his morning room  we dine at home today ferdinand said sir ratcliffe perhaps you will come  thank you sir i am engaged  it seems to me you are always engaged for a person who does not like gaiety it is very odd  heigho said ferdinand how do you like your new horse sir  ferdinand i wish to speak a word to you said sir ratcliffe i do not like ever to interfere unnecessarily with your conduct but the anxiety of a parent will i think excuse the question i am about to ask when do you propose being married  oh i do not know exactly  your grandfather has been dead now you know much more than a year i cannot help thinking your conduct singular there is nothing wrong between you and katherine is there  wrong sir  yes wrong i mean is there any misunderstanding have you quarrelled  no sir we have not quarrelled we perfectly understand each other  i am glad to hear it for i must say i think your conduct is very unlike that of a lover all i can say is i did not win your mothers heart by such proceedings  katherine has made no complaint of me sir  certainly not and that surprises me still more  ferdinand seemed plunged in thought the silence lasted some minutes sir ratcliffe took up the newspaper his son leant over the mantelpiece and gazed upon the empty fireplace at length he turned round and said father i can bear this no longer the engagement between katherine and myself is dissolved  illustration page2118jpg  good god when and why exclaimed sir ratcliffe the newspaper falling from his hand  long since sir ever since i loved another woman and she knew it  ferdinand ferdinand exclaimed the unhappy father but he was so overpowered that he could not give utterance to his thoughts he threw himself in a chair and wrung his hands ferdinand stood still and silent like a statue of destiny gloomy and inflexible  speak again at length said sir ratcliffe let me hear you speak again i cannot believe what i have heard is it indeed true that your engagement with your cousin has been long terminated  ferdinand nodded assent  your poor mother exclaimed sir ratcliffe this will kill her he rose from his seat and walked up and down the room in great agitation  i knew all was not right he muttered to himself she will sink under it we must all sink under it madman you know not what you have done  it is in vain to regret sir my sufferings have been greater than yours  she will pardon you my boy said sir ratcliffe in a quicker and kinder tone you have lived to repent your impetuous folly katherine is kind and generous she loves us all she must love you she will pardon you yes entreat her to forget it your mother your mother has great influence with her she will exercise it she will interfere you are very young all will yet be well  it is as impossible for me to marry katherine grandison as for you yourself to do it sir said ferdinand in a tone of calmness  you are not married to another  in faith i am bound by a tie which i can never break  and who is this person  she must be nameless for many reasons  ferdinand said sir ratcliffe you know not what you are doing my life your mothers the existence of our family hang upon your conduct yet yet there is time to prevent this desolation i am controlling my emotions i wish you to save us you all throw yourself at your cousins feet she is softhearted she may yet be yours  dear father it cannot be  thenthen welcome ruin exclaimed sir ratcliffe in a hoarse voice and he continued pausing between every word from the difficulty of utterance if the conviction that you have destroyed all our hopes rewarded us for all our affection our long devotion by blasting every fond idea that has ever illumined our sad lives that i and constance poor fools have clung and clung to if this conviction can console you sir enjoy it  ferdinand my son my child that i never have spoken an unkind word to that never gave me cause to blame or check him your mother will be home soon your poor poor mother do not let me welcome her with all this misery tell me it is not true recall what you have said let us forget these harsh words reconcile yourself to your cousin let us be happy  father if my hearts blood could secure your happiness my life were ready but this i cannot do  do you know what is at stake everything all all all we can see armine no more our home is gone your mother and myself must be exiles oh you have not thought of this say you have not thought of this  ferdinand hid his face his father emboldened urged the fond plea you will save us ferdinand you will be our preserver it is all forgotten is it not it is a lovers quarrel after all  father why should i trifle with your feelings why should i feign what can never be this sharp interview so long postponed ought not now to be adjourned indulge no hopes for there are none  then by every sacred power i revoke every blessing that since your birth i have poured upon your head i recall the prayers that every night i have invoked upon your being great god i cancel them you have betrayed your cousin you have deserted your mother and myself you have first sullied the honour of our house and now you have destroyed it why were you born what have we done that your mothers womb should produce such a curse sins of my father they are visited upon me and glastonbury what will glastonbury say glastonbury who sacrificed his fortune for you  mr glastonbury knows all sir and has always been my confidant  is he a traitor for when a son deserts me i know not whom to trust  he has no thoughts but for our welfare sir he will convince you sir i cannot marry my cousin  boy boy you know not what you say not marry your cousin then let us die it were better for us all to die  my father be calm i beseech you you have spoken harsh words i have not deserted you or my mother i never will if i have wronged my cousin i have severely suffered and she has most freely forgiven me she is my dear friend as for our house tell me would you have that house preserved at the cost of my happiness you are not the father i supposed if such indeed be your wish  happiness fortune family beauty youth a sweet and charming spirit if these will not secure a mans happiness i know not what might and these i wished you to possess  sir it is in vain for us to converse upon this subject see glastonbury if you will he can at least assure you that neither my feelings are light nor my conduct hasty i will leave you now  ferdinand quitted the room sir ratcliffe did not notice his departure although he was not unaware of it he heaved a deep sigh and was apparently plunged in profound thought     chapter xviii       ferdinand is arrested by messrs morris and levison and      taken to a spunginghouse  it must be confessed that the affairs of our friends were in a critical state everyone interested felt that something decisive in their respective fortunes was at hand and yet so vain are all human plans and calculations that the unavoidable crisis was brought about by an incident which no one anticipated it so happened that the stormy interview between sir ratcliffe and his son was overheard by a servant this servant who had been engaged by miss grandison in london was a member of a club to which a confidential clerk of messrs morris and levison belonged in the ensuing evening when this worthy knight of the shoulderknot just dropped out for an hour to look in at this choice society smoke a pipe and talk over the affairs of his mistress and the nation he announced the important fact that the match between miss grandison and captain armine was no go which for his part he did not regret as he thought his mistress ought to look higher the confidential clerk of messrs morris and levison listened in silence to this important intelligence and communicated it the next morning to his employers and so it happened that a very few days afterwards as ferdinand was lying in bed at his hotel the door of his chamber suddenly opened and an individual not of the most prepossessing appearance being much marked with smallpox reeking with gin and wearing topboots and a belcher handkerchief rushed into his room and enquired whether he were captain armine  the same said ferdinand and pray sir who are you  dont wish to be unpleasant was the answer but sir you are my prisoner  there is something exceedingly ignoble in an arrest ferdinand felt that sickness come over him which the uninitiated in such ceremonies must experience however he rallied and enquired at whose suit these proceedings were taken  messrs morris and levison sir  cannot i send for my lawyer and give bail  the bailiff shook his head you see sir you are taken in execution so it is impossible  and the amount of the debt  is 2800l sir  well what am i to do  why sir you must go along with us we will do it very quietly my follower is in a hackneycoach at the door sir you can just step in as pleasant as possible i suppose you would like to go to a house and then you can send for your friends you know  well if you will go down stairs i will come to you  the bailiff grinned cant let you out of my sight sir  why i cannot dress if you are here  the bailiff examined the room to see if there were any mode of escape there was no door but the entrance the window offered no chance well sir he said i likes to do things pleasant i can stand outside sir but you must be quick  ferdinand rang for his servant when louis clearly understood the state of affairs he was anxious to throw the bailiff out of the window but his master prevented him mr glastonbury had gone out some two hours ferdinand sent louis with a message to his family to say he was about leaving town for a few days and impressing upon him to be careful not to let them know in brookstreet what had occurred he completed his rapid toilet and accompanied the sheriffs officer to the hackneycoach that was prepared for him  as they jogged on in silence ferdinand revolved in his mind how it would be most advisable for him to act any application to his own lawyer was out of the question that had been tried before and he felt assured that there was not the slightest chance of that gentleman discharging so large a sum especially when he was aware that it was only a portion of his clients liabilities he thought of applying for advice to count mirabel or lord catchimwhocan but with what view he would not borrow the money of them even if they would lend it and as it was he bitterly reproached himself for having availed himself so easily of mr bond sharpes kind offices at this moment he could not persuade himself that his conduct had been strictly honourable to that gentleman he had not been frank in the exposition of his situation the money had been advanced under a false impression if not absolutely borrowed under a false pretence he cursed catchimwhocan and his levity the honour of the armines was gone like everything else that once belonged to them the result of ferdinands reflections was that he was utterly done up that no hope or chance of succour remained for him that his career was closed and not daring to contemplate what the consequences might be to his miserable parents he made a desperate effort to command his feelings  here the coach turned up a dingy street leading out of the lower end of oxfordstreet and stopped before a large but gloomy dwelling which ferdinands companion informed him was a spunginghouse i suppose you would like to have a private room sir you can have every accommodation here sir and feel quite at home i assure you  in pursuance of this suggestion captain armine was ushered into the best drawingroom with barred windows and treated in the most aristocratic manner it was evidently the chamber reserved only for unfortunate gentlemen of the utmost distinction it was amply furnished with a mirror a lootable and a very hard sofa the walls were hung with oldfashioned caricatures by bunbury the fireirons were of polished brass over the mantelpiece was the portrait of the master of the house which was evidently a speaking likeness and in which captain armine fancied he traced no slight resemblance to his friend mr levison and there were also some sources of literary amusement in the room in the shape of a hebrew bible and the racing calendar  after walking up and down the room for an hour meditating over the past for it seemed hopeless to trouble himself any further with the future ferdinand began to feel faint for it may be recollected that he had not even breakfasted so pulling the bellrope with such force that it fell to the ground a funny little waiter immediately appeared awed by the sovereign ring and having indeed received private intelligence from the bailiff that the gentleman in the drawingroom was a regular nob  and here perhaps i should remind the reader that of all the great distinctions in life none perhaps is more important than that which divides mankind into the two great sections of nobs and snobs it might seem at the first glance that if there were a place in the world which should level all distinctions it would be a debtors prison but this would be quite an error almost at the very moment that captain armine arrived at his sorrowful hotel a poor devil of a tradesman who had been arrested for fifty pounds and torn from his wife and family had been forced to repair to the same asylum he was introduced into what is styled the coffeeroom being a long low unfurnished sanded chamber with a table and benches and being very anxious to communicate with some friend in order if possible to effect his release and prevent himself from being a bankrupt he had continued meekly to ring at intervals for the last halfhour in order that he might write and forward his letter the waiter heard the coffeeroom bell ring but never dreamed of noticing it though the moment the signal of the private room sounded and sounded with so much emphasis he rushed upstairs three steps at a time and instantly appeared before our hero and all this difference was occasioned by the simple circumstance that captain armine was a nob and the poor tradesman a snob  i am hungry said ferdinand can i get anything to eat at this damned place  what would you like sir anything you choose sir mutton chop rump steak weal cutlet do you a fowl in a quarter of an hour roast or boiled sir  i have not breakfasted yet bring me some breakfast  yes sir said the little waiter tea sir coffee eggs toast buttered toast sir like any meat sir ham sir tongue sir like a devil sir  anything everything only be quick  yes sir responded the waiter beg pardon sir no offence i hope but custom to pay here sir shall be happy to accommodate you sir know what a gentleman is  thank you i will not trouble you said ferdinand get me that note changed  yes sir replied the little waiter bowing very low as he disappeared  gentleman in best drawingroom wants breakfast gentleman in best drawingroom wants change for a tenpound note breakfast immediately for gentleman in best drawingroom tea coffee toast ham tongue and a devil a regular nob  ferdinand was so exhausted that he had postponed all deliberation as to his situation until he had breakfasted and when he had breakfasted he felt dull it is the consequence of all meals in whatever light he viewed his affairs they seemed inextricable he was now in a spunginghouse he could not long remain here he must be soon in a gaol a gaol what a bitter termination of all his great plans and hopes what a situation for one who had been betrothed to henrietta temple he thought of his cousin he thought of her great fortune which might have been his perhaps at this moment they were all riding together in the park in a few days all must be known to his father he did not doubt of the result armine would immediately be sold and his father and mother with the wretched wreck of their fortune would retire to the continent what a sad vicissitude and he had done it all he their only child their only hope on whose image they had lived who was to restore the house he looked at the bars of his windows it was a dreadful sight his poor father his fond mother he was quite sure their hearts would break they never could survive all this misery this bitter disappointment of all their chopes little less than a year ago and he was at bath and they were all joy and triumph what a wild scene had his life been since o henrietta why did we ever meet that fatal fatal morning the cedar tree rose before him he recalled he remembered everything and poor glastonburyit was a miserable end he could not disguise it from himself he had been most imprudent he had been mad and yet so near happiness perfect perfect happiness henrietta might have been his and they might have been so happy this confinement was dreadful it began to press upon his nerves no occupation not the slightest resource he took up the racing calendar he threw it down again he knew all the caricatures by heart they infinitely disgusted him he walked up and down the room till he was so tired that he flung himself upon the hard sofa it was intolerable  a gaol must be preferable to this there must be some kind of wretched amusement in a gaol but this ignoble this humiliating solitude he was confident he should go mad if he remained here he rang the bell again  yes sir said the little waiter  this place is intolerable to me said captain armine i really am quite sick of it what can i do  the waiter looked a little perplexed  i should like to go to gaol at once said ferdinand  lord sir said the little waiter  yes i cannot bear this he continued i shall go mad  dont you think your friends will call soon sir  i have no friends said ferdinand i hope nobody will call  no friends said the little waiter who began to think ferdinand was not such a nob as he had imagined why if you have no friends sir it would be best to go to the fleet i think  by jove i think it would be better  master thinks your friends will call i am sure  nobody knows i am here said ferdinand  oh said the little waiter you want to let them know do you sir  anything sooner i wish to conceal my disgrace  o sir you are not used to it i dare say you never were nabbed before  certainly not  there it is if you will be patient you will see everything go well  never my good fellow nothing can go well  o sir you are not used to it a regular nob like you nabbed for the first time and for such a long figure sir sure not to be diddled never knowed such a thing yet friends sure to stump down sir  the greater the claim the more difficulty in satisfying it i should think said ferdinand  lord no sir you are not used to it it is only poor devils nabbed for their fifties and hundreds that are ever done up a nob was never nabbed for the sum you are sir and ever went to the wall trust my experience i never knowed such a thing  ferdinand could scarcely refrain from a smile even the conversation of the little waiter was a relief to him  you see sir continued that worthy morris and levison would never have given you such a deuce of a tick unless they knowed your resources trust morris and levison for that you done up sir a nob like you that morris and levison have trusted for such a tick lord sir you dont know nothing about it i could afford to give them fifteen shillings in the pound for their debt myself and a good days business too friends will stump down sir trust me  well it is some satisfaction for me to know that they will not and that morris and levison will not get a farthing  well sir said the incredulous little functionary when i find morris and levison lose two or three thousand pounds by a nob who is nabbed for the first time i will pay the money myself that is all i know  here the waiter was obliged to leave ferdinand but he proved his confidence in that gentlemans fortunes by his continual civility and in the course of the day brought him a stale newspaper it seemed to ferdinand that the day would never close the waiter pestered him about dinner eulogising the cook and assuring him that his master was famous for champagne although he had no appetite ferdinand ordered dinner in order to ensure the occurrence of one incident the champagne made him drowsy he was shown to his room and for a while he forgot his cares in sleep     chapter xix       the crisis rapidly advances  henrietta temple began once more to droop this change was not unnoticed by her constant companion lord montfort and yet he never permitted her to be aware of his observation all that he did was still more to study her amusement if possible to be still more considerate and tender miss grandison however was far less delicate she omitted no opportunity of letting miss temple know that she thought that henrietta was very unwell and that she was quite convinced henrietta was thinking of ferdinand nay she was not satisfied to confine these intimations to miss temple she impressed her conviction of henriettas indisposition on lord montfort and teased him with asking his opinion of the cause  what do you think is the cause miss grandison said his lordship very quietly  perhaps london does not agree with her but then when she was ill before she was in the country and it seems to me to be the same illness i wonder you do not notice it lord montfort a lover to be so insensible i am surprised  it is useless to notice that which you cannot remedy  why do you not call in those who can offer remedies said miss grandison why not send for sir henry  i think it best to leave henrietta alone said lord montfort  do you think it is the mind then said miss grandison  it may be said lord montford  it may be upon my word you are very easy  i am not indifferent miss grandison there is nothing that i would not do for henriettas welfare  oh yes there is there is something said miss grandison rather maliciously  you are really an extraordinary person miss grandison said lord montfort what can you mean by so strange an observation  i have my meaning but i suppose i may have a mystery as well as anybody else  a mystery miss grandison  yes a mystery lord montfort there is not a single individual in the three families who has not a mystery except myself but i have found out something i feel quite easy now we are all upon an equality  you are a strange person  it may be so but i am happy for i have nothing on my mind now that poor ferdinand has told sir ratcliffe we are not going to marry i have no part to play i hate deception it is almost as bitter as marrying one who is in love with another person  that must indeed be bitter and is that the reason that you do not marry your cousin enquired lord montfort  i may be in love with another person or i may not said miss grandison but however that may be the moment ferdinand very candidly told me he was we decided not to marry i think we were wise do not you lord montfort  if you are happy you were wise said lord montfort  yes i am pretty happy as happy as i can well be when all my best friends are miserable  are they  i think so my aunt is in tears my uncle in despair ferdinand meditates suicide henrietta is pining away and you who are the philosopher of the society you look rather grave i fancy i think we are a most miserable set  i wish we could be all happy said lord montfort  and so we might i think said miss grandison at least some of us  make us then said lord montfort  i cannot make you  i think you could miss grandison  at this moment henrietta entered and the conversation assumed a different turn  will you go with us to lady bellairs kate said miss temple the duchess has asked me to call there this morning  miss grandison expressed her willingness the carriage was waiting and lord montfort offered to attend them at this moment the servant entered with a note for miss grandison  from glastonbury she said dear henrietta he wishes to see me immediately what can it be go to lady bellairs and call for me on your return you must indeed and then we can all go out together  and so it was arranged miss temple accompanied by lord montfort proceeded to bellair house  dont come near me said the old lady when she saw them dont come near me i am in despair i do not know what i shall do i think i shall sell all my china do you know anybody who wants to buy old china they shall have it a bargain but i must have ready money ready money i must have do not sit down in that chair it is only made to look at oh if i were rich like you i wonder if my china is worth three hundred pounds i could cry my eyes out that i could the wicked men i should like to tear them to pieces why is not he in parliament and then they could not take him up they never could arrest charles fox i have known him in as much trouble as anyone once he sent all his furniture to my house from his lodgings he lodged in burystreet i always look at the house when i pass by dont fiddle the pens i hate people who fiddle where is gregory where is my bell where is the page naughty boy why do not you come there i do not want anything i do not know what to do the wicked men the greatest favourite i had he was so charming charming people are never rich he always looked melancholy i think i will send to the rich man i dine with but i forget his name why do not you tell me his name  my dear lady bellair what is the matter  dont ask me dont speak to me i tell you i am in despair oh if i were rich how i would punish those wicked men  can i do anything said lord montfort  i do not know what you can do i have got the tic i always have the tic when my friends are in trouble  who is in trouble lady bellair  my dearest friend the only friend i care about how can you be so hardhearted i called upon him this morning and his servant was crying i must get him a place he is such a good man and loves his master now do you want a servant you never want anything ask everybody you know whether they want a servant an honest man who loves his master there he is crying down stairs in gregorys room poor good creature i could cry myself only it is of no use  who is his master said lord montfort  nobody you know yes you know him very well it is my dear dear friend you know him very well the bailiffs went to his hotel yesterday and dragged him out of bed and took him to prison oh i shall go quite distracted i want to sell my china to pay his debts where is miss twoshoes continued her ladyship why dont you answer you do everything to plague me  miss grandison lady bellair  to be sure it is her lover  captain armine  have i not been telling you all this time they have taken him to prison  miss temple rose and left the room  poor creature she is quite shocked she knows him too said her ladyship i am afraid he is quite ruined there is a knock i will make a subscription for him i dare say it is my grandson he is very rich and very goodnatured  my dear lady bellair said lord montfort rising favour me by not saying a word to anybody at present i will just go in the next room to henrietta she is intimate with the family and much affected now my dear lady i entreat you continued his lordship do not say a word captain armine has good friends but do not speak to strangers it will do harm it will indeed  you are a good creature you are a good creature go away  lady frederick berrington my lady announced the page  she is very witty but very poor it is no use speaking to her i wont say a word go to miss thingabob go go and lord montfort escaped into the saloon as lady frederick entered  henrietta was lying on the sofa her countenance was hid she was sobbing convulsively  henrietta said lord montfort but she did not answer henrietta he again said dear henrietta i will do whatever you wish  save him save him she exclaimed oh you cannot save him and i have brought him to this ferdinand dearest ferdinand oh i shall die  for gods sake be calm said lord montfort there is nothing i will not do for you for him  ferdinand ferdinand my own own ferdinand oh why did we ever part why was i so unjust so wicked and he was true i cannot survive his disgrace and misery i wish to die  there shall be no disgrace no misery said lord montfort only for gods sake be calm there is a chattering woman in the next room hush hush i tell you i will do everything  you cannot you must not you ought not kind generous digby pardon what i have said forget it but indeed i am so wretched i can bear this life no longer  but you shall not be wretched henrietta you shall be happy everybody shall be happy i am armines friend i am indeed i will prove it on my honour i will prove that i am his best friend  you must not you are the last person you are indeed he is so proud anything from us will be death to him yes i know him he will die sooner than be under an obligation to either of us  you shall place him under still greater obligations than this said lord montfort yes henrietta if he has been true to you you shall not be false to him  digby digby speak not such strange words i am myself again i left you that i might be alone best and most generous of men i have never deceived you pardon the emotions that even you were not to witness  take my arm dearest let us walk into the garden i wish to speak to you do not tremble i have nothing to say that is not for your happiness at all times and under all circumstances the great object of my thoughts  he raised miss temple gently from the sofa and they walked away far from the observation of lady bellair or the auricular powers though they were not inconsiderable of her lively guest     chapter xx       in which ferdinand  receives more than one visit and finds      that adversity has not quite deprived him of his friends  in the mean time morning broke upon the unfortunate ferdinand he had forgotten his cares in sleep and when he woke it was with some difficulty that he recalled the unlucky incident of yesterday and could satisfy himself that he was indeed a prisoner but the bars of his bedroom window left him not very long in pleasing doubt  his friend the little waiter soon made his appearance slept pretty well sir same breakfast as yesterday sir tongue and ham sir perhaps you would like a kidney instead of a devil it will be a change  i have no appetite  it will come sir you ant used to it nothing else to do here but to eat better try the kidney sir is there anything you fancy  i have made up my mind to go to gaol today lord sir dont think of it something will turn up sir take my word  and sooth to say the experienced waiter was not wrong for bringing in the breakfast followed by an underling with a great pomp of plated covers he informed ferdinand with a chuckle that a gentleman was enquiring for him told you your friends would come sir  the gentleman was introduced and ferdinand beheld mr glastonbury  my dear glastonbury said ferdinand scarcely daring to meet his glance this is very kind and yet i wished to have saved you this  my poor child said glastonbury  oh my dear friend it is all over this is a more bitter moment for you even than for me kind friend this is a terrible termination of all your zeal and labours  nay said glastonbury let us not think of anything but the present for what are you held in durance  my dear glastonbury if it were only ten pounds i could not permit you to pay it so let us not talk of that this must have happened sooner or later it has come and come unexpectedly but it must be borne like all other calamities  but you have friends my ferdinand  would that i had not all that i wish now is that i were alone in the world if i could hope that my parents would leave me to myself i should be comparatively easy but when i think of them and the injury i must do them it is hell it is hell  i wish you would tell me your exact situation said mr glastonbury  do not let us talk of it does my father know of this  not yet  tis well he may yet have a happy day he will sell armine  glastonbury shook his head and sighed is it so bad he said  my dearest friend if you will know the worst take it i am here for nearly three thousand pounds and i owe at least ten more  and they will not take bail  not for this debt they cannot it is a judgment debt the only one  and they gave you no notice  none they must have heard somehow or other that my infernal marriage was off they have all waited for that and now that you see that affairs are past remedy let us talk of other topics if you will be so kind as to remain half an hour in this dungeon i shall quit it directly i shall go to gaol at once  poor glastonbury he did not like to go and yet it was a most melancholy visit what could they converse about conversation except on the interdicted subject of ferdinands affairs seemed quite a mockery at last ferdinand said dear glastonbury do not stay here it only makes us both unhappy send louis with some clothes for me and some books i will let you know before i leave this place upon reflection i shall not do so for two or three days if i can stay as long see my lawyer not that he will do anything nor can i expect him but he may as well call and see me adieu dear friend  glastonbury was about to retire when ferdinand called him back this affair should be kept quiet he said i told louis to say i was out of town in brookstreet i should be sorry were miss temple to hear of it at least until after her marriage  ferdinand was once more alone with the mirror the lootable the hard sofa the caricatures which he hated even worse than his hosts portrait the hebrew bible and the racing calendar it seemed a year that he had been shut up in this apartment instead of a day he had grown so familiar with every object and yet the visit of glastonbury had been an event and he could not refrain from pondering over it a spunginghouse seemed such a strange such an unnatural scene for such a character ferdinand recalled to his memory the tower at armine and all its glades and groves shining in the summer sun and freshened by the summer breeze what a contrast to this dingy confined close dungeon and was it possible that he had ever wandered at will in that fair scene with a companion fairer such thoughts might well drive a man mad with all his errors and all his disposition at present not to extenuate them ferdinand armine could not refrain from esteeming himself unlucky perhaps it is more distressing to believe ourselves unfortunate than to recognise ourselves as imprudent  a fond mistress or a faithful friend either of these are great blessings and whatever may be ones scrapes in life either of these may well be sources of consolation ferdinand had a fond mistress once and had henrietta temple loved him why he might struggle with all these calamities but that sweet dream was past as for friends he had none at least he thought not not that he had to complain of human nature he had experienced much kindness from mankind and many were the services he had received from kind acquaintances with the recollection of catch to say nothing of bond sharpe and above all count mirabel fresh in his mind he could not complain of his companions glastonbury was indeed a friend but ferdinand sighed for a friend of his own age knit to him by the same tastes and sympathies and capable of comprehending all his secret feelings a friend who could even whisper hope and smile in a spunginghouse  the day wore away the twilight shades were descending ferdinand became every moment more melancholy when suddenly his constant ally the waiter rushed into the room my eye sir here is a regular nob enquiring for you i told you it would be all right  who is it  here he is coming up  ferdinand caught the triumphant tones of mirabel on the staircase  which is the room show me directly ah armine mon ami mon cher is this your friendship to be in this cursed hole and not send for me cest une mauvaise plaisanterie to pretend we are friends how are you good fellow fine fellow excellent armine if you were not here i would quarrel with you there go away man the waiter disappeared and count mirabel seated himself on the hard sofa  my dear fellow continued the count twirling the prettiest cane in the world this is a b√™tise of you to be here and not send for me who has put you here  my dear mirabel it is all up  pah how much is it  i tell you i am done up it has got about that the marriage is off and morris and levison have nabbed me for all the arrears of my cursed annuities

fellow in the world but i have troubled my friends too much nothing will induce me to take a sou from you besides between ourselves not my least mortification at this moment is some 1500l which bond sharpe let me have the other day for nothing through catch  pah i am sorry about that though because he would have lent us this money i will ask bevil  i would sooner die  i will ask him for myself

good and kind i am so damned dull here it quite gladdens me to see you but do not talk about money  here is 500l four other fellows at 500l we can manage it  no more no more i beseech you  but you cannot stop here quel dr√¥le appartement before charley doricourt was in parliament he was always in this sort of houses but i got him out somehow or other i managed it once i bought of the fellow five hundred dozen of champagne  a new way to pay old debts certainly said ferdinand  i tell youhave you dined  i was going to merely to have something to do  i will stop and dine with you said the count ringing the bell and we will talk over affairs laugh my friend laugh my armine this is only a scene this is life what can we have for dinner man i shall dine here  gentlemans dinner is ordered my lord quite ready said the waiter champagne in ice my lord  to be sure everything that is good mon cher armine we shall have some fun  yes my lord said the waiter running down stairs dinner for best drawingroom directly greenpeasoup turbot beefsteak roast duck and boiled chicken everything that is good champagne in ice two regular nobs  the dinner soon appeared and the two friends seated themselves  potage admirable said count mirabel the best champagne i ever drank in my life mon brave your health this must be charleys man by the wine i think we will have him up he will lend us some money finest turbot i ever ate i will give you some of the fins ah you are glad to see me my armine you are glad to see your friend encore champagne good armine excellent armine keep up your spirits i will manage these fellows you must take some bifteac the most tender bifteac i ever tasted this is a fine dinner encore un verre man you may go dont wait  by jove mirabel i never was so glad to see anybody in my life now you are a friend i feel quite in spirits  to be sure always be in spirits cest une b√™tise not to be in spirits everything is sure to go well you will see how i will manage these fellows and i will come and dine with you every day until you are out you shall not be here eightandforty hours as i go home i will stop at mitchells and get you a novel by paul de kock have you ever read paul de kocks books  never said ferdinand  what a fortunate man to be arrested now you can read paul de kock by jove you are the most lucky fellow i know you see you thought yourself very miserable in being arrested tis the finest thing in the world for now you will read mon voisin raymond there are always two sides to a case  i am content to believe myself very lucky in having such a friend as you said ferdinand but now as these things are cleared away let us talk over affairs have you seen henrietta  of course i see her every day  i hope she will not know of my crash until she has married  she will not unless you tell her  and when do you think she will be married  when you please  cher ami point de moquerie  by jove i am quite serious exclaimed the count i am as certain that you will marry her as that we are in this damned spunginghouse  nonsense  the very finest sense in the world if you will not marry her i will myself for i am resolved that good montfort shall not it shall never be said that i interfered without a result why if she were to marry montfort now it would ruin my character to marry montfort after all my trouble dining with that good temple and opening the mind of that little grandison and talking fine things to that good duchess it would be a failure  what an odd fellow you are mirabel of course would you have me like other people and not odd we will drink la belle henriette fill up you will be my friend when you are married eh mon armine excellent gar√ßon how we shall laugh some day and then this dinner this dinner will be the best dinner we ever had  but why do you think there is the slightest hope of henrietta not marrying montfort  because my knowledge of human nature assures me that a young woman very beautiful very rich with a very high spirit and an only daughter will never go and marry one man when she is in love with another and that other one my dear fellow like you you are more sure of getting her because she is engaged  what a wonderful thing is a knowledge of human nature thought ferdinand to himself the counts knowledge of human nature is like my friend the waiters experience one assures me that i am certain to marry a woman because she is engaged to another person and the other that it is quite clear my debts will be paid because they are so large the count remained with his friend until eleven oclock when everybody was locked up he invited himself to dine with him tomorrow and promised that he should have a whole collection of french novels before he awoke and assuring him over and over again that he looked upon him as the most fortunate of all his friends and that if he broke the bank at crockys tonight which he fancied he should he would send him two or three thousand pounds at the same time he shook him heartily by the hand and descended the staircase of the spunginghouse humming vive la bagatelle     chapter xxi       the crisis  although when ferdinand was once more left alone to his reflections it did not appear to him that anything had occurred which should change his opinion of his forlorn lot there was something nevertheless inspiring in the visit of his friend count mirabel it did not seem to him indeed that he was one whit nearer extrication from his difficulties than before and as for the wild hopes as to henrietta he dismissed them from his mind as the mere fantastic schemes of a sanguine spirit and yet his gloom by some process difficult to analyse had in great measure departed it could not be the champagne for that was a remedy he had previously tried it was in some degree doubtless the magic sympathy of a joyous temperament but chiefly it might perhaps be ascribed to the flattering conviction that he possessed the hearty friendship of a man whose goodwill was in every view of the case a very enviable possession with such a friend as mirabel he could not deem himself quite so unlucky as in the morning if he were fortunate and fortunate so unexpectedly in this instance he might be so in others a vague presentiment that he had seen the worst of life came over him it was equally in vain to justify the consoling conviction or to resist it and ferdinand armine although in a spunginghouse fell asleep in better humour with his destiny than he had been for the last eight months  his dreams were charming he fancied that he was at armine standing by the barbary rosetree it was moonlight it was perhaps a slight recollection of the night he had looked upon the garden from the window of his chamber the night after he had first seen henrietta suddenly henrietta temple appeared at his window and waved her hand to him with a smiling face he immediately plucked for her a flower and stood with his offering beneath her window she was in a ridinghabit and she told him that she had just returned from italy he invited her to descend and she disappeared but instead of henrietta there came forward from the old placethe duchess who immediately enquired whether he had seen his cousin and then her grace by some confused process common in dreams turned into glastonbury and pointed to the rosetree where to his surprise katherine was walking with lord montfort ferdinand called out for henrietta but as she did not appear he entered the place where he found count mirabel dining by himself and just drinking a glass of champagne he complained to mirabel that henrietta had disappeared but his friend laughed at him and said that after such a long ride leaving italy only yesterday he could scarcely expect to see her satisfied with this explanation ferdinand joined the count at his banquet and was awakened from his sleep and his dream apparently by mirabel drawing a cork  ah why did he ever wake it was so real he had seen her so plainly it was life it was the very smile she wore at ducie that sunny glance so full of joy beauty and love which he could live to gaze on and now he was in prison and she was going to be married to another oh there are things in this world that may well break hearts  the cork of count mirabel was however a substantial sound a gentle tap at his door he answered it and the waiter entered his chamber  beg pardon sir for disturbing you only eight oclock  then why the deuce do you disturb me there has been another nob sir i said as how you were not up and he sent his compliments and said as how he would call in an hour as he wished to see you particular was it the count  no sir but it was a regular nob sir for he had a coronet on his cab but he would not leave his name  catch of course thought ferdinand to himself and sent by mirabel i should not wonder if after all they have broken the bank at crockys nothing shall induce me to take a ducat  however ferdinand thought fit to rise and contrived to descend to the best drawingroom about a quarter of an hour after the appointed time to his extreme surprise he found lord montfort  my dear friend said lord montfort looking a little confused i am afraid i have sadly disturbed you but i could not contrive to find you yesterday until it was so late that i was ashamed to knock them up here and i thought therefore you would excuse this early call as as as i wished to see you very much indeed  you are extremely kind said captain armine but really i much regret that your lordship should have had all this trouble  oh what is trouble under such circumstances replied his lordship i cannot pardon myself for being so stupid as not reaching you yesterday i never can excuse myself for the inconvenience you have experienced  ferdinand bowed but was so perplexed that he could not say a word  i hope my dear armine said his lordship advancing rather slowly putting his arm within that of ferdinand and then walking up and down the room together i hope you will act at this moment towards me as i would towards you were our respective situations changed  ferdinand bowed but said nothing  money you know my good fellow continued lord montfort is a disagreeable thing to talk about but there are circumstances which should deprive such conversation between us of any awkwardness which otherwise might arise  i am not aware of them my lord said ferdinand though your good feelings command my gratitude  i think upon reflection we shall find that there are some said lord montfort for the moment i will only hope that you will esteem those good feelings and which on my part i am anxious should ripen into sincere and intimate friendship as sufficient authority for my placing your affairs in general in that state that they may in future never deprive your family and friends of society necessary to their happiness  my lord i am sure that adversity has assumed a graceful hue with me for it has confirmed my most amiable views of human nature i shall not attempt to express what i feel towards your lordship for this generous goodness but i will say i am profoundly impressed with it not the less because i cannot avail myself in the slightest degree of your offer  you are too much a man of the world i am sure my dear armine to be offended by my frankness i shall therefore speak without fear of misconception it does appear to me that the offer which i have made you is worthy of a little more consideration you see my dear friend that you have placed yourself in such a situation that however you may act the result cannot be one completely satisfactory the course you should pursue therefore as indeed all conduct in this world should be is a matter of nice calculation have you well considered the consequences of your rushing upon ruin in the first place your family will receive a blow from which even future prosperity may not recover them your family estate already in a delicate position may be irrecoverably lost the worldly consequences of such a vicissitude are very considerable whatever career you pursue so long as you visibly possess armine you rank always among the aristocracy of the land and a family that maintains such a position however decayed will ultimately recover i hardly know an exception to this rule i do not think of all men that you are most calculated to afford one  what you say has long pressed itself upon us said captain armine  then again resumed lord montfort the feelings and even interests of your friends are to be considered poor glastonbury i love that old man myself the fall of armine might break his heart he would not like to leave his tower you see i know your place  poor glastonbury said ferdinand  but above all continued lord montfort the happiness nay the very health and life of your parents from whom all is now concealed would perhaps be the last and costliest sacrifices of your rashness  ferdinand threw himself on the sofa and covered his face  yet all this misery all these misfortunes may be avoided and you yourself become a calm and happy man byfor i wish not to understate your view of the subject armineputting yourself under a pecuniary obligation to me a circumstance to be avoided in the common course of life no doubt but is it better to owe me a favour and save your family estate preserve your position maintain your friend and prevent the misery and probable death of your parents or be able to pass me in the street in haughty silence if you please with the consciousness that the luxury of your pride has been satisfied at the cost of every circumstance which makes existence desirable  you put the case strongly said ferdinand but no reasoning can ever persuade me that i am justified in borrowing 3000l which i can never repay  accept it then  tis the same thing said ferdinand  i think not said lord montfort but why do you say never  because it is utterly impossible that i ever can  how do you know you may not marry a woman of large fortune said lord montfort now you seem to me exactly the sort of man who would marry an heiress  you are thinking of my cousin said ferdinand i thought that you had discovered or that you might have learnt that there was no real intention of our union  no i was not thinking of your cousin said lord montfort though to tell you the truth i was once in hopes that you would marry her however that i well know is entirely out of the question for i believe miss grandison will marry someone else  indeed exclaimed ferdinand a little agitated well may she be happy i love kate from the bottom of my heart but who is the fortunate fellow  tis a ladys secret said lord montfort but let us return to our argument to be brief either my dear armine you must be convinced by my reasoning or i must remain here a prisoner like yourself for to tell you the truth there is a fair lady before whom i cannot present myself except in your company  ferdinand changed countenance there wanted but this to confirm his resolution which had scarcely wavered to owe his release to henriettas influence with lord montfort was too degrading  my lord he said you have touched upon a string that i had hoped might have been spared me this conversation must indeed cease my mouth is sealed from giving you the reasons which nevertheless render it imperative on me to decline your generous offer  well then said lord montfort i must see if another can be more successful and he held forth a note to the astounded ferdinand in henriettas writing it dropped from ferdinands hand as he took it lord montfort picked it up gave it him again and walked to the other end of the room it was with extreme difficulty that ferdinand prevailed on himself to break the seal the note was short the hand that traced the letters must have trembled thus it ran  dearest ferdinanddo everything that digby wishes he is our best friend digby is going to marry katherine are you happy henrietta  lord montfort looked round ferdinand armine was lying senseless on the sofa  our friend was not of a swooning mood but we think the circumstances may excuse the weakness  as for lord montfort he rang the bell for the little waiter who the moment he saw what had occurred hurried away and rushed up stairs again with cold water a bottle of brandy and a blazing sheet of brown paper which he declared was an infallible specific by some means or other ferdinand was in time recovered and the little waiter was fairly expelled  my dear friend said ferdinand in a faint voice i am the happiest man that ever lived i hope you will be i am sure you will be katherine is an angel but i cannot speak it is so strange  my dear fellow you really must take a glass of brandy said lord montfort it is strange certainly but we are all happy  i hardly know where i am said ferdinand after a few minutes am i really alive  let us think how we are to get out of this place i suppose they will take my cheque if not i must be off  oh do not go said ferdinand if you go i shall not believe it is true my dear montfort is it really true  you see my dear armine said lord montfort smiling it was fated that i should marry a lady you rejected and to tell you the truth the reason why i did not get to you yesterday as i ought to have done was an unexpected conversation i had with miss grandison i really think this arrest was a most fortunate incident it brought affairs to a crisis we should have gone on playing at cross purposes for ever  here the little waiter entered again with a note and a packet  the same messenger brought them asked ferdinand  no sir the counts servant brought the note and waits for an answer the packet came by another person  ferdinand opened the note and read as follows   berkeleysquare halfpast 7 morning  mon amibest joke in the world i broke crockys bank three times of course i told you so i win 15000l directly i am awake i will send you the three thousand and i will lend you the rest till your marriage it will not be very long i write this before i go to bed that you may have it early adieu cher ami  votre affectionn√©  de mirabel   my arrest was certainly the luckiest incident in the world said ferdinand handing the note to lord montfort mirabel dined here yesterday and went and played on purpose to save me i treated it as a joke but what is this ferdinand opened the packet the handwriting was unknown to him ten bank notes of 300l each fell to the ground  do i live in fairyland he exclaimed now who can this be it cannot be you it cannot be mirabel it is wondrous strange  i think i can throw some light upon it said lord montfort katherine was mysteriously engaged with glastonbury yesterday morning they were out together and i know they went to her lawyers there is no doubt it is katherine i think under the circumstances of the case we need have no delicacy in availing ourselves of this fortunate remittance it will at least save us time said lord montfort ringing the bell send your master here directly he continued to the waiter  the sheriffs officer appeared the debt the fees all were paid and the discharge duly taken ferdinand in the meantime went up stairs to lock up his dressingcase the little waiter rushed after him to pack his portmanteau ferdinand did not forget his zealous friend who whispered hope when all was black the little waiter chuckled as he put his ten guineas in his pocket you see sir he said i was quite right knowed your friends would stump down fancy a nob like you being sent to quod fiddlededee you see sir you werent used to it  and so ferdinand armine bid adieu to the spunginghouse where in the course of less than eightandforty hours he had known alike despair and rapture lord montfort drove along with a gaiety unusual to him  now my dear armine he said i am not a jot the less in love with henrietta than before i love her as you love katherine what folly to marry a woman who was in love with another person i should have made her miserable when the great object of all my conduct was to make her happy now katherine really loves me as much as henrietta loves you i have had this plan in my head for a long time i calculated finely i was convinced it was the only way to make us all happy and now we shall all be related we shall be constantly together and we will be brother friends  ah my dear montfort said ferdinand what will mr temple say  leave him to me said lord montfort  i tremble said ferdinand if it were possible to anticipate difficulties today  i shall go to him at once said lord montfort i am not fond of suspense myself and now it is of no use all will be right  i trust only to you said ferdinand for i am as proud as temple he dislikes me and he is too rich for me to bow down to him  i take it upon myself said lord montfort mr temple is a calm sensible man you will laugh at me but the truth is with him it must be a matter of calculation on the one hand his daughters happiness a union with a family second to none in blood alliances and territorial position and only wanting his wealth to revive all its splendour on the other his daughter brokenhearted and a duke for his soninlaw mr temple is too sensible a man to hesitate particularly when i remove the greatest difficulty he must experience where shall i out you down berkeleysquare     chapter xxii       ferdinand meditates over his good fortune  in moments of deep feeling alike sudden bursts of prosperity as in darker hours man must be alone it requires some selfcommunion to prepare ourselves for good fortune as well as to encounter difficulty and danger and disgrace this violent and triumphant revolution in his prospects and his fortunes was hardly yet completely comprehended by our friend ferdinand armine and when he had left a note for the generous mirabel whose slumbers he would not disturb at this early hour even with good news he strolled along up charlesstreet and to the park in one of those wild and joyous reveries in which we brood over coming bliss and create a thousand glorious consequences  it was one of those soft summer mornings which are so delightful in a great city the sky was clear the air was bland the water sparkled in the sun and the trees seemed doubly green and fresh to one who so recently had gazed only on iron bars ferdinand felt his freedom as well as his happiness he seated himself on a bench and thought of henrietta temple he took out her note and read it over and over again it was indeed her handwriting restless with impending joy he sauntered to the bridge and leant over the balustrade gazing on the waters in charmed and charming vacancy how many incidents how many characters how many feelings flitted over his memory of what sweet and bitter experience did he not chew the cud fourandtwenty hours ago and he deemed himself the most miserable and forlorn of human beings and now all the blessings of the world seemed showered at his feet a beautiful bride awaited him whom he had loved with intense passion and who he had thought but an hour ago was anothers a noble fortune which would permit him to redeem his inheritance and rank him among the richest commoners of the realm was to be controlled by one a few hours back a prisoner for desperate debts the most gifted individuals in the land emulated each other in proving which entertained for him the most sincere affection what man in the world had friends like ferdinand armine ferdinand armine who two days back deemed himself alone in the world the unswerving devotion of glastonbury the delicate affection of his sweet cousin all the magnanimity of the highsouled montfort and the generosity of the accomplished mirabel passed before him and wonderfully affected him he could not flatter himself that he indeed merited such singular blessings and yet with all his faults which with him were but the consequences of his fiery youth ferdinand had been faithful to henrietta his constancy to her was now rewarded as for his friends the future must prove his gratitude to them  ferdinand armine had great tenderness of disposition and somewhat of a meditative mind schooled by adversity there was little doubt that his coming career would justify his favourable destiny  it was barely a year since he had returned from malta but what an eventful twelvemonth everything that had occurred previously seemed of another life all his experience was concentrated in that wonderful drama that had commenced at bath the last scene of which was now approaching the characters his parents glastonbury katherine henrietta lord montfort count mirabel himself and mr temple  ah that was a name that a little disturbed him and yet he felt confidence now in mirabels prescience he could not but believe that with time even mr temple might be reconciled it was at this moment that the sound of military music fell upon his ear it recalled old days parades and guards at malta times when he did not know henrietta temple times when as it seemed to him now he had never paused to think or moralise that was a mad life what a neapolitan ball was his career then it was indeed dancing on a volcano and now all had ended so happily oh could it indeed be true was it not all a dream of his own creation while his eye had been fixed in abstraction on that bright and flowing river but then there was henriettas letter he might be enchanted but that was the talisman  in the present unsettled though hopeful state of affairs ferdinand would not go home he was resolved to avoid any explanations until he heard from lord montfort he shrank from seeing glastonbury or his cousin as for henrietta it seemed to him that he never could have heart to meet her again unless they were alone count mirabel was the only person to whom he could abandon his soul and count mirabel was still in his first sleep  so ferdinand entered kensington gardens and walked in those rich glades and stately avenues it seems to the writer of this history that the inhabitants of london are scarcely sufficiently sensible of the beauty of its environs on every side the most charming retreats open to them nor is there a metropolis in the world surrounded by so many rural villages picturesque parks and elegant casinos with the exception of constantinople there is no city in the world that can for a moment enter into competition with it for himself though in his time something of a rambler he is not ashamed in this respect to confess to a legitimate cockney taste and for his part he does not know where life can flow on more pleasantly than in sight of kensington gardens viewing the silver thames winding by the bowers of rosebank or inhaling from its terraces the refined air of graceful richmond  in exactly ten minutes it is in the power of every man to free himself from all the tumult of the world the pangs of love the throbs of ambition the wear and tear of play the recriminating boudoir the conspiring club the rattling hell and find himself in a sublime sylvan solitude superior to the cedars of lebanon and inferior only in extent to the chestnut forests of anatolia kensington gardens is almost the only place that has realised his idea of the forests of spenser and ariosto what a pity that instead of a princess in distress we meet only a nurserymaid but here is the fitting and convenient locality to brood over our thoughts to project the great and to achieve the happy it is here that we should get our speeches by heart invent our impromptus muse over the caprices of our mistresses destroy a cabinet and save a nation  about the time that ferdinand directed his steps from these green retreats towards berkeleysquare a servant summoned miss temple to her father  is papa alone enquired miss temple  only my lord with him was the reply  is lord montfort here said miss temple a little surprised  my lord has been with master these three hours said the servant     chapter xxiii       ferdinand receives the most interesting invitation to      dinner ever offered to him  is not it wonderful said ferdinand when he had finished his history to count mirabel  not the least said the count i never knew anything less surprising tis exactly what i said tis the most natural termination in the world  ah my dear mirabel you are a prophet what a lucky fellow i am to have such a friend as you  to be sure you are take some more coffee what are you going to do with yourself  i do not know what to do with myself i really do not like to go anywhere until i have heard from montfort i think i shall go to my hotel i will drive you it is now three oclock but just at this moment mr bevil called on the count and another hour disappeared when they were fairly in the cabriolet there were so many places to call at and so many persons to see that it was nearly six oclock when they reached the hotel ferdinand ran up stairs to see if there were any letter from lord montfort he found his lordships card and also mr temples they had called about half an hour ago there was also a note these were its contents  grosvenorsquare thursday  my dear captain armine  i have prepared myself with this note as i fear i shall hardly be so fortunate as to find you at home it is only very recently that i have learnt from henrietta that you were in london and i much regret to hear that you have been so great an invalid it is so long since we met that i hope you will dine with us today and indeed i am so anxious to see you that i trust if you have unfortunately made any other engagement you may yet contrive to gratify my request it is merely a family party you will only meet our friends from st jamessquare and your own circle in brookstreet i have asked no one else save old lady bellair and your friend count mirabel and henrietta is so anxious to secure his presence that i shall be greatly obliged by your exerting your influence to induce him to accompany you as i fear there is little hope of finding him free  henrietta joins with me in kindest regards and i beg you to believe me  my dear captain armine  most cordially yours  pelham temple   well what is the matter said the count when ferdinand returned to the cabriolet with the note in his hand and looking very agitated  the strangest note said ferdinand  give it me said the count do you call that strange tis the most regular epistle i ever read i expected it tis an excellent fellow that mr temple i will certainly dine with him and send an excuse to that old castlefyshe a family party all right and he asks me that is proper i should not wonder if it ended by my being your trustee or your executor or your first childs godfather ah that good temple is a sensible man i told you i would settle this business for you you should hear me talk to that good temple i open his mind a family party it will be amusing i would not miss it for a thousand pounds besides i must go to take care of you for you will be committing all sorts of b√™tises i will give you one turn in the park jump in mon enfant good armine excellent fellow jump in you see i was right i am always right but i will confess to you a secret i never was so right as i have been in the present case tis the best business that ever was    chapter xxiv       some account of the party and its result  in spite of the count mirabels inspiring companionship it must be confessed that ferdinands heart failed him when he entered mr temples house indeed had it not been for the encouragement and jolly raillery of his lighthearted friend it is not quite clear that he would have succeeded in ascending the staircase a mist came over his vision as he entered the room various forms indeed glanced before him but he could distinguish none he felt so embarrassed that he was absolutely miserable it was mr temples hand that he found he had hold of the calm demeanour and bland tones of that gentleman somewhat reassured him mr temple was cordial and count mirabel hovered about ferdinand and covered his confusion then he recognised the duchess and his mother they were sitting together and he went up and saluted them he dared not look round for the lady of the house lady bellair was talking to his father at last he heard his name called by the count armine mon cher see this beautiful work and ferdinand advanced or rather staggered to a window where stood the count before a group and in a minute he clasped the hand of henrietta temple he could not speak katherine was sitting by her and lord montfort standing behind her chair but count mirabel never ceased talking and with so much art and tact that in a few moments he had succeeded in producing comparative ease on all sides  i am so glad that you have come today said henrietta her eyes sparkled with a strange meaning and then she suddenly withdrew her gaze the rose of her cheek alternately glowed and faded it was a moment of great embarrassment and afterwards they often talked of it  dinner however was soon announced as served for mirabel and ferdinand had purposely arrived at the last moment as the duke advanced to offer his arm to miss temple henrietta presented ferdinand with a flower as if to console him for the separation it was a round table the duchess and lady bellair sat on each side of mr temple the duke on the right hand of miss temple where there were so many members of the same family it was difficult to arrange the guests ferdinand held back when count mirabel who had secured a seat by henrietta beckoned to ferdinand and saying that lady bellair wished him to sit next to her pushed ferdinand as he himself walked away into the vacated seat henrietta caught the counts eye as he moved off it was a laughing eye  i am glad you sit next to me said lady bellair to the count because you are famous i love famous people and you are very famous why dont you come and see me now i have caught you at last and you shall come and dine with me the 7th 8th or 9th of next month i have dinner parties every day you shall dine with me on the 8th for then lady frederick dines with me and she will taste you you shall sit next to lady frederick and mind you flirt with her i wonder if you are as amusing as your grandfather i remember dancing a minuet with him at versailles seventy years ago  it is well recollected in the family said the count  ah you rogue said the little lady chuckling you lie i like a lie sometimes she resumed but then it must be a good one do you know i only say it to you but i am half afraid lies are more amusing than truth  naturally said the count because truth must in general be commonplace or it would not be true  in the meantime ferdinand was seated next to henrietta temple he might be excused for feeling a little bewildered indeed the wonderful events of the last fourandtwenty hours were enough to deprive anyone of a complete command over his senses what marvel then that he nearly carved his soup ate his fish with a spoon and drank water instead of wine in fact he was labouring under a degree of nervous excitement which rendered it quite impossible for him to observe the proprieties of life the presence of all these persons was insupportable to him five minutes alone with her in the woods of ducie and he would have felt quite reassured miss temple avoided his glance she was in truth as agitated as himself and talked almost entirely to the duke yet sometimes she tried to address him and say kind things she called him ferdinand that was quite sufficient to make him happy although he felt very awkward he had been seated some minutes before he observed that glastonbury was next to him  i am so nervous dear glastonbury said ferdinand that i do not think i shall be able to remain in the room  i have heard something said glastonbury with a smile that makes me quite bold  i cannot help fancying that it is all enchantment said ferdinand  there is no wonder my dear boy that you are enchanted said glastonbury  ferdinand said miss temple in a low voice papa is taking wine with you ferdinand looked up and caught mr temples kind salute  that was a fine horse you were riding today said count mirabel across the table to miss grandison  is it not pretty it is lord montforts  lord montforts thought ferdinand how strange all this seems  you were not of the riding party this morning said his grace to henrietta  i have not been very well this day or two said miss temple  well i think you are looking particularly well today replied the duke what say you captain armine  ferdinand blushed and looked confused at this appeal and muttered some contradictory compliments  oh i am very well now said miss temple  you must come and dine with me said lady bellair to count mirabel because you talk well across a table i want a man who talks well across a table so few can do it without bellowing i think you do it very well  naturally replied the count if i did not do it well i should not do it at all  ah you are audacious said the old lady i like a little impudence it is better to be impudent than to be servile  mankind are generally both said the count  i think they are said the old lady pray is the old duke of thingabob alive you know whom i mean he was an √©migr√© and a relation of yours  de crillon he is dead and his son too  he was a great talker said lady bellair but then he was the tyrant of conversation now men were made to listen as well as to talk  without doubt said the count for nature has given us two ears but only one mouth  you said that we might all be very happy whispered lord montfort to miss grandison what think you have we succeeded  i think we all look very confused said miss grandison what a fortunate idea it was inviting lady bellair and the count they never could look confused  watch henrietta said lord montfort  it is not fair how silent ferdinand is  yes he is not quite sure whether he is christopher sly or not said lord montfort what a fine embarrassment you have contrived miss grandison  nay digby you were the author of it i cannot help thinking of your interview with mr temple you were prompt  why i can be patient fair katherine said lord montfort but in the present instance i shrank from suspense more however for others than myself it certainly was a singular interview  and were you not nervous  why no i felt convinced that the interview could have only one result i thought of your memorable words i felt i was doing what you wished and that i was making all of us happy however all honour be to mr temple he has proved himself a man of sense  as the dinner proceeded there was an attempt on all sides to be gay count mirabel talked a great deal and lady bellair laughed at what he said and maintained her reputation for repartee her ladyship had been for a long time anxious to seize hold of her gay neighbour and it was evident that he was quite a favourite even ferdinand grew a little more at his ease he ventured to relieve the duke from some of his labours and carve for miss temple  what do you think of our family party said henrietta to ferdinand in a low voice  i can think only of one thing said ferdinand  i am so nervous she continued that it seems to me i shall every minute shriek and leave the room  i feel the same i am stupefied  talk to mr glastonbury drink wine and talk look look at your mother she is watching us she is dying to speak to you and so is some one else  at length the ladies withdrew ferdinand attended them to the door of the diningroom lady bellair shook her fan at him but said nothing he pressed his mothers hand goodbye cousin ferdinand said miss grandison in a laughing tone henrietta smiled upon him as she passed by it was a speaking glance and touched his heart the gentlemen remained behind much longer than was the custom in mr temples house everybody seemed resolved to drink a great deal of wine and mr temple always addressed himself to ferdinand if anything were required in a manner which seemed to recognise his responsible position in the family  anxious as ferdinand was to escape to the drawingroom he could not venture on the step he longed to speak to glastonbury on the subject which engrossed his thoughts but he had not courage never did a man who really believed himself the happiest and most fortunate person in the world ever feel more awkward and more embarrassed was his father aware of what had occurred he could not decide apparently henrietta imagined that his mother did by the observation which she had made at dinner then his father must be conscious of everything katherine must have told all were lord montforts family in the secret but what use were these perplexing enquiries it was certain that henrietta was to be his bride and that mr temple had sanctioned their alliance there could be no doubt of that or why was he there  at length the gentlemen rose and ferdinand once more beheld henrietta temple as he entered she was crossing the room with some music in her hand she was a moment alone he stopped he would have spoken but his lips would not move  well she said are you happy  my head wanders assure me that it is all true he murmured in an agitated voice  it is all true there go and speak to lady armine i am as nervous as you are  ferdinand seated himself by his mother  well ferdinand she said i have heard wonderful things  and i hope they have made you happy mother  i should indeed be both unreasonable and ungrateful if they did not but i confess to you my dear child i am even as much astonished as gratified  and my father he knows everything  everything but we have heard it only from lord montfort and katherine we have had no communication with anyone else and we meet here today in this extraordinary manner and but for them we should be completely in the dark  and the duchess do they know all  i conclude so  tis very strange is it not  i am quite bewildered  o mother is she not beautiful do you not love her shall we not all be the happiest family in the world  i think we ought to be dear ferdinand but i have not recovered from my astonishment ah my child why did you not tell me when you were ill  is it not for the best that affairs should have taken the course they have done but you must blame kate as well as me dear kate  i think of her said lady armine i hope kate will be happy  she must be dear mother only think what an excellent person is lord montfort  he is indeed an excellent person said lady armine but if i had been engaged to you ferdinand and it ended by my marrying lord montfort i should be very disappointed  the duchess would be of a different opinion said ferdinand  lady bellair who was sitting on a sofa opposite and had hitherto been conversing with the duchess who had now quitted her and joined the musicians began shaking her fan at ferdinand in a manner which signified her extreme desire that he should approach her  well lady bellair said ferdinand seating himself by her side  i am in the secret you know said her ladyship  what secret lady bellair  ah you will not commit yourself well i like discretion i have always seen it from the first no one has worked for you as i have i like true love and i have left her all my china in my will  i am sure the legatee is very fortunate whoever she may be  ah you rogue you know very well whom i mean you are saucy you never had a warmer friend than myself i always admired you you have a great many good qualities and a great many bad ones you always were a little saucy but i like a little spice of sauciness i think it takes i hear you are great friends with count thingabob the count whose grandfather i danced with seventy years ago that is right always have distinguished friends never have fools for friends they are no use i suppose he is in the secret too  really lady bellair i am in no secret you quite excite my curiosity  well i cant get anything out of you i see that however it all happened at my house that cant be denied i tell you what i will do i will give you all a dinner and then the world will be quite certain that i made the match  lady armine joined them and ferdinand seized the opportunity of effecting his escape to the piano  i suppose henrietta has found her voice again now whispered katherine to her cousin  dear katherine really if you are so malicious i shall punish you said ferdinand  well the comedy is nearly concluded we shall join hands and the curtain will drop  and i hope in your opinion not an unsuccessful performance  why i certainly cannot quarrel with the catastrophe said miss grandison  in the meantime the count mirabel had obtained possession of mr temple and lost no opportunity of confirming every favourable view which that gentleman had been influenced by lord montfort to take of ferdinand and his conduct mr temple was quite convinced that his daughter must be very happy and that the alliance on the whole would be productive of every satisfaction that he had ever anticipated  the evening drew on carriages were announced guests retired ferdinand lingered mr temple was ushering lady bellair the last guest to her carriage ferdinand and henrietta were alone they looked at each other their eyes met at the same moment there was but one mode of satisfactorily terminating their mutual embarrassments they sprang into each others arms ah that was a moment of rapture sweet thrilling rapid there was no need of words their souls vaulted over all petty explanations upon her lips her choice and trembling lips he sealed his gratitude and his devotion  the sound of footsteps was heard the agitated henrietta made her escape by an opposite entrance mr temple returned he met captain armine with his hat and enquired whether henrietta had retired and when ferdinand answered in the affirmative wished him goodnight and begged him to breakfast with them tomorrow     chapter xxv       which though final it is hoped will prove satisfactory  our kind reader will easily comprehend that from the happy day we have just noticed ferdinand armine was seldom absent from grosvenorsquare or from the society of henrietta temple both were so happy that they soon overcame any little embarrassment which their novel situation might first occasion them in this effort however they were greatly encouraged by the calm demeanour of lord montfort and the complacent carriage of his intended bride the world wondered and whispered marvelled and hinted but nothing disturbed lord montfort and katherine had the skill to silence raillery although it was settled that the respective marriages should take place as soon as possible the settlements necessarily occasioned delay by the application of his funded property and by a charge upon his yorkshire estates mr temple paid off the mortgages on armine which with a certain lifecharge in his own favour was settled in strict entail upon the issue of his daughter a certain portion of the income was to be set aside annually to complete the castle and until that edifice was ready to receive them ferdinand and henrietta were to live with mr temple principally at ducie which mr temple had now purchased  in spite however of the lawyers the eventful day at length arrived both happy couples were married at the same time and in the same place and glastonbury performed the ceremony lord and lady montfort departed for a seat in sussex belonging to his father ferdinand and henrietta repaired to armine while sir ratcliffe and his lady paid a visit to mr temple in yorkshire and glastonbury found himself once more in his old quarters in lancashire with the duke and duchess  once more at armine wandering once more together in the old pleasaunce it was so strange and sweet that both ferdinand and henrietta almost began to believe that it was well that the course of their true love had for a moment not run so smoothly as at present and they felt that their adversity had rendered them even more sensible of their illimitable bliss and the woods of ducie they were not forgotten nor least of all the old farmhouse that had been his shelter certainly they were the happiest people that ever lived and though some years have now passed since these events took place custom has not sullied the brightness of their love they have no cares now and yet both have known enough of sorrow to make them rightly appreciate their unbroken and unbounded blessings  when the honeymoon was fairly over for neither of them would bate a jot of this good oldfashioned privilege sir ratcliffe and lady armine returned to the place and glastonbury to his tower while mr temple joined them at ducie accompanied by lord and lady montfort the autumn also brought the count mirabel to slaughter the pheasants gay brilliant careless kindhearted as ever he has ever remained one of ferdinands most cherished friends indeed i hardly think that there is any individual to whom ferdinand is more attached and after all as the count often observes if it had not been for ferdinands scrapes they would not have known each other nor was lord catchimwhocan passed over ferdinand armine was not the man to neglect a friend or to forget a good service and he has conferred on that goodnatured though somewhat improvident young nobleman more substantial kindness than the hospitality which is always cheerfully extended to him when ferdinand repaid mr bond sharpe his fifteen hundred pounds he took care that the interest should appear in the shape of a golden vase which is now not the least gorgeous ornament of that worthys splendid sideboard the deer have appeared again too in the park of armine and many a haunch smokes on the epicurean table of clevelandrow  lady bellair is as lively as ever and bids fair to amuse society as long as the famous countess of desmond       who lived to the age of a hundred and ten      and died by a fall from a cherry tree then      what a frisky old girl  in her annual progresses through the kingdom she never omits laying under contribution every establishment of the three families in whose fortunes she was so unexpectedly mixed up as her ladyship persists in asserting and perhaps now really believes that both matches were the result of her matrimonial craft it would be the height of ingratitude if she ever could complain of the want of a hearty welcome  in the daily increasing happiness of his beloved daughter mr temple has quite forgotten any little disappointment which he might once have felt at not having a duke for a soninlaw and such a duke as his valued friend lord montfort but ferdinand armine is blessed with so sweet a temper that it is impossible to live with him and not love him and the most cordial intimacy and confidence subsist between the father of henrietta temple and his soninlaw from the aspect of public affairs also mr temple though he keeps this thought to himself is inclined to believe that a coronet may yet grace the brow of his daughter and that the barony of armine may be revived soon after the passing of the memorable act of 1828 lord montfort became the representative of his native county and an active and influential member of the house of commons after the reform mr armine was also returned for a borough situate near the dukes principal seat and although lord montfort and mr armine both adhere to the whig politics of their families they have both also in the most marked manner abstained from voting on the appropriation clause and there is little doubt that they will ultimately support that british and national administration which providence has doubtless in store for these outraged and distracted realms at least this is mr temples more than hope who is also in the house and acts entirely with lord stanley the montforts and the younger armines contrive through mutual visits and a town residence during the session to pass the greater part of their lives together they both honestly confess that they are a little in love with each others wives but this only makes their society more agreeable the family circle at armine has been considerably increased of late there is a handsome young armine who has been christened glastonbury a circumstance which repays the tenant of the tower for all his devotion and this blending of his name and memory with the illustrious race that has so long occupied his thoughts and hopes is to him a source of constant selfcongratulation the future sir glastonbury has also two younger brothers quite worthy of the blood temple and digby and the most charming sister in the world with large violet eyes and long dark lashes who is still in arms and who bears the hallowed name of henrietta and thus ends our love story
