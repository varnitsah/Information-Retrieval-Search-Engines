the missioner  book i  chapter i  mistress and agent   the lady of thorpe was bored these details as to leases and repairs were wearisome the phrases and verbiage confused her she felt obliged to take them in some measure for granted to accept without question the calmly offered advice of the man who stood so respectfully at the right hand of her chair  this agreement with philip crooks he remarked is a somewhat important document with your permission madam i will read it to you  she signified her assent and leaned wearily back in her chair the agent began to read his mistress watched him through half closed eyes his voice notwithstanding its strong country dialect had a sort of singsong intonation he read earnestly and without removing his eyes from the document his listener made no attempt to arrive at the sense of the string of words which flowed so monotonously from his lips she was occupied in making a study of the man sturdy and weatherbeaten neatly dressed in country clothes with a somewhat oldfashioned stock with trim grey sidewhiskers and a mouth which reminded her somehow of a wellbred foxhounds he represented to her in his clearly cut personality the changeless side of life the side of life which she associated with the mighty oaks in her park and the prehistoric rocks which had become engrafted with the soil of the hills beyond as she saw him now so had he seemed to her fifteen years ago only what a difference a volume to hera paragraph to him she had gone out into the worldrich intellectually inquisitive possessing most of the subtler gifts with which her sex is endowed and wherever the passionate current of life had flown the swiftest she had been there a leader always seeking ever to satisfy the unquenchable thirst for new experiences and new joys she had passed from girlhood to womanhood with every nerve of her body strained to catch the emotion of the moment always her fingers had been tearing at the cells of lifeand one by one they had fallen away this morning in the bright sunshine which flooded the great room she felt somehow tiredtired and withered her maid was a fool the two hours spent at her toilette had been wasted she felt that her eyes were hollow her cheeks pale fifteen years and the man had not changed a jot she doubted whether he had ever passed the confines of her estate she doubted whether he had even had the desire wind and sun had tanned his cheeks his eyes were clear his slight stoop was the stoop of the horseman rather than of age he had the air of a man satisfied with life and his place in itan attitude which puzzled her no one of her world was like that was it some inborn gift she wondered which he possessed some antidote to the worlds restlessness which he carried with him or was it merely lack of intelligence  he finished reading and folded up the pages to find her regarding him still with that air of careful attention with which she had listened to his monotonous flow of words he found her interest surprising it did not occur to him to invest it with any personal element  the agreement upon the whole he remarked is i believe a fair one you are perhaps thinking that those clauses  if the agreement is satisfactory to you she interrupted i will confirm it  he bowed slightly and glanced through the pile of papers upon the table  i do not think that there is anything else with which i need trouble you madam he remarked  she nodded imperiously  sit down for a moment mr hurd she said  if he felt any surprise he did not show it he drew one of the highbacked chairs away from the table and with that slight air of deliberation which characterized all his movements seated himself he was in no way disquieted to find her dark tired eyes still studying him  how old are you mr hurd she asked  i am sixtythree madam he answered  her eyebrows were gently raised to her it seemed incredible she thought of the men of sixtythree or thereabouts whom she knew and her lips parted in one of those faint rare smiles of genuine amusement which smoothed out all the lines of her tired face visions of the promenade at marienbad and carlsbad the kursaal at homburg floated before her she saw them all the men whom she knew with the story of their lives written so plainly in their faces babbling of nerves and tonics and cures the newest physician the latest fad defaulters all of them unwilling to pay the great debtseeking always a way out here at least this man scored  you enjoy good health she remarked  i never have anything the matter with me he answered simply i suppose he added as though by an afterthought the life is a healthy one  you find itsatisfying she asked  he seemed puzzled  i have never attempted anything else he answered it seems to be what i am suited for  she attempted to abandon the r√¥le of questionerto give a more natural turn to the conversation  it is always she remarked such a relief to get down into the country at the end of the season i wonder i dont spend more time here i daresay one could amuse oneself she added carelessly  mr hurd considered for a few moments  there are croquet and archery and tennis in the neighbourhood he remarked the golf course on the park hills is supposed to be excellent a great many people come over to play  she affected to be considering the question seriously an intimate friend would not have been deceived by her air of attention mr hurd knew nothing of this he on his part however was capable of a little gentle irony  it might amuse you he remarked to make a tour of your estate there are some of the outlying portions which i think that i should have the honour of showing you for the first time  i might find that interesting she admitted by the bye mr hurd what sort of a landlord am i am i easy or do i exact my last pound of flesh one likes to know these things  it depends upon the tenant the agent answered there is not one of your farms upon which if a man works he cannot make a living on the other hand there is not one of them on which a man can make a living unless he works it is upon this principle that your rents have been adjusted the tenants of the home lands have been most carefully chosen and thorpe itself is spoken of everywhere as a model village  it is very charming to look at its mistress admitted the flowers and thatched roofs are so picturesque quite a pastoral idyll my guests tell me the people one sees about seem contented and respectful too  they should be madam mr hurd answered drily the villagers have had a good many privileges from your family for generations  the lady inclined her head thoughtfully  you think then she remarked that if anything should happen in england like the french revolution i should not find unexpected thoughts and discontent smouldering amongst them you believe that they are really contented  mr hurd knew nothing about revolutions and he was utterly unable to follow the trend of her thoughts  if they were not madam he declared they would deserve to be in the workhouseand i should feel it my duty to assist them in getting there  the lady of thorpe laughed softly to herself  you too then mr hurd she said you are content with your life you dont mind my being personal do you it is such a change down here such a different existence  and i like to understand everything  upon mr hurd the almost pathetic significance of those last words was wholly wasted they were words of a language which he could not comprehend he realized only their direct applicationand the woman to him seemed like a child  if i were not content madam he said i should deserve to lose my place i should deserve to lose it he added after a moments pause notwithstanding the fact that i have done my duty faithfully for four and forty years  she smiled upon him brilliantly they were so far apart that she feared lest she might have offended him  i have always felt myself a very fortunate woman mr hurd she said in having possessed your services  he rose as though about to go it was her whim however to detain him  you lost your wife some years ago did you not mr hurd she began tentatively as a matter of fact she was not sure of her ground  seven years back madam he answered with immovable face she was unfortunately never a strong woman  and your son she asked more confidently is he back from south africa  a year ago madam he answered he is engaged at present in the estate office he knows the work well  the best place for him of course she interrupted we ought to do all we can for our young men who went out to the war i should like to see your son mr hurd will you tell him to come up some day  certainly madam he answered  perhaps he would like to shoot with my guests on thursday she suggested graciously  mr hurd did not seem altogether pleased  it has never been the custom madam he remarked for either my son or myself to be associated with the thorpe shooting parties  some customs she remarked pleasantly are well changed even in thorpe we shall expect him  mr hurds mouth reminded her for a moment of a steel trap she could see that he disapproved but she had no intention of giving way he began to tie up his papers and she watched him with some continuance of that wave of interest which he had somehow contrived to excite in her the signature of one of the letters which he was methodically folding caught her attention  what a strange name she remarked victor macheson who is he  mr hurd unfolded the letter the ghost of a smile flickered upon his lips  a preacher apparently he answered the letter is one asking permission to give a series of what he terms religious lectures in harrisons large barn  her eyebrows were gently raised her tone was one of genuine surprise  what in thorpe she demanded  in thorpe mr hurd acquiesced  she took the letter and read it her perplexity was in no manner diminished  the man seems in earnest she remarked he must either be a stranger to this part of the country or an extremely impertinent person i presume mr hurd that nothing has been going on in the place with which i am unacquainted  certainly not madam he answered  there has been no drunkenness she remarked the young people have i presume been conducting their lovemaking discreetly  the lines of mr hurds mouth were a trifle severe one could imagine that he found her modern directness of speech indelicate  there have been no scandals of any sort connected with the village madam he assured her to the best of my belief all of our people are industrious sober and pious they attend church regularly as you know we have not a publichouse or a dissenting place of worship in the village  the man must be a fool she said deliberately you did not of course give him permission to hold these services  certainly not the agent answered i refused it absolutely  the lady rose and mr hurd understood that he was dismissed  you will tell your son about thursday she reminded him  i will deliver your message madam he answered  she nodded her farewell as the footman opened the door  everything seems to be most satisfactory mr hurd she said i shall probably be here for several weeks so come up again if there is anything you want me to sign  i am much obliged madam the agent answered  he left the place by a side entrance and rode slowly down the private road fringed by a magnificent row of elm trees to the village the latch of the iron gate at the end of the avenue was stiff and he failed to open it with his hunting crop at the first attempt just as he was preparing to try again a tall boyishlooking young man dressed in sombre black came swiftly across the road and opened the gate mr hurd thanked him curtly and the young man raised his hat  you are mr hurd i believe he remarked i was going to call upon you this afternoon  the little man upon the pony frowned he had no doubt as to his questioner  my name is hurd sir he answered stiffly what can i do for you  you can let me have that barn for my services the other answered smiling i wrote you about it you know my name is macheson  mr hurds answer was briefly spoken and did not invite argument  i have mentioned the matter to miss thorpehatton sir she agrees with me that your proposed ministrations are altogether unneeded in this neighbourhood  you wont let me use the barn then the young man remarked pleasantly but with some air of disappointment  mr hurd gathered up the reins in his hand  certainly not sir  he would have moved on but his questioner stood in the way mr hurd looked at him from underneath his shaggy eyebrows the young man was remarkably young his smooth beardless face was the face of a boy only the eyes seemed somehow to speak of graver things they were very bright indeed and they did not falter  mr hurd he begged do let me ask you one question why do you refuse me what harm can i possibly do by talking to your villagers  mr hurd pointed with his whip up and down the country lane  this is the village of thorpe sir he answered there are no poor there is no publichouse and there within a few hundred yards of the farthest cottage he added pointing to the end of the street is the church you are not needed here that is the plain truth  the young man looked up and down at the flowerembosomed cottages with their thatched roofs and trim appearance at the neatly cut hedges the wellkept road the many signs of prosperity he looked at the little grey church standing in its ancient walled churchyard where the road divided a very delightful addition to the picturesque beauty of the place he looked at all these things and he sighed  mr hurd he said you are a man of experience you know very well that material and spiritual welfare are sometimes things very far apart  mr hurd frowned and turned his ponys head towards home  i know nothing of the sort sir he snapped what i do know is that we dont want any salvation army tricks here you should stay in the cities they like that sort of thing there  i must come where i am sent mr hurd the young man answered i cannot do your people any harm i only want to deliver my messageand go  mr hurd wheeled his pony round  i submitted your letter to miss thorpehatton he said she agrees with me that your ministrations are wholly unnecessary here i wish you good evening  the young man caught for a moment at the ponys rein  one moment sir he begged you do not object to my appealing to miss thorpehatton herself  a grim mirthless smile parted the agents lips  by no means he answered as he cantered off  victor macheson stood for a moment watching the retreating figure then he looked across the park to where through the great elm avenues he could catch a glimpse of the house a humorous smile suddenly brightened his face  its got to be done he said to himself here goes     chapter ii  the hunter and his quarry   the mistress of thorpe stooped to pat a black pomeranian which had rushed out to meet her it was when she indulged in some such movement that one realized more thoroughly the wonderful grace of her slim supple figure she who hated all manner of exercise had the ease of carriage and flexibility of one whose life had been spent in athletic pursuits  how are you all she remarked languidly shocking hostess am i not  a fairhaired little woman turned away from the teatable she held a chocolate √©clair in one hand and a cup of russian tea in the other her eyes were very dark and her hair very yellowand both were perfectly and unexpectedly natural her real name was lady margaret penshore but she was known to her intimates and to the mysterious individuals who write under a nomdeguerre in the society papers as lady peggy  a little casual perhaps my dear wilhelmina she remarked comes from your association with royalty i suppose try one of your own caviare sandwiches if you want anything to eat theyre ripping  wilhelminashe was one of the few women of her set with whose christian name no one had ever attempted to take any libertiesapproached the teatable and studied its burden there were a dozen different sorts of sandwiches arranged in the most tempting form hotwater dishes with delicately browned teacakes simmering gently thick cream in silver jugs tea and coffee and in the background old china dishes piled with freshly gathered strawberries and peaches and grapes on which the bloom still rested on a smaller table were flasks of liqueurs and a spirit decanter  anyhow she remarked pouring herself out some tea i do feed you people well and as to being casual i warned you that i never put in an appearance before five  a man in the background long and lanternfaced a man whose age it would have been as impossible to guess as his character opened and closed his watch with a clink  twenty minutes past he remarked to be exact twentytwo minutes past  his hostess turned and regarded him contemplatively  how painfully precise she remarked somehow it doesnt sound convincing though your watch is probably like your morals  what a flattering simile he murmured  flattering  it presupposes at any rate their existence he explained it is years since i was reminded of them  wilhelmina seated herself before an open cardtable  no doubt she answered you see i knew you when you were a boy seriously she continued i have been engaged with my agent for the last halfhoura most interesting person i can assure you there was an agreement with one philip crooks concerning a farm which he felt compelled to read to meevery word of it come along and cut all of you  the fourth person slim fairhaired the typical army officer and country house habitu√© came over to the table followed by the lanternjawed man lady peggy also turned up a card  you and i gilbert wilhelmina remarked to the elder man heres luck to us what on earth is that you are drinking  absinthe he answered calmly i have been trying to persuade austin to join me but it seems they dont drink absinthe in the army  i should think not indeed his hostess answered and you my partner too put the stuff away  gilbert deyes raised his glass and looked thoughtfully into its opalescent depths  ah my dear lady he said you make a great mistake when you number absinthe amongst the ordinary intoxicating beverages i tell you that the man who invented it was an epicure in sensations andergastronomy if only de quincey had realized the possibility of absinthe he would have given us jewelled prose indeed  wilhelmina yawned  bother de quincey she declared its your bridge im thinking of  dear lady you need have no anxiety deyes answered reassuringly one does not trifle with ones livelihood you will find me capable of the most daring finesses the most wonderful coups i shall not revoke i shall not lead out of the wrong hand my declarations will be touched with genius the rubber in fact is already won vive labsinthe  the rubber will never be begun if you go on talking nonsense much longer lady peggy declared tapping the table impatiently i believe i hear the motors outside we shall have the whole crowd here directly  they wont find their way here their hostess assured them calmly my deal i believe  they played the hand in silence at its conclusion wilhelmina leaned back in her chair and listened  you were right peggy she said they are all in the hall i can hear your brothers voice  lady peggy nodded  sounds healthy doesnt it  gilbert deyes leaned across to the side table and helped himself to a cigarette  healthy i call it boisterous he declared where have they all been  motoring somewhere wilhelmina answered they none of them have any idea how to pass the time away until the first run  sport my dear hostess deyes remarked is the one thing which makes life in a country house almost unendurable  wilhelmina shrugged her shoulders  thats all very well gilbert she said but what should we do if we couldnt get rid of some of these lunatics for at least part of the day  reasonable i admit deyes answered but think what an intolerable nuisance they make of themselves for the other part i double no trumps lady peggy  lady peggy laid down her cards  for goodness sake no more digressions she implored remember please that i play this game for the peace of mind of my tradespeople i redouble  the hand was played almost in silence lady peggy lost the odd trick and began to add up the score with a gentle sigh  after all her partner remarked returning to the subject which they had been discussing i dont think that we could get on very well in this country without sport of some sort  of course not deyes answered we are all sportsmen every one of us we were born so only while some of us are content to wreak our instinct for destruction upon birds and animals others choose the nobler gameour fellowcreatures to hunt or trap a human being is finer sport than to shoot a rocketing pheasant or to come in from hunting with mud all over our clothes smelling of ploughed fields steaming in front of the fire telling lies about our exploitsall undertaken in pursuit of a miserable little animal which as often as not outwits us and which in an ordinary way we wouldnt touch with gloves on what do you say lady peggy  youre getting beyond me she declared it sounds a little savage  deyes dealt the cards slowly talking all the while  sport is savage he declared no one can deny it whether the quarry be human or animal the end is death but of all its varieties give me the hunting of man by man the brain of the hunter coping with the wiles of the hunted both human both of the same order the games even then for at any moment they may change placesthe hunter and his quarry its finer work than slaughtering birds at the coverside it gives your sex a chance lady peggy  it sounds exciting she admitted  it is he answered  his hostess looked up at him languidly  you speak like one who knows  why not he murmured i have been both quarry and hunter most of us have more or less i declare hearts  again there was an interval of silence broken only by the stock phrases of the game and the soft patter of the cards upon the table once more the hand was played out and the cards gathered up captain austin delivered his quota to the general discussion  after all he said if it wasnt for sport our country houses would be useless  not at all deyes declared country houses should exist for  for what mr deyes do tell us lady peggy implored  for bridge he declared for giving weary married people the opportunity for divorce and as an asylum from ones creditors  wilhelmina shook her head as she gathered up her cards  you are not at your best today gilbert she said the allusion to creditors is prehistoric no one has them nowadays society is such a hopscotch affair that our coffers are never empty  what a utopian sentiment lady peggy murmured  we cant agree can we deyes whispered in her ear  you why they say that you are worth a million she protested  if i am i remain poor for i cannot spend it he declared  why not his hostess asked him from across the table  because he answered i am cursed with a single vice trailing its way through a labyrinth of virtues i am a miser  lady peggy laughed incredulously  rubbish she exclaimed  dear lady it is nothing of the sort he answered shaking his head sadly i have felt it growing upon me for years besides it is hereditary my mother opened a postoffice savings bank account for me at an early age i engineered a corner in marbles and sold out at a huge profit i am like the starving dyspeptic at the rich mans feast  captain austin intervened  i declare diamonds he announced and the hand proceeded  wilhelmina leaned back in her chair as the last trick fell her eyes were turned towards the window she could just see the avenue of elms down which her agent had ridden a short while since deyes through half closed eyes watched her with some curiosity  if one dared offer a trifling coin of the realm he murmured  i was thinking of your theory she interrupted according to you i suppose the whole world is made up of hunters and their quarry can you tell i wonder by looking at people to which order they belong  it is easy he answered yet you must remember we are continually changing places the man who cracks the whip today is the hunted beast tomorrow the woman who mocks at her lover this afternoon is often the slavebearer when dusk falls swift changes like this are like rain upon the earth they keep us at any rate out of the asylums  wilhelmina was still looking out of the window up the great avenue in and out amongst the tree trunks but moving always with swift buoyant footsteps towards the house came a slim dark figure soberly dressed in illfitting clothes he walked with the swing of early manhood his head was thrown back and he carried his hat in his hand she leaned forward to watch him more closelyhe seemed to have associated himself in some mysterious manner with the mocking words of gilbert deyes half maliciously she drew his attention to the swiftly approaching figure  come my friend of theories she said mockingly there is a stranger there the young man who walks so swiftly to which of your two orders does he belong  deyes looked out of the windowa brief careless glance  to neither he answered his time has not come yet but he has the makings of both     chapter iii  first blood   a footman entered the room a few minutes later and obedient without a doubt to some previously given command waited behind his mistress chair until a hand had been played when it was over she spoke to him without turning her head  what is it perkins she asked  he bent forward respectfully  there is a young gentleman here madam who wishes to see you most particularly he has no card but he said that his name would not be known to you  tell him that i am engaged wilhelmina said he must give you his name and tell you what business he has come upon  very good madam the man answered and withdrew  he was back again before the next hand had been played once more he stood waiting in respectful silence  well his mistress asked  his name madam is mr victor macheson he said that he would wait as long as you liked but he preferred telling you his business himself  i fancy that i know it wilhelmina answered you can show him in here  is it the young man i wonder lady peggy remarked who came up the avenue as though he were walking on air  doubtless wilhelmina answered he is some sort of a missionary i had him shown in here because i thought his coming at all an impertinence and i want to make him understand it you will probably find him amusing mr deyes  gilbert deyes shook his head quietly  there was a time he murmured when the very word missionary was a fingerpost to the ridiculous the comic papers rob us however of our elementary sources of humour  they all looked curiously towards the door as he entered all except wilhelmina who was the last to turn her head and found him hesitating in some embarrassment as to whom to address he was somewhat above medium height fair with a mass of windtossed hair and had the smooth face of a boy his eyes were his most noticeable feature they were very bright and very restless lady peggy called them afterwards uncomfortable eyes and the others without any explanation understood what she meant  i am miss thorpehatton wilhelmina said calmly i am told that you wished to see me  she turned only her head towards him her words were cold and unwelcoming she saw that he was nervous and she had no pity it was unworthy of her she knew that her eyes questioned him calmly sitting there in her light muslin dress with her deepbrown hair arranged in the madonnalike fashion which chanced to be the caprice of the moment she herselfone of londons most beautiful womenseemed little more than a girl  i beg your pardon he began hurriedly i understoodi expected  well  the monosyllable was like a drop of ice a faint spot of colour burned in his cheeks he understood now that for some reason this woman was inimical to him the knowledge seemed to have a bracing effect his eyes flashed with a sudden fire which gave force to his face  i expected he continued with more assurance to have found miss thorpehatton an older lady  she said nothing only her eyebrows were very slightly raised she seemed to be asking him silently what possible concern the age of the lady of thorpehatton could be to him he was to understand that his remark was almost an impertinence  i wished he said to hold a service in thorpe on sunday afternoon and also one during the week and i wrote to your agent asking for the loan of a barn which is generally i believe used for any gathering of the villagers mr hurd found himself unable to grant my request i have ventured to appeal to you  mr hurd she said calmly decided in my opinion quite rightly i do not see what possible need my villagers can have of further religious services than the church affords them  madam he answered i have not a word to say against your parish church or against your excellent vicar yet i believe and the body to which i am attached believes that change is stimulating we believe that the great truths of life cannot be presented to our fellowcreatures too often or in too many different ways  and what she asked with a faint curl of her beautiful lips do you consider the great truths of life  madam he answered with slightly reddening cheeks they vary for every one of us according to our capacity and our circumstances what they may mean he added after a moments hesitation to people of your social order i do not know it has not come within the orbit of my experience it was your villagers to whom i was proposing to talk  there was a moments silence gilbert deyes and lady peggy exchanged swift glances of amused understanding wilhelmina bit her lip but she betrayed no other sign of annoyance  to what religious body do you belong she asked  my friends he answered and i are attached to none of the recognized denominations our only object is to try to keep alight in our fellowcreatures the flame of spirituality we want to help themnot to forget  there is no name by which you call yourselves she asked  none he answered  and your headquarters are where she asked  in gloucestershire he answeredso far as we can be said to have any headquarters at all  you have no churches then she asked  any building he answered where the people are to whom we desire to speak is our church we look upon ourselves as missioners only  i am afraid wilhelmina said quietly that i am only wasting your time in asking these questions still i should like to know what induced you to choose my village as an appropriate sphere for your labours  we each took a county he answered leicestershire fell to my lot i selected thorpe to begin with because i have heard it spoken of as a model village  wilhelminas forehead was gently wrinkled  i am afraid she said that i am a somewhat dense person your reason seems to me scarcely an adequate one  our belief is he declared that where material prosperity is assured especially amongst this class of people the instincts towards spirituality are weakened  my people all attend church we have no publichouse there are never any scandals she said  all these things he admitted are excellent but they do not help you to see into the lives of these people churchgoing may become a habit a respectable and praiseworthy thingand a thing expected of them morality too may become a customuntil temptation comes one must ask oneself what is the force which prompts these people to direct their lives in so praiseworthy a manner  you forget she remarked that these are simple folk their religion with them is simply a matter of right or wrong they need no further instruction in this  madam he said so long as they are living here that may be so frankly i do not consider it sufficient that their lives are seemly so long as they live in the shadow of your patronage what happens to those who pass outside its influence is another matter  what do you know about that she asked coldly  what i do know about it he answered decided me to come to thorpe  there was a moments silence any of the other three gilbert deyes especially perhaps would have found it hard to explain even to realize the interest with which they listened to the conversation between these twothe somewhat unkempt illattired boy with the nervous forceful manner and burning eyes and the woman so sure of herself so coldly and yet brutally ungracious it was not so much the words themselves that passed between them that attracted as the undernote of hostility more felt than apparentthe beginning of a duel to all appearance so ludicrously onesided yet destined to endure deyes turned in his chair uneasily he was watching this intrudera being outwardly so far removed from their world the niceties of a correct toilet had certainly never troubled him his clothes were rough in material and cut he wore a flannel shirt and a collar so low that his neck seemed illshaped he had no special gifts of features or figure his manner was nervous his speech none too ready deyes found himself engaged in a swift analysis of the subtleties of personality what did this young man possess that he should convey so strong a sense of power there was something about him which told they were all conscious of it and more than any of them the woman who was regarding him with such studied illfavour to the others her still beautiful face betrayed only some languid irritation deyes fancied that he saw more therethat underneath the mask which she knew so well how to wear there were traces of some deeper disturbance  do you mind explaining yourself she asked that sounds rather an extraordinary statement of yours  a few months ago he said i attended regularly one of the police courts in london day by day i came into contact with the lost souls who have drifted on to the great rubbishheap there was a girl martha gullimore her name was whose record for her age was as black as sin could make it her father i believe is the blacksmith in your model village i spoke to him of his daughter yesterday and he cursed me  you mean samuel gullimoremy farrier she asked  that is the man he answered  have you any otherinstances she asked  more than one i am sorry to say he replied there were two young men who left here only a year agoone is the son of your gardener the other was brought up by his uncle at your lodge gates i was instrumental in saving them from prison a few months ago one we have shipped to canadathe other i am sorry to say has relapsed we did what we could but beyond a certain point we cannot go  she leaned her head for a moment upon the slim white fingers of her right hand innocent of rings save for one great emerald whose gleam of colour was almost barbaric in its momentary splendour her face had hardened a little her tone was almost an offence  you would have me believe then she said that my peaceful village is a veritable den of iniquity  not i he answered brusquely only i would have you realize that roses and honeysuckle and regular wages the appurtenances of material prosperity are after all things of little consequence they hear the song of the world these people in their leisure moments their young men and girls are no stronger than their fellows when temptation comes  deyes leaned suddenly forward in his chair he felt that his intervention dissipated a dramatic interest of which he was keenly conscious but he could not keep silence any longer  to follow out your argument sir to its logical conclusion he said why not aim higher still it is your contention is it not that the seeds of evil things are sown in indifference that prosperity might even tend towards their propagation why not direct your energies then towards the men and women of society there is plenty of scope here for your labours  the young man turned towards him the lines of his mouth had relaxed into a smile of tolerant indifference  i have no sympathy sir he answered with the class you name on a sinking ship the cry is always save the women and children it is the less fortunate in the worlds possessions who represent the women and children of shipwrecked morality it is for their betterment that we work  deyes sighed gently  it is a pity he declared i am convinced that there is a magnificent opening for mission work amongst the idle classes  no doubt the young man agreed quickly the question is whether the game is worth the candle  deyes made no reply lady peggy was laughing softly to herself  i have heard all that you have to say mr macheson the mistress of thorpe said calmly and i can only repeat that i think your presence here as a missioner most unnecessary i consider it in fact an  she hesitated with a sudden flash of humour in his deepset eyes he supplied the word  an impertinence perhaps  the word is not mine she answered but i accept it willingly i cannot interfere with mr hurds decision as to the barn  i am sorry he said slowly i must hold my meetings out of doors that is all  there was a dangerous glitter in her beautiful eyes  there is no common land in the neighbourhood she said and you will of course understand that i will consider you a trespasser at any time you are found upon my property  he bowed slightly  i am here to speak to your people he said and i will do so if i have to stop in these lanes and talk to them one by one you will pardon my reminding you madam that the days of feudalism are over  wilhelmina carefully shuffled the pack of cards which she had just taken up  we will finish our rubber peggy she said mr deyes perhaps i may trouble you to ring the bell  the young man was across the room before deyes could move  you will allow me he said with a delightfully humourous smile to facilitate my own dismissal i shall doubtless meet your man in the hall may i be allowed to wish you all good afternoon  they all returned his farewell save wilhelmina who had begun to deal she seemed determined to remember his existence no more yet on the threshold with the handle of the door between his fingers he turned back he said nothing but his eyes were fixed upon her deyes leaned forward in his chair immensely curious softly the cards fell into their places there was no sign in her face of any consciousness of his presence deyes alone knew that she was fighting he heard her breath come quicker saw the fingers which gathered up her cards shake slowly but with obvious unwillingness she turned her head she looked straight into the eyes of the man who still lingered  good afternoon miss thorpehatton he said pleasantly i am sorry to have troubled you  her lips moved but she said nothing she half inclined her head the door was softly closed     chapter iv  beating her wings   never was a young man more pleased with himself than stephen hurd on the night he dined at thorpehatton he had shot well all day and been accepted with the utmost cordiality by the rest of the party at dinner time his hostess had placed him on her left hand and though it was true she had not much to say to him it was equally obvious that her duties were sufficient to account for her divided attention he was quite willing to be ignored by the lady on his other sidea little elderly and noted throughout the country for her husbandhunting proclivities he recognized the fact that apart from the personal side of the question he could scarcely hope to be of any interest to her the novelty of the situation wilhelminas occasional remarks and a dinner such as he had never tasted before were sufficient to keep him interested for the rest he was content to twirl his moustache of which he was inordinately proud and lean back in his chair with the comfortable reflection that he was the first of his family to be offered the complete hospitality of thorpehatton  towards the close of dinner his hostess leaned towards him  have you seen or heard anything of a young man named macheson in the village she asked  i have seen him once or twice he answered here on a missionary expedition or something of the sort i believe  has he made any attempt to hold a meeting she asked  not that i have heard of he replied he has been talking to some of the people though i saw him with old gullimore yesterday  that reminds me she remarked is it true that gullimore has had trouble with his daughter  i believe so young hurd admitted looking downwards at his plate  the man was to blame for letting her leave the place wilhelmina declared in cold measured tones a pretty girl i remember but very vain and a fool of course but about this young fellow macheson do you know who he is and where he came from  stephen hurd shook his head  im afraid i dont he said doubtfully he belongs to some sort of brotherhood i believe i cant exactly make out what hes at seems a queer sort of place for him to come missioning this  so i told him she said by the bye do you know where he is staying  at onetree farm the young man answered  wilhelmina frowned  will you execute a commission for me tomorrow she asked  with pleasure he answered eagerly  you will go to the woman at onetree farm i forget her name and say that i desire to take her rooms myself from tomorrow or as soon as possible i will pay her for them but i do not wish that young man to be taken in by any of my tenants you will perhaps make that known  i will do so he declared i hope he will have the good sense to leave the neighbourhood  i trust so wilhelmina replied  she turned away to speak once more to the man on her other side and did not address stephen hurd again he watched her covertly with tingling pulses as she devoted herself to her neighbourthe lordlieutenant of the county he considered himself a judge of the sex but he had had few opportunities even of admiring such women as the mistress of thorpe he watched the curve of her white neck with its delicate satinlike skin the play of her features the poise of her somewhat small oval head he admired the slightly wearied air with which she performed her duties and accepted the compliments of her neighbour a woman of mysteries some one had once called her and he realized that it was the mouth and the dark tired eyes which puzzled those who attempted to classify her what a triumphto bring her down to the world of ordinary women to drive the weariness away to feel the soft touch perhaps of those wonderful arms he was a young man of many conquests and with a sufficiently good idea of himself the thought was like wine in his blood if only it were possible  he relapsed into a daydream from which he was aroused only by the soft flutter of gowns and laces as the women rose to go there was a momentary disarrangement of seats gilbert deyes who was on the other side of the table rose and carrying his glass in his hand came deliberately round to the vacant seat by the young mans side in his evening clothes the length and gauntness of his face and figure seemed more noticeable than ever his skin was dry almost like parchment and his eyes by contrast appeared unnaturally bright his new neighbour noticed too that the glass which he carried so carefully contained nothing but water  i will come and talk to you for a few minutes if i may deyes said i leave the church and agriculture to hobnob somehow i dont fancy that as a buffer i should be a success  young hurd smiled amiably he was more than a little flattered  the archdeacon he remarked is not an inspiring neighbour  deyes lit one of his own cigarettes and passed his case  i have found the archdeacon very dull he admitteda privilege of his order i suppose by the bye you are having a dose of religion from a new source hereabouts are you not  you mean this young missioner hurd inquired doubtfully  deyes nodded  i was with our hostess when he came up to ask for the loan of a barn to hold services in a very queer sort of person i should think  i havent spoken to him hurd answered but i should think hes more or less mad i can understand mission and salvation army work and all that sort of thing in the cities but im hanged if i can understand any one coming to thorpe with such notions  our hostess is annoyed about it i imagine deyes remarked  she seems to have taken a dislike to the fellow hurd admitted she was speaking to me about him just now he is to be turned out of his lodgings here  gilbert deyes smiled the news interested him  our hostess is practical in her dislikes he remarked  why not his neighbour answered the place belongs to her  deyes watched for a moment the smoke from his cigarette curling upwards  the young man he said thoughtfully impressed me as being a person of some determination i wonder whether he will consent to accept defeat so easily  the agents son scarcely saw what else there was for him to do  there isnt anywhere round here he remarked where they would take him in against miss thorpehattons wishes besides he has nowhere to preach his coming here at all was a huge mistake if hes a sensible person hell admit it  deyes nodded as he rose to his feet and lounged towards the door with the other men  play bridge he asked his companion as they crossed the hall  a little the young man answered for moderate stakes  they entered the drawingroom and deyes made his way to a secluded corner where lady peggy sat scribbling alone in a notebook  my dear lady peggy he inquired whence this exceptional industry  she closed the book and looked up at him with twinkling eyes  well i didnt mean to tell a soul until it was finished she declared but youve just caught me ive had such a brilliant idea im going to write a society encyclop√¶dia  deyes looked at her solemnly  a society encyclop√¶dia he repeated uncertainly pon my word im not quite sure that i understand  she motioned him to sit down by her side  ill explain she said you know were all expected to know something about everything nowadays and its such a bore reading up things im going to compile a little volume of definitions i shall sell it at a guinea a copy pay all my debts and become quite respectable again  deyes shook his head his attitude was scarcely sympathetic  my dear lady peggy what nonsense he declared respectable indeed i call it positively pandering to the middle classes  lady peggy looked doubtful  it is a horrid word isnt it she admitted but it would be lovely to make some money of course i havent absolutely decided how to spend it yet it does seem rather a waste doesnt it to pay ones debts but think of the luxury of feeling one could do it if one wanted to  theres something in that deyes admitted but an encyclop√¶dia my dear lady peggy you dont know what youre talking about ive got one somewhere i know it came in a van and it took two of the men to unload it  lady peggy laughed softly  oh i dont mean that sort of course she declared i mean just a little giltedged text book bound in morocco you know with just those things in it were likely to run up against radium for instance now every ones talking about radium do you know what radium is  deyes swung his eyeglass carefully by its black riband  well he admitted ive a sort of idea but im not very good at definitions  of course not lady peggy declared triumphantly when it comes to the point you see what a good idea mine is you turn to my textbook she added turning the pages over rapidly and there you are radium a hard rare substance invented by mr gillette to give tone to his bachelor parties what do you think of that  wonderful deyes declared solemnly where do you get your information from  oh i poke about in dictionaries and things and ask every one questions lady peggy declared airily would you like to hear some more  our hostess is beckoning to me deyes answered rising i expect she wants some bridge  im on lady peggy declared cheerfully whom shall we get for a fourth  wilhelmina has found him already deyes declared its the new young man i think  lady peggy shrugged her shoulders  the agents son she remarked i shouldnt have thought that he would have cared about our points  he can afford it for once in a way i should imagine deyes answered i cant understand though  he stopped short she looked at him curiously  is it possible she murmured that there exists anything which gilbert deyes does not understand  many things he answered amongst them why does wilhelmina patronize this young man he is well enough of course but he shrugged his shoulders expressively the thing needs an explanation doesnt it  if wilhelminawere not wilhelmina it certainly would lady peggy answered i call her craving for new things and new people positively morbid all the time she beats her wings against the bars there are no new things there are no new experiences the sooner one makes up ones mind to it the better  gilbert deyes laughed softly  if my memory serves me he said you are repeating a cry many thousand years old wasnt there a prophet  there was she interrupted but they are beckoning us i hope i dont cut with the young man i dont believe he has a bridge face     chapter v  evicted   victor macheson smoked his afterbreakfast pipe with the lazy enjoyment of one who is thoroughly at peace with himself and his surroundings the tiny strip of lawn on to which he had dragged his chair was surrounded with straggling bushes of cottage flowers and flanked by a hedge thick with honeysuckle straight to heaven as the flight of a bird the thin line of blue smoke curled upwards to the summer sky the very air seemed full of sweet scents and soothing sounds a few yards away a procession of lazy cows moved leisurely along the grassbordered lane from the other side of the hedge came the cheerful sound of a reapingmachine driven slowly through the field of golden corn  the man through half closed eyes looked out upon these things and every line in his face spelt contentment in repose the artistic temperament with which he was deeply imbued asserted itself more clearlythe almost fanatical light in his eyes was softened one saw there was something of the wistfulness of those who seek to raise but a corner of the veil that hangs before the world of hidden thingssomething too of the subdued joy which even the effort brings the lines of his forceful mouth were less firm more sensitivea greater sense of humanity seemed somehow to have descended upon him as he lounged there in the warmth of the sun with the full joy of his beautiful environment creeping through his blood  if you please mr macheson some one said in his ear  he turned his head at once a tall fair girl had stepped out of the room where he had been breakfasting and was standing by his elbow she was neatly dressed pretty in a somewhat insipid fashion and her hands and hair showed signs of a refinement superior to her station just now she was apparently nervous macheson smiled at her encouragingly  well letty he said what is it  i wantedcan i say something to you mr macheson she began  why not he answered kindly is it anything very serious out with it  i was thinking mr macheson she said that i should like to leave homeif i couldif there was anything which i could do i wanted to ask your advice  he laid down his pipe and looked at her seriously  why letty he said how long have you been thinking of this  oh ever so long sir she exclaimed speaking with more confidence you see theres nothing for me to do here except when theres any one staying like you sir and thats not often mother wont let me help with the rough work and ruths growing up now shes ever such a strong girl and i should like to go away if i could and learn to be a little moremore ladylike she added with reddening cheeks  macheson was puzzled the girl was not looking him in the face he felt there was something at the back of it all  my dear girl he said you cant learn to be ladylike thats one of the things thats born with you or it isnt you can be just as much a lady helping your mother here as practising grimaces in a london drawingroom  but i want to improve myself she persisted  go for a long walk every day and look about you he said read ill lend you some booksthe right sort youll do better here than away  she was frankly dissatisfied  but i want to go away she declared i want to leave thorpe for a time i should like to go to london couldnt i get a situation as ladys help or companion or something of that sort i shouldnt want any money  he was silent for a moment  does your mother know of this letty he asked  she wouldnt object the girl answered eagerly she lets me do what i like  hadnt you better tell methe rest macheson asked quietly  the girl looked away uneasily  there is no rest she protested weakly  macheson shook his head  letty he said if you have formed any ideas of a definite future for yourself different from any you see before you here tell me what they are and i will do my best to help you but if you simply want to go away because you are dissatisfied with the life here because you fancy yourself superior to it well im sorry but id sooner prevent your going than help you  her eyes filled with tears  oh mr macheson it isnt that she declared ii dont want to tell any one but im veryvery fond of some one whosquite different i think hes fond of me too she added softly but hes always used to being with ladies and i wanted to improve myself so much i thought if i went to london she added wistfully i might learn  macheson laughed cheerfully he laid his hand for a moment upon her arm  oh letty letty he declared youre a foolish little girl now listen to me if hes a good sort and im sure he is or you wouldnt be fond of him hell like you just exactly as you are do you know what it means to be a lady the supreme test of good manners it means to be natural take my advice go on helping your mother enter into the village life make friends with the other girls dont imagine yourself a bit superior to anybody else read when you have timeill manage the books for you and spend all the time you can out of doors its sound advice letty take my word for it hullo whos this  a new sound in the lane made them both turn their heads young hurd had just ridden up and was fastening his pony to the fence he looked across at them curiously and letty retreated precipitately into the house a moment or two later he came up the narrow path frowning at macheson over the low hedge of foxgloves and cottage roses and barely returning his courteous greeting for a moment he hesitated however as though about to speak then changing his mind he passed on and entered the farmhouse  he met mrs foulton herself in the passage and she welcomed him with a smiling face  good morning mr hurd sir she exclaimed plucking at her apron wont you come inside sir and sit down the parlours let to mr macheson there but hes out in the garden and he wont mind your stepping in for a moment and hows your father mr hurd wonderful well he was looking when i saw him last  the young man followed her inside but declined a chair  oh the governors all right mrs foulton he answered never knew him anything else good weather for the harvest eh  beautiful sir mrs foulton answered  were you wanting to speak to john mr stephen hes about the home meadow somewhere or in the orchard i can send a boy for him or perhaps youd step out  its you i came to see mrs foulton the young man said and pon my word i dont like my errand much  mrs foulton was visibly anxious  theres no trouble like i hope sir she began  oh its nothing serious he declared reassuringly to tell you the truth its about your lodger  about mr macheson sir the woman exclaimed  yes do you know how long he was proposing to stay with you  hes just took the rooms for another week sir she answered and a nicer lodger or one more quiet and regular in his habits i never had or wish to have theres nothing against him sirsurely  nothing personalthat i know of hurd answered tapping his boots with his ridingwhip the fact of it is he has offended miss thorpehatton and she wants him out of the place  well i never did mrs foulton exclaimed in amazement him offend miss thorpehatton so nicespoken he is too im sure i cant imagine his saying a wry word to anybody  he has come to thorpe hurd explained on an errand of which miss thorpehatton disapproves and she does not wish to have him in the place she knows that he is staying here and she wishes you to send him away at once  mrs foultons face fell  well im fair sorry to hear this sir she declared its only this morning that he spoke for the rooms for another week and i was glad and willing enough to let them to him well i never did it does sound all anyhow dont it sir to be telling him to pack up and go suddenlike  i will speak to him myself if you like mrs foulton stephen said of course miss thorpehatton does not wish you to lose anything and i am to pay you the rent of the rooms for the time he engaged them i will do so at once if you will let me know how much it is  he thrust his hand into his pocket but mrs foulton drew back the corners of her mouth were drawn tightly together  thank you mr stephen she said ill obey miss thorpehattons wishes of course as in duty bound but ill not take any money for the rooms thank you all the same  dont be foolish mrs foulton the young man said pleasantly it will annoy miss thorpehatton if she knows you have refused and you may just as well have the money let me see shall we say a couple of sovereigns for the week  mrs foulton shook her head  ill not take anything sir thank you all the same and if youd say a word to mr macheson id be much obliged id rather any one spoke to him than me  stephen hurd pocketed the money with a shrug of the shoulders  just as you like of course mrs foulton he said ill go out and speak to the young gentleman at once  he strolled out and looked over the hedge  mr macheson i believe he remarked interrogatively  macheson nodded as he rose from his chair  and you are mr hurds son are you not he said pleasantly wonderful morning isnt it  young hurd stepped over the rose bushes the two men stood side by side something of a height only that the better cut of hurds clothes showed his figure to greater advantage  im sorry to say that ive come on rather a disagreeable errand the agents son began ive been talking to mrs foulton about it  indeed macheson remarked interrogatively  the fact is you seem to have rubbed up against our great lady here young hurd continued shes very down on these services you were going to hold and she wants to see you out of the place  i am sorry to hear this macheson saidand once more waited  it isnt a pleasant task stephen continued liking his errand less as he proceeded but ive had to tell mrs foulton thatthat in short miss thorpehatton does not wish her tenants to accept you as a lodger  miss thorpehatton makes war on a wide scale macheson remarked smiling faintly  well after all you see hurd explained the whole place belongs to her and there is no particular reason is there why she should tolerate any one in it of whom she disapproves  none whatever macheson assented gravely  i promised mrs foulton i would speak to you stephen continued stepping backwards im sure for her sake you wont make any trouble good morning  macheson bowed slightly  good morning he answered  stephen hurd lingered even then upon the garden path somehow he was not satisfied with his interviewwith his own position at the end of it he had an uncomfortable sense of belittlement of having played a small part in a not altogether worthy game the indifference of the others manner nettled him he tried a parting shaft  mrs foulton said something about your having engaged the rooms for another week he said turning back of course if you insist upon staying it will place the woman in a very awkward position  macheson had resumed his seat  i should not dream he said coolly of resistingyour mistress decree i shall leave here in half an hour  young hurd walked angrily down the path and slammed the gate the sense of having been worsted was strong upon him he recognized his own limitations too accurately not to be aware that he had been in conflict with a stronger personality  d the fellow he muttered as he cantered down the lane i wish he were out of the place  a genuine wish and one which betrayed at least a glimmering of a prophetic instinct in some dim way he seemed to understand even before the first move on the board that the coming of victor macheson to thorpe was inimical to himself he was conscious of his weakness of a marked inferiority and the consciousness was galling the fellow had no right to be a gentleman he told himself angrilya gentleman and a missioner  macheson relit his pipe and called to mrs foulton  mrs foulton he said pleasantly ill have to go your great lady doesnt like me on the estate i dare say shes right  im sure im very sorry sir mrs foulton declared shamefacedly youve seen young mr hurd  he was kind enough to explain the situation to me macheson answered im afraid i am rather a nuisance to everybody if i am its because they dont quite understand  im sure sir mrs foulton affirmed a nicer lodger no one ever had and as for them services and the vicar objecting to them i cant see what harm theyd do were none of us so good but we might be a bit better  a very sound remark mrs foulton macheson said smiling and now you must make out my bill please and what about a few sandwiches you could manage that im going to play in a cricket match this afternoon  why youve just paid the bill sir theres only breakfast and the sandwiches youre welcome to and very sorry i am to part with you sir  better luck another time i hope mrs foulton he answered smiling i must go upstairs and pack my bag i shant forget your garden with its delicious flowers  its a shame as youve got to leave it sir mrs foulton said heartily if my richard were alive hed never have let you go for all the miss thorpehattons in the world but johnhes little more than a ladhed be frightened to death for fear of losing the farm if i so much as said a word to him  macheson laughed softly  johns a good son he said dont you worry him  he went up to his tiny bedroom and changed his clothes for a suit of flannels then he packed his few belongings and walked out into the world he lit a pipe and shouldered his portmanteau  there is a flavour of martyrdom about this affair he said to himself as he strolled along which appeals to me i dont think that young man has any sense of humour  he paused every now and then to listen to the birds and admire the view he had the air of one thoroughly enjoying his walk presently he turned off the main road and wandered along a steep green lane which was little more than a carttrack here he met no one the country on either side was common land sown with rocks and the poorest soil picturesque but almost impossible of cultivation a few sheep were grazing upon the hills but other sign of life there was none not a farmhousescarcely a keepers cottage in sight it was a forgotten corner of a not unpopulous countythe farthest portion of a belt of primeval forest land older than history itself macheson laughed softly as he reached the spot he had had in his mind and threw his bag over the grey stone wall into the cool shade of a dense fragment of wood  so much he murmured softly for the lady of thorpe     chapter vi  cricket and philosophy   the instinct for games wilhelmina remarked is one which i never possessed let us see whether we can learn something  in obedience to her gesture the horses were checked and the footman clambered down and stood at their heads deyes from his somewhat uncomfortable back seat in the victoria leaned forward and adjusting his eyeglass studied the scene with interest  here he remarked we have the flannelled fool upon his native heath they are playing a game which my memory tells me is cricket everyone seems very hot and very excited  wilhelmina beckoned to the footman to come round to the side of the carriage  james she said do you know what all this means  she waved her hand towards the cricket pitch the umpires with their white coats the tent and the crowd of spectators the man touched his hat  it is a cricket match madam he answered between thorpe and nesborough  wilhelmina looked once more towards the field and recognized mr hurd upon his stout little cob  go and tell mr hurd to come and speak to me she ordered  the man hastened off mr hurd had not once turned his head his eyes were riveted upon the game the groom found it necessary to touch him on the arm before he could attract his attention even when he had delivered his message the agent waited until the finish of the over before he moved then he cantered his pony up to the waiting carriage wilhelmina greeted him graciously  i want to know about the cricket match mr hurd she asked smiling  mr hurd wheeled his pony round so that he could still watch the game  i am afraid that we are going to be beaten madam he said dolefully nesborough made a hundred and ninetyeight and we have six wickets down for fifty  wilhelmina seemed scarcely to realize the tragedy which his words unfolded  i suppose they are the stronger team arent they she remarked they ought to be nesborough is quite a large town  we have beaten them regularly until the last two years mr hurd answered we should beat them now but for their fast bowler mills i dont know how it is but our men will not stand up to him  perhaps they are afraid of being hurt wilhelmina suggested innocently if that is he bowling now im sure i dont wonder at it  mr hurd frowned  we dont have men in the eleven who are afraid of getting hurt he remarked stiffly  a shout of dismay from the onlookers a smothered exclamation from mr hurd and a man was seen on his way to the pavilion his wickets were spreadeagled and the ball was being tossed about the field  another wicket the agent exclaimed testily crooks played all round that ball  isnt that your son going in mr hurd wilhelmina asked  yes stephen is in now his father answered if he gets out the match is over  who is the other batsman deyes asked  antill the second bailiff mr hurd answered hes captain and he can stay in all day but he cant make runs  they all leaned forward to witness the continuation of the match stephen hurds career was brief and inglorious he took guard and looked carefully round the field with the air of a man who is going to give trouble then he saw the victoria with its vision of parasols and fluttering laces and the sight was fatal to him he slogged wildly at the first ball missed it and paid the penalty the lady in the carriage frowned and mr hurd muttered something under his breath as he watched his son on the way back to the tent  im afraid its all up with us now he remarked we have only three more men to go in  then we are going to be beaten wilhelmina remarked  im afraid so mr hurd assented gloomily  the next batsman had issued from the tent and was on his way to the wicket wilhelmina who had been about to give an order to the footman watched him curiously  who is that going in she asked abruptly  mr hurd was looking not altogether comfortable  it is the young man who wanted to preach he answered  wilhelmina frowned  why is he playing she asked he has nothing to do with thorpe  he came down to see them practise a few evenings ago and antill asked him the agent answered if i had known earlier i would have stopped it  wilhelmina did not immediately reply she was watching the young man who stood now at the wicket bat in hand in his flannels he seemed a very different person from the missioner whose request a few days ago had so much offended her nevertheless her lip curled as she saw the terrible mills prepare to deliver his first ball  that sort of person she remarked is scarcely likely to be much good at games oh  her exclamation was repeated in various forms from all over the field macheson had hit his first ball high over their heads and a storm of applause broke from the bystanders the batsman made no attempt to run  what is that wilhelmina asked  a boundarymagnificent drive mr hurd answered excitedly by jove another  the agent dropped his reins and led the applause along the ground this time the ball had come at such a pace that the fieldsman made a very halfhearted attempt to stop it it passed the horses feet by only a few yards the coachman turned round and touched his hat  shall i move farther back madam he asked  stay where you are wilhelmina answered shortly her eyes were fixed upon the tall lithe figure once more facing the bowler the next ball was the last of the over macheson played it carefully for a single and stood prepared for the bowling at the other end he began by a graceful cut for two and followed it up by a square leg hit clean out of the ground for the next half an hour the thorpe villagers thoroughly enjoyed themselves never since the days of one foulds a former blacksmith had they seen such an exhibition of hurricane hitting the fast bowler knocked clean off his length became wild and erratic once he only missed machesons head by an inch but his next ball was driven fair and square out of the ground for six the applause became frantic  wilhelmina was leaning back amongst the cushions of her carriage watching the game through half closed eyes and with some apparent return of her usual graceful languor nevertheless she remained there and her eyes seldom wandered for a moment from the scene of play beneath her apparent indifference she was watching this young man with an interest for which she would have found it hard to account and which instinct alone prompted her to conceal it was a very ordinary scene after all of which he was the dominant figure she had seen so much of life on a larger scaleof men playing heroic parts in the limelight of a stage as mighty as this was insignificant yet without stopping to reason about it she was conscious of a curious sense of pleasure in watching the doings of this forceful young giant with an easy goodhumoured smile replaced every now and then with a grim look of determination as he jumped out from the crease to hit he continued his victorious career until a more frantic burst of applause than usual announced that the match was won then wilhelmina turned towards stephen hurd who was standing by the side of the carriage  you executed my commission she asked respecting that young man  the first thing this morning he answered i went up to see mrs foulton and i also spoke to him  did he make any difficulty  none at all the young man answered  what did he say  stephen hesitated but wilhelmina waited for his reply she had the air of one remotely interested yet she waited obviously to hear what this young man had said  i think he said something about your making war upon a large scale stephen explained diffidently  she sat still for a moment she was looking towards the deserted cricket pitch  where is he staying now she asked  i do not know he answered i have warned all the likely people not to receive him and i have told him too that he will only get your tenants into trouble if he tries to get lodgings here  i should like she said to speak to him perhaps you would be so good as to ask him to step this way for a moment  stephen departed wondering deyes was watching his hostess with an air of covert amusement  do you continue the warfare he asked or has the young mans prowess softened your heart  wilhelmina raised her parasol and looked steadily at her questioner  warfare is scarcely the word is it she remarked carelessly i have no personal objection to the young man  they watched him crossing the field towards them notwithstanding his recent exertions he walked lightly and without any sign of fatigue deyes looked curiously at the crest upon the cap which he was carrying in his hand  magdalen he muttered your missioner grows more interesting  wilhelmina leaned forwards her face was inscrutable and her greeting devoid of cordiality  so you have decided to teach my people cricket instead of morals mr macheson she remarked  the two he answered pleasantly are not incompatible  wilhelmina frowned  i hope she said that you have abandoned your idea of holding meetings in the village  certainly not he answered i will begin next week  you understand she said calmly that i consider youas a missioneran intruderhere those of my people who attend your services will incur my displeasure  madam he answered i do not believe that you will visit it upon them  but i will she interrupted ruthlessly you are young and know little of the world you have not yet learnt the truth of one of the oldest of proverbsthat it is well to let well alone  it is a sop for the idle that proverb he answered it is the motto for the great army of those who drift  i have been making inquiries she said i find that my villagers are contented and prosperous there are no signs of vice in the place  there is such a thing he answered as being too prosperous overcontented the person in such a state takes life for granted religion is a thing he hears about but fails to realize he has no need of it he becomes like the prize cattle in your park he has a mind but has forgotten how to use it  she looked at him steadily perhaps a trifle insolently  how old are you mr macheson she asked  twentyeight he answered with a slight flush  twentyeight you are young to make yourself the judge of such things as these you will do a great deal of mischief i am afraid before you are old enough to realize it  to awaken those who sleep in the daytimeis that mischief he asked  it is she answered deliberately when you are older you will realize it sleep is the best  he bent towards her the light in his eyes had blazed out  you know in your heart he said that it is not true you have brains and you are as much of an artist as your fettered life permits you to be you know very well that knowledge is best  do you believe she answered that ii take myself not personally but as a typeam as happy as they are  she moved her parasol to where the village lay beyond the trees he hesitated  madam he answered gravely i know too little of your life to answer your question  she shrugged her shoulders for a moment her parasol hid her face  we are quite √† la mode are we not my dear peggy she remarked with a curious little laugh philosophy upon the village green gilbert tell them to drive on  she turned deliberately to macheson  come and convert us instead she said we need it more  i do not doubt it madam he answered good afternoon  the carriage drove off macheson obeying an impulse which he did not recognize watched it till it was out of sight at the bend wilhelmina deliberately turned in her seat and saw him standing there she waved her parasol in ironical farewell and macheson walked back to the tent with burning cheeks     chapter vii  an undernote of music   a great dinner party had come to an end and the lordlieutenant of the county bowed low over the cold hand of his departing guest in whose honour it had been given a distant relationship gave lord westerdean privileges upon which he would willingly have improved  you are leaving us early wilhelmina he murmured reproachfully how can i expect to keep my other guests if you desert us  wilhelmina withdrew the hand and nodded her other farewells the heat of the summer evening had brought every one out from the drawingroom the hall doors stood open those of the guests who were not playing bridge or billiards were outside upon the terracesome had wandered into the gardens  my dear leslie she said as she stood upon the broad steps you are losing your habit of gallantry a year ago you would not have ventured to suggest that in my absence the coming or going of your other guests could matter a straw  you know very well that it doesnt he answered dropping his voice you know very well  tonight she interrupted calmly i will not be made love to i am not in the humour for it  he looked down at her curiously he was a man of exceptional height thin grey still handsome an exdiplomat whose career had he chosen to follow it would have been a brilliant one wealth and immense estates had thrust their burdens upon him however and he was content to be the most popular man in his county  there is nothing the matter he asked anxiously  she shook her head  you are well he persisted dropping his voice  absolutely she answered it is not that it is a mood i used to welcome moods as an escape from the ruts i suppose i am getting too old for them now  he shook his head  i wonder he said if the world really knows how young you are  dont she interrupted with a shudder i have outlived my years  a motor omnibus and a small victoria came round from the stables the party from thorpe began slowly to assemble upon the steps  i am going in the victoriaalone she said resting her fingers upon his arm dont you envy me  i envy the vacant place he answered sadly isnt this desire for solitude somewhat of a new departure though  perhaps she admitted i am rather looking forward to my drive tonight as we came here the whole country seemed like a great garden of perfumes and beautiful places that is why i had them telephone for a carriage there are times when i hate motoring  he broke off a cluster of pink roses and placed them in her hands  if your thoughts must needs fill the empty seat he whispered as he bent over her for his final adieux remember my claims i beg perhaps my thoughts might even meet yours  she laughed under her breath but the light in his eyes was unanswered  perhaps she answered it is a night for thoughts and dreams this even i may drift into sentiment good night such a charming evening  the carriage rolled smoothly down the avenue from the great house over which she might so easily have reigned and turned into the road a few minutes later the motorcar flashed by afterwards there was solitude for it was already past midnight gilbert deyes looked thoughtfully out at the carriage from his place in the car he had beggedvery hard for himfor that empty seat  of what is it a sign he asked when a woman seeks solitude  lady peggy shrugged her shoulders  wilhelmina is tired of us all i suppose she remarked she gets like that sometimes  then of what is it a sign he persisted when a woman tires of peoplelike us  lady peggy yawned  in a woman of more primitive instincts she said it would mean an affair but wilhelmina has outgrown all that she is the only woman of our acquaintance of whom one would dare to say it but i honestly believe that to wilhelmina men are like puppets was she born i wonder with ice in her veins  one wonders deyes remarked softly a woman like that is always something of a mystery by the bye wasnt there a whisper of something the year she lived in florence  people have talked of her of course lady peggy answered in florence a woman without a lover is like a child without toys to be virtuous there is the one offence which society does not pardon  i believe deyes said that a lover would bore wilhelmina terribly  why the dickens doesnt she marry leslie austin asked opening his eyes for a moment  too obvious deyes murmured some day i cant help fancying that she will give us all a shock  a mile or more behind the lady with ice in her veins leaned back amongst the cushions of her carriage drinking in with a keenness of appreciation which surprised even herself the beauties of the still hot night the moon was as yet barely risen in the half light the country and the hills beyond with their tumbled masses of rock seemed unrealof strange and mysterious outline more than anything she was conscious of a sense of softness the angles were gone from all the crude places it was peace itself which had settled upon the land peace and a wonderful silence the birds had long ago ceased to sing no breath of wind was abroad to stir the leaves of the trees all the cheerful chorus of country sounds which make music throughout the long summer day had ceased once when a watchdog barked in the valley far below she started the sound seemed unrealas though indeed it came from a different world  the woman in the carriage looked out with steady tireless eyes upon this visionary land the breath of the honeysuckle and the pleasant odour of warm hay seemed to give life to the sensuous joy of the wonderful night she herself was a strange being to be abroad in these quiet lanes her only wrap was a long robe of filmy lace which she had thrown back so that her shoulders and neck with its collar of lustrous pearls were bare to the faint breeze which only their own progress made her gleaming dress of white satin undecorated unadorned fell in delicate lines about her limbs no wonder that the only person whom they passed a belated farmer rubbed his eyes and stared at her as at a ghost  it seemed to her that something of the confusion of this delightful halfseen world had stolen too into her thoughts all day long she had been conscious of it there was something alien there something wholly unrecognizable she felt a new light falling upon her life from where she could not tell only she knew that its pitiless routine its littleness its frantic struggle for the front place in the great pleasurehouse seemed suddenly to stand revealed in pitiful colours surely it belonged to some other woman it could not be she who did those things and called them life she who scarcely knew what nerves were was suddenly afraid some change was coming upon her she felt herself caught in a silent swiftflowing current she was being carried away and she had not strength to resist and all the time there was an undernote of music that was what made it so strange the light that was falling was like summer rain upon the bare dry places she was conscious of a new vitality a new life and she feared it fancy being endowed with a new sense in the midst of an ordinary workaday existence she felt like that it was unbelievable and yet its tumult was stirring in her heart was rushing through her veins often before her tired eyes had rested unmoved upon a country as beautiful as this even the mystery of this half light was no new thing tonight she saw farthershe felt the throbbing halfmad delight of the wanderer in the enchanted land the pilgrim who hears suddenly the angelus bell from the shrine he has journeyed so far to visit what it meant she could not she dared not ask herself she was content to sit there her eyes wide open now the tired lines smoothed from her forehead her face like the face of an eager and beautiful child no one of her world would have recognized her as she travelled that night through the perfumed lanes  it was when they were within a mile or two of home that an awakening came they had turned into a lonely lane leading to one of the back entrances to thorpe and were climbing a somewhat steep hill suddenly the horses plunged and almost stopped she leaned forward  what is it johnson she asked  the man touched his hat  the osses shied madam at the light in the trees there enough to frighten em too  her eyes followed his pointing finger a few yards back from the roadside a small steady light was burning amongst the trees  what is it she asked quickly  i cant say madam the man answered it looks like a lantern or a candle or something of that sort  there is no cottage there she asked  the man shook his head  theres none nearer than the first lodge madam he answered theres a bit of a shelter therehiggs the keeper built it for a watchman  can i take care of the horses for a moment while you go and see what it is she asked  they take a bit of holding madam the man answered doubtfully we got your message so late at the stables or i should have had a second man  wilhelmina stepped softly out into the road  i will go myself she said i daresay it is nothing if i call though you must leave the horses and come to me  she opened the gate and raising her skirts with both hands stepped into the plantation her small whiteshod feet fell noiselessly upon the thick undergrowth she reached the entrance of the shelter without making any sound cautiously she peeped in her eyes grew round with surprise her bosom began rapidly to rise and fall it was macheson who lay there fast asleep he had fallen asleep evidently whilst reading a book was lying by his side and a covered lantern was burning by his left shoulder he was dressed in trousers and shirt the latter was open at the throat showing its outline firm and white and his regular breathing she drew a step nearer and leaned over him curiously enough in sleep the boyishness of his face was less apparent the straight firm mouth rigidly closed was the mouth of a man his limbs in repose seemed heavy even massive especially the bare arm upon which his head was resting his shirt was old but spotlessly clean his socks were neatly darned in many places he occupied nearly the whole of the shelter in fact one foot was protruding through the opening in the corner a lookingglass was hanging from a stick and a few simple toilet articles were spread upon the ground  she bent more closely over him holding her breath although he showed no signs of waking her senses were in confusion and there was a mist before her eyes an unaccountable impulse was urging her on driving her as it seemed into incredible folly lower and lower she bent till her hot breath fell almost upon his cheek suddenly he stirred she started back after all he did not open his eyes but the moment was gone she moved backwards towards the opening she was seized now with sudden fright she desired to escape she was breathless with fear the fear of what she might not have escaped yet in the midst of it with hot trembling fingers she loosened the roses from her dress and dropped them by his side then she fled into the semidarkness  the habits of a lifetime die hard they are proof as a rule against these fits of temporary madness  wilhelmina stepped languidly into her carriage and commanded her coachmans attention  johnson she said i found a poor man sleeping there there is no necessity for him to be disturbed it is my wish that you do not mention the occurrence to any oneto any one at all you understand  the man touched his hat he would have been dullwitted indeed if he had not appreciated the note of finality in his mistress tone his horses sprang forward and a few minutes later turned into the dark avenue which led to the house     chapter viii  roses   macheson woke with the daylight stiff a little tired and haunted with the consciousness of disturbing dreams he sprang to his feet and stretched himself then he saw the roses  for a moment or two he stared at them incredulously then his thoughts flashed backwardswhere or how had he become possessed of them a few seconds were sufficient some one had been there in the nightmost likely a woman  his cheeks burned at the thought he stooped and took them hesitatingly reverently into his hand to him they represented part of the mystery of life the mystery of which he knew so little soft and fragrant the touch of the drooping blossoms was like fire to his fingers had he been like those predecessors of his in the days of the puritans he would have cast them away trampled them underfoot he would have seen in them only the snare of the evil one but to macheson this would have seemed almost like sacrilege they were beautiful and he loved beautiful things  he made his way farther into the plantation to where the trees suddenly opening disclosed a small disused slate quarry the water in which was kept fresh by many streams stripping off his clothes he plunged into the deep cool depths swimming round for several minutes on his back his face upturned to the dim blue sky then he dressedin the ugly black suit for it was sunday and made a frugal breakfast boiling the water for his coffee over a small spiritlamp and all the time he kept looking at the roses now fresh with the water which he had carefully sprinkled over them their coming seemed to him to whisper of beautiful things they turned his thoughts so easily into that world of poetry and sentiment in which he was a habitual wanderer yet every now and then their direct significance startled almost alarmed some one had actually been in the place while he slept and had retreated without disturbing him roses do not drop from the sky and of gardens there were none close at hand was it one of the village girls who had seen him that afternoon his cheeks reddened at the thought perhaps he had better leave his shelter another time if she came she might not steal away so quietly scandal would injure his work he must run no risks deep down in his heart he thrust that other that impossibly sweet thought he would not suffer his mind to dwell upon it  after breakfast he walked for an hour or so across the hills watching the early mists roll away in the valleys and the sunlight settle down upon the land it was a morning of silence thisthat peculiar mysterious silence which only the first day of the week seems to bring the fields were empty of toilers the harvest was stayed from its faraway nest amongst the hills he could just hear carried on the bosom of a favouring breeze the single note of a monastery bell whose harshness not even distance or its pleasant journey across the open country could modify macheson listened to it for a moment and sat down upon a rock on the topmost pinnacle of the hills he was climbing  below him the country stretched like a piece of brilliant patchwork thorpe with its many chimneys and stately avenues and the village hidden by a grove of elms was like a cool oasis in the midst of the landscape behind the hills ran rockier and wilder culminating in a bleak stretch of country in the middle of which was the monastery macheson looked downwards at thorpe with the faint clang of that single bell in his ears the frown on his forehead deepened as the rush of thoughts took insistent hold of him  for a young man blessed with vigorous health free from all material anxieties and with the world before him macheson found life an uncommonly serious matter only a few years ago he had left the university with a brilliant degree a splendid athletic record and a host of friends what to do with his life that was the problem which pressingly confronted him he recognized in himself certain gifts inevitably to be considered in this choice he was possessed of a deep religious sense an immense sympathy for his fellows and a passion for the beautiful in life from which the physical side was by no means absent  how to find a career which would satisfy such varying qualities a life of pleasure unless it were shared by his fellows did not appeal to him at all personal ambition he was destitute of his religion he was very well aware was not the sort which would enable him to enter with any prospect of happiness any of the established churches for a time he had travelled and had come back with only one definite idea in his mind chance had brought him on his return into contact with two young men of somewhat similar tastes a conversation between them one night had given a certain definiteness to his aims he recalled it to himself as he sat looking down at the thin blue line of smoke rising from the chimneys of thorpe  to use ones life for others he had repeated thoughtfullyit was the enthusiast of the party who had spokenbut how  teach them to avoid like filth the ugly things of lifehelp them in their search for the things beautiful  what are the things beautiful he had asked dont they mean something different to every man  holderness had lifted his beautiful headthe boy with whom he had played at schoolthe friend of his younger life  the christian morality he had answered  macheson had been surprised  but you he said you dont believe anything  it is not necessary holderness had answered it is a matter of the intelligence as an artist if i might dare to call myself one i say that the christian life if honestly lived is the most beautiful thing of all the ages  macheson walked down to the village with the memory of those words still in his brain the bell was ringing for service from the queer ivycovered church the villagers were coming down the lane in little groups macheson found himself one of a small knot of people who stood reverently on one side with doffed hats just by the wooden porch he looked up suddenly realizing the cause  a small vehicle something between a bathchair and a miniature carriage drawn by a fat sleek pony was turning into the lane from one of the splendid avenues which led to the house a boy led the pony a footman marched behind wilhelmina in a plain white muslin dress and a black hat was slowly preparing to descend she smiled languidly but pleasantly enough at the line of curtseying women and men with doffed hats the note of feudalism which their almost reverential attitudes suggested appealed irresistibly to machesons sense of humour he too formed one of them he too doffed his hat his greeting however was different her eyes swept by him unseeing his pleasant good morning was unheeded she even touched her skirt with her fingers as though afraid lest it might brush against him in passing with tired graceful footsteps she passed into the cool church leaving him to admire against his will the slim perfection of her figure the wonderful carriage of her small but perfect head  he followed with the others presently and found a single seat close to the door the service began almost at once a very beautiful service in its way for the organ a present from the lady of the manor was perfectly played and the preachers voice was clear and as sweet as a boys macheson however was nervous and ill at ease from the open door he heard the soft whispering of the west windfor the first time in his life he found the simple but dignified ritual unconvincing he was haunted by the sense of some impending disaster when the prayers came he fell on his knees and remained there even then he could not collect himself he was praying to an unknown god for protection against some nameless evil he knew quite well that the words he muttered were vain words through the stained glass windows the sunlight fell in a subdued golden stream upon the glowing hair the gracefully bent head of the woman who sat alone in the deep square pew she too seemed to be praying macheson got up and softly but abruptly stole from the church  up into the hills as far away as high up as possible a day of sabbath calm this macheson with the fire in his veins and a sharp pain in his side climbed as a man possessed he too was fleeing from the unknown he was many miles away when down in the valley at thorpe some one spoke of him  by the bye gilbert deyes remarked looking across the luncheon table at his hostess when does this athletic young missioner of yours begin his work of regeneration  wilhelmina raised her eyebrows  tomorrow evening i believe she answered he is going to speak at the crossroads i fancy that his audience will consist chiefly of the children and mrs adniths chickens  cant understand austin remarked why a chap who can play cricket like thathe did lay on to em toocan be such a crank  he is very young wilhelmina remarked composedly and i fancy that he must be a little mad i hope that thorpe will teach him a lesson he needs it  you do not anticipate then deyes remarked that his labours here will be crowned with success  he wont get a soul to hear him stephen hurd replied confidently the villagers all know what miss thorpehatton thinks of his coming here it will be quite sufficient  wilhelmina lit a cigarette and rose to her feet  let us hope so she remarked drily please remember all of you that this is the palace of ease do exactly what you like all of you till five oclock i shall be ready for bridge then  lady peggy rose briskly  no doubt about what i shall do she remarked im going to bed  deyes smiled  i he said shall spend the afternoon in the rose garden i needdevelopment  wilhelmina looked at him questioningly  please dont be inexplicable she begged it is too hot  roses and sentiment he declared are supposed to go together i want to grow into accord with my surroundings  wilhelmina was silent for a moment  if you have found sentiment here she said carelessly you must have dug deep  on the contrary he answered i have scarcely scratched the surface  stephen hurd looked uneasily from deyes to his hostess never altogether comfortable although eager to accept the most casually offered invitation to thorpe he had always the idea that the most commonplace remark contained an innuendo purposely concealed from him  mr deyes he remarked looks mysterious  deyes glanced at him through his eyeglass  it is a subtle neighbourhood he said by the bye mr hurd have you ever seen the rose gardens at carrow  never hurd replied enviously i have heard that they are very beautiful  wilhelmina passed out  the gardens are beautiful she said looking back but the roses are like all other roses they fade quickly till five oclock all of you     chapter ix  summer lightning   stephen hurd walked into the room which he and his father shared as a sanctum half office half study mr hurd senior was attired in his conventional sabbath garb the same black coat of hard dull material and dark grey trousers in which he had attended church for more years than many of the villagers could remember stephen on the other hand was attired in evening clothes of the latest cut his white waistcoat had come from a london tailor and his white tie had cost him considerable pains his father looked him over with expressionless face  you are going to the house again stephen he asked calmly  i am asked to dine there father he answered sorry to leave you alone  i have no objection to being alone mr hurd answered i think that you know that you lunched there didnt you  stephen nodded  miss thorpehatton asked me as we came out of church he answered  you play cards  the directness of the question allowed of no evasion stephen flushed as he answered  they play bridge i may be asked to join itis a sort of whist you know  so i understand the older man remarked i have no remark to make concerning that manners change i suppose with the generations you are young and i am old i have never sought to impose my prejudices upon you you have seen more of the world than i ever did perhaps you have found wisdom there  stephen was not at his ease  i dont know about that sir he answered of course sunday isnt kept so strictly as it used to be i like a quiet day myself but its pretty dull here usually and i didnt think it would be wise to refuse an invitation from miss thorpehatton  perhaps not mr hurd answered on the other hand i might remind you that during the forty years during which i have been agent to this estate i have never acceptedbeyond a glass of winethe hospitality offered to me by miss thorpehattons father and grandfather and by the young lady herself it is not according to my idea of the fitness of things i am a servant of the owner of these estates i prefer to discharge my duties honestly and capablyas a servant  stephen frowned at his reflection in the glass he did not feel in the least like a servant  thats rather an oldfashioned view dad he declared  it may be his father answered in any case i do not seek to impose it upon you you are free to come and go according to your judgment but you are young and i cannot see you expose yourself to trouble without some warning miss thorpehatton is not a lady whom it is wise for you to see too much of  the directness of this speech took the young man aback  ishe seems very pleasant and gracious he faltered  not even to you his father continued gravely can i betray the knowledge of such things as have come under my notice as the servant of these estates and this young lady her father was a fine selfrespecting gentleman as all the thorpehattons have been her mother came from a noble but degenerate french family i who live here a life without change who mark time for the years and watch the striplings become old men see many things and see them truthfully the evil seed of her mothers family is in this young womans blood she lives without a chaperon without companionship as she pleasesand to please herself only  stephen frowned irritably his fathers cold measured words were like drops of ice  but father he protested she is a leader of society she goes to court and you see her name at the very best places if there was anything wrong about her she wouldnt be received like that  i know nothing about society or its requirements his father answered she has brains and wealth and she is a woman therefore i suppose the world is on her side i have said all that i wish to say you can perhaps conjecture the reason of my speaking at all  she wouldnt take the trouble to make a fool of me stephen answered bitterly i just happen to make up a number thats all  i am glad that you understand the young lady so well his father answered before you go will you be good enough to pass me the bible and my spectacles and let mary know that mr stuart will be in to supper with me  stephen obeyed in silence he remembered the time not so long ago when he would have been required to seat himself on the opposite side of the fireplace with a smaller bible in his hand and read word for word with his father his mind went back to those days as he walked slowly up the great grassgrown avenue to the house picking his steps carefully lest he should mar the brilliancy of his wellpolished patentleather boots he compared that old time curiously with the evening which was now before him the round table drawn into the midst of the splendid diningroom an oasis of exquisitely shaded light and colour lady peggy with her daring toilette and beautiful white shoulders deyes with his worldworn face and flippant tongue the mistress of thorpe herself more subdued perhaps in dress and speech and yet with the everpresent mystery of eyes and lips wherein was always the fascination of the unknown more than ever that night stephen hurd felt himself to be her helpless slave all his former amours seemed suddenly empty and vulgar things she came late into the drawingroom her greeting was as carelessly kind as usual there was no perceptible difference in her manner of speech yet his observation of her was so intense that he found readily the signs of some subtle indefinable change a change which began with her toilette and endedah as yet there was no ending her gown of soft white silk was daring as a french modiste could make it but its simplicity was almost nunlike she wore a string of pearls no earrings no rings and her hair was arranged low down almost like a schoolgirls she had more colour than usual a temporary restlessness seemed to have taken the place of her customary easy languor what did it mean he asked himself breathlessly was it deyes impossible for deyes himself was a watcher a thin smile parting sometimes the close set lips of his white masklike face after all how hopelessly at sea he was he knew nothing of her life of which these few days at thorpe were merely an interlude she might have lovers by the score of whom he knew nothing he was vain but he was not wholly a fool  she talked more than usual at dinnertime but afterwards she spoke of a headache and sat on the windowseat of the library a cigarette between her lips her eyes half closed when the bridge table was laid out she turned her head languidly  i will come in in the next rubber she said you four can start  they obeyed her of course but lady peggy shrugged her shoulders slightly she had no fancy for stephens bridge and they cut together wilhelmina waited until the soft fall of the cards had ceased and the hands were being examined then with a graceful movement she slipped out of the window and away into the shadows no signs of her headache were left she passed swiftly along a narrow path bordered by gigantic shrubs until she reached a small iron gate here for the first time she paused  for several moments she listened there was no sound from the great house whose outline she could barely see but whose long row of lights stretched out behind her she turned her head and looked along the grassgrown lane beyond the gate there was no one in sightno sound she lifted the latch and passed through  for a summer night it was unusually dark all day the heat had been almost tropical and now the sky was clouded over and a south wind dry and unrefreshing was moving against the tall elms every few seconds the heavens were ablaze with summer lightning once the breathless silence was broken by a low rumble of distant thunder  she reached the end of the lane before her another gate led out on to a grasscovered hill strewn with fragments of rocks she paused for a moment and looked backwards she was suddenly conscious that her heart was beating fast the piquant sense of adventure with which she had started had given place to a rarer and more exciting turmoil of the senses her breath was coming short as though she had been running  the silence seemed more complete than ever she lifted her foot and felt the white satin slipper it was perfectly dry there was no dew and as yet no rain had fallen she lifted the latch of the gate and passed through  the footpath skirted the side of a plantation and she followed it closely keeping under the shelter of the hedge every now and then a rabbit started up almost from under her feet and rushed into the hedge the spinney itself seemed alive with birds and animals startled by her light footsteps in the shelter which they had sought disturbed too by their instinct of the coming storm her footsteps grew swifter she was committed now to her enterprise vague though it had seemed to her she passed through a second gate into a ragged wood and along a winding path into a country road she turned slowly up the hill her breath was coming faster than ever now what follytranscendentalexquisite her footsteps grew slower she kept to the side of the hedge raising her skirts a little for the grass was long a few yards farther was the gate the soft swish of her silken draperies as she stole along became a clearly recognizable sound against the background of intense silence macheson had been leaning against a tree just inside he opened the gate she stepped almost into his arms her white face was suddenly illuminated by the soft blaze of summer lightning which poured from the sky he had no time to move to realize he felt her hands upon his cheek his face drawn downwards her lips soft and burning pressed against his for one long exquisite second and thenthe darkness once more and his arms were empty     chapter x  the still figure in the chair   with upraised skirts and feet that flashed like silver across the turf and amongst the bracken wilhelmina flew homewards once more her heart was like the heart of a girl her breath came in little sobs mingled with laughter the ground beneath her feet was buoyant as the clouds she had no fear of being pursuedleast of anything in the world did she desire it the passion of a woman is controlled always by her sentiment it seemed to her that that breathless episode was in itself an epic she would not for worlds have added to it have altered it in any shape or form a moments lingering might so easily have spoilt everything had he attempted to play either the prude or the lothario the delicate flavour would have passed away from the adventure which had set her heart beating once more and sent the blood singing so sweetly through her veins so she sped through the darkness leaving fragments of lace upon the thorns like some beautiful bird escaped from long captivity rushing through a strange world  before she reached the grounds the storm came there was a crash of thunder which seemed to tear apart the heavens above and then the big raindrops began to fall upon her bare shoulders and her clothes as light and airy as butterflys wings she abandoned herself to the ruin of a paquin gown without a thought of regret she even laughed softly with pleasure as she lifted her burning face to the cool sweet deluge and lessened her pace in the avenue walking with her hands behind her and her head still upraised it was a wonderful night this she had found something of her lost girlhood  she reached the house at last and stole through the hall like a truant schoolgirl her shoes were nothing but pulp her dress clung to her limbs like a grey seasoaked bathingcostume everywhere on the oak floor and splendid rugs she left a trail of wet on tiptoe she stole up the stairs looking guiltily around yet with demure laughter in her glowing eyes she met only one amazed servant whom she dispatched at once for her own maid in the bathroom she began to strip off her clothes even before hortense who loved her could effect a breathless entrance  eh madame madame the girl exclaimed with uplifted hands  wilhelmina stopped her laughing  its all right hortense she exclaimed gaily i was out in the grounds and got caught in the storm turn on the hot water and cut these lacesso  to hortense the affair was a tragedy her mistress indifference could not lessen it  madame she declared the gown is ruineda divine creation madame has never looked so well in anything else  then i am glad i wore it tonight was the astonishing reply quick quick quick hortense get me into the bath and bring me some wine and biscuits i am hungry i dont think i could have eaten any dinner  hortense worked with nimble fingers but her eyes at every opportunity were studying her mistress face was it the english rain which could soften and beautify like this madame was brilliantand so young such a colour such a fire in the eyes madame laughed as she thrust her from the room  the wine hortense and the biscuitsno sandwiches i die of hunger and send word to the library that i have been caught in the storm and must change my clothes but shall be down presently so                                       she found them an hour later just finishing a rubber their languid postmortem upon a curiously played hand was broken off upon her entrance they made remarks about the storm and her illluckhad she been far from shelter was she not terrified by the lightning lady peggy remembered her gown deyes alone was silent she felt him watching her all the time taking cold note of her brilliant colour the softer light in her eyes she felt that he saw her as she wasa woman suddenly set free even though for a few short hours she had broken away from them all and she gloried in it  she played bridge laterbrilliantly as usual and with success then she leaned back in her chair and faced them all  dear guests she murmured you remember the condition the only condition upon which we bestowed our company upon one another in this benighted place you remember it was agreed that when you were bored you left without excuse or any foolish apologies the same to apply to your hostess  my dear wilhelmina lady peggy exclaimed i know what youre going to say and i wont go im not due anywhere till the thirteenth i wont be stranded  wilhelmina laughed  you foolish woman she exclaimed who wants you to go you shall be chatelaineplay hostess and fill the place if you like only you mustnt have leslie over more than twice a week  you are going to desert us deyes asked coolly  it was in the bond wasnt it she answered peggy will look after you all i am sure  you mean that you are going away to leave thorpe stephen hurd asked abruptly  she turned her head to look at him he was sitting a little outside the circlean attitude typical perhaps of his position there the change in her tone was slight indeed but it was sufficient  i am thinking of it she answered you gilbert and captain austin can find some men to shoot no doubt ask any one you like peggy will see about some women for you i draw the line at that redhaired egremont woman anybody else  this is a blow deyes remarked but it was in the bond nothing will move me from here till the seventeenthunless your chef should leave do we meet in marienbad  i am not sure wilhelmina answered playing idly with the cards i feel that my system requires something more soothing  i hate them allthose german baths lady peggy declared ridiculous places every one of them  after all you see wilhelmina declared illness of any sort is a species of uncleanliness i think i should like to go somewhere where people are healthy or at least not so disgustingly frank about their livers  why not stay here stephen ventured to suggest i doubt whether any one in thorpe knows what a liver is  inutile lady peggy exclaimed wilhelmina has the wander fever i can see it in her face is it the thunder i wonder  deyes walked to the window and threw it open the storm was over but the rain was still falling a soft steady downpour the cooler air which swept into the room was almost faint with the delicious perfume of flowers and shrubs bathed in the refreshing downpour  i think he said that there is some magic abroad tonight did you meet lucifer walking in the rose garden he asked turning slightly towards his hostess the storm may have brought himeven here  neither lucifer nor any other of his princely fellows she answered the only demon is hereshe touched her bosom lightlythe demon of unrest it is not i alone who am born with the wanderers curse there are many of us you know  he shook his head  you have not the writing in your face he said i do not believe that you are one of the accursed at all tonight  she was standing by his side now looking out into the velvety darkness her eyes challenged his  well tonight  tonight you have the look of one who has found what she has sought for for a long time this sounds bald but it is as near to truth as i can get  she was silent for a moment she stood by his side listening to the soft constant patter of the rain the faraway rumblings of the dying storm  one has moods she murmured  heaven forbid that a woman should be without them he answered  do you ever feel as though something were going to happen she asked suddenly  often he answered but nothing ever does  lady peggy came yawning over to them  my dear she said i feel it in my very bones i firmly believe that something is going to happen to every one of us i have a most mysterious pricking about my left elbow  to every one of us stephen hurd asked idly enough  to every one of us she answered to you even who live in thorpe remember my words when you get home tonight or when you wake in the morning as for you wilhelmina i am not at all sure that you have not already met with your adventure  deyes lit a cigarette  let us remember this he declared in a weeks time we will compare notes  stephen hurd stood up to take his leave  you are really goingsoon he asked as he bent over her carelessly offered hand  as soon as i can decide where to go to she answered  can i give my father any message would you care to see him tomorrow morning he asked  she shook her head  it is not necessary she answered  he made his adieux reluctantly somehow he felt that the night had not been a success she was going away very likely he would not see her again the great house and all its glories would be closed to him to do him justice he thought of that less than the casual manner of her farewell his vanity was deeply wounded she had begun by being so graciousno wonder that he had lost his head a little he thought over the events of the last few days something had occurred to alter her could he have offended in any way  he walked dejectedly home heedless of the sodden path and wet grass a light was still burning in the study he hesitated for a moment and then turning the handle entered  youre late father he remarked going towards the cupboard to select a pipe  there was no answer the still figure in the chair never moved something in the silence struck stephen as ominous he turned abruptly round and for the first time noticed the condition of the room a chair was overturned a vase of flowers spilt upon the table the low window from which one stepped almost into the village street was wide open the desk in front of the motionless figure was littered all over with papers in wild confusion stephen with a low cry of horror crossed the room and laid his hand upon his fathers shoulder he tried to speak to him but the words stuck in his throat he knew very well that there could be no reply his father was sitting dead in his chair     chapter xi  the baying of the hounds   out amongst the broken fragments of the storm on the hilltop and down the raindrenched lane macheson sought in vain by physical exertion to still the fever which burned in his veins nothing he could do was able to disturb that wonderful memory to lessen for an instant the significance of those few amazing seconds the world of women all the lighter and quieter joys of life he had with the fierce asceticism of the young reformer thrust so resolutely behind him but he had never imagined anything like this its unexpectedness had swept him off his feet the memory of it was most delicious torture  sleephe dared not think of it who could sleep with such a fire in his blood as this he heard the storm die away thunder and wind and rain melted into the deep stillness of midnight a dim moon shone behind a veil of mist the dripping of rain from the trees alone remained then he heard a footstep coming down the lane his first wild thought was that she had returned his eyes burned their way through the darkness soon he saw that it was a man who came unsteadily but swiftly down the roadway  macheson leaned over the gate he would have preferred not to disclose himself but as the man passed he was stricken with a sudden consciousness that for him the events of the night were not yet over this was no villager he had not even the appearance of an englishman he was short and inclined to be thickset his coat collar was turned up and a tweed cap was drawn down to his eyes he walked with uneven footsteps and muttered to himself words that sounded like words of prayer only they were in some foreign language macheson accosted him  hullo he said have you lost your way  the man cried out and then stood still trembling on the roadside he turned a white scared face to where macheson was leaning against the gate  who is that he cried what do you want with me  macheson stepped into the lane  nothing at all he answered reassuringly i simply thought that you might have lost your way these are lonely parts  the newcomer drew a step nearer he displayed a small ragged beard a terrorstricken face and narrow very bright eyes his black clothes were soaked and splashed with mud  i want a railway station he said rapidly where is the nearest  macheson pointed into the valley  just where you see that light burning he answered but there will be no trains till the morning  then i must walk the man declared feverishly how far is it to nottingham  twentyfive miles macheson answered  too far and leicester  twelve perhaps but you are walking in the wrong direction  the man turned swiftly round  point towards leicester he said i shall find my way  macheson pointed across the trees  you cant miss it he declared climb the hill till you get to a road with telegraph wires turn to the left and you will walk into leicester  for some reason the stranger seemed to be occupied in looking earnestly into machesons face  what are you doing here he asked abruptly  i am close to where i am staying macheson answered just in the wood there  the man took a quick step forwards and then reeled his hand flew to his side he was attacked by sudden faintness and would have fallen but for machesons outstretched arm  god he muttered it is finished  he was obviously on the verge of a collapse macheson dragged him into the shelter and poured brandy between his teeth he revived a little and tried to rise  i must go on he cried i dare not stay here  the terror in his face was unmistakable macheson looked at him gravely  you had better stay where you are till morning he said you are not in a fit state to travel  the man had raised himself upon one arm he looked wildly about him  where am i he demanded what is this place  it is a gamekeepers shelter macheson answered which i am making use of for a few days you are welcome to stay here until the morning  i must go on the man moaned i am afraid  almost as he uttered the words he fell back and went off immediately into an uneasy doze macheson threw his remaining rug over the prostrate figure and lighting his pipe strolled out into the spinney the mans coming filled him with a vague sense of trouble he seemed so utterly out of keeping with the place he represented an alien and undesirable notea note almost of tragedy all the time in his broken sleep he was muttering to himself once or twice he cried out in terror once especiallymacheson turned round to find him sitting up on the rug his brown eyes full of wild fear and the perspiration running down his face a stream of broken words flowed from his lips macheson thrust him back on the rug  go to sleep he said there is nothing to be afraid of  after that the man slept more soundly macheson himself dozed for an hour until he was awakened by the calling of the birds directly he opened his eyes he knew that something had happened to him it was not only the music of the birdsthere was a strange new music stirring in his heart the pearly light in the eastern sky had never seemed so beautiful never surely had the sunlight streamed down upon so perfect a corner of the earth and then with a quick rush of blood to his cheeks he remembered what it was that had so changed the world he lived again through that bewildering moment again he felt the delicious warmth of her presence the touch of her hair as it had brushed his cheek the soft passionate pressure of her lips against his it was like an episode from a fairy story there was something so delicate so altogether fanciful in that flying visit something too so unbelievable when he thought of her as the mistress of thorpe the languid insolent woman of the world who had treated him so coldly  then a movement behind reminded him of his strange visitor he turned round the man was already on his feet he looked better for his sleep but the wild look was still in his eyes  i must go he said i ought to have started before thank you for your shelter  macheson reached out for his spirit lamp  wait a few minutes he said and i will have some coffee ready  the man hesitated he looked sorely in need of something of the sort as he came to the opening of the shelter the trembling seized him again he looked furtively out as though he feared the daylight the sunshine and the bright open day seemed to terrify him  i ought to have gone on last night he muttered i must  he broke off his sentence macheson too had turned his head to listen  what is that he asked sharply  the baying of dogs macheson answered  dogs what dogs he demanded  colonel harveys bloodhounds  the mans face was ashen now to the lips he clutched machesons arm frantically  they are after me he exclaimed where can i hide tell me quick  macheson looked at him gravely  what have you been doing he asked they do not bring bloodhounds out for nothing  i have hurt a man down in the village was the terrified answer i didnt mean tono i swear that i did not mean to i went to his house and i asked him for money i had a right to it and i asked him to tell me wherebut oh you would not understand listen i swear to you that i did not mean to hurt him why should i he was old and i think he fainted god do you hear that  he clung to macheson in a frenzy the deep baying of the dogs was coming nearer and nearer  listen macheson said the dogs will not be allowed to hurt you but if you are loose i promise that i will protect you from them you had better wait here with me  the man fell upon his knees  sir he begged i am innocent of everything except a blow struck in anger help me to escape i implore you there are others who will sufferif anything happens to me  the law is just macheson answered you will suffer nothing except justice  i want mercy not justice the man sobbed for the love of god help me  macheson hesitated again the early morning stillness was broken by that hoarse terrifying sound his sporting instincts were aroused he had small sympathy with the use of such means against human beings  i will give you a chance he said remember it is nothing more follow me  he led the way to the slate pit  can you swim he asked  yes the man answered  this is where i take my morning bath macheson said you will see that though you can scramble down and dive in it is too precipitous to get out therefore i have fixed up a rope on the other sideit goes through those bushes and is attached to the trunk of a tree beneath the bracken if you swim across you can pull yourself out of the water and hide just above the water in the bushes there is just a chance that you may escape observation  already he was on his way down but macheson stopped him  i shall leave a suit of dry clothes in the shelter he said if they should give up the chase you are welcome to them now you had better dive they are in the spinney  the man went in after the fashion of a practised diver macheson turned round and retraced his steps towards his temporary dwellinghouse     chapter xii  retreat   out in the lane a motley little group of men were standing stephen hurd was in the act of springing off his brown cob the dogs were already in the shelter  what the devil are you doing here hurd asked as macheson strode through the undergrowth  macheson pointed to the shelter  i could find no other lodging he answered thanks to circumstances of which you are aware  stephen hurd kicked the gate open he was pale and there were deep lines under his eyes he was still in his evening clothes except for a rough tweed coat but his white tie was hanging loose and his patentleather shoes were splashed with mud  we are chasing a man he said have you seen him  i have macheson answered what has he done  there was a momentary silence hurd spoke with a sob  murderedmy father  macheson was shocked  you meanthat mr hurd is dead he asked in an awestricken tone  dead the young man answered with a sob killed in his chair  the dogs came out of the shelter they turned towards the interior of the spinney the little crowd came streaming through the gate  i gave shelter to a man who admitted that he was in trouble he said gravely he heard the dogs and he was terrified he has jumped into the slate quarry  the dogs were on the trail now they followed them to the edge of the quarry here the bushes were trodden down a mans cap was hanging on one close to the bottom they all peered over into the still water unnaturally black amies the head keeper raised his head  its twentyfive feet deepsome say forty and a sheer drop he declared impressively well have to drag it for the body  best take the dogs round the other side and make sure he aint got out again one of the crowd suggested  amies pointed scornfully to the precipitous side such a feat was clearly impossible nevertheless the dogs were taken round for a few minutes they were uneasy but eventually they returned to the spot from which their intended victim had dived every one was peering down into the dark water as though fascinated  i thought as they come up once or twice before they were drownded somebody remarked  not unless they want to another answered this chap wasnt too anxious he knew his goose was cooked  the dogs were muzzled and led away one by one the labourers and servants dispersed two of them started off to telegraph for a drag stephen hurd was one of the last to depart  i hope you will allow me to say how sorry i am for you macheson declared earnestly such a tragedy in a village like thorpe seems almost incredible i suppose it was a case of attempted robbery  i dont know im sure hurd answered there was plenty of money left untouched and i cant find that there is any short the man arrived after the maids had gone to bed but they heard him knock at the door and heard my father let him in  they didnt hear any struggle then macheson asked  hurd shook his head  there was only one blow upon his head he answered graikson says that death was probably through shock  macheson felt curiously relieved  the man did not go there as a murderer then he remarked perhaps not even as a thief there may have been a quarrel  he killed him anyhow hurd said brokenly what time was it when you first saw him  about midnight i should think macheson answered he came down the lane like a drunken man  what was he like hurd asked  small and i should say a foreigner macheson answered he spoke english perfectly but there was an accent and when he was asleep he talked to himself in a language which to the best of my belief i have never heard before in my life  a foreigner hurd muttered you are sure of that  quite macheson answered there could be no mistake about it  stephen hurd mounted his cob and turned its head towards home he asked no more questions he seemed if possible graver than ever before he started however he pointed with his whip towards the shelter  youve no right there you know he said we cant allow it you must clear out at once  very well macheson answered im trespassing of course but one must sleep somewhere  there is no necessity for you to remain in thorpe at all hurd said i think in the circumstances the best thing you can do is to go  in the circumstances the irony of the phrase struck home what did this young man know of the circumstances there were reasons now indeed why he should fly from thorpe as from a place stricken with the pestilence but no other soul in this world could know of those reasons save himselfand she  i should not of course think of holding my services at present macheson said gravely if you think it would be better i will go away  stephen hurd nodded as he cantered off  i am glad to hear you say so he declared shortly go and preach in the towns where this scum is reared theres plenty of work for missioners there  macheson stood still until the young man on his pony had disappeared then he turned round and walked slowly back towards the slate quarry the black waters remained smooth and unrippled there was no sound of human movement anywhere in the adjoining field a harvestingmachine was at work in the spinney itself the rabbits disturbed last night by the storm were scurrying about more frolicsome than usual a solitary thrush was whistling in the background the sunlight lay in crooked beams about the undergrowth a gentle west breeze was just stirring the foliage overhead there was nothing in the air to suggest in any way the strange note of tragedy which the coming of this hunted man had nevertheless brought  macheson was turning away when a slight disturbance in the undergrowth on the other side of the quarry attracted his notice he stood still and watched the spot the bracken was shaking slightlythen the sound of a dry twig suddenly snapped for a moment he hesitated then he turned on his heel and walked abruptly away with almost feverish haste he flung his few belongings into his portmanteau leaving in the shelter his flask a suit of clothes and several trifles five minutes later he was on his way down the hill with his bag upon his shoulder and his face set southwards     chapter xiii  a creature of impulse   up the broad avenue to the great house of thorpe stephen hurd slowly made his way his hands clasped behind him his eyes fixed upon the ground but his appearance was not altogether the appearance of a man overcome with grief the events of the last few days had told upon him and his deep mourning had a sombre look yet there were thoughts working even then in his brain which battled hard with his natural depression strange things had happenedstranger things than he was able all at once to digest he could not see the end but there were possibilities upon which he scarcely dared to brood  he was shown into the library and left alone for nearly twenty minutes then wilhelmina came languid and moving as though with tired feet yet her manner was gentler and kinder than usual she leaned back in one of the vast easychairs and murmured a few graceful words of sympathy  we were all so sorry for you mr hurd she said it was a most shocking affair  i thank you very muchmadam he replied after a moments pause it was better perhaps for the present to assume that their relations were to continue those of employer and employed  i do not know she continued whether you care to speak about this shocking affair perhaps you would prefer that we did not allude to it for the present  he shook his head  i am not sure he answered that it is not rather a relief to have it spoken of one cant get it out of ones mind of course  there is no news of the manno fresh capture  none he answered they are dragging the slate quarry again today i believe there are some very deep holes where the body may have drifted  do you believe that that is the case she asked or do you think that he got clean away  i cannot tell he answered it seems impossible that he should have escaped altogether without help  and that he could not have had could he she asked  he looked across at her thoughtfully watching her face curious to see whether his words might have any effect  only from one person he said  yes  from macheson the fellow who came here to convert us all he said deliberately  beyond a slight elevation of the eyebrows his scrutiny was in vain for she made no sign  he scarcely seems a likely person does he to aid a criminal she asked in measured tones  stephen hurd shrugged his shoulders  perhaps not he admitted but at any rate he sheltered him  as he doubtless would have done any passerby on such a night she remarked by the bye what has become of that young man  he has left the neighbourhood hurd answered shortly  left altogether she inquired  i imagine so hurd answered i had the shelter destroyed and i gave him to understand pretty clearly what your wishes were there really wasnt much else for him to do  her eyelids drooped over her half closed eyes for a moment she was silent  if you hear of him again she said quietly be so good as to let me know  her indifference seemed too complete to be assumed yet somehow or other hurd felt that she was displeased with him  i will do so he said if i hear anything about him it scarcely seems likely  wilhelmina sat quite still her head resting slightly upon the long delicate fingers of her right hand was turned away from the young man who was daring to watch her she was apparently gazing across the park down the magnificent avenue of elms which led to the village so he was gonewithout a word how else on the whole she could not but approve and yetand yet  she turned once more to hurd  i read the account of the inquest on your fathers death she said speaking very slowly with her usual drawl yet with a softer note in her voice as though out of respect for the dead man does it not seem very strange that the money was left untouched  yes he answered yet after all i dont know you see the governor must have closed with the fellow and shown fight before he got that knock on the head if the thief was really only an ordinary tramp hed be scared to death at what hed done and probably bolt for his life without stopping to take anything with him  isnt it rather surprising to have trampsin thorpe she asked  i have scarcely ever seen one he answered  wilhelmina turned her head slightly so that she was now directly facing him she looked him steadily in the eyes  has it occurred to you mr hurd she asked that this young man may not have been a tramp at all and that his visit to your father may have been on other business than that of robbery  he hesitated for a moment  my fathers connexions with the outside world he said slowly were so slight  yet it has occurred to you  yes he admitted  and have you come to any conclusion  none he declared  you carried out my instructions with regard to the papers and documents belonging to the estate  certainly madam he answered within five minutes of receiving your message they were all locked up in the safe and the key handed to your messenger  you did not go through them yourself she asked  i did not he answered lying with admirable steadiness i scarcely felt that i was entitled to do so  so that you could not tell if any were missing she continued  i could not he admitted  your father never spoke then of any connexions with peopleoutside thorpelikely to prove of a dangerous character  the young man smiled my father he said had not been farther than loughborough for twenty years  there was a short silence wilhelmina deliberately and without any attempt at concealment was meditatively watching the young man studying his features with a halfcontemptuous and yet searching interest perhaps the slightly curving lips the hard intentness of her gaze suggested that he was disbelieved he lost colour and fidgeted about it was a scrutiny not easy to bear and he felt that it was going against him already she had written him down a liar  she spoke to him at last if the silence had not ended soon he would have made some blundering attempt to retrieve his position she spoke just in time to avert such ignominy  mr hurd she said the question of your fathers successor is one that has doubtless occurred to you as it has to me i trust that you will at any rate remain here as to whether i can offer you your fathers position in its entirety i am not for the present assured  he glanced up at her furtively he was certain now that he had played his cards ill she had read through him easily he cursed himself for a lout  you see she continued the post is one of great responsibility because it entails the management of the whole estates it is necessary for me to feel absolute confidence in the person who undertakes it i have not known you very long mr hurd  he bowed he could not trust himself to words  i have instructed them to send some one down from my solicitors office for a week or so she continued to assist you in the meantime i must think the matter over  i am very much obliged to you madam he said you will find me i think quite as trustworthy and devoted to your interests as my father  she smiled slightly she recognized exactly his quandary and it amused her the slightest suggestion of menace in his manner would be to give the lie to himself  i am coming down this afternoon she said to go through the safes please be there in case i want you you will not forget in case you should hear anything of mr macheson that i desire to be informed  he took his leave humiliated and angry he had started the game with a wrong moveretrievable perhaps but annoying wilhelmina passed into the library where lady peggy in a wonderful morning robe was leaning back in an easychair dictating letters to captain austin  you dear woman she exclaimed dont interrupt us will you i have found an ideal secretary writes everything i tell him and spells quite decently considering his profession my conscience is getting lighter every moment  and my heart heavier austin grumbled a most flirtatious correspondence yours  she laughed softly  my next shall be to my dressmaker she declared such a charming woman and so trustful behave yourself nicely and you shall go with me to call on her next week and see her mannikins by the bye wilhelmina am i hostess or are you  you by all means wilhelmina answered i shall go tomorrow or the next day is any one coming to lunch  his grace i fancyno one else  wilhelmina yawned  where is gilbert she asked  asleep on the lawn last time i saw him  no one shooting then  were going to beat up the home turnips after lunch captain austin answered its rather an off day with us gilbert is nursing his legfancies he has rheumatism coming  she strolled out into the garden but she avoided the spot where gilbert deyes lounged in an easychair reading the paper and smoking cigarettes with his leg carefully arranged on a garden chair in front of him she took the winding path which skirted the kitchen gardens and led to the green lane along which the carts passed to the home farm she felt that what she was doing was in the nature of an experiment she was yielding again to that most astonishing impulse which once before had taken her so completely by surprise she passed out of the gate and along the lane she began to climb the hill about the success of her experiment she no longer had any doubt her heart was beating with pleasant insistence a feeling of suppressed excitement sent the blood gliding through her veins with delicious softness all the time she mocked at herselfthat this should be wilhelmina thorpehatton to whom the most distinguished men not only in one capital but in europe had paid court whom the most ardent wooer had failed to move who had found indeed in all the professions of lovemaking something insufferably tedious she was at once amused and annoyed at herself but an instinctive habit of truthfulness forbade even selfdeception her cheeks were aflame and her heart was beating like a girls as she reached the spinney she recognized the fact that she was experiencing a new and delightful pleasure an emotion as unexpected and ridiculous as it was inexplicable but she hugged it to herself it pleased her immensely to feel that the impossible had happened what all this army of men experienced in the wiles of lovemaking had failed to do a crazy boy had accomplished without an effort absolutely bizarre of course but not so wonderful after all she was so secure against any ordinary assault she felt herself like the heroine of one of gautiers novels if he had been there himself she would have taken him into her arms with all the passionate simplicity of a child  but he was not there on the contrary the place was looking forlorn and deserted the shelter had been razed to the groundshe felt that she hated stephen hurd as she contemplated its ruinthe hedge was broken down by the inrush of people a few days ago in the absence of any sunshine the country around seemed bleak and colourless she leaned over the gate and half closed her eyes memory came more easily like that     chapter xiv  searching the papers   the late stephen hurd had been a methodical man every one of those many packets of foolscap and parchment bore in the lefthand corner near the top a few carefully written words summarizing their contents it was clear from the first that wilhelmina had undertaken not an examination but a search mortgages leases agreements she left unopened and untouched one by one she passed them back to the young man who handed them out to her for replacement in the end she had retained one small packet of letters only on the outside of which were simply the initials p n these she held for a moment thoughtfully in her hand  do you happen to remember mr hurd she said whether this small packet which i have here was amongst the papers which you found had been disturbed after the attack upon your father  i am sorry the young man answered but it is quite impossible for me to say i do not remember it particularly  wilhelmina turned it over thoughtfully it was an insignificant packet to hold the tragedy of a womans life  you see she continued that it has the appearance of having been tampered with there are marks of sealing wax upon the tape and upon the paper here then too she continued turning it over it has been tied up hastily unlike any of the other packets the tape too is much too long it looks almost as though some letters or papers had been withdrawn  i am afraid i cannot help you at all he admitted regretfully my father never allowed any one but himself to open that safe mine was the outofdoor share of the workand the rentbook of course i kept that  she slowly undid the tape the contents of the packet consisted of several letters which she smoothed out with her fingers before beginning to read stephen hurd stood with his back towards her rearranging the bundles of documents in the safe  you have no idea then she asked softly of the contents of this packet  he turned deliberately round he was not in the least comfortable it was almost as though she could see through his tweed shootingjacket into that inner pocket  may i see which packet you refer to he asked  she showed it to him without placing it in his hand he shook his head  no he said i have not noticed them before  she sighedor was it a yawn at any rate her eyes left his face for which he was immediately grateful she began to read the papers and having finished his task he walked towards the window and stood there looking out he stood there minute after minute hearing only the sound of rustling paper behind when at last it ceased he turned around  she had risen to her feet and was slowly drawing on her gloves the letters had disappeared presumably into her pocket but she made no reference to them when she spoke her voice was smooth and deliberate as usual somehow or other he was at once conscious however that she had received a shock  i presume mr hurd she said quietly that amongst your fathers private papers you did not discover anythingunexpected  i am afraid i scarcely follow you madam he answered  i am asking you she repeated deliberately whether amongst your fathers private papers which i presume you have looked through you found anything of a surprising nature  he shook his head  i found scarcely any he answered only his will and a memorandum of a few investments may i ask  she turned towards the door  no she said do not ask me any questions to tell you the truth i am not yet fully persuaded that the necessity exists  i do not understand he protested  illustration forgive me he said with his hand upon the gate page 117  she shrugged her shoulders she did not trouble to explain her words he followed her along the cool whiteflagged hall hung with old prints and trophies of sport into the few yards of garden outside brilliant with cottage flowers beyond the little iron gate her carriage was waitinga low victoria drawn by a pair of great horses whose sleek coats and dark crimson rosettes suggested rather a turn in the park than these country lanes the young man was becoming desperate she was leaving him altogether mystified somewhere or other he had missed his cue he had meant to have conducted the interview so differently and never had she looked so provokingly well he recognized with hopeless admiration the perfection of her toilettethe trim white flannel dress shaped by the hand of an artist to reveal in its simple lines the peculiar grace of her slim figure the patent shoes with their suggestion of openwork silk stockings the black picture hat and veil a delicate recognition of her visit to a house of mourning yet light and gossamerlike with no suggestion of gloom never had she seemed so desirable to him so fascinating and yet so unattainable he made a last and clumsy effort to reestablish himself  forgive me he said with his hand upon the gate but i must ask you what you mean by that last question my father had no secrets that i know of how could he when for the last forty years his life was practically spent in this village street  she nodded her head slowly  sometimes she murmured events come to those even who sit and wait those whose lives are absolutely secluded no one is safe from fate you know  but my father he answered he had no tastes no interests outside the boundary of your estates  she motioned to him to open the gate  perhaps not she assented yet i suppose that there is not one of us who knows as much of his neighbours life as he imagines he does good afternoon mr hurd my visit has given me something to think about i may send for you to come to the house before i go away  she drove away leaning back amongst the cushions with half closed eyes as though tired the country scenery with its pastoral landscape its watteaulike perfections was wholly unseen her memory had travelled back she was away amongst the days when the roar of life had been in her ears when for a short while indeed the waves had seemed likely to break over her head an unpleasant echo this no more than an echoand yet the thought of old stephen hurd lying in his grave suddenly chilled her she shivered as she left the carriage and instead of entering the house crossed the lawn to where gilbert deyes was lounging he struggled to his feet at her approach but she waved him back again  sybarite she murmured glancing around at his arrangements for complete comfort you have sent austin out alone  dear lady i confess it he answered what would you have it is too fine an afternoon to kill anything  she sank into a chair by his side a slight smile parted her lips as she glanced around on a table by his side a table drawn back into the shade of the cedar tree were several vellumbound volumes a tall glass and a crystal jug half full of some delicate amber beverage mixed with fruit and ice a box of cigarettes an ivory papercutter and a fan  your capacity for making yourself comfortable she remarked amounts almost to genius  let it go at that he answered i like the sound of the word  i want you to go to paris for me she said abruptly  he flicked the ash off the end of his cigarette and looked at her thoughtfully not a line of his face betrayed the least sign of surprise  tomorrow he asked  yes  i can get up in time for the twotwenty he remarked thoughtfully i wonder whether it will be too late for the armenonville  she laughed quietly  you are a poseur she declared  naturally he admitted we all are even when the audience consists of ourselves alone i fancy im rather better than most though  she nodded  you wont mind admittingto methat you are surprised  astonished he said to descend to the commonplace what on earth do you want me to go to paris for  i will tell you she answered forget for a moment the paris that you know and remember the paris of the tourist  painful he answered but it is done  the h√¥tel de luxe  i know it well  there are a race of creatures there small parasitical insects who hang about the hall and the boulevard outsideguides they call themselves  show you something altogether new this evening captain he quoted yes i know them  there is or was one she continued who goes by the name of thomas johnson he is undersized he has red cheeks and puffy brown eyes he used to wear a glazed black hat and he speaks every language without an accent  i should know the beast anywhere he declared  find out if he is there still let him take you out dont lose sight of himand write to me  tomorrow night he said i will renew my youth i will search for him on the boulevards and see the sights which make a gay dog of the travelling briton  she nodded  youre a good sort gilbert she said simply thanks     chapter xv  on the spree   high up on the seventh floor of one of londons newest and loftiest buildings a young man sat writing in a somewhat barely furnished office he wrote deliberately and with the air of one who thoroughly enjoyed his occupation the place had a bookish aspectthe table was strewn with magazines and books of reference piles of literature of a varied order stood in the absence of bookshelves against the wall the young man himself however was the most interesting object in the room he was big and dark and rugged there was strength in his squareset shoulders in the compression of his lips even in the way his finger guided the pen across the paper he was thoroughly absorbed in his task nevertheless he raised his head at a somewhat unusual sound the lift had swung up to his floor he heard the metal gate thrown open there was a knock at the door and macheson walked in  victor by glory  down went the pen and richard holderness stood up at his desk with outstretched hands macheson grasped them heartily and seated himself on the edge of the table  its good to see you dick he declared like coming back to the primitive forces of nature unchanged unchanging the sight of yous enough to stop a revolution  youre feeling like that are you his friend answered his eyes fixed upon machesons face yes i see you are go ahead or will you smoke first  macheson produced his pipe and his host a great tin of honeydew macheson helped himself slowly he seemed to be trying to gain time  blessed compact ours the giant remarked leaning back in his chair no probing for confidences no silly questions out with it  ive started wrong macheson said ill have to go back on my tracks a bit anyway  holderness grunted affably  nothing like mistakes he remarked best discipline in the world  i started on a theory macheson continued thoughtfully it didnt pan out the people i have been trying to get at are better left alone  exactly why holderness asked  ill tell you macheson answered you know ive seen a bit of what we call village life their standard isnt high enough of course things come too easily their noses are too close to the ground they are moderately sober moderately industrious but the sameness of life is at work all the time it makes machines of the factory hands animals of the country folk i knew that before i started i thought i could lift their heads a little its too big a task for me dick  of course holderness assented you cant graft on to dead wood  they live decent livesmost of them macheson continued thoughtfully they cant understand that any change is needed no more can their landlords or their clergy a mechanical performance of the christian code seems all that any one expects from them dick its all theyre capable of you cant alter laws you cant create intelligence you cant teach these people spirituality  as well try to teach em to fly holderness answered i could have told you so before if it had been of any use what about these welshmen though  its hysteria macheson declared if you can get through the hide you can make the emotions run riot stir them into a frenzy its a debauch ive been there to see the true spiritual life is partly intellectual  what are you going to do now holderness asked  i dont know macheson answered i havent finished yet dick curse all women  the giant looked thoughtful  im sorry he said simply  macheson swung himself from the table he walked up and down the room  it isnt serious he declared it isnt even definite but its like a perfume or a wonderful chord of music or the call of the sea to an inlandbred viking its under my heel dick but i cant crush it i came away from leicestershire because i was afraid  does sheexist holderness asked  not for me macheson declared hurriedly dont think that i shouldnt have mentioned it but for our compact  holderness nodded  bad luck he said this craving for something we havent gotcant havei wish i could find the germ the world should go free of it for a generation wed build empires wed reconstruct society its a deadly germ though victor and its the princes of the world who suffer most theres only one antidotework  give me some macheson begged  the giant looked at him thoughtfully  right he answered but not today clothes up in town  macheson nodded  well go on the bust holderness declared ive been dying for a spree well have it where are you staying  my old rooms macheson answered i looked in on my way from the station and found them empty  capital were close together come on well do the west end like two gay young bucks five oclock isnt it well walk up regent street and have an ap√©ritif at biflores wait till i brush my hat  macheson made no difficulties but he was puzzled holderness he knew well enough had no leanings towards the things which he proposed with so much enthusiasm was it a pilgrimage they were to start uponor what after all why need he worry he was content to go his friends way  so they walked up regent street bright with the late afternoon sunshine threading their way through the throngs of sauntering men and women gazing into the shopsand at one another at biflores macheson would have felt out of his element but for holderness selfpossession he had the air of going through what might have been an everyday performance ordered vermouth mixed lit a cigarette leaned back at his ease upon the cushioned seat and told with zest and point a humorous story there were women there a dozen or more some alone some in little groups women smartly enough dressed goodlooking too and prosperous with gold purses and paris hats yetlacking something macheson did not ask himself what it was he felt it he knew too that holderness meant him to feel it the shadow of tragedy was therethe worlds tragedy  they went back to their rooms to dress and met at a popular restaurantone of the smartest here macheson began to recover his spirits the music was soft yet inspiring the womenthere were none alone herewere well dressed and pleasant to look at the sound of their laughter and the gay murmur of conversation was like a delightful undernote the dinner and wine were good holderness seemed to know very well how to choose both macheson began to feel the depression of a few hours ago slipping away from him once or twice he laughed softly to himself holderness looked at him questioningly  you should have been with me for the last fortnight dick he remarked smiling the lady of the manor at thorpe didnt approve of me and i had to sleep for two nights in a gamekeepers shelter  didnt approve of you to such an extent holderness remarked was she one of those old country frumpsall starch and prejudice  then for a moment the heel was lifted and a rush of memory kept him dumb he felt the tearing of the blood in his veins the burning of his cheeks the wild delicious sense of an exaltation indefinable mysterious he was tonguetied suddenly apprehensive of himself and his surroundings he felt somehow nearer to herit was her atmosphere this was he weaker than his friendhad he indeed more to fear he raised his glass mechanically to his lips and the soft fire of the amber wine soothed whilst it disquieted him again he wondered at his friends whim in choosing this manner of spending their evening  no he said at last and he was surprised to find his voice composed and natural the mistress of thorpe is not in the least that sort thorpe is almost a model village and of course there is the church and a very decent fellow for vicar i am not at all sure that she was not right i must have seemed a fearful interloper  holderness stretched his long limbs under the table and laughed softly  well he declared it was a harebrained scheme theoretically i believe you were right theres nothing more dangerous than content sort of armour you cant get through come we mustnt miss the ballet  they threaded their way down the room suddenly macheson stopped short he was passing a table set back in a recess and occupied by two persons the girl who wore a hat and veil and whose simple country clothes were conspicuous was staring at him with something like fear in her eyes her cheeks were flushed her lips parted she was leaning forward as though to call her companions attention to machesons approach macheson glanced towards him with a sudden impulse of indignant apprehension it was stephen hurd in irreproachable evening clothes save only for his black tie and his companion was letty  macheson stopped before the table he scarcely knew what to say or how to say it but he was determined not to be intimidated by hurds curt nod  so you are up in town letty he said gravely is your mother with you  the girl giggled hysterically  oh no she declared mother cant bear travelling a lot of us came up this morning at six oclock on a day excursion six shillings each  and what time does the train go back macheson asked quickly  at twelve oclock the girl answered or as soon afterwards as they can get it off it was terribly full coming up  macheson was to some extent relieved at any rate there was nothing further that he could do he bent over the girl kindly  i hope you have had a nice day he said and wont be too tired when you get home these excursions are rather hard work remember me to your mother  he exchanged a civil word with the girls companion who was taciturn almost to insolence then he passed on and joined holderness who was waiting near the door  an oddly assorted couple your friends he remarked as they struggled into their coats  macheson nodded  the girl was my landladys daughter at thorpe and the young mans the son of the agent there he said  engaged holderness asked  imafraid not macheson answered shes up on an excursionfor the daygoes back at twelve  i suppose hes a decent fellowthe agents son holderness remarked she seems such a child  i suppose he is macheson repeated i dont care for him very much dick i suppose im an evilminded person but i hate leaving them  holderness looked back into the restaurant  you cant interfere he said its probably a harmless frolic enough come on     chapter xvi  the night side of london   no stalls left holderness declared turning away from the box office at the alhambra well go in the promenade we can find a chair there if we want to sit down  macheson followed him up the stairs and into the heavily carpeted promenade his memory of the evening a memory which clung to him for long afterwards seemed like a phantasmagoria of thrilling music a stage packed with marvellously dressed women whose movements were blended with the music into one voluptuous chorusa blaze of colour not wholly without its artistic significance and about him an air heavy with tobacco smoke and perfumes a throng of moving people more womenmany more women a girl spoke to holdernessa girl heavily rouged but not illlooking dressed in a blue muslin gown and large black hat holderness bent towards her deferentially his voice seemed to take to itself its utmost note of courtesy he answered her inquiry pleasantly and accepted a glance at her programme the girl looked puzzled but they talked together for several moments of casual things then holderness lifted his hat  my friend and i are tired he said we are going to look for a seat  she bowed and they strolled on down the promenade finding some chairs at the further end the dresses of the women brushed their feet and the perfume from the clothes was stronger even than the odour from the clouds of tobacco smoke which hung about the place macheson in whom were generations of puritanical impulses found himself shrinking back in his corner holderness turned towards him frowning  no superiority victor he said these are your fellowcreatures dont look at them as though youd come down from the clouds  it isnt that macheson answered its a matter of taste  taste rot holderness answered the factory girls hat offends my taste but i dont shrink away from her  a girl in passing stumbled against his foot holderness stood up as he apologized  i am really very sorry he said no one with feet like mine ought to sit down in a public place i hope you havent torn your dress  it really doesnt matter the girl answered i ought to have looked where i was going  in which case holderness remarked with a laugh you could not have failed to see my feet  there were two empty chairs at their table the girl glanced towards them and hesitated  do you mind if we sit down here for a minute she asked my friend and i we are rather tired  he drew the chairs towards them  by all means he answered courteously your friend does look tired  the party arranged itself holderness called to a waiter and gave an order  my friend and i he remarked indicating macheson who was fiercely uncomfortable and struggling hard not to show it are disappointed that we could not get stalls we wanted to see la guerrero and this wonderful conjurer  the place is full every night the girl answered listlessly la guerrero comes on at ten oclock you can see her from the front of the promenade easily you dont often come here do you  not very often holderness answered and you  every night the girl answered in a dull tone  that must be monotonous he said kindly  it is she admitted  they talked for a few minutes longer or rather it was holderness who mostly talked and the others who listened it struck macheson as curious that his friend should find it so easy to strike the note of their conversation and keep it there as though without any definite effort he could assume control over even the thoughts of these girls to whom he talked with such easy courtesy he told a funny story and they all laughed naturally and heartily macheson had an idea that the girls had forgotten for the moment exactly where they were something in their faces something which had almost terrified him at their first coming had relaxed if it had not passed wholly away at the sound of a few bars of music one of them leaned almost eagerly forward  there she said if you want to see la guerrero you must hurry she is coming on now  the two young men rose to their feet one of the girls looked wistfully at holderness but nothing was said beyond the ordinary farewells  thank you so much for telling us holderness said come along victor it is la guerrero  macheson breathed more freely when once they were in the throng they watched the spanish dancer with her exquisite movements sinuous full of grace holderness especially applauded loudly afterwards they found seats in the front and remained there for the rest of the performance  out in the street they hesitated holderness passed his arm through his companions  supper he declared this way did you know what a man about town i was victor ah but one must learn and life isnt all roses and honey one must learn  they threaded their way through the streets crowded with hansoms electric broughams and streams of foot passengers holderness led the way to a sombrelooking building and into a room barely lit save for the roseshaded lamps upon the tables macheson gasped as he entered nearly every table was occupied by women in evening dress women alonewaiting holderness glanced around quite unconcernedly as he gave up his coat and hat to a waiter  feeling shy victor he asked smiling never mind well find a table to ourselves all right  they sat in a corner the girls chattered and talked across themoften at them a frenchwoman superbly gowned in white lace and with a long rope of pearls around her neck paused as she passed their table she carried a pomeranian under her arm and held it out towards them  see my little dog she exclaimed he bite you messieurs are lonely  alas of necessity holderness answered in french madame is too kind  she passed on laughing macheson looked across the table almost fiercely  what are you doing it for dick he exclaimed what does it mean  his friend looked across at him steadfastly  victor he said i want you to understand you are an enthusiast a reformer a prophet of lost causes i want you to know the truth if you can see it there are many sides to life  what am i to learn of this macheson asked almost passionately  if i told you holderness answered the lesson would only be half learnt sit tight and dont be a fool drink your wine mademoiselle in violet there wants to flirt with you  shall i ask her to join us macheson demanded with wasted satire  you might do worse holderness answered calmly she could probably teach you something  it was a dull evening and many of the tables remained unoccupiedsave for the one waiting figure the women tired of looking towards the door were smoking cigarettes twirling their bracelets yawning and looking around the room many a mute invitation reached the two young men but holderness seemed to have lost his sociability his face had grown harder and he seemed glad when their meal was over and they were free to depart in the hall below they had to wait for their overcoats macheson strolled idly towards the entrance of another supper room on the ground floor and looked in an exclamation broke from his lips he turned towards holderness  you see the time he exclaimed and they are here those two  holderness nodded gravely  the girl has been crying he said and there is an a b c on the table its up to you victor we may both have to take a hand in the game no i wouldnt go in wait till they come out  they stood in the throng jostled cajoled besought at last the two rose and came towards the door letty had dried her eyes but she looked still pale and terrified hurd on the contrary was flushed as though with wine macheson took her by the arm as she passed  letty he said gravely have you missed your train  she gave a stifled cry and shrank back when she saw who it was however she recovered herself quickly  mr macheson she exclaimed how you startled me i didnt expectto see you again  about this train letty he repeated  mr hurds watch stopped she declared her eyes filling once more with tears he thought it was eleven oclockand it was ten minutes past twelve i dont know what mother will say i am sure  what are you going to do he asked  she looked round nervously  mr hurd is going to take me to some friends of his she answered you see it was his fault so he has promised to see mother and explain  hurd pushed angrily forward  look here he said to macheson have you been following us about  i have not macheson answered calmly i am very glad to have come across you though  sorry i cant return the compliment hurd remarked come letty  a girl who was passing tapped him on the arm she was dressed in blue silk with a large picture hat and she was smoking a cigarette  hullo stephen she exclaimed edith wants to see you are you coming round tonight  hurd muttered something under his breath and moved away letty looked at him with horror  stephen she exclaimed you cantyou dont mean to say that you knowany of these  she was trembling in every limb he tried to pass his arm through hers  dont be a fool letty he said its time we went or my friends will have gone to bed  she looked at him with wideopen eyes her lips were quivering it was as though she saw some new thing in his face  your friends she murmured are theythat sort oh i am afraid  she clung to macheson people were beginning to notice them he led her out into the street hurd followed angrily protesting holderness was close behind  i say you know hurd began with his arm on machesons shoulder macheson shook it off  mr hurd he said at the risk of seeming impertinent i must ask you precisely where you intend taking this girl tonight  what the devil business is it of yours hurd answered angrily  tell me all the same macheson persisted  hurd passed his arm through lettys  come letty he said we will take this hansom  the girl was only half willing macheson declined to let them go  no he said i will have my question answered  hurd turned as though to strike him but holderness intervened head and shoulders taller than the other  i think he said that we will have my friends question answered  hurd was almost shaking with rage but he answered  to some friends in cambridge terrace he said sullenly number eighteen  you will not object macheson said if i accompany you there  ill see you damned first hurd answered savagely get in letty  the girl hesitated she turned to macheson  i should like to go to the station and wait she declared  i think macheson said that you had better trust yourself to me and my friend  i am sure of it holderness added calmly  she put her hand in machesons she was as pale as death and avoided looking at hurd he took a quick step towards her  very well young lady he said if you go now you understand that i shall never see you again  she began to cry again  i wish she murmured that i had never seen you at allnever  he turned on his heel a row was impossible it occurred to him that a man of the world would face such a position calmly  very good he said we will leave it at that  he paused to light a cigarette and strolled back down the street towards the restaurant which they had just left letty was crying now in good earnest the two young men looked at one another in something like dismay then holderness began to laugh quietly  youre a nice sort of don quixote to spend an evening with he remarked softly     chapter xvii  the victims of society   the girl was still crying softly but persistently she caught hold of machesons arm  if you please i think i had better go back to stephen she said do you think i could find him  i think you had much better not letty he answered he ought not to have let you miss your train my friend here and i are going to look after you  its very kind of you the girl said listlessly but it doesnt matter much what becomes of me now mother will never forgive meand the others will all knowthat i missed the train  we must think of some way of putting that all right macheson declared i only wish that i had some relations in london can you suggest anything dick  i can take the young lady to some decent rooms holderness answered the landladys an old friend of mine shell be as right as rain there  the girl shook her head  id as soon walk about the streets she said pathetically motherll never listen to meor the others some of them saw me with stephen and they said things i think ill go to the station and wait till the five oclock train  they were walking slowly up towards piccadilly a fine rain had begun to fall and already the pavements were shining neither of them had an umbrella and lettys hat with its cheap flowers and ribbon showed signs of collapse suddenly macheson had an idea  look here he said supposing you spent the night at miss thorpehattons house in berkeley squareno one could say anything then could they  the girl looked up with a sudden gleam of hope  no i dont suppose they could she admitted but i dont know where it is and i dont suppose theyd take me in anyway  i know where it is macheson declared and well see about their taking you in i believe miss thorpehatton may be there herself stop that fourwheeler dick  they climbed into a passing cab and macheson directed the driver the girl was beginning to lose confidence again  the house is sure to be shut up she said  there will be a caretaker macheson declared hopefully well manage it never fear i believe miss thorpehatton is there herself  letty was trembling with excitement and fear  im scared to death of her she admitted shes so beautiful and she looks at you always as though you were something a long way off  macheson was suddenly silent a rush of memories surged into his brain he had sworn to keep away this was a different matter an errand of mercy nevertheless he would see her if only for a moment his heart leaped like a boys he looked eagerly out of the window already they were entering berkeley square the cab stopped  macheson looked upwards there were lights in many of the windows and a small electric brougham with a tall footman by the side of the driver was waiting opposite the door  the house is open he declared dont be afraid letty  the girl descended and clung to his arm as they crossed the pavement  i shall wait here for you holderness said good luck to you and good night young lady  macheson rang the bell the door was opened at once by a footman who eyed them in cold surprise  we wish to see miss thorpehatton for two minutes macheson said producing his card it is really an important matter or we would not disturb her at such an hour she is at home is she not  the footman looked exceedingly dubious he looked from the card to macheson and from macheson to the girl and he didnt seem to like either of them  miss thorpehatton has just returned from the opera he said and she is going on to the countess of annesleys ball directly cant you come again in the morning  quite impossible macheson declared briskly i am sure that miss thorpehatton will see me for a moment if you take that card up  the footman studied macheson again and was forced to admit that he was a gentleman he led the way into a small morningroom  miss thorpehatton shall have your card sir he said kindly take a seat  he left the room macheson drew up a chair for letty but she refused it trembling  oh i darent sit down mr macheson she declared and pleasedont say that i was with mr hurd i know he wouldnt like it  probably not macheson answered but what am i to say  anythinganything but that she begged  macheson nodded his promise then the door opened and his heart seemed to stand still she entered the room in all the glory of a wonderful toilette she wore her famous ropes of pearls the spotless white of her gown was the last word from the subtlest parisian workshop of the day but it was not these things that counted had he been dreaming he wondered a moment later or had that strange smile indeed curved her lips that marvellous light indeed flowed from her eyes it was the lady of his dreams who had enteredit was a very different woman who with a slight frown upon her smooth forehead was looking at the girl who stood trembling by machesons side  it is mr macheson is it not she said calmly the young man who wanted to convert my villagers and youwho are you she asked turning to the girl  letty foulton if you please maam the girl answered  foulton letty foulton wilhelmina repeated  yes maam my brother has onetree farm the girl continued  wilhelmina inclined her head  ah yes she remarked i remember now and what do you two want of me at this hour of the night she asked frigidly  if you will allow me i will explain macheson interrupted eagerly letty came up from thorpe this morning on an excursion train which returned at midnight  wilhelmina glanced at the clock it was five minutes to one  well  she missed it macheson continued it was very careless and very wrong of course but the fact remains that she missed it i found her in great distress she had lost her friends and there is no train back to thorpe till the morning her brother and mother are very strict and all her friends who came from thorpe will of course know thatshe remained in london the position as you will doubtless realize is a serious one for her  wilhelmina made no sign nothing in her face answered in any way the silent appeal in his  i happened to know he continued that you were in london so i ventured to bring her at once to you you are the mistress of thorpe and in our recent conversation i remember you admitted a certain amount of responsibility as regards your people there if she passes the night under your roof no one can have a word to say it will save her at once from her parents anger and the undesirable comments of her neighbours  wilhelmina glanced once more towards the clock  it seems to me she remarked that a considerable portion of the night has already passed  both macheson and the girl were silent wilhelmina for the first time addressed the latter  where have you been spending the evening she asked  we had dinner and went to a place of entertainment she faltered then we had supper and i found out how late it was  who is we  the girls face was scarlet she did not answer wilhelmina waited for a moment and then shrugged her shoulders  you are to be congratulated she said with cold irony upon your fortunate meeting with mr macheson  she had touched the bell and a footman entered  reynolds she said show this young person into the housekeepers room and ask mrs brown to take charge of her for the night  the girl moved forward impulsively but something in wilhelminas expression checked her little speech of gratitude she followed the man from the room without a word wilhelmina also turned towards the door  you will excuse me she said coldly to macheson i am already later than i intended to be  i can only apologize for disturbing you at such an hour he answered taking up his hat i could think of nothing else  she looked at him coldly  the girls parents she said are respectable people and i am sheltering her for their sake but i am bound to say that i consider her story most unsatisfactory  they were standing in the hallshe had paused on her way out to conclude her sentence her maid holding out a wonderful roselined opera cloak was standing a few yards away a manservant was waiting at the door with the handle in his hand she raised her eyes to his and macheson felt the challenge which flashed out from them she imagined then that he had been the girls companion the cold disdain of her manner was in itself an accusation  his cheeks burned with a sort of shame she had dared to think this of himand that afterwards he should have brought the girl to her to beg for shelter there were a dozen things which he ought to have said which came flashing from his brain to find themselves somehow imprisoned behind his tightly locked lips he said nothing she passed slowly almost unwillingly down the hall the maid wrapped her coat around herstill he stood like a statue he watched her pass through the opened door and enter the electric brougham he watched it even glide away then he too went and joined holderness who was waiting outside  hail succourer of damsels in distress holderness called out producing his cigarcase jolly glad you got rid of her it would have meant the waitingroom at st pancras and an allnight sitting smoke my son and we will walk homeunless you mind this bit of rain was her ladyship gracious  she was not macheson answered grimly but she is keeping the girl id like to walk he added lighting a cigar  a very elegant lady holderness remarked but i thought she looked a bit up in the air did you notice her pearls victor  macheson nodded  wonderful werent they  yes she wears them round her neck and thesethese wear always their shame he added pushing gently away a woman who clutched at his arm funny thing isnt it what are they worth ten thousand pounds very likely a lot of money for gewgawsto hang upon a womans body shall we ever have a revolution in london do you think victor  who knows macheson answered wearily not a political one perhaps but the other might come the sewers underneath are pretty full  they passed along in silence for a few minutes neither the drizzling rain nor the lateness of the hour could keep away that weary procession of sad staringeyed women who seemed to come from every shadow and vanish heaven knows where macheson gripped his companion by the arm  holderness he cried for gods sake lets get out of it i shall choke presently well take a side street  but holderness held his arm in a grip of iron  no he said these are the things which you must feel i want you to feel them i mean you to  its heartbreaking dick  holderness smiled faintly  i know how you feel he declared ive gone through it myself you are a christian arent youalmost an orthodox christian  i am not sure  dont waste your pity then holderness declared god will look after these its the women with the pearl necklaces and the scorn in their eyes whore looking for hell your friend in the electric brougham for instance cant you see her close her eyes and draw away her skirts if she should brush up against one of these  its hard to blame her macheson declared  holderness looked down at him pityingly  man he said youre a long way down in the valley youll have to climb vice and virtue are little else save relative terms they number their adherents by accident rather than choice  you mean that it is all a matter of temptation  holderness laughed they had passed into the land of silent streets their own rooms were close at hand  wait a little time he said some day youll understand     chapter xviii  lettys dilemma   you are quite sure the girl said anxiously that miss thorpehatton wants to see me you see theres a train at ten oclock i could catch  the housekeeper looked up from the menu she was writing and tapped the table impatiently with her pencil  my dear child she said is it likely i should keep you here without orders we have sent a telegram to your mother and you are to wait until the mistress is ready to see you  what time does she generally get down letty asked  any time mrs brown answered resuming her task she was back early last night only stayed an hour at the ball so she may send for you at any moment dont fidget about so theres a good girl im nervous this morning weve twentyfour people dining and i havent an idea in my head im afraid i shall have to send for fran√ßois  is fran√ßois the mancook who comes down to thorpe letty asked  mrs brown nodded  the chef you should call him she answered a very clever man no doubt in his way but takes a lot of keeping in order  do you have to look after all the servants letty asked doesnt miss thorpehatton ever order anything  mrs brown looked pityingly at her guest  my dear child she said i doubt if she could tell you to three or four how many servants there are in the house and as to ordering anything i dont suppose such a thoughts ever entered into her head heres james coming perhaps its a message for you  a footman entered and greeted letty kindly  good morning young lady he said you are to go into the morningroom at once  letty rose with alacrity  isis she there she asked nervously  she is the man answered and if i were you miss i wouldnt do much more than just answer her questions and skedaddle i havent had any conversation with her myself but mademoiselle says shes more than a bit off it this morning slept badly or something  dont frighten the child james mrs brown said reprovingly shes not likely to say much to you my dear you hurry along and come back and have a glass of wine and a biscuit before you go show her the way james  if you please miss the man answered becoming once more an automaton  letty was ushered into a small room full it seemed to her as she entered of sunshine and flowers wilhelmina in a plain whiteserge gown with a string of beads around her neck of some strangecoloured shade of blue was sitting in a highbacked easychair a small wood fire was burning in the grate filling the room with a pleasant aromatic odour and the window leading into the square was thrown wide open  on a table by her side were a pile of letters an ivory letteropener several newspapers and a silver box of cigarettes for the moment however none of these things claimed her attention the lady of the house was leaning back in her chair and her eyes were half closed if she had not been sitting with her back to the light letty might have noticed the dark rings under her eyes it was true that she had not slept well  letty advanced doubtfully into the room wilhelmina turned her head  oh it is you she remarked come up to the table where i can see you  mrs brown told me that you wished to see me before i went the girl said hesitatingly  wilhelmina was silent for a moment she was looking at the girl yes she was pretty in a rustic uncultured way her figure was unformed her hands and feet what might have been expected and it was obvious that she lacked taste were men really attracted by this sort of thing  yes wilhelmina said i wish to speak to you i am not altogether satisfied about last night  letty said nothing she went red and then white wilhelminas examination of her was merciless  i wish to know wilhelmina said who your companion waswith whom you had dinner and supper i look upon that person as being responsible for your lost train  letty prayed that she might sink into the ground her worst imaginings had not been so bad as this she remained silent tonguetied  im waiting wilhelmina said mercilessly i suppose it is obvious enough but i wish to hear from your own lips  ihei dont think that he would like me to tell you maam she faltered  wilhelmina smiledunpleasantly  probably not she answered that however is beside the question i wish to know  the girl was desperate it was indeed a quandary with her to offend the mistress of thorpe was something like sacrilege but she knew very well what stephen would have had her do  if you please maam she said at last i cant  wilhelmina said nothing for a moment only her eyebrows were slowly lifted  if you do not she said calmly i must write to your mother and tell her what i think of your behaviour last night i do not care to have people near me who are disobedient orfoolish  the girl burst into tears wilhelmina watched her with cold patience  i presume she said that it was mr macheson you do not need to mention his name you need only say yes  the girl said nothing  mr macheson lodged with your mother i believe wilhelmina continued  yes the girl whispered  and you waited upon him  yes  the girl lifted her head  mr macheson always behaved like a gentleman to me she said  wilhelmina regarded her contemptuously  your ideas of what constitutes gentlemanly behaviour are probably primitive she said i do not think that i need trouble you for any direct answer still it would be better for you to give it  the girl was again silent there was a knock at the door the footman ushered in stephen hurd  he entered confident and smiling he was wearing a new grey tweed suit and he was pleased with himself and the summons which had brought him to london but the sight of the girl took his breath away she too was utterly taken by surprise and forgot herself  stephen she exclaimed taking a quick step towards him  you you here he answered  it was quite enough but what puzzled letty was that wilhelmina did not seem in the least angry there was a strange look on her face as she looked from one to the other something had sprung into her eyes which seemed to transform her her voice too had lost all its hardness  how do you do mr hurd she said i hope you have come to explain how you dared let this child lose her train last night  ireally iit was quite a mistake he faltered darting an angry glance at letty  you had supper with her wilhelmina said and you knew what time the train went  she met some other friends stephen answered she left me  wilhelmina smiled she had found out all that she wanted to know  well she said i wont inquire too closely into it this time only i hope that nothing of the sort will occur again you had better have lunch with mrs brown in the housekeepers room letty and ill send you over to st pancras for the four oclock train ill give you a letter to your mother this time but mind no more foolishness of this sort  the girl tried to stammer out her thanks but she was almost incoherent wilhelmina dismissed her with a smile her manner was distinctly colder when she turned to hurd  mr hurd she said i hope you will understand me when i say that i do not care to have my agent or any one connected with the estate play the don juan amongst my tenants daughters  he flushed up to the eyes  it was idiotic of me he admitted frankly i simply meant to give the child a good time  she is quite pretty in her way wilhelmina said and her parents i believe are most respectable people you were perhaps thinking of settling down  he looked at her in amazement  what with letty foulton he exclaimed  why not she asked  he drew a breath through his teeth he could scarcely trust himself to speak for anger  youare not serious he permitted himself to ask  why not she demanded  hurd struggled to express himself with dignity  i should not consider such a marriage a suitable one even if i were thinking of marrying at all he said  she raised her eyebrows  no well i suppose you know best she said carelessly is there anything fresh down at thorpe  she was angry about that fool of a girl he told himself a good sign but what an actress his conceit barely kept him up  there really isnt anything i couldnt arrange with mr fields he admitted i thought perhaps as i was up you might have some special instructions that is why i sent to ask if you would see me  he looked at her almost eagerly after all she was the same woman who had been kind to him at thorpe and yet was she a sudden thought startled him she was changed had she guessed that he knew her secret  no she said deliberately i do not think that there is anything if you could find out mr machesons address i should be much obliged  hurd was puzzled this was the second time what could she have to say to macheson  he was here last night but i forgot to ask him she continued equably  macheson here he exclaimed  it was he who brought the girl letty she said  he was silent for a moment  hes a queer lot he said came to thorpe of all places as a sort of missioner and he was about town last night most immaculately got up nothing of the parson about him i can assure you  no she answered quietly well if you can discover his address remember i should be glad to hear it  he took up his hat reluctantly he had hoped at least that he might have been asked to luncheon it was obvious however that he was expected to depart and he did so on the whole although he had escaped from an exceedingly awkward situation he could scarcely consider his visit a success on his way out he passed deyes stepping out of a cab piled up with luggage he nodded to hurd in a friendly manner  miss thorpehatton in he asked  just left her hurd answered  deyes passed on and was received by the butler as a favoured guest he was shown at once into the morningroom     chapter xix  a report from paris   for the first time in my life deyes declared accepting the cigarette and the easychair i have appreciated paris i have gone there as a tourist i have drunk strange drinks at the caf√© de la paix i have sat upon the boulevards and ogled the obvious lady  and my little guide she asked  has disappeared he answered  since when  a month ago it is reported that he came to england  wilhelmina sat still for several moments to a casual observer she might have seemed unmoved deyes however was watching her closely and he understood  i am sorry he said to have so little to tell you but that is the beginning and the end of it the man had gone away  that is precisely what i desired to ascertain she said it seemed to me possible that the man had come to england i wished to know for certain whether it was true or not  i think deyes said withdrawing his cigarette and looking at it thoughtfully that it is true  you have any further reason for thinking so she asked beyond your casual inquiries  well yes he admitted i went a little farther than those casual inquiries it seemed such a meagre report to bring you  go on  the ordinary person he continued smoothly would never believe the extreme difficulty with which one collects any particulars as to the home life of a guide more than once i felt inclined to give up the task in despair it seemed to me that a guide could have no home that he must sleep in odd moments on a bench at the h√¥tel de luxe i tried to fancy a guide in the bosom of his family carving a sunday joint and surrounded by mrs guide and the little guides i couldnt do it it seemed to me somehow grotesque just as i was giving it up in despair the commissionaire at a night caf√© in montmartre told me exactly what i wanted to know he showed me the house where johnny as they called him had a room  you went there she asked  i did he answered  it was locked up  on the contrary he declared mrs or miss guide was at home and very pleased to see me  there was a woman there  assuredly whether she is there now or not i cannot say for it is three days ago and to me she seemed nearer than that to death  and about this woman what was she like was she his wife or his daughter  he called her his daughter i am not sure about the relationship she had been goodlooking i should say but she was very ill  what did she tell youabout the man johnson  that he had gone to england to try to get some money they were almost destitute he was a good guide she said but people came so often to paris and they liked some one fresh then she coughedhow she coughed  did she tell you to what part of england the man johnson had gone  i asked her but she was not sure i do not believe that she knew she said that there was some one in england who was very rich and from whom he hoped to be able to get money  anything else  no i spoke of myself as an old client of johnnys and i left money afterwards at the caf√© where i lunched i found a commissionaire who told me more about our friend  ah what was the name of the caf√©  the caf√© de paris  she took up a screen and held it before her face there seemed to be little need of it however for her cheeks were as pale as the white roses by her side  this man johnny as they call him deyes continued seems to have had his ups and downs one big stroke of luck he had however which seems to have kept him going for several years the commissionaire was able to tell me something about it shall i go on he asked dropping his voice a little  i should like to know what the commissionaire told you she answered  somehow or other this fellow johnny or johnson as some of them called him was recommended to a young lady a very young lady who was in paris with an invalid chaperon  stop she cried  he looked at her fixedly  you were that young lady he said softly of course i know that  i was she admitted dont speak to me for a few moments it was years agobut  she bent the screen which she held in her hand until the handle snapped  you seem she said to have rather exceeded your instructions i simply wanted to know whether the man was in paris or not  he bowed  the man is in england he said dont you think it might be helpful if you gave me more of your confidence and told me why you wanted to hear about him  she shook her head  i would sooner tell you than any one gilbert she said but i do not want to talk about it  it must be as you will of course he answered but i hope you will always remember that you could do me no greater kindnessat any timethan to make use of my services i do not know everything of what happened in parisabout that time i do not wish to know i am content to serve youblindly  i will not forget that she said softly if ever the necessity comes i will remind you there let that be the end of it  she changed the subject giving him to understand that she did not wish to discuss it further  you are for marienbad as usual she asked  next week he answered one goes from habit i suppose no waters upon the earth or under it will ever cure me  liver she asked  heart he declared  you shouldnt smoke so many cigarettes  harmless he assured her i dont inhale  i think she said that i shall come over next month  do he begged ill answer for the bridge may i come and lunch tomorrow  she turned to a red morocco book by her side  a bishop and lady sarah she said several more parsons and i think the duchess  ill face em he declared  i think i shall send for peggy wilhelmina said she is always so sweet to the church  deyes grinned  i shall go round and look her up he declared perhaps shell come and have lunch with me somewhere  she held out her hand  youre a good sort to have gone over for me she said the things you tumbled up against youd better forget  until you remind me of them he said very well ill do that sorry i didnt run johnny to earth  he went off and wilhelmina after a few minutes went to her desk and wrote a letter to stephen hurd      as usual she wrote when you were here this morning i forgot     to mention several matters upon which i meant to speak to you     the first is with regard to the man whose brutal assault upon     your father caused his death i understand that the police have     never traced him have never even found the slightest clue to     his whereabouts the more i think of this the more strange it     seems to me and i am inclined to believe that he never after     all escaped from the wood in which he first took shelter i     know that the slate quarry was dragged at the time but i have     been told that this was hastily done and that there are several     very deep holes into which the mans body may have drifted i     wish you therefore to send over to nottingham to get some     experienced men to bring back the drags and make an exhaustive     search please have this done without delay      further i wish to communicate with the young man macheson who     was in thorpe at the time they may know his address at the     postoffice but if you are unable to procure it in any other     way you must advertise in your own name please carry out my     instructions in these two matters immediately  wilhelmina laid down her pen and looked thoughtfully through the window into the square a policeman was coming slowly along the pavement she watched him approach and pass the house his eyes still fixed in front of him his whole appearance stolid and matteroffact to the last degree she watched him disappear with fascinated eyes after all he represented great things behind him was a whole national code the machinery of which he was so small a part drove the wheels of life or death she turned away from the window with a shrug of the shoulders humming a tune she threw herself back in her chair and began the leisurely perusal of her letters     chapter xx  like a trapped animal   macheson in those days felt himself rapidly growing older an immeasurable gap seemed to lie between him and the eager young apostle who had plunged so lightheartedly into the stress of life all that wonderful enthusiasm that undaunted courage with which he had faced coldness and ridicule in the earlier days of his selfchosen vocation seemed to have left him some way somehow he seemed to have suffered shipwreck there was poison in his system fight against it as he mightand he did fightthere were moments when memory turned the life which he had taken up so solemnly into the maddest most fantastic fairy story at such times his blood ran riot the sweetness of a strange unknown world seemed to be calling to him across the forbidden borders inaction wearied him horriblyand after all it was inaction which holderness had recommended as the best means of reestablishing himself in a saner and more normal attitude towards life  look round a bit old chap he advised and think dont do anything in a hurry youre young shockingly young for any effective work you cant teach before you understand life isnt such a sink of iniquity as you young prigs at oxford professed to find it see the best of it and the worst youll be able to put your finger on the weak spots quick enough  but the process of looking around wearied macheson excessivelyor was it something else which had crept into his blood to his immense unsettlement there were several philanthropic schemes started by himself and his college friends in full swing now in or about london to each of them he paid some attention studying its workings listening to the enthusiastic outpourings of his quondam friends and doing his best to catch at least some spark of their interest but it was all very unsatisfactory deep down in his heart he felt the insistent craving for some fiercer excitement some mode of life which should make larger and deeper demands upon his emotional temperament a heroic war would have appealed to him instantlyfor that he realized with a sigh he was born many centuries too late for weeks he wandered about london in a highly unsatisfied condition then one afternoon in the waning of a misty october day he came face to face with wilhelmina in bond street  she was stepping into her motor brougham when she saw him he had no opportunity for escape even if he had desired it her tired lips were suddenly curved into a most bewildering smile she withdrew her hand from her muff and offered it to himfor the first time  so you are still in london mr macheson she said i am very glad to see you  the words were unlike her the tone was such as he had never heard her use do what he could he could not help the answering light which sprang into his own eyes  i am still in london he said i thought you were to go to marienbad  i left it until it was too late she answered walk a little way with me she added abruptly i should like to talk to you  if i may he answered simply  she dismissed the brougham and they moved on  i am sorry she began that i was rude to you when you brought that girl to me you did exactly what was nice and kind and i was hateful please forgive me  of course he answered simply i felt sure that when you thought it over you would understand  you are not going backto thorpe she asked  not at present at any rate he answered  she looked up at him with a faint smile  you can have the barn she said  his eyes answered her smile but his tone was grave  i have given that upfor a little time at any rate he said i mean that particular sort of work  my villagers must content themselves with mr vardon then she remarked  he nodded  perhaps he said ours was a mistaken enterprise i am not sure but at any rate so far as thorpe is concerned i have abandoned it for the present  she was walking close to his side so close that the hand which raised her skirt as they crossed the street touched his and her soft breath as she leaned over and spoke fell upon his cheek  why  he felt the insidious meaning of her whispered monosyllable he felt her eyes striving to make him look at her his cheeks were flushed but he looked steadily ahead  there were several reasons he said  do tell me she begged i am curious  for one he said steadily i did an unjust thing at thorpe i sheltered a criminal and helped him to escape  so it was you who did that she remarked you mean of course the man who killed mr hurd  yes he answered i showed him where to hide he either got clean away or he is lying at the bottom of the slate quarry in either case i am responsible for him  well she said he is not at the bottom of the slate quarry i can at least assure you of that i have had the place dragged and every foot of it gone over by experienced men from nottingham  really he said surprised well i am glad of it  she sighed  i want you if you can she said to describe the man to me it is not altogether curiosity i have a reason for wishing to know what he was like  he was in such a state of panic macheson said doubtfully that i am afraid i have only an imperfect impression of him he was not very tall he had a round face cheeks that were generally i should think rather highcoloured brown eyes and dark hair almost black he wore a thick gold ring on the finger of one hand and although he spoke good english i got the idea somehow that he was either a foreigner or had lived abroad he was in a terrible state of fear and from what i could gather i should say that he struck old mr hurd in a scuffle and not with any deliberate intention of hurting him  she nodded  i have heard all that i want to she declared  they walked on in silence for several minutes then she turned to him with a shrug of the shoulders  the subject she declared is dismissed i did not ask you to walk with me to discuss such unpleasant things i should like to know about yourself  he sighed  about myself he answered there is nothing to tell there isnt in the whole of london a more unsatisfactory person  she laughed softly  such delightful humility she murmured especially amongst the young is too touching nevertheless go on it amuses me to hear  the note of imperiousness in her tone was pleasantly reminiscent it was the first reminder he had received of the great lady of thorpe  well he said what do you want to know  everything she answered i am possessed by a most unholy curiosity your relatives for instance and where you were born  he shook his head  i have no relatives he answered i was born in australia i am an orphan twentyeight years old and feel fortyeight no profession no settled purpose in life i am japhet in search of a career  she glanced at his shabby clothes he had been to a missionhouse in the east end  you are poor she asked softly  i have enough more than enough he answered to live on  her eyes lingered upon his clothes but he offered no explanation enough to live on she reflected might mean anything  you say that you have no profession she remarked i suppose you would call it a vocation but why did you want to come and preach to my villagers at thorpe why didnt you go into the church if you cared for that sort of thing  there was a certain amount of dogma in the way he answered i should make but a poor churchman they would probably call me a freethinker besides i wanted my independence  she nodded  i am beginning to understand a little better she said now you must tell me this why did you entertain the idea of mission work in a place like thorpe when the whole of that awful east end was there waiting for you  all the world of reformers he answered rushes to the east end we fancied there was as important work to be done in less obvious places  and you started your work she asked directly you left college  before i think he answered you see i wasnt alone there were several of us who felt the same wayholderness for instance the man who came to your house with me the other night he works altogether upon the political side hes a socialistof a sort two of the others went into the church one became a medical missionary i joined in with a few who thought that we might do more effective work without tying ourselves down to anything or subscribing to any religious denomination  she looked at him curiously he was tall broadshouldered and muscular he wore even his shabby clothes with an air of distinction  i suppose she said calmly that i must belong to a very different world but what i cannot understand is why you should choose a career which you intend to pursue apparently for the benefit of other people all the young men whom i have known who have taken life seriously enough to embrace a career at all have at least studied their individual tastes  well he answered smiling it isnt that i fancy myself any better than my fellows i was at magdalen you know under heysey i think that it was his influence which shaped our ideas  yes i have heard of him she said thoughtfully he was a good man at least every one says so im afraid i dont know much about good men myself most of those whom i have met have been the other sort  the faint bitterness of her tone troubled him there was deliberation too in her words instinctively he knew that this was no idle speech  you have asked me he reminded her a good many questions i wonder if i might be permitted to ask you one  why not i can reserve the privilege of not answering it she remarked  people call you a fortunate woman he said you are very rich you have a splendid home the choice of your own friends a certain reputationforgive me if i quote from a society paperas a brilliant and popular woman of the world yours is rather a unique position isnt it i wonder he added whether you are satisfied with what you get out of life  i get all that there is to be got she answered a slight hardness creeping into her tone it maynt be much but it amuses mesometimes  he shook his head  there is more to be got out of life he said than a little amusement  she shrugged her shoulders  how about yourself you havent exactly the appearance of a perfectly contented being  im hideously dissatisfied he admitted promptly something seems to have gone wrong with mei seem to have become a lookeron at life i want to take a hand and i cant there doesnt seem to be any place for me of course its only a phase he continued i shall settle down into something presently but its rather beastly while it lasts  she looked at him her eyes soft with laughter somehow his confession seemed to have delighted her  im glad you are human enough to have phases she declared i was beginning to be afraid that you might turn out to be just an ordinary superior person perhaps you are also human enough to drink tea and eat muffins try wont you  they were in front of her door which flew immediately open she either took his consent for granted or chose not to risk his refusal for she went on ahead and his faint protests were unheard his hat and stick passed into the care of an elderly person in plain black clothes with scarcely an effort at resistance he found himself following her down the hall she stopped before a small wroughtiron gate which a footman at once threw open  it makes one feel as though one were in a hotel doesnt it she remarked but i hate stairs besides i am going to take you a long long way up i am not at home this afternoon groves  very good madam the man answered  they stepped out into a smaller hall a darkfeatured young woman came hurrying forward to meet them  i shall not need you annette wilhelmina said go down and see that they send up tea for two and telephone to lady margaretsay im sorry that i cannot call for her this afternoon  parfaitement madame the girl murmured and hurried away wilhelmina opened the door of a sittingroomthe most wonderful apartment macheson had ever seen a sudden nervousness seized him he felt his knees shaking his heart began to thump his brain to swim all at once he realized where he was it was not the lady of thorpe this it was the woman who had come to him with the storm the woman who had set burning the flame which had driven him into a new world he looked around half wildly he felt suddenly like a trapped animal it was no place for him this bower of roses and cushions and all the voluptuous appurtenances of a chamber subtly and irresistibly feminine he was bereft of words awkward embarrassed he longed passionately to escape  wilhelmina closed the door and raised her veil she laid her two hands upon his shoulders and looked up at him with a faint but very tender smile her forehead was slightly wrinkled her fingers seemed to cling to him so that her very touch was like a caress his heart began to beat madly the perfume of her clothes her hair the violets at her bosom were like a new and delicious form of intoxication the touch of her fingers became more insistent she was drawing his face down to hers  i wonder she murmured whether you remember     book ii  chapter i  rather a ghastly part   mademoiselle rosine raised her glass her big black eyes flashed unutterable things across the pink roses  i think she said that we drink the good health of our host meester macheson meester victor is it not  bravo declared a pallidlooking youth her neighbour at the round supper table by jove if we were at the c√¥te dor instead of the warwick wed give him musical honours  i drink macheson declared to all of us who know how to live jules another magnum and look sharp  certainly sir the man answered  there flashed a quick look of intelligence between the waiter and a ma√Ætre dh√¥tel who was lingering near the latter hesitated for a moment and then nodded it was a noisy party and none too reputable but a magnum of champagne was an order they were likely to make more noise still if they didnt get it so the wine was brought and more toasts were drunk mademoiselle rosines eyes flashed softer things than ever across the table but she had the disadvantage of distance ella merriam the latest american importation held the place of honour next macheson and she was now endeavouring to possess herself of his hand under the table  i say macheson how is it none of us ever ran up against you before young davenant demanded leaning back in his chair never set eyes on you myself from the day you left magdalen till i ran up against you at the alhambra the other evening awfully studious chap macheson was at college he added to the american girl thought us chaps no end of rotters because we used to go the pace a bit thats so isnt it macheson  macheson nodded  it is only the young who are really wise he declared coolly as we grow older we make fools of ourselves inevitably either fools or beasts according to our proclivities then we begin to enjoy ourselves  the girl by his side laughed  i guess you dont mean that she said it sounds smart but its real horrid how old are you mr macheson  older than i look and younger than i feel he answered gazing into his empty glass  have you found what you call your proclivities she asked  i am searching for them macheson answered the trouble is one doesnt know whether to dig or to climb  why should one search at all the other man asked drawing out a gold cigarette case from his trousers pocket and carefully selecting a cigarette life comes easiest to those who go blindfold ive got a brother private secretary to a member of parliament hes got views about things and he makes an awful fag of life whats the good of it hell be an old man before hes made up his mind which way he wants to go this sort of things good enough for me  the magnum had arrived and macheson lifted a foaming glass  davenant he declared you are a philosopher we will drink to life as it comes to lifeas it comes  they none of them noticed the little break in his voice a party of newcomers claimed their attention macheson too had seen them he had seen her like a ghost at the feast he sat quite motionless his glass half raised in the air the colour gone from his cheeks his eyes set in a hard fast stare wilhelmina in a plain black velvet gown with a rope of pearls about her neck her dark hair simply arranged about her pallid distinguished face was passing down the room followed closely by the earl of westerdean deyes and lady peggy her first impulse had been to stop a light sprang into her eyes and a delicate spot of colour burned in her cheeks then her eyes fell upon his companions she realized his surroundings the colour went the momentary hesitation was gone she passed on without recognition lady peggy after a curious glance did the same she whispered and laughed in deyes ear as they seated themselves at an adjacent table he looked round behind her back and nodded but macheson did not appear to see him  a momentary constraint fell upon the little party the american young lady leaned over to ask davenant who the newcomers were  the elder man he said is the earl of westerdean and the pretty fair woman lady margaret penshore the other woman is a miss thorpehatton macheson probably knows more about them than i do  macheson ignored the remark he whispered something in his neighbours ear which made her laugh heartily the temporary check to their merriment passed away macheson was soon laughing and talking as much as any of them  supper he declared would be the most delightful meal of the day in any other country except england in a quarter of an hour the lights will be out  but it is barbarous mademoiselle rosine declared ah monsieur macheson you should come to paris there it is that one may enjoy oneself  i will come macheson answered whenever you will take me  she clapped her hands  agreed she cried i have finished rehearsing i have a weeks vacance we will go to paris tomorrow all four of us  im on davenant declared promptly i was going anyway in a week or two  mademoiselle rosine clapped her hands again  bravo she cried and you mademoiselle  the girl hesitated she glanced at macheson  we will both come macheson declared miss merriam will do me the honour to go as my guest  well stay at the vivandi√©re davenant said ive a pal there who knows the ropes right up to date what about the twotwenty tomorrow we shall get there in time to change and have supper at noyeaus  and afterwardsau rat mort mademoiselle rosine cried we will drink a glass of champagne with cher monsieur fran√ßois  davenant raised his glass  one more toast then before the bally lights go out he exclaimed to parisand our trip  some one touched macheson on the arm he turned sharply round deyes was standing there tall and immaculately attired there was something a little ghostly in the pallor of his worn beardless face with its many wrinkles and tired eyes  forgive me for interrupting you my dear fellow he said we are having our coffee outside just on the left there miss thorpehatton wants you to stop for a moment on your way out  macheson hesitated perceptibly a dull flush of colour stained his cheek fading away almost immediately he set his teeth hard  i shall be very happy he said to stop for a second  deyes bowed and turned away the room now was almost in darkness and the people were streaming out into the foyer macheson paid the bill and followed in the wake of the others seeing him approach alone wilhelmina welcomed him with a smile and drew her skirts on one side to make room for him to sit down he glanced doubtfully around she raised her eyebrows  your friends she said are in no hurry they can spare you for a moment  there was nothing in her tone to indicate any surprise at finding him there or in such company she made a few casual remarks in her somewhat languid fashion and recalled him to the recollection of lady peggy who was to all appearance flirting desperately with lord westerdean deyes had strolled across to a neighbouring group and was talking to a wellknown actor wilhelmina leaned towards him  has it ever occurred to you she asked quietly that you left me a little abruptly the other afternoon  his eyes blazed into hers he found it hard to emulate the quiet restraint of her tone and manner it was a trick which he had never cultivated never inherited this playing with the passions in kid gloves this muzzling and harnessing of the emotions  you know why he said  she inclined her head ever so slightly to where his late companions were seated  and this she asked am i responsible for this too  he laughed shortly  it would never have occurred to me to suggest such a thing he declared i am amusing myself a little why not  are you she asked calmly  her eyes drew his he almost fancied that the quiver at the corners of her lips was of mirth  somehow she continued i am not sure of that i watched you now and then in there it seemed to me that you were playing a partrather a ghastly part theres nothing so wearisome you know as pretending to enjoy yourself  i had a headache tonight he said frowning  she bent towards him  is it better now she whispered smiling  he threw out his hands with a quick fierce gesture it was well that the great room was wrapped in the mysterious obscurity of semidarkness and that every one was occupied with the business of farewells he sprang to his feet  i am going he said thickly my friends are expecting me  she shook her head  those are not your friends she said you know very well that they never could be you can go and wish them good night you are going to see me home  no he declared  if you please she begged softly  he crossed the room unsteadily and made his excuses with the best grace he could mademoiselle rosine made a wry face miss ella laid her fingers upon his arm and looked anxiously up at him  say you wont disappoint us tomorrow she said its all fixed up about paris isnt it twotwenty from charing cross  yes he answered i will let you know if anything turns up  they all stood around him davenant laid his hand upon his shoulder  look here old chap he said no backing out weve promised the girls and we mustnt disappoint them  monsieur macheson would not be so cruel mademoiselle rosine pleaded he has promised and englishmen never break their workd is it not so a party of four yes that is very well but alone with herbert here i could not go if you do not come all is spoilt is it not so my friends  rather davenant declared  the other girls fingers tightened upon his arm  dont go away now she whispered come round to my flat and well all talk it over i will sing you my new song im crazy about it  macheson detached himself as well as he could  i must leave you now he declared i can assure you that i mean to come tomorrow  he hurried after wilhelmina who was saying good night to her friends a few minutes later they were being whirled westwards in her brougham     chapter ii  playing with fire   and now she said throwing herself into an easychair and taking up a fan we can talk  he refused the chair which she had motioned him to wheel up to the fire he stood glowering down upon her pale stern yet not wholly master of himself against the sombre black of her dress her neck and bosom shone like alabaster she played with her pearls and looked up at him with that faint maddening curl of the lips which he so loved and so hated  so you wont sit down i wonder why a man always feels that he can bully a woman so much better standing up  there is no question of bullying you he answered shortly you are responsible for my coming here what is it that you want with me  suppose she murmured looking up at him that i were to sayanother kiss  suppose on the other hand he answered roughly you were to tell me the truth  she sighed gently  you jump so rapidly at conclusions she declared are you sure that it would not be the truth  if it were he began fiercely  if it were she interrupted well  i would rather kiss mademoiselle rosine or whatever her name is he said i would sooner go out into the street and kiss the first woman i met  she shook her head  what an impossible person you are she murmured of course i dont believe you  he shrugged his shoulders and glanced at the clock  are you going to keep me here long he asked roughly i am going to paris tomorrow and i have to pack my clothes  to paris with mademoiselle rosine  yes  she laughed softly  oh i think not she declared that sort of thing wouldnt amuse you a bit  we shall see he muttered  i am sure that you will not go she repeated  why not he demanded  becausei beg you not to  you he exclaimed you do you think that i am another of those creatures of straw and putty to dance to your whims to be whistled to your heel to be fed with stray kisses and an occasional kind word i think not if i am to go to the devil i will go my own way  you inconsistent creature she said why not mine  ill take my soul with me such as it is he answered ill not make away with it while my feet are on the earth  do you know that you are really a very extraordinary person she said  what i am you are responsible for he answered i was all right when you first knew me i may have been ignorant perhaps but at any rate i was sincere i had a conscience and an ideal oh i suppose you found me very amusinga missioner who thought it worth while to give a part of his life to help his fellows climb a few steps higher up what devil was it that sent you stealing down the lane that night from your house i wonder  she nodded slowly  im sorry you can speak of it like that she said to me it was the most delightful piece of sentiment almost like a poem  a poem it was the devils own poetry you breathed into me what a poor mad fool i became you saw how easily i gave my work up how i sulked up to london fighting with it all the time with this madnessthis  dear me she said what an adam you are my dear victor isnt ityou are very very young there is no need for you to manufacture a huge tragedy out of a womans kiss  what else is it but a tragedy he demanded the kiss that is a lieor worse you brought me here you let me hold you in my arms you filled my brain with mad thoughts you drove everything good and worth having out of life you filled it with what yourself and thenyou pat me on the cheek and tell me to come and be kissed some other day when you feel in the humour a wet afternoon perhaps or when you are feeling bored and want to hunt up a few new emotions it may be the way with you and your kind i call it hellish  well she said tell me exactly what it is that you want  to be laughed atas you did before he answered fiercely never mind it was the truth you have lain in my arms you came willingly your lips have been mine you belong to me  to be quite explicit she murmured you think i ought to marry you  yes he declared firmly a kiss is a promise you seem to want to live as a poseuse to make playthings of your emotions and mine i wanted to build up my life firmly to make it a stable and a useful thing you came and wrecked it and you wont even help me to rebuild  let us understand one another thoroughly she said your complaint is then that i will not marry you  the word the surprising amazing word left her lips again so calmly that macheson was staggered a little confused by its marvellous significance he was thrown off his balance and she smiled as a wrestler who has tripped his adversary henceforth she expected to find him easier to deal with  you knowthat it is not thataltogether he faltered  what is it that you want then she asked calmly there are not many men in the world who have kissedeven my hand there are fewer stillwhom i have kissed i thought that i had been rather kind to you  kind he threw out his arms with a despairing gesture you call it kindness the drop of magic you pour into a mans veins the touch of your body the breath of your lips vouchsafed for a second the elixir of a new life what is it to you a caprice a little dabbling in the emotions a device to make a few minutes of the long days pass more smoothly perhaps its the way in your world this you cheat yourself of a wholehearted happiness by making physiological experiments frittering away the great chance out of sheer curiosityor something worse and we who dont understand the gamewe are the victims  really she said pleasantly you are very eloquent  and you he said are  her hand flashed out almost to his lips long shapely fingers ablaze with the dull fire of emeralds  stop she commanded you are not quite yourself this evening i am afraid that you will say something which you will regret now listen you have made a most eloquent attack upon me but you must admit that it is a perfect tangle of generalities wont you condescend to look me in the face leave off vague complaints and tell me precisely why you have placed me in the dock and yourself upon the bench in plain words mind no evasions i want the truth  you shall have it he answered grimly listen then i began at thorpe you were at once rude and kind to me i was a simple ass of course and you were a mistress in all the arts which go to a mans undoing it wasnt an equal fight i struggled a little but i thanked god that i had an excuse to give up my work i came to london but the poison was working every morning before you were up and every night after dark i walked round your squareand the days i saw you were the days that counted  dear me how interesting she interrupted softly and to think that i never knew  i never meant you to know he declared a fool i was from the first but never fool enough to misunderstand when i brought letty foulton to you i brought her against my will it was for the childs sake and you were angry and then i saw you againand you were kind  she smiled at him  im glad you admit that she said gently i thought that i was very kind indeed and you repaid mehow  kind he cried fiercely yes you were kind you were mine for the moment you lay in my arms you gave me your lips it was an impression it amused you to see any human being so much in earnest then the mood passed your dole of charity had been given i must sit apart and you must smooth your hair what did it all amount to an episode a trifling debauch in sentimentand for megod knows  to return once more she said patiently to your complaint is it that i will not marry you  i did not ask thatat first he answered it is a good deal i know  then do you want to come and kiss me every day she asked because i dont think that that would suit me either  i can believe it he said  i am inclined to think she said that you are a very grasping and unreasonable person i have permitted you privileges which more men than my modesty permits me to tell you of have begged for in vain you have accepted themi promised nothing beyond nor have you asked for it yet because i was obliged to talk reasonably to you you flung yourself out of my house and i am left to rescue you at the expense of my pride perhaps also of my reputation from associations which you ought to be ashamed of  to talk reasonably to me he repeated slowly do you remember what you said  she shrugged her shoulders  naturally and what i said was true enough  i was to be content with scraps to go away and forget you until chance or a whim of yours should bring us together again  did you want so much more she asked with a swift maddening glance at him  he fell on his knees before her couch  oh i love you he said forgive me if i am unreasonable or foolish i cant help it you came so unexpectedly so wonderfully and you see i lost my head as well as my heart i have so little to offer youand i want so much  her hands rested for a moment caressingly upon his shoulders a whole world of wonderful things was shining out of her eyes it was only her lips that were cruel  my dear boy she said you want what i may not give i am very very sorry i think there must have been some sorcery in the air that night the spell of the roses must have crept into my blood i am sorry for what i did i am very sorry that i did not leave you alone  he rose heavily to his feet his face was grey with suffering  i ought to have known he said i think that i did know  all the same she continued laying her hand upon his arm i think that you are a rank extremist  he shook his head  i dont understand he said  shall i teach you she whispered  he flung her hand away  no he said savagely  she sighed  i am afraid you had better go away she said  as he closed the door he fancied that he heard a sob but it might have been only fancy     chapter iii  monsieur samuse   tonight young davenant declared with something which was suspiciously like a yawn i really think that we must chuck it just a little earlier shall we say that we leave here at two and get back to the hotel  mademoiselle rosine pouted but said nothing the young lady from america tried to take machesons hand  yes she murmured do lets im dead tired  she whispered something in machesons ear which he affected not to hear he leaned back in his cushioned seat and laughed  what go home without seeing fran√ßois he exclaimed hes keeping the corner table for us and were all going to dance the maxixe with the little russian girl  we could telephone davenant suggested do you know that we havent been to bed before six one morning since we arrived in paris  well isnt that what we came for macheson exclaimed we can go to bed at halfpast twelve in london ma√Ætre dh√¥tel the wine my friends are getting sleepy whats become of the music tell our friend thereah monsieur henri  he beckoned to the leader of the orchestra who came up bowing with his violin under his arm  monsieur henri my friends are triste he explained they say there is no music here no life they speak of going home to bed look at mademoiselle here she yawns we did not come to paris to yawn something of the liveliest you understand perhaps mademoiselle there will dance  parfaitement monsieur  the man bowed himself away with a twentyfranc piece in the palm of his hand the orchestra began a gay twostep macheson starting up passed his arm round the waist of a little fairhaired parisienne just arriving she threw her gold satchel on to a table and they danced round the room davenant watched them with unwilling admiration  well machesons a fair knockout he declared im hanged if he can keep still for five minutes and when i knew him at oxford he was one of the most studious chaps in the college gad hes dancing with another girl nowlook hes drinking champagne out of her glass shouldnt stand it ella  ella was watching him her eyes were very bright and there was more colour than usual in her cheeks  its nothing to me what mr macheson does she said with a catch in her voice i dont understand him a bit i think hes mad  mademoiselle rosine leaned across and whispered in her ear ella shook her head  you seeit is any girl with him she said he dances with them pays their billssee he pays for annette there and away he goeslaughing you see it is so with them too he has finished with them now he comes back to us guess im not sure i want him  nevertheless she moved her skirts and made room for him by her side macheson came up out of breath and poured himself out a glass of wine  what a time they are serving supper he exclaimed  davenant groaned  my dear fellow he exclaimed remember our dinner at lesueurs you cant be hungry  but i am macheson declared what are we here for but to eat and drink and enjoy ourselves jove this is good champagne mademoiselle rosine  he raised his glass and bowed mademoiselle rosine laughed at him out of her big black eyes he was rather a fascinating figure this tall goodlooking young englishman who spoke french so perfectly and danced so well  i would make you come and sit by me monsieur macheson she declared but ella would be jealous  what about me davenant exclaimed  oh l√† l√† she answered pinching his arm  im sure i dont mind ella declared i guess were all free to talk to whom we please  macheson drew up a chair and sat opposite to them  i choose to look at you both he said banging the table with his knife gar√ßon we did not come here to eat your flowers or your immaculate tablecloth we ordered supper half an hour ago good it arrives  no one but macheson seemed to have much appetite he ate and he drank and he talked almost alone he ordered another bottle of wine and the tongues of the others became a little looser the music was going now all the time and many couples were dancing the fairhaired girl dancing with an older woman touched him on the shoulder as she passed and laughed into his face  there is no one she murmured who dances like monsieur  he sprang up from his seat and whirled her round the room she leaned against his arm and whispered in his ear ella watched her with darkening face  it is little flossie from the folies marigny mademoiselle rosine remarked you must have a care ella she has followed monsieur macheson everywhere with her eyes  he returned to his place and continued his supper  hang it all you people are dull tonight he exclaimed drink some more wine davenant and look after mademoiselle miss ella  he filled her glass and she leaned over the table  every one else seems to make love to you she whispered i guess ill have to begin if you call me miss ella again i shall box your ears  ella then what you will he exclaimed remember all of you that we are here to have a good time not to mope davenant if you dont sparkle up i shall come and sit between the girls myself  come along they both cried mademoiselle rosine held out her arms but macheson kept his seat  lets go up to the rat mort if were going ella exclaimed its dull here and im tired of seeing that yellowheaded girl make eyes at you  macheson laughed and drained his glass  au rat mort he cried good  they paid the bill and all trooped out the fairhaired girl caught at machesons hand as he passed  au rat mort she whispered  she threw a meaning glance at ella  monsieur is well guarded she said softly  malheureusement he answered smiling  davenant drew him on one side as the girls went for their cloaks  i say old chap he began arent you trying ella a bit high shes not a badtempered girl you know but im afraid therell be a row soon  macheson paused to light a cigarette  a row he answered i dont see why  youre a bit catholic in your attentions you know davenant remarked  why not macheson answered ella is nothing to me no more are the rest of them i amuse myselfthats all  davenant looked as he felt puzzled  well he said im not sure that ella sees it in that light  why shouldnt she macheson demanded  well hang it all you brought her over didnt you davenant reminded him  she came over as my guest macheson answered that is to say i pay for her whenever she chooses to come out with us and i pay or shall pay her hotel bill beyond that i imagine that we are both of us free to amuse ourselves as we please  i dont believe ella looks at it in that light davenant said hesitatingly you mean to say that there is nothinger  of course not macheson interrupted  hasnt she  oh shut up macheson exclaimed here they come  ella passed her arm through his mademoiselle rosine had told her while she stood on tiptoe and dabbed at her cheeks with a powderpuff that she was too cold the messieurs anglais were often so difficult they needed encouragement so very much encouragement then there were more confidences and madame rosine was very much astonished what sort of a man was this monsieur macheson yet so gallant so gay she promised herself that she would watch him  we will drive up together you and i ella whispered in his ear but macheson only laughed  ive hired a motor car for the night he said in you get im going to sit in front with the chauffeur and sing  you will do nothing of the sort ella declared almost sharply you will come inside with us  anywhere anyhow he answered to the little hell at the top of the hill jean and drive fast he directed jove its two oclock hurry up davenant we shall have no time there at all  there was barely room for four mademoiselle rosine perched herself daintily on davenants knee ella tried to draw macheson into her arms but he sank on to the floor and sat with his hands round his knees singing a french musichall song of the moment they shouted to him to leave off but he only sang the louder then in a block he sprang from the car seized the whole stock of a pavement flowerseller and paying her magnificently emptied them through the window of the car into the girls laps and turning round as suddenlydisappeared  hes madquite mad ella declared with a sigh i dont believe we shall see him again tonight  nevertheless he was on the pavement outside the rat mort awaiting them chaffing the commissionaire he threw open the door and welcomed them  they are turning people away here he declared heaps of fun going on all the artistes from the circus are here and a party of spaniards fran√ßois has kept our table come along  ella hung on to him as they climbed the narrow shabby staircase  say she pleaded in his ear dont you want to be a little nicer to me tonight  command me he answered i am in a most amenable temper  sit with me instead of wandering round so you dont want to talk to every pretty girl do you  he laughed  why not arent we all on the same quest it is the camaraderie of pleasure  they reached the bend of the stairs from above they could hear the music the rattle of plates the hum of voices she leaned towards him  kiss me please she whispered  he stooped down and raised her hand to his lips she drew it slowly away and looked at him curiously  your lips are cold she said  he laughed  the night is young he answered see there is fran√ßois  they passed on ella was a little more content it was the most promising thing he had said to her     chapter iv  at the dead rat   monsieur fran√ßois piloted the little party himself to the corner table which he had reserved for them he had taken a fancy to this tall young englishman whose french save for a trifle of accent was as perfect as his own who spent money with both hands who was gay as the gayest and yet who had the air of being little more than a lookeron at the merriment which he did so much to promote  we are full tonight monsieur he said there will be a great crowd yet you see your table waits mademoiselle bolero herself begged for it but i said alwaysno no no it is for monsieur and his friends  you are a prince macheson exclaimed as they filed into their places tonight we are going to prove to ourselves that we are indeed in paris sommelier the same winein magnums tonight my friend is sleepy we must wake him up ah mademoiselle he waved his hand to the little shortskirted danseuse you must take a glass of wine with us and afterwardsthe maxixe waiter a glass a chair for mademoiselle  mademoiselle came pirouetting up to them monsieur was very kind she would take a glass of champagne and afterwardsyes the maxixe if they desired it  they sat with their backs to the wall facing the little space along which the visitors to the caf√© came and went and where under difficulties one danced the leader of the orchestra came bowing and smiling towards them playing an american waltz and macheson with a laugh sprang up and guided mademoiselle through the throng of people and hurrying waiters  monsieur comes often to paris she asked as they whirled around  for the first time in my life macheson answered we are here on a quest we want to understand what pleasure means  mademoiselle sighed ever so slightly under the powder with which her pretty face was disfigured  one is gay here always she said somewhat doubtfully but it is the people who come seldom who enjoy themselves the most  macheson laughed as he led her back to their table  you are right he declared pleasure is a subtle thing it does not do to analyse  macheson filled her glass  sit down he said and tell us about the people it is early yet i suppose  she nodded  yes she answered there are many who come every night who have not yet arrived  ella leaned forward to ask a question and mademoiselle nodded yes that was bolero at the small table opposite she sat with three men one of whom was busy sketching on the back of the menu card bolero with her wonderful string of pearls smileless stolid with the boredom in her face of the woman who sees no more worlds to conquer monsieur with the ruffled hair and black eyes yes a russian certainly mademoiselle with a smile which belied her words was not sure of his name but fran√ßois spoke always of his highness the gentleman with the smoothshaven face who read a newspaper and supped alone mademoiselle looked around she hesitated after all monsieur and his friends were only casual visitors it was not for them to repeat it but the gentleman was a detectiveone of the most famous he had watched for some one for many nights in the end it would happen ah some one was asking for a cakewalk mademoiselle finished her wine hastily and sprang up she will return but certainly if monsieur pleases  the band struck up something american mademoiselle danced up and down the little space between the tables ella laid her hand upon machesons shoulder  why do you want to talk to every one she whispered i think you forget sometimes that you are not alone  macheson laughed impatiently  my dear young lady he said you too forget that we are on a quest we are here to understand what pleasure meanshow to win it we must talk to every one do everything everybody else does its no good looking on all the time  but you never talk to me at all she objected  rubbish he answered lightly you dont listen come i am getting hungry davenant we must order supper  davenant whose hair mademoiselle rosine had been ruffling whose tie was no longer immaculate and who was beginning to realize that he had drunk a good deal of wine leaned forward and regarded macheson with admiration  old man he declared youre great order what you like we will eat itsomehow wont we rosine  she laughed assent  for me she begged some caviare and afterwards an omelette  consomm√© and dry biscuitsand some fruit ella suggested  macheson gave the order and filled their glasses it was halfpast two and people were beginning to stream in unattached ladies strolled down the roomlooking for a friendor to make one their more fortunate sisters of the haute demimonde were beginning to arrive with their escorts from the restaurants and caf√©s greetings were shouted up and down the room suddenly ellas face clouded over again it was the girl in blue with whom macheson had danced at lesueurs who had just entered with a party of friends women in lace coats and wonderful opera cloaks the men all silkhattedthe shiniest silk hats in europewhite gloves supercilious and immaculate a burst of applause greeted her as with her blue skirts daringly lifted she danced down the room to the table which was hastily being prepared for them her piquant face was wreathed with smiles she shouted greetings everywhere and when she saw macheson she threw him kisses with both hands which he stood up and gallantly returned she was the centre of attraction until mademoiselle anna from the circus arrived and to reach her place leaped lightly over an intervening table with a wonderful display of red silk stocking and filmy lingerie the place became gayer and noisier every moment greetings were shouted from table to table the spirit of bohemianism seemed to flash about the place like quicksilver people who were complete strangers drank one anothers health across the room the hardworked waiters were rushing frantically about the popping of corks was almost incessant a blue haze of tobacco smoke hung about the room macheson leaning back in his place watched with eyes that missed little he saw the keenfaced little man whose identity mademoiselle had disclosed calmly fold up his paper light a cigarette and stroll across the room to a table nearly opposite a man was sitting there with a couple of womena big man with a flushed face and tumbled hair the waiter was opening a magnum of champagneeverything seemed to promise a cheerful time for the trio then a word was whispered in his ear the newcomer bowed apologetically to the ladies and accepted a glass of wine but a moment later the two men left the place togetherand neither returned  what are you staring at ella demanded curiously  macheson looked away from the door and smiled quietly  i was wondering he answered what it was likeoutside  would you like to go she whispered eagerly in his ear im ready the others could come on afterwards  what without supper he exclaimed my dear girl im starving besidesi didnt mean that altogether  its rather hard to know what you do mean she remarked with a sigh say i dont understand you a little bit  how should you he answered when im in the same fix myself  i wish you were like other boys she remarked youre so difficult  he looked at herwithout the maskfor a moment and she drew back wondering for his eyes were very weary and they spoke to her of things which she did not understand  dont try he said it wouldnt be any good  mademoiselle sank into her chair opposite to them breathless and hot she accepted a glass of wine and begged for a cigarette she whispered in machesons ear that the big man was a forger an affair of the year before last he was safe away from paris but the price of his liberty was more than he could pay the man there to the left with the lady in pink no not the vicomte the one beyond he was tried for murder a month ago there was a witness missingthe case fell through butmademoiselle shook her shoulders significantly the lady with fair hair and dark eyes macheson asked was she english but certainly mademoiselle assured him she was the divorced wife of an english nobleman tonight she is alone mademoiselle added but it is not often ah monsieur  mademoiselle shook her finger across the table machesons too curious glance had provoked a smile of invitation from the lady  i really think you might remember that i am here ella remarked it is very interesting to hear you talk french but i get tired of it  mademoiselle took the hint and flitted away supper arrived and created a diversion nevertheless macheson alone of the little party seemed to have absorbed successfully the spirit of the place he was almost recklessly gay he drank toasts right and left he was the centre from which the hilarity of the room seemed to radiate davenant was half muddled with wine and sleepy he sat with his arm about rosine who looked more often towards macheson ella who had refused to eat anything was looking flushed and angry she had tried to link her arm in her companions but he had gently disengaged it she kept whispering in his ear and sat with her eyes glued upon mademoiselle flossie whose glances and smiles were all for macheson and soon after the end came the band began a waltzlamoureuseit was apparently mademoiselle herself who had commanded it with the first bars she sprang to her feet and came floating down the room her arms stretched out towards macheson she leaned over the table her body swaying towards him her gesture of invitation piquant bewitching macheson springing at once to his feet rested his hand for a moment upon the table which hemmed him in and vaulted lightly into the room a chorus of laughter and bravoes greeted his feat  but he is un homme galant this englishman a frenchwoman cried out delighted every one was watching the couple but ella rose to her feet and called a waiter to move the table  i am going she said angrily i have had enough of this you people can come when you like  they tried to stop her but it was useless she swept down the room taking not the slightest notice of macheson and his companion a spot of angry colour burning in her cheeks davenant and mademoiselle rosine stood up preparing to follow her the former shouted to macheson who brought his partner up to their table and poured her out a glass of champagne  ellas gone davenant exclaimed youll catch it  macheson smiled  im sorry he said quietly are you off too  as soon as the johnny brings the bill davenant answered  ill settle up macheson declared take the automobile ill follow you in a few minutes  mademoiselle flossie called back to her own table hurried off with a parting squeeze of machesons hand he sat down alone for a moment at the other end of the room a darkey with a dolls hat upon his head was singing a coon song     chapter v  the awakening   alone for the first moment of the evening it seemed to macheson that a sudden wave of confounding thoughts surged into his brain at war from the first with all that was sensuous and brilliant in this new and swiftly developed phase of his personality he closed his eyes for a moment and when again he opened them it seemed indeed as though a miracle had taken place the whole atmosphere of the room was changed he looked around incredulous amazed the men especially were different such good fellows as they had seemed a few moments agofrom his altered point of view macheson regarded them now in scornful curiosity their ties were awry their hair was ruffled their faces were paled or flushed the laughter of women rang still through the place but the music had gone from their mirth it seemed to him that he saw suddenly through the smiles that wreathed their lips saw underneath the barren mockery of it all this hideous travesty of life in its gentler moods had but one endthe cold relentless path to oblivion louder and louder the laughter rang until macheson felt that he must close his ears the devil was using his whip indeed  mademoiselle la danseuse seeing him alone paused at his table on her way through the room  monsieur is triste she remarked because his friends have departed  macheson shook his head  i am off too in a few minutes he answered  a waiter with immovable face slipped a note into his hand under cover of presenting the bill macheson read it and glanced across the room mademoiselle flossie was watching him with uplifted eyebrows and expectant smile macheson shook his head slightly but unmistakably the young lady in blue shrugged her shoulders and pouted  mademoiselle la danseuse was watching him curiously  i wonder she said softly why monsieur comes here  in search of pleasure macheson answered grimly  she looked at him fixedly and macheson momentarily interested returned her gaze then he saw that underneath the false smile for a moment laid aside there was something human in her face  monsieur makes a brave show but he does not succeed she remarked  and you he asked why do you come here  it paysvery well she answered quietly and left him  macheson settled his bill and called for the vestiaire in the further corner of the room two women were quarrelling the languid senses of those who still lingered in the place were stirred the place was electrified instantly with a new excitement a fight perhapsevery one crowded around unnoticed macheson walked out  down the narrow stairs he groped his way with the music of the orchestra the fierce hysterical cries of the women the mock cheering of those who crowded round in his ears he passed out into the bluegrey dawn the stars were faint in the sky and away eastwards little fleecy red clouds were strewn over the housetops he stood on the pavement and drew in a long breath the morning breeze was like a draught of cold water it was as though he had come back to life again after an interlude spent in some other world overhead he could still hear the music of the valse amoureuse the swell of voices he shivered with the cold perhapsor the memory of the nightmare  the commissionaire hat in hand summoned a coup√© and macheson took his place in the small open carriage down the cobbled street they went the crazy vehicle swaying upon its worn rubber tyres past other night resorts with their blaze of lights and string of waiting cabs past women in light boots in strange costumes artificial in colour and shape painted boldeyed uncanny pilgrims in the city of pleasure past the great churches silent and stern in the cold morning light past wearyeyed scavengers into the heart of the city where a thin stream of early morning toilers went on their relentless way once more he entered the obscurity of his dimly lit hotel where sleepyeyed servants were sweeping and retired to his room into which he let himself at last with a sigh of relief he threw up the blinds and opened the windows to be alone within those four walls was a blessed thing  he threw off his coat and glanced at his watch it was halfpast five his eyes were hot but he had no desire for sleep he walked restlessly up and down for a few minutes and then threw himself into an easychair suddenly he looked up  some one was knocking softly at his door he walked slowly towards it and paused all his senses were still pulsating with a curious sense of excitement when he stood still he could almost hear his heart beat from outside came the soft rustling of a womans gownhe knew very well who it was that waited there he stood still and waited again there came the knocking to him almost like a symbolical thing in its stealthy muffled insistence he felt himself battling with a sudden wave of emotions struggling with a passionate unexpected desire to answer the summons he took a quick step forwards then sanity came and the moment seemed far awaya part of the nightmare left behind he waited until he heard the quiet reluctant footsteps pass away down the corridor then he muttered something to himself which sounded like a prayer he sank into a chair and passed his hand across his forehead the recollection of that moment was horrible to him he stared at the door with fascinated eyes what if he had opened it  he still had no desire for sleep but he began slowly to undress his clothes his tie everything he had been wearing seemed to him to reek of accumulated perfumes of the night and he flung them from him with feverish disgust there was a small bathroom opening from his sleeping chamber and with a desire for complete cleanliness which was not wholly physical he filled the bath and plunged in the touch of the cold water was inspiring and he stepped out again into a new world much of the horror of so short a time ago had gone but with his new self had come an everincreasing distaste for any resumption in any shape or form of his associations of the last few days he must get away he rummaged through his things and found a timetable in less than an hour he was dressed his clothes were packed and the bill was paid he wrote a short note to davenant and a shorter one to ella ignoring the events of the last night he spoke of a summons home he enclosed the receipted hotel bill and something with which he begged her to purchase a souvenir of her visit then he drank some coffee and with a somewhat stealthy air made his way to the lift and thence to the courtyard of the hotel already a small victoria was laden with his luggage the concierge the baggagemaster the porters were all tipped with a prodigality almost reckless shaven and with a sting of the cold water still upon his skin in homely flannel shirt and grey tweed travelling clothes he felt like a man restored to sanity and health as his cab lumbered over the long cobbled street on its way to the gare du nord it was only a matter of a few hours and yet how sweet and fresh the streets seemed in the early morning sunshine the shops were all open and the busy housewives were hard at work with their bargaining the toilers of the city thronged the pavements everywhere there was evidence of a real and rational life the city of those few hours ago was surely a city of nightmares the impassable river flowed between macheson leaned back in his carriage and his eyes were fixed upon the blue sunlit sky his lips moved a song of gratitude was in his heart he felt like the prisoner before whom the iron gates have been rolled back disclosing the smiling world     chapter vi  the echo of a crime   macheson by jove where on earth have you sprung from  holderness threw down his pen and held out both his hands macheson drew a long sigh of relief  from the pigsties dick whew its good to see you againto be here  holderness surveyed his friend critically  what have you been up to he asked look washed out as though youd had a fever or something ive been expecting to see you every day  ive been on a pleasure trip to paris macheson answered dont talk about it for gods sake  holderness roared with laughter  you poor idiot he exclaimed been on the razzledazzle i believe i wish id known id have come  its all very well to laugh macheson answered i feel like a man whos been living in a sewer  are you cured holderness asked abruptly  macheson hesitated as yet he had not dared to ask himself that question holderness watched the struggle in his face  im sorry i asked you that he said quietly look here i know what youve come to me for and i can give it you you can start at once if you like  work macheson asked eagerly you mean that  of course tons of it henwoods at his wits end in stepney hes started lecturing and the things taken on but he cant go on night after night we dont want anything secondrate either then i want help with the paper  ill help you with the paper as soon as you like macheson declared id like to go to stepney too but could we hit it henwood and i  of course holderness answered what are you thinking of man you havent become a strawsplitter have you  not i macheson answered but you have crystallized your ideas into a cult havent you i might find myself on the other side of the traces  rot holderness answered vigorously look here this is what we call ugliness and dirt we say that these things make for misery we say that it is every mans duty and every womans too to keep themselves clean and cleanliving for the sake of the community we take the christian code it is the most complete the most philosophic the most beautiful we preach it not from the christian standpoint but from the point of view of the man of common sense doctrinal religions are all very well in their way but the great bald fact remains that the truth has not been vouchsafed to us through any of them therefore we say live the life and wait from a scientific point of view we believe of course in a future state it may be that the truth awaits us there you can work to that cant you  of course macheson answered but dont you rather overlook the support which doctrine gives to the weak and superstitious  bah there are the strong to be considered holderness declared think how many men of average intelligence chuck the whole thing because they cant stomach doctrine besides these people all think if you want to confirm em or baptize em or anything of that sort that youve your own axe to grind jolly suspicious lot the eastenders i can tell you  ill go and see henwood macheson declared  holderness glanced at his watch  well have something to eat and go together he declared look here im really pushed or i wouldnt bother you can you do me a country walk in november for the paper i have two a month you can take the last number and see the sort of thing  ill try macheson promised you can give me a couple of days i suppose  a weekonly i want it off my mind you can get out somewhere and rub up your impressions well dine for half a crown in soho and you shall tell me about paris  macheson groaned  shut up about paris he begged the thought of its like a nightmare to mea nightmare full of puppet gnomes with human masks and the faces of devils underneath  the masks came off holderness asked  macheson shivered  they did he answered  do you good holderness declared coolly locking his desk ive been through it so long as the masks came off its all right what was it sent you there victor  a piece of madness macheson answered in a low tone supreme utter madness  cured  oh i hope so macheson answered if notwell i can fight  holderness stood still for a moment there was a queer look in his eyes  there was a woman once victor he said who nearly made mincemeat of my life she could have done it if she likedand she wasnt the sort who spares she diedthank god you see i know something about it  they walked out arm in arm and not a word passed between them till they reached the street then holderness called a hansom  i feel like steak he declared entrec√¥te with potatoes ma√Ætre dh√¥tel somehow i feel particularly like steak we will chuck soho and dine at the caf√© royal  they talked mostly of henwood and his work holderness spoke of it as successful but the man himself was weakly the strain of holding his difficult audience night after night had begun to tell on him machesons help would be invaluable there was a complete school of night classes running in connexion with the work and also a library you can guess where the money came from for those he added smiling on the womens side there was only the cookery and the care of the children all very imperfect but with the making of great things about it  they went into the caf√© proper for their coffee sitting at a marbletopped table and holderness called for dominoes but they had scarcely begun their game before macheson started from his seat and without a word of explanation strode towards the door he was just in time to stop the egress of the man whom he had seen slip from his seat and try to leave the place  look here he said touching him on the shoulder i want to talk to you  the man made no further attempt at escape he was very shabby and thin but macheson had recognized him at once it was the man who had come stealing down the lane from thorpe on that memorable nightthe man for whose escape from justice he was responsible  my friend wont interfere with us macheson said leading him back to their seats sit down here  the man sat down quietly holderness took up a paper  go ahead he said i shant listen  if i am to talk the man said i must have some absinthe my throat is dry i have things to say to you too  macheson called a waiter and ordered it  look here the man said i know all that you want to say to me i can save you time it was i who called upon old mr hurd it was out of kindness that i went he has a daughter whom i cannot find she is in danger and i went to warn him he struck me first he lost his temper he would not tell me where to find her he would not give me even the money i had spent on my journey i too lost my temper i returned the blow he fell downand i was frightened so i ran away  macheson nodded  well he said you seem to have struck an old man because he would not let you blackmail him and i like a fool helped you to escape  blackmail the man looked around him as though afraid of the word his cheeks were sunken but his brown eyes were still bright it wasnt that he said i brought information that was really valuable there is a young lady somewhere who is in danger of her life i came to warn him i believed what i had always been told that she was his daughter i found out that it was a lie it was a conspiracy against me he never had a daughter but i am going to find out who she is  what if i give you up to the police macheson asked  for the sake of the woman whom the old man hurd was shielding you had better not you had very much better not was the hoarse reply if you do it may cost a woman her life  why are you staying on in england macheson asked  to find that woman and i will find her he added with glittering eyes listen i have seen her riding in a carriage beautifully dressed with coachman and footman upon the box an aristocrat i always said that she was that it was a plot against usto call her that old mans daughter  all this has nothing to do with me macheson said quietly the only thing i have to consider is whether i ought or ought not to hand you over to the police  the man eyed him craftily he had little fear  if you did sir he said it would be an injustice i only touched the old man in selfdefence  macheson looked at him gravely  i hope that that is the truth he said you can go  the man stood up he did not immediately depart  what is it macheson asked  i was wondering sir he said in a confidential whisper whether you could not give me an idea as to who the lady was who called herself stephen hurds daughter in paris six years ago  macheson shook his head  i have no idea he answered curtly  the man shuffled away macheson lit a cigarette and watched him for a moment steadfastly through the large giltframed mirror  queer sort of johnny your friend holderness remarked  hes a bad lot im afraid macheson answered somehow or other i cant help wishing that i hadnt seen him  holderness laughed  man alive he said its a good thing youve come back to me or youd be a bundle of nerves in no time well get along now if youre ready you might find something to say to em tonight i know henwoods pretty well pumped dry  they left the place and took an omnibus citywards     chapter vii  a country walk   it was exactly such a day as he would have chosen for his purpose when macheson stepped out of the train at the wayside station and set his face towards thorpe a strong blustering wind blowing down from the hills had dried the road of all save a slight coating of mud a wind fresh from the forest so fresh and strong that he walked with his cap in his hand and his head thrown back glad to breathe it in his lungs and feel the sting of it on his cheeks it seemed to him that he had been away for months as he climbed the long hill towards the village the fields now were brown instead of green a pungent smell of freshly turned earth and burning wood was in his nostrils the hedges and trees were bare he caught a glimpse of the great house itself from an unexpected point everywhere he was receiving familiar impressions he came to the avenue up which he had passed on his first visit to the house continually he met carts bearing her name and villagers most of whom he noticed with some surprise looked at him doubtfully presently he arrived at the village itself and stopped before the long low white house where stephen hurd lived he paused for a moment hesitating whether to fulfil this part of his mission now or to wait until later in the day eventually with the idea of getting the thing over he opened the gate and rang the frontdoor bell  he was shown into the study and in a few minutes stephen hurd came in smoking a pipe his hands in his pockets when he saw who his visitor was he stopped short he did not offer his hand or ask macheson to sit down he looked at him with a heavy frown upon his face  you wished to see me he said  i did macheson answered perhaps my call is inopportune i have come from london practically for no other reason than to ask you a single question  hurd laughed shortly  you had better ask it then he said i thought that you might have other business in the neighbourhood preaching off eh  my question is simply this macheson said calmly have you or had you ever a sister  a dull red flush streamed into the young mans face he removed his pipe from his mouth and stared at macheson his silence for several moments seemed to arise from the fact that surprise had robbed him of the powers of speech  who put you up to asking that he demanded sharply  macheson raised his eyebrows slightly  my question is a simple one he said if you do not choose to answer it it is easy for me to procure the information from elsewhere the first villager i met would tell me i preferred to come to you  i have no sister hurd said slowly i never had now you must tell me why you have come here to ask me this  i am told macheson said that years ago a girl in paris represented herself as being your fathers daughter she is being inquired for in a somewhat mysterious way  and what business is it of yours hurd demanded curtly  noneapparently macheson answered i am obliged to you for your information i will not detain you any longer  but stephen hurd barred the way looking into his face macheson saw already the signs of a change there his eyes were a little wild and though it was early in the morning he smelt of spirits  no you dont he declared truculently youre not going till you tell me what you mean by that question  i am afraid macheson answered that i have nothing more to tell you  you will tell me who this mysterious person is hurd declared  macheson shook his head  no he said i think that you had better let me pass  not yet hurd answered look here youve been in communication with the man who came here and murdered my father you know where he is  scarcely that was it macheson answered there was a struggle but your fathers death was partly owing to other causes however i did not come here to discuss that with you i came to ask you a question which you have answered if you will permit me to pass i shall be obliged  hurd hesitated for a moment  look here he said with an assumption of good nature theres no reason why you and i should quarrel i want to know who put you up to asking me that question it isnt that i want to do him any harm ill guarantee his safety if you like so far as i am concerned only im anxious to meet him  macheson shook his head  i do not know where he is myself he answered in any case i could not give you any information  stephen hurd stood squarely in front of the door  youll have to he said doggedly thats all there is about it  macheson took a step forward  look here he said i shouldnt try that on if i were you i am stronger than you are and i have studied boxing i dont care about fighting but i am going to leave this roomat once  the devil you are hurd cried striking at him take that you canting hypocrite  macheson evaded the blow with ease exactly how it happened he never knew but hurd found himself a few seconds later on his backand alone in the room he sprang up and rushed after macheson who was already in the front garden his attack was so violent that macheson had no alternative he knocked him into the middle of his rose bushes and opened the gate to find himself face to face with the last person in the world whom he expected to see in thorpe it was wilhelmina herself who was a spectator of the scene  mr macheson she said gravely what is the meaning of this  macheson was taken too completely by surprise to frame an immediate answer stephen hurd rose slowly to his feet dabbing his mouth with his handkerchief  a little disagreement between us he said with an evil attempt at a smile we will settle it another time  you will settle it now the lady of the manor said with authority in her tone shake hands if you please at once i cannot have this sort of thing going on in the village  macheson held out his hand without hesitation  the quarrel was not of my seeking he said i bear you no illwill hurd will you shake hands  no stephen hurd answered fiercely  machesons hand fell to his side  i am sorry he said  you will reconsider that mr hurd wilhelmina said quietly  no he answered i am sorry miss thorpehatton to seem ungracious but there are reasons why i cannot accept his hand he knows them well enough we cannot possibly be friends dont let us be hypocrites  wilhelmina turned away coldly  very well she said mr macheson will you walk with me a little way i have something to say to you  with pleasure he answered im sorry hurd he added turning round  there was no answer together they walked up the village street already the shock of seeing her had passed away and he was fighting hard against the gladness which possessed him he had paid dearly enough already for his folly he was determined that there should be no return of it  which way were you going she asked  to the hills he answered i can leave you at the church entrance but before you go  i am not going she answered i should love a walk i will come with you to the hills  he looked at her doubtfully she appeared to him so different a person in her country clothesa dark brown tailormade suit with short skirt a brown tamoshanter and veil she was not much more than a child after all her mouth was a little sad and she was very pale and seemed tired  if you care to walk so far he said gravelyand with me  what am i expected to say to that she asked demurely  i think that you know what i mean he answered avoiding her eyes your villagers will certainly think it strange to see their mistress walking with the poor missioner who wasnt allowed to hold his services  i am afraid she answered that my people have learnt to expect the unexpected from me now tell me she continued what has brought you back to the scene of your persecutions i am hoping you are going to tell me that it is to apologize for the shockingly rude way you left me last time we met  i did not know that you were here he answered i came for two reasonsfirst to collect materials for a short article in a friends magazine and secondly to ask a question of stephen hurd  apparently she remarked your question annoyed him  he seemed annoyed before i asked it macheson remarked i seem to have offended him somehow or other  i should imagine she said drily that that is not altogether incomprehensible to you  so she knew or guessed who it was that had been letty foultons companion in london macheson was silent they walked on for some distance climbing all the time till wilhelmina paused breathless and leaned against a gate  i hope said she that you are collecting your impressions if so i am sure they must be in the air for you have not looked to the right or to the left  he smiled and stood by her side looking downwards the village lay almost at their feet and away beyond spread the mistwreathed country still and silent in the november afternoon the wind had fallen the birds were songless nothing remained of the busy chorus of summer sounds they stood on the edge of a plantationthe peculiar fragrance of freshly turned earth from the ploughed fields opposite and of the carpet of wet leaves beneath their feet had taken the place of all those sweeter perfumes which a short while ago had seemed to belong naturally to the place  to tell you the truth he said i have been thinking more about something which i have to say to you  is it something serious she asked  rather he admitted  her eyebrows were faintly contracted she looked up at him pathetically  it will keep for a little time she said let us finish our walk first i am down here alone and have been dull this exercise is what i wanted it is doing me good i will not have my afternoon spoilt see i have the key of the gate here we will go through the plantation and up to the back of the beacon  she led the way giving him no time to protest and he followed her vaguely uneasy through the plantation their feet fell noiselessly upon a carpet of wet leaves outside on the springy turf the rabbits scampered away in hundreds to their holes then they began to climb beneath them the country expanded and rolled away like a piece of patchwork dimly seen through a veil of mist wilhelmina turned towards him with a laugh there was more colour now in her cheeks she was breathless before they reached the summit and laid her hand upon his arm for support  confess she said you like me better here than in london dont you  you are more natural he answered you are more like what i would have you be  she sat down on a piece of grey rock they were at the summit now below was the great house with its magnificent avenues and park the tiny village and the quaint church beyond a spreading landscape of undulating meadows and welltilled land the same thought came to both of them  behold she murmured my possessions  he nodded  you should be very proud of your home he said quietly it is very beautiful  she turned towards him her face was as cold and destitute of emotion as the stone on which she sat  do you wonder she asked why i have never married  he shrugged his shoulders  a matter of temperament perhaps he said you are inclined to be independent arent you  there have been things in my lifea very secret chamber she said slowly i think that some day i shall tell you about it for i may need help  i shall be glad he said simply you know that  she rose and shook out her skirts  come she said it is too cold to sit down i am going to take you to onetree farm mrs foulton must give us some tea i have a reason too she added more slowly for taking you there     chapter viii  the missing letty   macheson knew directly they entered the farm that wilhelmina had brought him here for some purpose for mrs foulton straightened herself at the sight of him and forgot even her usual respectful courtesy to the lady of the manor  i have brought mr macheson to see you mrs foulton wilhelmina said we want you to give us some teaand there is a question which i think you ought to ask him  the woman was trembling she seemed for the moment to have no words  if you like wilhelmina continued calmly i will ask it for you did you know mr macheson that letty foulton has left home and has gone away without a word to her mother  i did not know it macheson answered gravely i am very sorry  youdidnt know it you dont know where she is the woman demanded fiercely  certainly not macheson answered how should i  the woman looked bewildered she turned towards wilhelmina as though for an explanation  mr macheson has himself to blame wilhelmina said if his action in bringing your daughter to me that night has been misunderstood at any rate he cannot refuse to tell you now what he refused to tell me you understand mr macheson she added turning towards him mrs foulton insists upon knowing with whom you found her daughter having supper that night in london  macheson hesitated only for a moment  your daughter was with mr stephen hurd mrs foulton he said  the woman threw her apron over her head and hastened away they heard her sobbing in the kitchen wilhelmina shrugged her shoulders  what a bore she remarked we shant get any tea people of this sort have no selfcontrol  macheson looked at her sternly  have the people here he asked been connecting me with this childs disappearance  i suppose so she answered carelessly rather a new line for you isnt itthe gay lothario its your own fault you shouldnt be so mysterious  you didnt believe it he said shortly  why not youve beenseeing life lately havent you  you didnt believe it he repeated keeping his eyes fixed upon her  she came over to him and laid her hands upon his shoulders her pale face was upturned to his it seemed open to him to transform her attitude into a caress  of course not dear she answered ifany one else did they will soon know the truth  all the same he muttered its horrible we must do something  she moved away from him wearily his thoughts were full of the tragedy of letty foultons disappearance he seemed scarcely to know that she had been almost in his arms he turned to her suddenly  i shall go back he said to speak once more with stephen hurd  she looked into his face and saw things there which terrified her he had moved already towards the door but she stood in his way  no she cried it is not your affair let me deal with him  he shook his head  it is no matter he said for a woman to interfere in  he will not listen to you she continued eagerly he will tell you that it is not your concern  it is the concern of every honest man he interrupted you must please let me go  she was holding his arm and she refused to withdraw her fingers then mrs foulton intervened  she had smoothed her hair and was carrying a teatray they both looked at her as though fascinated  i hope i have not kept you waiting madam she said quietly i had to send ruth up for the cream the boys at loughborough market and im a bit shorthanded  ioh im sorry you bothered about the tea mrs foulton wilhelmina said with an effort but how good it looks come mr macheson i dont know whether youve had any lunch but i havent im perfectly ravenous  ive some sandwiches in my pocket macheson answered moving slowly to the table but to tell you the truth id forgotten them  she drew off her gloves and seated herself before the teapot all the time her eyes were fixed upon macheson she was feverishly anxious to have him also seat himself and he could scarcely look away from the woman who with a face like a mask was calmly arranging the things from the tray upon the table when she left the room he drew a little breath  do they feelreally these people he asked or are they stoics  we feel through our nerves she answered and they havent many is that too much creamand pass the strawberry jam please  he ate and drank mechanically the charm of this simple meal alone with her was goneit seemed to him that there was tragedy in the arrangement of the table she talked to him lightly and he answeredwhat he scarcely knew suddenly he interposed a question  when did this girl letty leave home he asked  i am not sure she answered we will ask mrs foulton  mrs foulton came silently in  we want to know mrs foulton when letty went away wilhelmina asked  a week ago tomorrow madam mrs foulton answered is there anything else you will be wanting  nothing thank you wilhelmina answered and then seeing that the woman lingered she continued  are you wanting to get rid of us  the woman hesitated  it isnt that madam she said but im wanting to step out as soon as possible  the same idea occurred at once to both wilhelmina and macheson  you are going down to the village mrs foulton wilhelmina asked gravely  im going down to have a bit of talk with mr stephen hurd madam she answered grimly id be glad to clear away as soon as convenient  wilhelmina turned round in her chair and laid her hand upon the womans arm  mrs foulton she said mr macheson and i are going to see him at once leave it to us please  mrs foulton shook her head doubtfully  lettys my daughter madam thank you kindly she said i must go myself  wilhelmina shook her head  no she said firmly you can go and see him afterwards if you like mr macheson and i are going to see what we can do first believe me mrs foulton it will be better for letty  the woman was shaken and wilhelmina pushed home her advantage  we are going straight to the village now mrs foulton she said you will only have to be patient for a very short time come mr macheson if you are ready we will start  they walked briskly along the country lane through the early twilight they said little to one another  macheson was profoundly moved by the tragedy of lettys disappearance with his marvellous gift of sympathy he had understood very well the suffering of the woman whom they had just left he shivered when he thought of the child with every step they took his face resolved itself into grimmer lines wilhelmina was forced at last to protest  after all she said touching his arm this young man will scarcely run away please remember that i am not an athletic personand i have not much breath left  he slackened his pace at once  i am sorry he said i was forgetting  yes she answered simply you were forgetting inoticed it  to macheson her irritation seemed childishunworthy he knew so little of womenor their moods  what are you going to say to stephen hurd he asked abruptly  i shall make him marry letty foulton she answered  can you do it he demanded  he must marry her or go she declared i will make that quite clear  macheson drew a little breath he suddenly realized that for all his impetuosity the woman who walked so calmly by his side held the cards he slackened his pace the lane had narrowed now and on either side of them was a tall holly hedge her hand stole through his arm  well she said softly you have not told me yet whether your pilgrimage to paris was a success  he turned upon her almost fiercely  yes he answered it was a complete success i havent an atom of sentiment left thank goodness  she laughed softly  i dont believe it she whispered in his ear you went abroad to be cured of an incurable disease do you imagine that the mademoiselle rosines of the world count for anything you foolish foolish person do you imagine that if i had not known youi should have let you go  i am not one of your tenants he answered grimly  you might be she laughed  you are very kind he declared but i need not tell you that nothing in this world would induce me to become one  she walked on humming to herself he was hard to tame she told herself but the end was so sure yet all her experience of his sex had shown her nothing like this it was the first time she had played such a part was it only the novelty which she found attractive she stole an upward glance at him through the twilight taller and more powerful than ever he seemed in the gathering darknessso far as looks were concerned he was certainly desirable enough and yet the worldher world was full of handsome men it must be something else which he possessed some other less obvious gift perhaps that flavour of puritanism about his speech and deportment of which she was always conscious he resisted where other men not only succumbed but rushed to meet their fate it must be that or  she herself became suddenly serious she looked straight ahead down the darkening lane fate could surely not play her a trick so scurvy as this it could not be that she cared her hands were suddenly clenched a little cry broke from her lips her heart was beating like a girls the delicious thrill of youth seemed to be thawing her long frozen blood not again she prayed not again it was a catastrophe this grotesque impossible she thrust out her hands as though to guard herself from some impending danger macheson turned to look at her in surprise and her eyes were glowing like stars  is anything the matter he asked  she laughed unnaturally  a memory she answered a superstition if you like some one was walking over the grave of my forgotten days  she pointed to the front of the low white house now only a few yards away a dogcart stood there waiting with some luggage at the back stephen hurd himself dressed for travelling was standing in the doorway     chapter ix  foiled   we seem to be just in time mr hurd wilhelmina said do you mind coming back for a moment into your study mr macheson and i have something to say to you  he glanced at his watch he was wholly unable to conceal his annoyance at their appearance  i am afraid he said with strained civility that i can only spare a couple of minutes  you are going to town she asked as he reluctantly followed her  yes he answered mr white wished to see me early tomorrow morning about the new leases and i have to go before the committee about this loughborough water scheme  these are my affairs she said so if you should miss your train the responsibility will be mine  i can spare five minutes he answered but i cannot miss that train i have some private engagements and madam he continued struggling with his anger i beg that you will not forget that even if i am in your employ this is my house and i will not have that man in it  he pointed to macheson who was standing upon the threshold wilhelmina stood between the two  mr hurd she said please control yourself there is no reason why we should any of us quarrel mr macheson and i are here to speak to you of a matter in which he has become concerned i asked him to come here with me we have come to see you about letty  what about her he demanded with some attempt at bravado  we find that there is an impression in the village that mr macheson is responsible for her disappearance  hurd seized his opportunity without a seconds hesitation  how do you know that it isnt the truth he demanded he wouldnt be the first of these psalmsinging missioners who have turned out to be hypocrites  macheson never flinched wilhelmina only shrugged her shoulders  mr hurd she said we will not waste time mr macheson and i are both perfectly aware that you are responsible for lettys disappearance  itsits false he declared swallowing with an effort a more obnoxious word why i havent left the village since the day she went away  but you are goingtonight wilhelmina remarked  he flushed  im going away on business he answered i dont see why it should be taken for granted that im going to see her  nevertheless wilhelmina said quietly between us three there isnt the slightest doubt about it i tell you frankly that the details of your private life in an ordinary way do not interest me in the least but on the other hand i will not have you playing the don juan amongst the daughters of my tenants you have been very foolish and you will have to pay for it i do not wish to make you lose your train tonight but you must understand that if you ever return to thorpe you must bring back letty foulton as your wife  he stared at her incredulously  as mywife he exclaimed  precisely wilhelmina answered i will give her a wedding present of a thousand pounds and i will see that your own position here is made a permanent one  he had the appearance of a man beside himself with anger was this to be the end of his schemes and hopes he to marry the pretty uneducated daughter of a working farmera girl too who was his already for the asking he struggled with a torrent of ugly words  ii must refuse he said denying himself more vigorous terms with an effort  she looked at him steadily  better think it over mr hurd she said i am in earnest  he hesitated for a moment and then with a glance at the clock moved towards the door  very well he said i will think it over i will let you know immediately i return from london  she shook her head  you can take as long as you like to reflect she answered but it must be here in this room mr macheson and i will wait  he turned towards her  miss thorpehatton he said will you allow me to speak to you alone for two minutes  she shook her head  it is not necessary she answered mr macheson does not count you can say whatever you will before him  a smile that was half a sneer curved his lips he was like a rat in a corner and he knew that he must fight he must use the weapon which he had feared with a cowards fear  the matter on which i wish to speak to you he said looking straight at her is not directly connected with the affair which we have been discussing if you will give me two minutes i think i can make you understand  she met his challenge without flinching she was a shade paler perhaps the little glow which the walk through the enchanted twilight had brought into her cheeks had faded away but her gaze was as cool and contemptuous as before she showed no sign of any fearof any desire to conciliate  i think she said that i can understand without you can consider that we are alone whatever you may have to say to me i should prefer that mr macheson also heard  macheson looked from one to the other uneasily  shall i wait in the passage he asked i should be within call  certainly not she answered this person she continued indicating stephen with a scornful gesture is i believe about to make a bungling attempt to blackmail me i should much prefer that you were present  stephen hurd drew a sharp breath her words stung like whips  i dont knowabout blackmail he said still holding himself in i want nothing from you i only ask to be left alone stop this nonsense about letty foulton and let me catch my train thats all i want  wilhelmina shrugged her shoulders  you are a very wearisome person she declared did you ever know me to change my mind every word i have said to you i absolutely mean no more no less  one of the veins at his temple was protruding he was passionately angry  you think it wise he cried threateningly to make an enemy of me  she laughed derisively a laugh as soft as velvet but to him maddening  my dear young man she said carelessly i think i should prefer you in that capacity i should probably see less of you  he took a quick stride forward he thrust his face almost into hers she drew back with a gesture of disgust  you he cried striking the table with his clenched fist to pretend to care what becomes of any fool of a girl who chooses to take a lover is it because youre in love with this wouldbe saint here  he struck the table again he was absolutely beside himself with rage he seemed even to find a physical difficulty in speech wilhelmina raised her eyebrows  go on she said coolly i am curious to hear the rest  macheson suddenly intervened he stepped between the two  this has gone far enough he said sternly hurd you are losing your head you are saying things you will be sorry for afterwards and i cannot allow you to speak like this to a womanin my presence  let him go on wilhelmina said calmly i am beginning to find him interesting  hurd laughed fiercely  what he cried you want to hear of your apache lover the man you took from the gutters of paris into  macheson struck him full across the mouth but wilhelmina caught at his arm she had overestimated her courage or her strengthhe was only just in time to save her from falling  brute she muttered and the colour fled from her cheeks like breath from a lookingglass  macheson laid her on the couch and rang the bell suddenly he realized that they were alone from outside came the sound of wheels he sprang up listening wilhelmina too opened her eyes she waved him away feebly he smiled back his comprehension  the servants are coming he said i can hear them i promise you that if he catches the train i will  illustration go on she said coolly i am curious to hear the rest page 240  he vaulted through the window which he had already opened the sound of wheels had died away but he set his face at once towards the station running with long easy strides and gradually increasing his pace stephen hurd with his handkerchief to his mouth and with all his nerves tingling with a sense of fierce excitement looked behind him continually but saw nothing long before he reached the station he had abandoned all fear of pursuit yet during the last halfmile macheson was never more than a few yards from him and on st pancras platform he was almost the first person he encountered  macheson by god  he almost dropped the coat he was carrying he looked at macheson as one might look at a visitor from mars it was not possible that this could be the man from whom he had fled macheson smiled at him grimly  how didhow did you get here the young man faltered  by the same train as you macheson answered how else where are you going to meet letty  hurd answered with a curse  why the devil cant you mind your own business he demanded  this is my business macheson answered  then he turned abruptly round towards the hesitating figure of the girl who had suddenly paused in her swift approach  it is my business to take you home letty he said i have come to fetch you  letty looked appealingly towards stephen hurd what she saw in his face however only terrified her  look here he said thickly ive had almost enough of this you can go to the devilyou and miss thorpehatton too i wont allow any one to meddle in my private concerns come along letty  he would have led her away but macheson was not to be shaken off he kept his place by the girls side  letty he said are you married to him  not yet she answered hesitatingly but we are going to be  where are you going to now  she glanced towards stephen  i am going to take her away with me he declared sullenly as soon as i can get my luggage on this cab  letty macheson said a few hours ago miss thorpehatton offered stephen hurd a dowry for you of a thousand pounds if he would promise to bring you back as his wife he refused he has not the slightest intention of making you his wife i am sorry to have to speak so plainly but you see we havent much time for beating about the bush have we i want you to come with me to berkeley square mrs brown will look after you  she turned towards the young man piteously  stephen she said tell mr macheson that he is mistaken we are going to be married arent we  yes he answered at least i always meant to marry you what i shall do if every one starts bullying me im sure i dont know cut the whole lot of you i think and be off to the colonies  you dont mean that stephen she begged  he pointed to the cab laden now with his luggage  will you get in or wont you letty he asked  she shrank back  stephen she said i thought that you were going to bring mother up with you  he laughed hardly  your mother wasnt ready he said we can send for her later  dont you think stephen she pleaded that it would be nice for me to stay with mrs brown untiluntil we are married  if you go to mrs brown he said gruffly you can stay with her thats all i wont be fooled about any longer once and for all are you coming  she took a hesitating step forward but macheson led her firmly towards another hansom  no he answered she is not you know where she will be when you have the marriage license  stephen sprang into his cab with an oath even then letty would have followed him but macheson held her arm  you stay here letty he said firmly  she covered her face with her hands but she obeyed     chapter x  mysteries in mayfair   that night and for many nights afterwards macheson devoted himself to his work in the east end the fascination of the thing grew upon him he threw himself into his task with an energy which carried him often out of his own life and made forgetfulness an easy task night after night they came these tired whitefaced women with a sprinkling of sullen dejectedlooking men night after night he pleaded and reasoned with them striving with almost passionate earnestness to show them how to make the best of the poor thing they called life gradually his efforts began to tell upon himself he grew thinner there were shadows under his eyes a curious intangible depression seemed to settle upon him holderness one night sought him out and insisted upon dinner together  look here victor he said i have a bone to pick with you youd better listen dont sit there staring round the place as though you saw ghosts everywhere  macheson smiled mirthlessly  but that is just what i do see he answered the conscience of every man who knows must be haunted with them the ghosts of starving men and unsexed women what keeps their hands from our throats dick  common sense you idiot holderness answered cheerfully theres a refuse heap for every one of natures functions you may try to rake it out and cleanse it but there isnt much to be done hang that mission work victor its broken more hearts than anything else on earth a man can but do what he may  the refuse heap is mans work macheson muttered  but not wholly his responsibility holderness declared were part of the machine but remember the wheels are driven by fate or god or whatever the hidden motive force of the universe may be dont lose yourself macheson sentiments a good thing under control its a sickly master  you call it sentiment if one feels the horror of this garbage heap come tonight and look into their faces  ive done it holderness declared ive been through it all hang it all do you forget that im the editor of a socialist magazine no feel it you must but dont let it upset your mental balance dont lose your values  macheson left his friend in a saner frame of mind his words came back to him that night as he watched the little stream of people file out from the bare whitewashed building with its rows of cheap cane chairs it was so true to give way to despair was simply to indulge in a sentimental debauch yet in a sense he had never felt so completely the pitiful ineffectiveness of his task how could he preach the christian morality expound the christian doctrines to a people whose very sufferings whose constant agony was a hideous and glaring proof that by the greater part of the world those doctrines were ignored  a man was shown into his room afterwards as he was putting on his overcoat almost with relief macheson saw that he at least had no pitiful tale to tell he was a small dapper man well dressed and spoke with a slight american accent  mr macheson he said im taking the liberty of introducing myself peter drayton my name is never mind my profession it wouldnt interest you  macheson nodded  what can i do for you he asked with some curiosity  say ive been very much interested in these talks of yours to the people mr drayton remarked but its occurred to me that youre on the wrong end of the stick thats why im here youre saying the right things and youve got the knack of saying them so that people have just got to listen but youre saying them to the wrong crowd  i dont understand macheson was forced to confess  well i reckon its simple enough drayton answered these people here dont need to have their own misery thrust down their throats even while youre trying to show them how to bear it its the parties who are responsible for it all that you want to go for see what i mean  i think so macheson admitted but  look here drayton interrupted youre a man of common sense and you know that lifes more or less a standup fight those that are licked live here in whitechapelif you can call it livingand those who win get to belgravia its a pitiless sort of affair this fight but there it is now which of the two do you think need preaching to these people or the people who are responsible for them youve started a mission in whitechapelit would have been more logical if theres a word of truth in your religion to have started it in mayfair  macheson laughed  they wouldnt listen to me he declared  id see to that drayton answered quickly its my business i want you to give a course ofwell wed call them lectures in the west end you can say what you like you can pitch into em as hot as hell ill guarantee you a crowded audience every time  i have no interest in those people macheson said why should i go and lecture to them my sympathies are all down here  exactly drayton answered i want you to stir up the people who can really help people who can give millions pull down these miles of fevertainted rat holes endow farms here and abroad lash them till their conscience squeaks see whats the good of preaching to these people that wont do any good you want to preach to the really ignorant the really depraved the westenders  do i understand macheson asked that you have a definite scheme in which you are inviting me to take part  drayton lit a cigarette and led the way out  look here he said ill walk with you as far as youre going and tell you all about it  it was a sort of pilgrimage which macheson undertook during these restless nights a walk seemingly purposeless the sole luxury which he permitted himself always about the same hour he found himself on the garden side of berkeley square always he stood and looked for a period of time of which he took no count at the tall dimly lit house across whose portals he had once passed into fairyland then came a night when everything was changed lights flashed from the windows freshly painted windowboxes had been filled with flowers scarce enough now everything seemed to denote a sudden spirit of activity macheson stood and watched with a curious sense of excitement stirring in his blood he knew very well what was happening she was coming perhaps had already arrived in town he realized as he stood there a silent motionless figure how far gone in his folly he really was how closely woven were the bonds that held him for time seemed to him of no account beside the chance of seeing her if only for a moment as she passed in or out he never knew how long he waited thereit was long enough however for his patience to be rewarded smoothly with flashing lights a little electric brougham turned into the square and pulled up immediately opposite to him the tall footman sprang to the ground the door flew open he saw a slim familiar figure veiled and dressed in a dark travelling costume pass leisurely up the steps and into the arc of light which streamed through the open door the brougham glided away the door was closed she was gone still macheson leaned forward watching the spot where she had been his heart thumping against his sides his senses thrilled with the excitement of her coming suddenly his attention was diverted in a curious manner he became conscious that he was not the only watcher under the chestnut trees a man had stolen out from amongst the deeper shadows close up to the railings and was standing by his side macheson recognized him with a start  what are you doing here he asked abruptly  his fellowwatcher too showed signs of excitement his cheeks were flushed he pointed across the road with shaking finger and looked up into machesons face with a triumphant chuckle  run to earth at last he exclaimed you saw her you saw her too  i saw a lady enter that house macheson answered what of it  the man whom he had once befriended drew a breath between his clenched teeth  there she goes he muttered the woman who dared to call herself the daughter of a poor landagent the woman who is deceiving her world today as she deceived usonce bah it is finished  he started to cross the road macheson kept by his side  where are you off to he asked  the man pointed to the brilliantly lit house  there he answered fiercely i am going to see her tonight at once she shall not escape me this time  what do you want with her macheson asked  moneyor exposure such an exposure the man answered but she will pay she owes a good deal but she will pay  and supposing macheson said that i were to tell you that this lady is a friend of mine and that i will not have you intrude upon herwhat then  something venomous gleamed in the mans eyes a short unpleasant laugh escaped him  not all the devils in hell he declared would keep me from going to her for five years shes fooled us not a day longer not an hour  machesons hand rested lightly upon the mans shoulder  can you reach her from prison he asked calmly  the man turned and snarled at him he knew well enough that escape or resistance alike was hopeless he was like a pigmy in the hands of the man who held him  this isnt your affair he pleaded earnestly let me go or i shall do you a mischief some day remember it was you who helped me to escape you cant give me away now  i helped you to escape macheson said but i did not know what you had done there is another matter you have to go away from here quietly and swear never to molest  the man ducked with a sudden backward movement and tried to escape but macheson was on his guard  you are a fool the man hissed out his small beadlike eyes glittering as though touched with fire his thick red lips parted showing his ugly teeth it is money alone i want from her i have but to breathe her name and this address in a certain quarter of paris and there are others who would take her life let me go  then macheson was conscious of a familiar figure crossing the street in their direction he had seen him come furtively out of the house they had been watching and had recognized him at once it was stephen hurd keeping his grasp upon his captives shoulder macheson intercepted him  hurd he said i want to speak to you  hurd started and his face darkened with anger when he saw who it was that had accosted him macheson continued hurriedly  look here he said i owe you this at any rate i have just caught our friend here watching this house have you ever seen him before  hurd looked down into the face of the man who with an evil shrug of the shoulders had resigned himselffor the presentto the inevitable  never he answered cant say im particularly anxious to see him again convert of yours he asked with a sneer  he is the man who visited your father on the night of his death macheson said  stephen hurd was like a man electrified he seized hold of the others arm in excitement  is this true he demanded  the man blinked his eyes  you have to prove it he said i admit nothing  you can leave him to me stephen hurd said turning to macheson  macheson nodded and prepared to walk on  there is a policestation behind to the left he remarked  hurd took no notice he had thrust his arm tightly through the other mans  i have been looking for you he said eagerly we must have a talk together we will take this hansom he added hailing one  the man drew back  are you going to take me to the policestation he demanded  policestation no hurd answered roughly what good would that do me get in caf√© monico     chapter xi  the way of salvation   holderness leaned back in his worn leather chair and shouted with laughter he treated with absolute indifference the white anger in machesons face  victor he cried dont look at me as though you wanted to punch my head down on your knees man and pray for a sense of humour its the very salt of life  thats all very well macheson answered but i cant exactly see  thats because youre deficient holderness shouted wiping the tears from his eyes i havent laughed so much for ages here you come from the east to the west with all the worlds tragedy tearing at your heart flowing from your lips a flagellator a hater of the people to whom you speak seeking only to strike and to wound and they accept you as a new sensation they bare their back to your whip they have made you the fashion oh this funny funny world of ours  macheson smiled grimly  ill grant you the elements of humour in the situation he said but you can scarcely expect me to appreciate it can you i never came here to play the mountebank to provide a new sensation for these tired dolls of society dick do you think st paul could have opened their eyes  holderness shook his head  i dont know he declared theyre a difficult classyou see they have pluck and a sort of fantastic philosophy which goes with breeding theyre not easily scared  macheson thought of his friends words later in the afternoon when he stood on the slightly raised platform of the fashionable room where his lectures were given not a chair was empty macheson as he entered gazed long and steadily into those rows of tired distinguishedlooking faces and felt in the atmosphere the delicate wave of perfume shaken from their clothesthe indescribable effect of femininity there were men there too mostly as escorts correctly dressed bored vacuous from intent rather than lack of intelligence macheson himself carelessly dressed from design his fine figure illclad with untidy boots and shock hair felt his anger slowly rising as he marked the stir which his coming had caused he to be the showman of such a crowd it was maddening that day he spoke to them without even the ghost of a smile parting his lips he sought to create no sympathy he cracked his whip with the cool deliberation of a russian executioner   i was asked the other day he remarked by an enterprising journalist what made me decide to come here and deliver these lectures to you i did not tell him it is because i wanted to speak to the most ignorant class in christendom you are that class if you have intelligence you make it the servant of your whims if you have imagination you use it to enlarge the sphere of your vices you are worse than the ostrich who buries his head in the sandyou prefer to go underground altogether  as you sit herewith every tick of your jewelled watches out in the world of which in your sublime selfishness you know nothing a child dies a woman is given to sin a mans heart is broken what do you care what do you know of that infernal that everlasting tragedy of sin and suffering that seethes around you why should you care your life is attuned to the most pagan philosophy which all the ages of sin have evolved you have sunk so low that you are content to sit and listen to the story of your ignominy  what fascination was it that kept them in their places holderness who was sitting in the last row fully expected to see them leave their seats and stream out macheson himself would not have been surprised his voice had no particular charm his words were simple words of abuse he attempted no rhetorical flourishes nor any of the tricks of oratory he stood there like a disgusted schoolmaster lecturing a rebellious and backward school holderness when he saw that no one left chuckled to himself macheson aware that his powers of invective were spent suddenly changed his tone  consciously or unconsciously he told them every one was seeking to fashion his life according to some hidden philosophy some unrealized ideal with religion as it was commonly understood he had in that place at any rate nothing to do even the selfish drifting down the stream of idle pleasures which constituted life for most of them was the passive acceptance in their consciousness of the old fain√©ant philosophy of laissez faire had they any idea of the magnificent stimulus which work could give to the emptiest life for healths sake alone they were willing sometimes to step out of the rut of their easygoing existence to discipline their bodies at foreign wateringplaces to take up courses of physical exercises as prescribed by the fashionable crank of the moment what they would do for their bodies why should they not try for their souls the one was surely as near decay as the otherthe care of it if only they would realize it was ten thousand times more important he had called them perhaps many hard names there was one he could not call them he could not call them cowards on the contrary he thought them the bravest people he had ever known to live the lives they did and await the end with the equanimity they showed the equivalent of hell whatever it might be had evidently no terrors for them  he concluded his address abruptly as his custom was a few minutes later and turned at once to leave the platform but this afternoon an unexpected incident occurred a man from the middle of the audience rose up and called to him by name  macheson surprised paused and turned round it was deyes who stood there immaculately dressed in morning clothes his long face pale as ever his manner absolutely and entirely composed he was swinging his eyeglass by its narrow black ribbon and leaning a little forward  sir he said once more addressing macheson as one of the audience whose shortcomings have soerprofoundly impressed you may i take the liberty of asking you a question i ask it of you publicly because i imagine that there are many others here besides myself to whom your answer may prove interesting  macheson came slowly to the front of the platform  ask your question sir by all means he said  deyes bowed  you remind me if i may be permitted to say so he continued of the prophet who went about with sackcloth and ashes on his head crying woe woe woe but who was either unable or unwilling to suggest any means by which that doleful cry might be replaced by one of more cheerful import in plain words sir according to your lightswhat must we do to be saved  there was a murmur of interest amongst the audience there were many upon whom machesons stinging words and direct denunciation had left their mark they sat up eagerly and waited for his answer he came to the edge of the platform and looked thoughtfully into their faces  in this city he said it should not be necessary for any one to ask that question my answer may seem trite and hackneyed yet if you will accept it you may come to the truth take a hansom cab and drive as far say as whitechapel walkin any directionfor half a mile look into the faces of the men the women and the children then go home and think you will say at first nothing can be done for these people they have dropped down too low they have lost their humanity they only justify the natural law of the survival of the fittest think again a hemisphere may divide the east and the west of this great city but these are human beings as you are a human being they are your brothers and your sisters consider for a moment this natural law of yours it is based upon the principle of the seesaw those who are down are down because the others are up those men are beasts those women are unsexed those children are growing up with dirt upon their bodies and sin in their hearts because you others are what you are because consider that consider it well and take up your responsibility they die that you may flourish do you think that the seesaw will be always one way a revolution in this world or justice in the next which would you rather face  deyes bowed slightly  you have given me an answer sir for which i thank you he answered but you must allow me to remind you of the great stream of gold which flows all the while from the west to the east hospitals mission houses orphanages colonial farmsare we to have no credit for these  very little macheson answered for you give of your superfluity charity has little to do with the chequebook besides you must remember this i am not here today to plead the cause of the east i am here to talk to you of your own lives i represent if you are pleased to have it so the sandow of your spiritual body i ask you to submit your souls to my treatment as the professor of physical culture would ask for your bodies this is not a matter of religion at all it is a matter if you choose to call it so of philosophy your souls need exercise you need a course of thinking and working for the good of some one elsenot for your own benefit give up one sin in your life and replace it with a wholehearted effort to rescue one unfortunate person from sin and despair and you will gain what i understand to be the desire of all of youa new pleasure briefly for your own sakes from your own point of view it is a personal charity which i am advocating as distinguished from the charity of the chequebook  one more question mr macheson deyes continued quietly where do we find the lost soulsi mean upon what principle of selection do we work  there are many excellent institutions through which you can come into touch with them macheson answered you can hear of these through the clergyman of your own parish or the bishop of london  deyes thanked him and sat down the lecture was over and the people slowly dispersed macheson passed into the room at the back of the platform drayton who was waiting for him there pushed over a box of cigarettes he knew that macheson loved to smoke directly he had finished talking  macheson he said solemnly youre a marvel why in my country i guess theyd come and scratch your eyes out before theyd stand plain speaking like that  macheson was looking away into vacancy  i wonder he said softly if it does any goodany real good  drayton who was looking through a cashbook with gleaming eyes opened his lips to speak but thought better of it he pointed instead towards the table  the usual pile of notes was thereall the latest novelties in fancy stationery were represented there crested coroneted scented macheson began to tear them open and as rapidly destroy them with a little gesture of disgust they were mostly of the same type the girls were all so anxious to do a little good so tired of the wearisome round of society wouldnt mr macheson be very kind and give them some personal advice couldnt he meet them somewhere or might they come and see him they did hope that he wouldnt think them bold it would be such a help to talk to him the married ladies were bolder still they felt the same craving for advice but their proposals were more definite mr macheson must come and see them they would be quite alone underlined there should be no one else there to worry him then followed times and addresses one lady whose coronet and motto were familiar to him would take no denial he was to come that afternoon her carriage was waiting at the side door and would bring him directly to her macheson looked up quickly through the window he could see a small brougham with cockaded footman and coachman waiting outside he swept all the notes into the flames  for heavens sake go and send that carriage away drayton he begged  drayton laughed and disappeared on the table there remained one more notea square envelope less conspicuous perhaps than the others but more distinguishedlooking macheson broke the seal on half a sheet of paper were scrawled these few lines only       for heavens sake come to me at oncewilhelmina  he started and caught up his hat in a few minutes he was on his way to berkeley square     chapter xii  jean le roi   over a marbletopped table in a retired corner of the caf√© stephen hurd listened to the story of the man whom macheson had delivered over to him and the longer he listened the more interesting he found it when at last all was told the table itself was strewn with cigarette stumps and their glasses had three times been replenished the faces of both men were flushed  you see the little man said glancing for a moment at his yellowstained fingers and then beginning to puff furiously at a fresh cigarette the time is of the shortest jean le roiwell his time is up he may be here tomorrow the next day who can tell and when he comes he will kill her that is certain  hurd shuddered and drank some of his whisky  look here he said we mustnt have that revenge of course he will wantbut there are other ways  the little man blinked his eyes  you do not know jean le roi he said to him it is a pastime to kill for myself i do not know the passions as he would know them where there was money i would not kill it would be as you have saidthere are other ways but jean le roi is different  jean le roi as you call him must be tamed then hurd said you speak of money i have been her agent so i can tell you what do you think might be the income of this lady  johnson was deeply interested he leaned across the table his little black eyes were alight with cupidity  who can tell he murmured it might be two perhaps three four thousand english pounds a year eh  stephen hurd laughed scornfully  four thousand a year he repeated bah she fooled you all to some purpose her income islistenis forty thousand pounds a year you hear that my friend forty thousand pounds a year  the little mans face was a study in varying expressions he leaned back in his chair and then crouched forward over the table his beady eyes were almost protruding a spot of deeper colour an ugly purple patch burned upon his cheeks the words seemed frozen upon his lips twice he opened his mouth to speak and said nothing  stephen hurd took off his hat and placed it upon the table before him his listeners emotion was catching  forty thousand pounds he said softly livres you call it it is a great fortune she has deceived you too you must make her pay for it  johnson was recovering himself slowly his voice when he spoke shook but it was with the dawn of a vicious anger  yes he muttered speaking as though to himself she has deceived us she must pay god how she must pay  his fingers twitched upon the table he was blinking rapidly  there is the money he said softly and there is jean le roi  it was a night of shocks for him again his eyes were dilated he shrank back in his chair and clutched at hurds sleeve  it is himself he whispered hoarsely it is jean le roi god in heaven he will kill us  johnson collapsed for a moment in his face were all the evidences of an abject fear and stephen hurd was in very nearly as evil a plight the man who was threading his way through the tables towards them was alarming enough in his appearance and expression to have cowed braver men  jean le roihe fears nothinghe cares for nothing not even for me his father johnson muttered with chattering teeth if he feels like it he will kill us as we sit here  hurd who was facing the man watched him with fascinated eyes he was over six feet high and magnificently formed notwithstanding his ready made clothes fresh from a french tailor his brown hat ludicrously too small and the blue stubble of a recently cropped beard he was almost as impressively handsome as he was repulsive to look at he walked with the grace of a savage animal in his native woods there was something indeed not altogether human in the gleam of his white teeth and stealthy faultless movements he came straight to where they sat and his hand fell like a vice upon the shoulder of the shrinking elder man it was further characteristic of this strange being that when he spoke there was no anger in his tone his voice indeed was scarcely raised above a whisper  what are you doing here old man he asked why did you not meet me eh  i will tell you tell you everything jean johnson answered sit down here and drink with us everything shall be made quite clear to you i came for your saketo get money jean sit down my boy  jean le roi sat down  i sit with you he said and i will drink with you because i have no money to pay for myself but we are not friends yet old man i will hear first what you have done and who is this  his eyes flashed as he looked upon hurd johnson interposed quickly  a friend a good friend he exclaimed he will be of service to us great service only a few minutes ago he told me something astounding something for you also to hear dear jean it is wonderful news  jean le roi interrupted  what i want to hear from you he said in a soft vicious whisper is why when they let me out of that cursed place you were not there with money and clothes for me as i ordered but for the poor faithful annette whom i did not desire to see i might have starved on the day of my release stop he held up his hand as johnson was on the point of pouring out a copious explanation order me brandy first tell them to bring me the bottle do not speak till i have drunk  they called a waiter and gave the order they waited in an uneasy silence until it arrived jean le roi drank at first sparingly but his eyes rested lovingly upon the bottle  now speak he commanded  johnson told his story with appropriate gestures  after it was all over he began rapidly and one saw that a rescue was impossible i followed madame it was a moment of fury i thought she will repent she will pay for lawyers for his defence so i hung about her hotel only to find that she had left stolen away as you know she did not appear at the trial it was a bargain with the police that they should not call her if she betrayed you she escaped me jean and as you know i had no money all every penny had been spent on your clothes and your horse and carriage to make you a gentleman  jean le roi extended his hands money well spent indeed let the old man continue  she escaped me jean and it was many months before i found a clue on an old labeljust the words thorpe england so i wrote there and the letter did not come back as the others i waited a little time and i wrote again this time to receive an answer it was a stern angry letter from a man who called himself her father and signed himself stephen hurd he was what is called here an estate agent and he had not very much money he would not send one pound he said that the marriage was illegal and if one came to england he threatened the law i wrote againhumbly piteously i spoke of your hardships i told how all the time you raved of your dear wife how you repented your madnesshow it was for love of her only that you had committed such a crime there came no answer i forwarded the letters which you had written to heri begged oh how i begged for just a little money for the small luxuries the good wine the tobacco the newspapers they sent nothing  jean le roi drew in his breath with a gasp  oh he muttered so they sent nothing  not one sou jeannot one sou and all the while the time of your release was drawing near what could i do well i raised the money how i will not tell you my boy but i went on a fruit boat from havre to southampton and from there down to thorpe i saw the old man stephen hurd it was on a sunday night that i arrived and i found him alone he was as hard jean as his letters when i pressed him he ordered me out of the house i would not go i said that i would see my daughterinlaw i would remain until i saw her i said even if i slept under a hedge again he ordered me out of the house i was firm i refused then he struck me there was a quarrel and he fell i thought at first that he was unconscious but when i examined himhe was dead  johnson finished his speech in a stealthy whisper leaning half way across the table jean le roi poured himself out more brandy but he was unmoved  the old trick i suppose he remarked carelessly making a swift movement with his hand  no no johnson declared earnestly i used no weapon it was an accident a pure accident remember that this is his son he would not be here if it was not quite certain that it was accidentand accident alone  jean le roi lifted his head and gazed curiously at stephen hurd  so you he murmured are my brotherinlaw  johnson leaned once more across the table  it is where you where we all have been deceived he said impressively listen she was never the daughter of stephen hurd at all it was a schoolgirls freak to take that name when she was eluding her chaperon and amusing herself in paris stephen hurd was her servant  and she jean le roi asked softly  johnson spread out his yellowstained fingers his voice trembled his eyes shone it was like speaking of something holy  she is a great lady he said she goes to court she has houses and horses and carriages troops of servants a yacht motorcars she is richfabulously rich jean she haslistenforty thousand pounds livres mind a year  more than that hurd muttered  more than that johnson repeated  jean le roi was no longer unmoved he drew a long breath and his teeth seemed to come together with a click  there is no mistake he asked softly an income of forty thousand pounds  there is no mistake stephen hurd assured him i will answer for that  jean le rois face was white and vicious yet for a time he said nothing and his two companions watched him anxiously there was something uncanny about his silence  it is a great deal of money he said at last often in prison i was hungry i had no cigarettes i was forced to drink water a great deal of money and she is my wife half of what she has belongs to me that is the law eh  i dont know about that stephen hurd said but she has certainly treated you very badly  jean le roi struck the table with his fist not violently and yet somehow with a force which made itself felt  it is overthat he said i am a man who knows when he has been illtreated who knows too what it is that a wife owes to her husband tell me where it is that she lives old man write it down  johnson drew from his pocket a stump of pencil and the back of an envelope he wrote slowly and with care jean le roi extended the palm of his hand to stephen hurd  he will warn madame perhaps he suggested why does he sit here with us this young man is it that he too wants money  no no my son johnson intervened hastily madame treated him badly he would not be sorry to see her humiliated  jean le roi smiled  it shall be done he promised but from one of you i must have money i cannot present myself before my wife so altered no one would believe my story  how much do you want hurd asked uneasily  twenty pounds english jean le roi answered i cannot resume my appearance as a gentleman on less  hurd took out some notes  i will lend you that he said slowly  jean le rois long fingers took firm hold of the notes he buttoned them up in his pocket slapped the place where they were and poured out more brandy  now he said i am prepared madame shall discover what it means to deceive her fond husband  hurd moved in his seat uneasily there was something ominous in the villainous curve of the mans lipsin the utter absence of any direct threats what was it that was passing in his mind  you are not thinking of any violence he asked remember she is a proud woman and you cannot punish her more than by simply appearing and declaring yourself  jean le roi smiled  we shall see he declared     chapter xiii  the king of the apaches   wilhelmina was restingand looked in need of it all the delicate colours and fluttering ribbons of her doucet dressingjacket could not hide the pallor of her cheeks or the hollows under her eyes macheson who came in sternly enough felt himself moved to a troublous pity nothing seemed left of the great ladyor the poseuse  you are kind she murmured to come so soon sit down please  is there any trouble he asked you look worried  she laughed unnaturally  no wonder she answered for five years i have been living more or less on the brink of a volcano from what i have heard i fancy that an eruption is about due  tell me about it he asked  she passed him a telegram it was from paris and it was signed gilbert deyes  jean le roi was free yesterday left immediately for england  macheson looked up he did not understand  and who he asked is jean le roi  she looked him in the eyes  my husband she told him quietly at least that is what i suppose the law would say that he was  macheson had been prepared for something surprising but not for this he looked at her incredulously he found himself aimlessly repeating her words  your husband  i was married five years ago in paris she said in a dull emotionless tone no one over here knows about it or has seen him because he has been in prison all the time it was i who sent him there  i cant believe this he said in a low tone it is too amazing  then a light broke in upon him and he began to understand  he is in england now she said and i am afraid  jean le roi he muttered  king of the apaches she answered bitterly the greatest rogue in paris they said when they sentenced him  sentenced him he repeated bewildered  he has been in prison since the day we were married she continued it was i who sent him there  he bowed his head he felt that it was not right to look at her an infinite wave of tenderness swept through his whole being he was ashamed of his past thoughts of her of his hasty judgments all the time she had been carrying this in her bosom her very pride seemed to him now magnificent he felt suddenly like a querulous child  what can i do to help you he asked softly  she came a little nearer to him  i am afraid she said dropping her voice almost to a whisper ever since i heard the story of his life as it was told in court i have been afraid when he was taken he swore to be revenged for the last twentyfour hours i have felt somehow that he was near read this  she passed him a letter the notepaper was thick and expensive and headed by a small coronet       my dearest wife it began at last this miserable separation      comes to an end i am here in london on my way to you prepare      to throw yourself into my arms how much too long has our      happiness been deferred       i should have been with you before dear wilhelmina but for      more sordid considerations i need money i need money very      badly send me please a thousand pounds tomorrow between      three and fouror shall i come and fetch it and you       as you will                      your devoted husband                          jean  he gave her back the letter gravely  what was your answer he asked  i sent nothing she declared i did not reply but i am afraidhorribly afraid he is a terrible man if we were alone he would kill me as you or i would a fly if only they could have proved the things at the trial which were known to be true he would never have seen the daylight again but even the witnesses were terrified they dared not give evidence against him  will you tell me macheson asked how it all came about not unless you like he added after a moments hesitation not if it is painful to you  she sat down upon the couch curling herself up at the further end of it and building up the pillows at the further end to support her head against the soft green silk her face was like the face of a tired child something seemed to have gone out of her she was no longer playing a partnot even to himnot even to herself there was nothing left of the woman of the world it was the child who told him her story  you must listen she said and you may laugh at me if you like but you must not be angry my story is the story of a fool sit down pleaseat the end of the couch if you dont mind i like to have you between me and the door  he obeyed her in silence and she continued she spoke like a child repeating her lesson she held a crumpledup lace handkerchief in her hand and her eyes large and intent never left his  this is the story of a girl she said an orphan who went abroad with a chaperon to travel in europe and perfect her french in paris the chaperon fell ill the girl hired a guide recommended by the hotel to show her the sights  they saw all that the tourist sees and the chaperon was still ill the girl thought that she would like to see something of the parisians themselves she was tired of cooks english people and americans so she gave the guide money to buy himself clothes and bade him take her to the restaurants and places where the world of paris assembled it was known at the hotel perhaps through the servants that the girl was rich the guide heard it and told some one else between them they concocted a plot the girl was to be the victim she was only eighteen  one day they were lunching at the caf√© de paristhe guide and the girlwhen a young man entered he was exceedingly handsome and very wonderfully turned out after the fashion of the french dandy the guide as the young man passed rose up and bowed respectfully the young man nodded carelessly then he saw the girl and he looked at her as no man had ever looked before and the girl ought to have been angry but wasnt  she asked the guide who the young man was he told her that it was the duke of languerois head of one of the oldest families in france his father and grandfather and for a time he himself had been in their service the girl looked across at the young man with interest and the young man returned her gaze that was what he was there for  as they left the restaurant her guide fell behind for a moment and when she looked round she saw him talking to the young man of course she wanted to know what they had been saying and with much apparent reluctance the guide told her the young man had been inquiring about mademoiselle where they spent their time how he could meet them of course he had told nothing but the young man was very persistent and very much in earnest she encouraged the guide to talk about him and she believed what she was told he was rich noble adored in french society and he was in love with mademoiselle she was very soon given to understand this  for several days the young man was always in evidence he was perfectly respectful he never attempted to address her it was all most cunningly planned then one evening when she was driving with her guide through a narrow street a man sprang suddenly upon the step of her carriage and snatched at her jewels another on the other side had passed his arm round the guides neck and almost throttled him and a third was struggling with the coachman it was one of those lightninglike attacks by apaches which were common enough thenat least it seemed like one the girl screamed and of course the young man who had been following in another voiture appeared one of the thieves he threw on to the pavement the others fled and the young man was a hero it was well arranged  her voice broke for a moment and macheson moved uneasily upon the sofa if he could he would have stopped her he could guess as much of the miserable story as it was necessary for him to know but she ignored his threatened interruption she was determined having kept her secret for so long that he should know now the whole truth  after that things moved rapidly the girl was as near her own mistress as a child of her age could be she was lonely and the young man proved a delightful companion he had many attractive gifts and he knew how to make use of them all the time he made love to her for a time she resisted but she had very little chance she was just at the age when all girls are more or less fools in the end she consented to a secret marriage afterwards he was to take her to his family but that time never came  they were married at eleven oclock one morning and went afterwards to a caf√© for d√©je√ªner the young man that day was ill at ease and nervous he kept looking about him as though he was afraid of being followed he spoke vaguely of danger from the anger of his noble relations they were scarcely seated at luncheon before a man came quietly into the place and whispered a few words in his ear whatever those few words were the young man went suddenly pale and called for his hat and stick he wrote an address on a piece of paper and gave it to the girl he begged her to follow him in an hourhe would introduce her then to his friends and he left her alone the girl was troubled and uneasy he had gone off without even paying for the luncheon he had the air of a desperate man she began to realize what she had done  she was preparing to depart when an englishman who had been lunching at the other end of the room came over and with a word of apology sat down by her side he saw that she was young and a fellowcountryman and he told her very gravely that he was sure she could not be aware of the character of the man with whom she had been lunching her eyes grew wide open with horror the man he said was the illegitimate son of a french nobleman and his mother had been married to a guideher guide he had perhaps the worst character of any man in paris he had been tried for murder imprisoned for forgery and he was now suspected of being the leader of a band of desperate criminals who were dreaded all over paris this and other things he told her of the man whom she had just married the girl listened as though turned to stone with the piece of paper which he had given her crumpled up in her hands then the police came they asked her questions she pretended at first to know nothing at last she addressed the commissionary if she gave him the address where this young man could be found he and all his friends might she depart without mention being made of her or her name appearing in any way the commissionary agreed and she gave him the piece of paper the englishmanit was gilbert deyestook her back to her hotel and the police captured jean le roi and the whole band of his associates the girl returned to england that night jean le roi was sentenced to six years penal servitude his time was up last week  what a diabolical plot macheson exclaimed but the marriage it could have been annulled surely  perhaps she answered but i did not dare to face the publicity i felt that i should never be able to look any one in the face again i had given my name to the guide johnson as clara hurd i hoped that they might never find me  they cannot do you any harm macheson declared let me go with you to the lawyers they will see that you are not molested  she shook her head  it is not so easy she said the marriage was quite legal to have it annulled i should have to enter a suit the whole story would come out i could never live in england afterwards  but you dont mean he protested to remain bound to this blackguard all your life  how can i free myself she asked except by making myself the laughingstock of the country  why did you send for me he asked bluntly  to ask for your adviceand to protect me she added with a shiver it is not only money that jean le roi wants it is vengeance because i betrayed him  as for that i wont leave you except when you send me away he declared and my advice if you want that the right thing to me seems simple enough go at once to your lawyers they will tell you the proper course at the worst the man could be bought off for the present  she raised her head  i will not give him one penny she declared i have always sworn that  but im afraid if you wont try to divorce him that he can claim some macheson said  then he must come and take it by force she declared  there was silence between them then she rose to her feet and came and stood before him  i ought to have told you all this long ago she said simply today i felt that i must tell you without another hours delay now that you know i am not so terrified but you must promise to come and see me every day while that brute remains in london  yes i promise that he answered also rising to his feet  they heard her maid moving about in the bedroom  hortense is reminding me that i must dress for dinner she remarked with a faint smile one must dine you know even in the midst of tragedies  macheson prepared to take his departure  i shall come tomorrow he said if you do not send for me before     chapter xiv  behind the palm trees   lady peggy was fussing round the drawingroom talking to all her guests at once  i havent the least idea who takes anybody in she declared james said hed see to that so you might just as well put your hand in a luckybag and im not at all sure that youll get any dinner ive got a new chefdrives up in a high dogcart with such a sweet little groom he may be all right jules the ma√Ætre dh√¥tel at claridges got him for me and wilhelmina sooner than come out like a ghost id really take lessons in the use of the rougepot my new maids a perfect treasure at it no one can ever tell whether my colours natural or not i dont mind telling you people it generally isnt but anyhow it isnt daubed on like lady sydneysmakes her look for all the world like one of ces dames doesnt it im sure id be afraid to be seen speaking to her if i were a man gilbert she broke off addressing deyes who was just being ushered in how dare you come to dinner without being asked im sure i have not asked you dont say i did now you refused me eight times running and i crossed you off my list  deyes held out a card as he bowed over his hostesss fingers  my dear lady he said here is the proof that i am not an intruder i am down to take in our hostess of thorpe  you have bribed james she declared i hope it cost you a great deal of money i will not believe that i asked you however since you are here go and tell wilhelmina some of your stories i hate pale cheeks and wilhelmina blushes easily no use looking at the clock duke dinner will be at least half an hour late im sure these foreign chefs have no idea of punctuality whats that dinner served two minutes before time well were all here arent we i knew it would be either too early or too late duke you will have to take me in by the time we get there the soup will probably be cold youd better pray that were starting with caviare and oysters such a slow crowd arent theyand such chatterboxes i wish theyd move on a little faster and talk a little less no only thirty nice sociable number i call it for a round table i asked victor macheson the man whos so rude to us all every thursday afternoon for a guinea a timei dont know why we pay it to be abusedbut he wouldnt come i met him before he developed and i dont think he liked me  you got my telegram deyes asked as he unfolded his napkin  wilhelmina nodded  yes she answered it was very good of you to warn me i have hada letter already the campaign has begun  deyes nodded  chosen your weapons yet he asked  i havent much choice have i she answered a little bitterly i fight of course  deyes was carefully scanning the menu through his hornrimmed eyeglass  becassine √† la broche he murmured i must remember that  then he turned in his chair and looked at wilhelmina  you are worrying he declared abruptly  she shrugged her shoulders alabaster white rising from the unrelieved black of her velvet gown  my maids fault she added i ought to have worn white of course im worrying i dont care about carrying the signs of it about with me though i think i shall have to adopt peggys advice and go to the rougepot  perhaps he said deliberately it will not be necessary  she looked up at him quickly his words sounded encouraging  what do you mean  i mean that a way may be found to induce a certain gentleman to return to his native country and stay there deyes said smoothly after dinner we are going to have some talk please oblige me now by abandoning the discussion and eating something ah that champagne will do you good  her neighbour on the other side addressed her and wilhelmina was conscious of a sudden lightening of the load upon her heart like every one else she had confidence in this tall selfcontained man whose life was somewhat of a mystery even to his friends and who had about him that suggestion of power which reticence nearly always brings he was going to help her she pushed all those miserable thoughts away from her she became herself again  let no one imagine lady peggy said carefully knocking the end of a cigarette upon the table that i am going to try to catch the eyes of all you women and go sailing away with my nose in the air to look at engravings in the drawingroom you can just get up and go when you like any or all of you there are bridge tables laid out for you in the library music and a hopping girli dont call it dancingin the drawingroom a pool in the billiardroom or flirtation in the wintergarden coffee and liqueurs will follow you wherever you go take your choice good people for myself the duke is telling me stories of cairo jy suis jy reste im only thankful no one else can hear them  the party at the great round table dispersed slowly by two and threes wilhelmina and deyes strolled into the wintergarden deyes lit a cigarette and stood with his hands behind him wilhelmina was leaning against the back of a chair she was too excited to sit down  please she begged  deyes threw his cigarette away his face seemed to harden and soften at the same time his mouth was suddenly firm but his eyes glowed all the boredom was gone from his manner and expression  wilhelmina he said i have wanted to marry you ever since i saw you in the caf√© de paris with that atrocious blackguard who has caused you so much suffering you may remember that i have hinted as much to you before  she was startledvisibly disturbed  you know very well she said that you are speaking of impossible things  things that were impossible wilhelmina he said suppose i take jean le roi off your hands suppose i promise to send him back to his own country like a rat to his hole suppose i promise that your marriage shall be annulled without a line in the newspapers without a single vestige of publicity  you cannot do it she murmured eagerly  you want your freedom then he asked  yes i want my freedom she answered i have a right to it havent i  and i he said slowly want you  there was a short pause through the palms came the faint wailing of a violin the crash of pianoforte chords the clear soft notes of a singer wilhelmina felt her eyes fill with tears she was overwrought and there were new things things that were strange to her in the worn lined face of the man who was bending towards her  wilhelmina he said softly life our life does its best to strangle the emotions one feels that one does best with a pulse which has forgotten how to quicken and a heart which beats to the will of its owner but the most hardened of us come to grief sometimes i am afraid that i have comevery much to grief  i am sorry she said quietly  he drew away and his face became like marble  you meanthat it isnt any use he asked hoarsely  she looked at him and he did not press for words  is itthe missioner he asked  her head sank a little lower but still she did not answer gilbert deyes drew himself upright he remembered the cigarette which had burnt itself out between his fingers and he carefully relit it  i am now he said blowing a cloud of blue smoke into the heart of a yellow rose confronted by a somewhat hackneyed but always interesting problem do i care for you enoughor too littleor too muchto continue your friend when my aid will probably ensure the loss of you for ever it is not a problem to be hurried over this  there is no need for haste she answered i know you gilbert better than you know yourself i am very sure that you will help meif you can  he laughed bitterly  you are a good deal surer of me than i am of myself he answered why should i give you up to a boy who hasnt learnt yet the first lesson of life  what is it she asked i am not clear that i have graduated  you can see it blazoned over the portals as you pass through the gates he answered abandon all enthusiasm ye who enter here the pathways of life are heaped with the corpses of those who will not understand do you think that this boy will fare better than the rest with his preaching and lectures and east end work its sheer impertinence man the individual is only a pawn in the game of life why should he imagine that he can alter the things that are  even the striving to alter them she said may tend towards betterment  a platitude he declaredand hopeless  she raised her eyes to his  anyhow she said softly i care for him  he bowed low  incomprehensible he murmured take your freedom and marry this young man if you must but i warn you that you will be miserable apples and green figs dont grow on the same tree  he drew an envelope from his pocket and handed it to her  jean le roi he said was married to annette hurier in the town of ch√¢lons two years before he posed before you as the duke of languerois you will find annettes address in there it took me a year to trace this outa wasted year bah you women are all disappointments we will go and play bridge  lady peggy stared at wilhelmina when they entered the library a few minutes later  what on earth have you been doing to her gilbert she demanded shes a changed woman  making love to her deyes answered  lady peggy laughed  if i believed you she declared id give up this rubber and go and lose myself amongst the palms with you come and cut inyou too wilhelmina  but wilhelmina excused herself she drove homewards with a soft smile upon her lips and the dead weight lifted from her heart     chapter xv  the only way   it was a round table too at which macheson dined that night but with a different company for they were all men who sat there men with earnest faces and thoughtful eyes the graces of evening dress and society talk they knew nothing of they were the friends of machesons college days the men who had sworn amongst themselves that however they might live they would devote the greater part of their life to their fellowcreatures  they were smoking pipes and a great bowl of tobacco was on the table few of them took wine but macheson and holderness were drinking whisky holderness their senior was usually the one who started their informal talk  my works been easy enough all the time he remarked leaning forward there were no end of labourpapers but all being run either for the trades unions or some special industrial branch i started a labour magazinemacheson found the money of courseand im paying my way now i dont know whether the thing does any good at any rate its an effort ive been hearing about your colony franklin i shall want an article on it presently  a tall thin young man removed his pipe from his mouth  you shall have it as soon as i can find time he answered were going strong but really theres very little credit due to me it was machesons money and machesons idea weve got an entire village now near llandirog and the whole population come from the prisons macheson and i used to attend the policecourts ourselves hear all the cases and form our own conclusions as to the prisoners if we thought there was any hope for them we made a note met them when they came out and offered them a job on probationin our village we have to leave it to the chaplains nowi cant spare time to be always in london weve two woollen mills a sawmill and a bakery besides all the shops and nearly a thousand acres of wellfarmed land at first the people round were terribly shy of us but thats all over now why we have less trouble with the police in our village than any for miles around were paying our way too  youve done thundering well franklin macheson declared i remember what a rough time you had at first uphill work wasnt it  thats what makes it such a relief to have pulled through franklin declared relighting his pipe i shouldnt like to say how much i had to draw from macheson before we turned the corner glad to say weve paid a bit back now though tell us about your idea holroyd they tell me its working well in some of the large cities  its simple enough holroyd answered smiling it was just the application of common sense to the laws of charity nearly every ones charitable by instinctonly sometimes its so difficult for a busy man to know exactly when and how to give i started in one of the big cities looking up prosperous middleclass families id try to induce them instead of just writing cheques for institutions and making things for bazaars to take a personal interest in a family of about the same size as their own who were in a bad way when they promised all i had to do was to find the poor family and bring them together and it was astonishing how much the one could do for the other without undue effort there were the clothes of course and old housekeeping things odd bits of furniture food from the kitchen a job for one of the boys in the garden a days work for one of the girls in the house i tell you i have lists of hundreds of poor families who feel now that they have some one to fall back upon and the richer half of the combination take a tremendous interest in their fosterfamily as some of them call it sometimes there is trouble but the world is governed by majorities and in the majority of cases the thing has turned out excellently  theres the essence of charity in the ideathe personal note macheson remarked hows the canadian farm going finlayson  were paying our way finlayson answered and you should see our boys they come out thin and whiteall skin and bones you wouldnt recognize one of them in six months theyre good workers too weve nine hundred altogether in the northwest and we want more im hoping to take a hundred back with me  its a grand country macheson said im glad its part of the empire finlayson or i should grudge you those boys we cant spare too many hinton your work speaks for itself  hinton the only one in clerical dress smiled a little wearily  sometimes he said i wish it would speak a little louder east end work is all the same one feels ashamed of preaching religion to a starving people  macheson nodded his sympathy  i know what you mean he said it drove me from the east to the west we should preach at the one and feed the other of course i personally have always been handicapped i havent been able to subscribe to any of the established churches but i do believe in the laws of retribution whether you call them human or divine ones moral delinquencies pay one out just as bodily excesses do always ones debts are to be paid and its a terrible burden the drones must carry after all ive come to the conclusion that theres heaps of sound moral teaching to be drummed into our fellowcreatures without the necessity of being orthodox  you speak lightly of your own work macheson franklin said but there is one thing we must none of us forget our schools our farms our colonies all our attempts indeed owe their very being to your open purse  macheson held out his hand  franklin he said i want to tell you something which i think none of you know i want to tell you where most of my money came from and youll understand then why ive been so anxious to get rid of itor a part of itin this way did you ever hear of ferguson davis the moneylender yes i can see by your faces you did well he was my mothers brother and he died without a will when i was a child and the whole lot came to me  a million and a quarter some one murmured  more macheson answered i was at oxford when i understood exactly the whole business and it seemed like nothing but a curse to me then i talked to the dear old professor and he showed me the way i can honestly say that not one penny of that money has ever been spent directly or indirectly upon myself i believe that if the old man could come to life and read my bankbook hed have a worse fit than the one which carried him off i appointed myself the trustee of his fortune and its spread pretty well all over the world ive never refused to stand at the back of any reasonable scheme for the betterment of our fellowcreatures there have been a few failures perhaps but many successes the davis buildings are minein trust of course theyve done well ive a larger scheme on hand now on the same lines and in spite of it all the money grows i cant get rid of it the old man chose his investments well and many of our purely philanthropic schemes are beginning to pay their way it isnt that i care a fig about the money but you must try to make these things selfsupporting or you injure the character of those who benefit by them now ive told you all the truth but dont let it go out of this room you can consider yourselves fellowtrustees with me if you like show me an honest way to use money for the real benefit of the worlds unfortunates and its yours as much as mine  its magnificent franklin murmured  its justice macheson answered the money was wrung from the poor and it goes back to them perhaps its a saner distribution for its the improvident and shiftless of the world who go to the moneylender  there was a knock at the door the hallporter of the club in which they were holding their informal meeting entered and addressed macheson  i beg your pardon sir he said but there is a young man here who wants to see you at once he would not give his name but he says that his business is urgent  where is he macheson asked  in the smaller strangers room sir  macheson excused himself and crossing the hall entered the barely furnished apartment on the left of the entrance a young man was walking up and down with fierce restless movements he was pale untidily dressed and in his eyes there was a curious look of terror as though all the time he saw beyond the walls of the room things which kept him breathless with fear macheson pausing for a moment on the threshold failed on the instant to recognize him then he closed the door and advanced into the room  hurd he exclaimed what do you want what is the matter  matter enough hurd declared wildly i have been a fool and a blackguard those two got round methe old man and his cursed stepson i must have been mad  what have you done macheson asked sharply  she treated me badly hurd continued made a fool of me before you and turned me away from thorpe i wanted to cry quits with her and those two got hold of me jean le roi is her husband she refused to see himto hear from him letty foulton is there and i have been allowed to visit her i knew the back way in and i took jean le roi therean hour agoand he is waiting in her room until she comes home  good god macheson murmured you unspeakable blackguard  he glanced at the clock it was past midnight  what time was she expected home he demanded  soon after eleven she was only dining out hehe swore that he only wanted to talk to her to threaten her with exposure she deserved that but he is a madman when i left him i was afraid he carries a knife always and he kept on saying that she was his wife i left him there waitingand when i wanted him to promise that there should be no violence he laughed at me he is hidden in her room i thought that it was only money he wantedbutbut  macheson flung him on one side he caught up his hat and rushed out of the club     chapter xvi  man to man   hortense smiled softly to herself as she laid down the ivorybacked brushes what did it mean she wondered when her mistress went out with tired eyes and pallid cheeks and came home with the colour of a rose and eyes like stars humming an old french lovesong and her feet moving all the time to some unheard music it was years since she had seen her like this hortense knew the signs and was well pleased at last then the household was to be properly established a woman as beautiful as her mistress without a lover was to hortense an incomprehensible thing  you can go now hortense her mistress ordered i will have my coffee half an hour earlier tomorrow morning  very good madame the girl answered there is nothing else tonight then  nothing thank you wilhelmina answered you had better go to bed now i have been keeping you up rather late the last few evenings we must both turn over a new leaf  hortense departed smiling to herself it was always like thiswhen it came one thought of others and one wanted to be alone she too hummed a few bars of that lovesong as she climbed the stairs to her room  wilhelmina rose from her chair and stood for a moment looking at herself in the long oval lookingglass hortense had chosen for her a french dressingjacket with the palest of light blue ribbons drawn through the lace wilhelmina looked at herself and smiled was it the light the colouring or was she really still so good to look at her hair falling over her shoulders was long and silky the lines seemed to have been smoothed out of her faceshe was like herself when she had been a girl she followed the slender lines of her figure down past the lace of her petticoat to her feet still encased in her evening slippers with diamond buckles and she laughed softly to herself what was she yet but a girl fate had cheated her of some of the years but she was barely twentyfive how wonderful to be young still and feel ones blood flow to music like this her thoughts ran riot her mouth trembled and a deeper colour stained her cheeks then she heard a voice behind her a living voice in her room and as swiftly as those other mysterious thoughts had stolen into her heart came the chill of a deadly indescribable fear  charming ravishing it is almost worth the six years of waiting dear wife  she began to tremble she could not have called out or framed any intelligible sentence to save her life it was like a nightmare the horror was there without the power of movement or speech  he moved his position and came within the range of her terrified vision hurds twenty pounds and a little more added to it had done wonders he wore correct evening clothes correctly worn except for his good looksthe good looks of a devilhe would have attracted notice nowhere he leaned against the couch and though his lips curled into a sneer there was a flame in his eyes a horrible admiration  she tried to pray  you are overcome he murmured softly ah why not six years since our happiness was snatched from us ch√©rie ah but it was cruel you have thought of me i trust you have pitied me ah how often i have lain awake at night in my cell fondly imagining some such reunionas this  she forced herself to speak through lips suddenly pale what strange words they sounded frozen things scarcely audible yet the effort hurt her  i will give youthe money she said more if you will  ah he said reflectively the money i had forgotten that it was not kind of you to run away and hide little woman it was not kind of you to send me nothing when i was in prison oh i suffered i can tell you there is a good deal to be made up for pet if you had not reminded me just now these things seem so little dear little wife you are enchanting almost you turn my head  he came slowly towards her she threw up her hands  wait she begged oh wait listen i am in your power i admit it i will make terms i will sign anything what is it that you want you shall be rich but you must go away you must leave me now  he looked at her steadily and it seemed to her that his eyes were on fire with evil things  little wife he said with a shade of mockery in his lowered tone i cannot do that consider how you were snatched from my arms consider the cruelty of it as for the moneybah i have come to claim my own dont you understand you bewitching little fool it is you i want the money can wait i cannot  he came nearer still and she shrank like a terrified dumb thing against her magnificent dressingtable with its load of priceless trinkets she tried to call out but her voice seemed gone and he only laughed as he laid his hand over her mouth and drew her gently towards him with a sudden unnatural strength she wrested herself from his arms  oh listen to me listen to me for one moment first she begged frantically its true that i married you but it was all a plotand i was a child you shall have your share of my money leave me alone and i swear it you shall be rich you can go back to paris and be an adventurer no longer you shall spend your own money you can live your own life  even then her brain moved quickly she dared not speak of annette for fear of making him desperate it was his cupidity to which she appealed  i am no wife of yours she moaned you shall have more money than you ever had before in your life but dont make me kill myself for i shall if you touch me  he was so close to her now that his hot breath scorched her cheek  is it that another has taken my place he asked  yesno that is there is some one whom i love she cried listen you know what you can do with money in paris anything everything  he was so close to her now that the words died away upon her lips  little wife he whispered dont you understandthat i am a man and that it is you i want  again she tried to scream but his hand covered her mouth his arm was suddenly around her then he started back with an oath and looked towards the door of her bedroom  who is in that room he asked quickly  my maid she lied  he took a quick step across the room the door was flung open and macheson entered wilhelmina fainted but forced herself back into consciousness with a sheer effort of will sobbing and laughing at the same time she tried to drag herself towards the bell but jean le roi stood in the way jean le roi was calm but wicked  what are you doing in my wifes bedroom he asked  i am here to see you out of the house macheson answered with one breathless glance around the room will you come quietly  out of my own house jean le roi said softly out of my wifes room who are you  illustration the bone snapped and the knife fell from the nerveless fingers page 301  never mind macheson answered her friend let that be enough and let me tell you this if i had come too late i would have wrung your neck  jean le roi sprang at him like a cat his legs off the ground one arm around the others neck and something gleaming in his right hand nothing but machesons superb strength saved him he risked being throttled and caught jean le rois right arm in such a grip that he swung him half round the room the bone snapped and the knife fell from the nerveless fingers but macheson let go a second too soon jean le roi had all the courage and the insensibility to pain of a brute animal he stretched out his foot and with a trick of his old days tripped macheson so that he fell heavily jean le roi bent over him on his knees breathing heavily and with murder in his eyes macheson scarcely breathed he lay perfectly still jean le roi staggered to his feet and turned towards wilhelmina  you see madame he said seizing her by the wrist how i shall deal with your lovers if there are any more of them no use tugging at that bell i saw to that before you came im used to fighting for what i want and i think ive won you  he caught her into his arms but suddenly released her with a low animal cry he knew that this was the end for he was pinioned from behind a child in the mighty grip which held him powerless you are a little too hasty my friend macheson remarked i was afraid i might not be so quick as you on my feet so i rested for a moment but no man has ever escaped from this grip till i chose to let him go now he added turning to wilhelmina the way is clear will you go outside and rouse the servants dont come back  you arequite safe she faltered  absolutely he answered i could hold him with one hand  jean le roi lifted his head his brain was working swiftly  listen he exclaimed it is finished i am beaten i jean le roi admit defeat why call in servants the affair is better finished between ourselves  wilhelmina paused in that first great rush of relief she had not stopped to think that with jean le roi a prisoner and herself as prosecutrix the whole miserable story must be published he continued  give me money he said only a half of what you offered me just now and you shall have your freedom  wilhelmina smiled something of the joy of a few hours ago came faintly back to her  i have already that she answered i learnt the truth tonight  jean le roi shrugged his shoulders the game was up then what an evening of disasters  let me go he said i ask no more  wilhelmina and macheson exchanged glances she vanished into her room for a moment and reappeared in a long wrapper  come with me softly she said and i will let you out  so they three went on tiptoe down the broad stairs macheson and wilhelmina exchanged no words yet they both felt that the future was different for them  you can give mr macheson your address wilhelmina said as they stood at the front door i will send you something to help you make a fresh start  but jean le roi laughed  i play only for the great stakes he murmured with a swagger and when i losei lose  so he vanished into the darkness and macheson and wilhelmina remained with clasped hands  tomorrow he whispered stooping and kissing her fingers  tomorrow she repeated thank god you came tonight  she was too weary too happy to ask for explanations and he offered none all the time as he crossed the square and turned towards his house those words rang in his earstomorrow     chapter xvii  lord and lady bountiful   deyes caught a vision of blue in the window and crossed the lawn lady peggy leaned over the low sill between them was only a fragrant border of hyacinths  you know that our host and hostess have deserted us she asked  he nodded  they have gone over to this wonderful convalescent home that macheson is building in the hills he remarked i am not sure that i consider it good manners to leave us to entertain one another  i am not sure she said that it is proper wilhelmina should have considered that we are her only guests  she sat down in the windowsill and leaned back against the corner she had slept well and she was not afraid of the sunshineblue too was her most becoming colour he looked at her admiringly  you are really looking very well this morning he said  thank you she answered i was expecting that  i wonder he said how you others discover the secret of eternal youth you and macheson and wilhelmina all look younger than you did last year i seem to be getting older all by myself  she looked at him critically there were certainly more lines about his face and the suspicion of crowsfeet about his tired eyes  age she said is simply a matter of volition you wear yourself out fretting for the impossible  one has ones desires he murmured  but you should learn she said to let your desires be governed by your reason it is a foolish thing to want what you may not have  you think that it is like that with me he asked  all the world knows she answered that you are in love with wilhelmina  one must be in love with someone he remarked  naturally but why choose a woman who is head and ears in love with some one else  it cannot last he answered she has married him  lady peggy reached out for a cushion and placed it behind her head  that certainly would seem hopeful in the case of an ordinary womanmyself for instance she said but wilhelmina is not an ordinary woman she always would do things differently from other people i dont want to make you more unhappy than you are but i honestly believe that wilhelmina is going to set a new fashion she is going to try and reestablish the life domestic amongst the upper classes  she always was such a reformer he sighed  lady peggy nodded sympathetically  of course one cant tell how it may turn out she continued but at present they seem to have turned life into a sort of garden of eden and do you know i cant help fancying that there isnt the slightest chance for the serpent wilhelmina is so fearfully obstinate  the thing will cloy he declared  i fancy not she answered you see they dont live on sugarplums victor macheson is by way of being a masterful person and wilhelmina is only just beginning to realize the fascination of being ruled frankly gilbert i dont think theres the slightest chance for you  he sighed  i am afraid you are right he said regretfully i began to realize it last night when we went into the library unexpectedly and wilhelmina blushed no selfrespecting woman ought to blush when she is discovered being kissed by her own husband  wilhelmina lady peggy said stretching out her hand for one of deyes cigarettes may live to astonish us yet but of one thing i am convinced she will never even realize the other sex except through her own husband i am afraid she will grow narrowi should hate to write as her epitaph that she was an affectionate wife and devoted motherbut i am perfectly certain that that is what it will come to  in that case deyes remarked gloomily i may as well go away  no i shouldnt do that lady peggy said i should try to alter my point of view  direct me please he begged  i should try she continued to put a bridle upon my desires and take up the reins you could lead them in a more suitable direction  for instance  there is myself she declared  he laughed quietly  you he repeated why you are the most incorrigible flirt in christendom you would no more tie yourself up with one man than enter a nunnery  she sighed  i have always been misunderstood she declared looking at him pathetically out of her delightful eyes what you call my flirtations have been simply my attempts more or less clumsy to gain a husband i have been most unlucky no one ever proposes to me  he laughed derisively  your victims have been too loquacious he replied how about gayton who went to africa because you offered to be his friend and horrishe came to my rooms to tell me all about it the day you refused him and sammy palliseryou treated him shockingly  i had forgotten them she admitted they were nice men too all of them but they all made the same mistake i remember now they did propose to me that of course was fatal  i scarcely see he began  she patted him gently on the arm  my dear gilbert she said havent i always said that i never intend to marry any one who proposes to me when i have quite made up my mind i am going to do the proposing myself  whether it is leap year or not he asked  decidedly she answered men can always shuffle out of a leap year declaration my man wont be able to escape i can promise you that  does heexist then deyes asked  she laughed softly  hes existed for a good many years more than i have she answered i wasnt thinking of marrying a baby  ah does he know  well im not sure she said thoughtfully he ought to but hes such a stupid person  it was then that gilbert deyes received the shock of his life he discovered quite suddenly that her eyes were full of tears for the first time for many years he nearly lost his head  perhaps he suggested dropping his voice and astonished to find that it was not quite so steady as usual he has been waiting  i am afraid not she answered looking down for a moment at the buckle in her waistband  he looked round  if only he were here now he said could one conceive a more favourable opportunity an april morning sunshine flowers everything in the air to make him forget that he is an old fogey and doesnt deserve  she lifted her eyes to his now deliciously wet her brows were delicately uplifted  i couldnt do it she murmured unless he were in the same room  deyes stepped over the hyacinths and vaulted through the window                                       wilhelmina selected a freshly cut treestump carefully brushed away the sawdust and sat down macheson chose another and lighted a cigarette eventually they decided that they were too far away and selected a treetrunk where there was room for both wilhelmina unrolled a plan and glancing now and then at the forest of scaffold poles to their left proceeded to try to realize the incomplete building macheson watched her with a smile  victor she exclaimed you are not to laugh at me remember this is my first attempt at doing anythingworth doing and of course im keen about it are you sure we shall have enough bedrooms  enough for a start at any rate he answered we can always add to it  she looked once more at that forest of poles at the slowly rising walls through whose empty windows one could see pictures of the valley below  one can build she murmured one can build always but think victor what a lot of time i wasted before i knew you i might have done so much  he smiled reassuringly  there is plenty of time he declared better to start late and build on a sure foundation you know a good many of my houses had to come down as fast as they went up do you remember for instance how i wanted to convert all your villagers by storm  she smiled  stillim glad you came to try she said softly that horrid foreman is watching us victor i am going to look the other way  he has gone now macheson said slipping his arm around her waist dear do you know i dont think that one person can build very well alone its a cold sort of building when its finishedthe life built by a lonely man i like the look of our palace better wilhelmina  i should like to know where my part comes in she asked  every room he answered will need adorning and the lampsone person alone can never keep them alight and we dont want them to go out wilhelmina do you remember the old german who said that beautiful thoughts were the finest pictures to hang upon your walls think of next spring when we shall hear the children from that miserable town running about in the woods picking primrosesdo you see how yellow they are against the green moss  wilhelmina rose  i must really go and pick some she said what about your pheasants victor  he laughed  ill find plenty of sport never fear he answered without keeping the kiddies shut out why the country belongs to them its their birthright not ours  they walked through the plantation side by side the ground was still soft with the winters rains but everywhere the sunlight came sweeping in up the glade and across the many stretching arms of tender blossoming green the ground was starred with primroses and in every sheltered nook were violets a soft west wind blew in their faces as they emerged into the country lane below them was the valley hung with a faint blue mist all around them the song of birds the growing sounds of the stirring season stephen hurd came cantering by and stopped for a moment to speak about some matter connected with the estates  my love to letty wilhelmina said graciously as he rode off then she turned to macheson  stephen hurd is a little corner in your house she remarked  in our house he protested i should never have considered him if he had not worked out his own salvation if he had reached me ten minutes later  she gripped his arm  dont she begged  he laughed  dont ever brood over grisly impossibilities he said the man never breathed who could have kept you from me across the hills home or are your shoes too thin  he swung open the gate and they passed through only to descend the other side along the broad green walk strewn with grey rocks and bordered with gorse bushes aglow with yellow blossom they skirted the fir plantation received the respectful greetings of mrs green at the gamekeepers cottage and crossing the lower range of hills approached the house by the back avenue and wilhelmina laughed softly as they passed along the green lane for her thoughts travelled back to one wild night when with upraised skirts and flying trembling footsteps she had sped along into a new world she clung to her husbands arm  i came this way dear when i set out that nightto kiss you  he stooped down and kissed her full on the lips  a nice state you flung me into he remarked  it was rather an exciting evening she said demurely  they walked straight into the morningroom which was indiscreet and wilhelmina screamed  peggy she cried peggy you bad girl  the two women went off together of course to talk about it and deyes and macheson like englishmen all the world over muttered something barely comprehensible and then looked at one another awkwardly  care for a game of billiards macheson suggested  right oh deyes answered in immense relief                           the end
