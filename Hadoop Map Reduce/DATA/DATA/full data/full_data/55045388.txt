in the spring of the present year they contain in the plainest terms i could use the substance of what i then desired to say to our english workmen which was briefly thisthe reform you desire may give you more influence in parliament but your influence there will of course be useless to youperhaps worse than useless until you have wisely made up your minds what you wish parliament to do for you and when you have made up your minds about that you will find not only that you can do it for yourselves without the intervention of parliament but that eventually nobody but yourselves can do it and to help you as far as one of your old friends may in so making up your minds such and such things are what it seems to me you should ask for and moreover strive for with your heart and might  the letters now published relate only to one division of the laws which i desired to recommend to the consideration of our operativesthose namely bearing upon honesty of work and honesty of exchange i hope in the course of next year that i may be able to complete the second part of the series i could not but fors clavigera is now 1872 answering the same end which will relate to the possible comforts and wholesome laws of familiar household life and the share which a laboring nation may attain in the skill and the treasures of the higher arts  the letters are republished as they were written with here and there correction of a phrase and omission of one or two passages of merely personal or temporary interest the headings only are added in order to give the reader some clue to the general aim of necessarily desultory discussion and the portions of mr dixons letters in reply referred to in the text are added in the appendix and will be found well deserving of attention    denmark hill       december 14 1867     time and tide  by  weare and tyne     letter i  the two kinds of cooperationin its highest sense it is not yet thought of                                      denmark hill february 4 1867  my dear friend  1 you have now everything i have yet published on political economy but there are several points in these books of mine which i intended to add notes to and it seems little likely i shall get that soon done so i think the best way of making up for the want of these is to write you a few simple letters which you can read to other people or send to be printed if you like in any of your journals where you think they may be useful  i especially want you for one thing to understand the sense in which the word cooperation is used in my books you will find i am always pleading for it and yet i dont at all mean the cooperation of partnership as opposed to the system of wages which is now so gradually extending itself among our great firms i am glad to see it doing so yet not altogether glad for none of you who are engaged in the immediate struggle between the system of cooperation and the system of mastership know how much the dispute involves and none of us know the results to which it may finally lead for the alternative is not in reality only between two modes of conducting businessit is between two different states of society it is not the question whether an amount of wages no greater in the end than that at present received by the men may be paid to them in a way which shall give them share in the risks and interest in the prosperity of the business the question is really whether the profits which are at present taken as his own right by the person whose capital or energy or ingenuity has made him head of the firm are not in some proportion to be divided among the subordinates of it  2 i do not wish for the moment to enter into any inquiry as to the just claims of capital or as to the proportions in which profits ought to be or are in actually existing firms divided i merely take the one assured and essential condition that a somewhat larger income will be in cooperative firms secured to the subordinates by the diminution of the income of the chief and the general tendency of such a system is to increase the facilities of advancement among the subordinates to stimulate their ambition to enable them to lay by if they are provident more ample and more early provision for declining years and to form in the end a vast class of persons wholly different from the existing operativemembers of society possessing each a moderate competence able to procure therefore not indeed many of the luxuries but all the comforts of life and to devote some leisure to the attainments of liberal education and to the other objects of free life on the other hand by the exact sum which is divided among them more than their present wages the fortune of the man who under the present system takes all the profits of the business will be diminished and the acquirement of large private fortune by regular means and all the conditions of life belonging to such fortune will be rendered impossible in the mercantile community  3 now the magnitude of the social change hereby involved and the consequent differences in the moral relations between individuals have not as yet been thought ofmuch less estimatedby any of your writers on commercial subjects and it is because i do not yet feel able to grapple with them that i have left untouched in the books i send you the question of cooperative labor when i use the word cooperation it is not meant to refer to these new constitutions of firms at all i use the word in a far wider sense as opposed not to masterhood but to competition i do not mean for instance by cooperation that all the master bakers in a town are to give a share of their profits to the men who go out with the bread but that the masters are not to try to undersell each other nor seek each to get the others business but are all to form one society selling to the public under a common law of severe penalty for unjust dealing and at an established price i do not mean that all bankers clerks should be partners in the bank but i do mean that all bankers should be members of a great national body answerable as a society for all deposits and that the private business of speculating with other peoples money should take another name than that of banking and for final instance i mean by cooperation not only fellowships between trading firms but between trading nations so that it shall no more be thought as it is now with ludicrous and vain selfishness an advantage for one nation to undersell another and take its occupation away from it but that the primal and eternal law of vital commerce shall be of all men understoodnamely that every nation is fitted by its character and the nature of its territories for some particular employments or manufactures and that it is the true interest of every other nation to encourage it in such speciality and by no means to interfere with but in all ways forward and protect its efforts ceasing all rivalship with it so soon as it is strong enough to occupy its proper place you see therefore that the idea of cooperation in the sense in which i employ it has hardly yet entered into the minds of political inquirers and i will not pursue it at present but return to that system which is beginning to obtain credence and practice among us this however must be in a following letter     letter ii  cooperation as hitherto understood is perhaps not expedient                                                    february 4 1867  4 limiting the inquiry then for the present as proposed in the close of my last letter to the form of cooperation which is now upon its trial in practice i would beg of you to observe that the points at issue in the comparison of this system with that of mastership are by no means hitherto frankly stated still less can they as yet be fairly brought to test for all mastership is not alike in principle there are just and unjust masterships and while on the one hand there can be no question but that cooperation is better than unjust and tyrannous mastership there is very great room for doubt whether it be better than a just and benignant mastership  5 at present youevery one of youspeak and act as if there were only one alternative namely between a system in which profits shall be divided in due proportion among all and the present one in which the workman is paid the least wages he will take under the pressure of competition in the labormarket but an intermediate method is conceivable a method which appears to me more prudent and in its ultimate results more just than the cooperative one an arrangement may be supposed and i have good hope also may one day be effected by which every subordinate shall be paid sufficient and regular wages according to his rank by which due provision shall be made out of the profits of the business for sick and superannuated workers and by which the master being held responsible as a minor king or governor for the conduct as well as the comfort of all those under his rule shall on that condition be permitted to retain to his own use the surplus profits of the business which the fact of his being its master may be assumed to prove that he has organized by superior intellect and energy and i think this principle of regular wagepaying whether it be in the abstract more just or not is at all events the more prudent for this reason mainly that in spite of all the cant which is continually talked by cruel foolish or designing persons about the duty of remaining content in the position in which providence has placed you there is a root of the very deepest and holiest truth in the saying which gives to it such power as it still retains even uttered by unkind and unwise lips and received into doubtful and embittered hearts  6 if indeed no effort be made to discover in the course of their early training for what services the youths of a nation are individually qualified nor any care taken to place those who have unquestionably proved their fitness for certain functions in the offices they could best fulfilthen to call the confused wreck of social order and life brought about by malicious collision and competition an arrangement of providence is quite one of the most insolent and wicked ways in which it is possible to take the name of god in vain but if at the proper time some earnest effort be made to place youths according to their capacities in the occupations for which they are fitted i think the system of organization will be finally found the best which gives the least encouragement to thoughts of any great future advance in social life  7 the healthy sense of progress which is necessary to the strength and happiness of men does not consist in the anxiety of a struggle to attain higher place or rank but in gradually perfecting the manner and accomplishing the ends of the life which we have chosen or which circumstances have determined for us thus i think the object of a workmans ambition should not be to become a master but to attain daily more subtle and exemplary skill in his own craft to save from his wages enough to enrich and complete his home gradually with more delicate and substantial comforts and to lay by such store as shall be sufficient for the happy maintenance of his old age rendering him independent of the help provided for the sick and indigent by the arrangement presupposed and sufficient also for the starting of his children in a rank of life equal to his own if his wages are not enough to enable him to do this they are unjustly low if they are once raised to this adequate standard i do not think that by the possible increase of his gains under contingencies of trade or by divisions of profits with his master he should be enticed into feverish hope of an entire change of condition and as an almost necessary consequence pass his days in an anxious discontent with immediate circumstances and a comfortless scorn of his daily life for which no subsequent success could indemnify him and i am the more confident in this belief because even supposing a gradual rise in social rank possible for all wellconducted persons my experience does not lead me to think the elevation itself when attained would be conducive to their happiness  8 the grounds of this opinion i will give you in a future letter in the present one i must pass to a more important pointnamely that if this stability of condition be indeed desirable for those in whom existing circumstances might seem to justify discontent much more must it be good and desirable for those who already possess everything which can be conceived necessary to happiness it is the merest insolence of selfishness to preach contentment to a laborer who gets thirty shillings a week while we suppose an active and plotting covetousness to be meritorious in a man who has three thousand a year in this as in all other points of mental discipline it is the duty of the upper classes to set an example to the lower and to recommend and justify the restraint of the ambition of their inferiors chiefly by severe and timely limitation of their own and without at present inquiring into the greater or less convenience of the possible methods of accomplishing such an object every detail in suggestions of this kind necessarily furnishing separate matter of dispute i will merely state my longfixed conviction that one of the most important conditions of a healthful system of social economy would be the restraint of the properties and incomes of the upper classes within certain fixed limits the temptation to use every energy in the accumulation of wealth being thus removed another and a higher ideal of the duties of advanced life would be necessarily created in the national mind by withdrawal of those who had attained the prescribed limits of wealth from commercial competition earlier worldly success and earlier marriage with all its beneficent moral results would become possible to the young while the older men of active intellect whose sagacity is now lost or warped in the furtherance of their own meanest interests would be induced unselfishly to occupy themselves in the superintendence of public institutions or furtherance of public advantage and out of this class it would be found natural and prudent always to choose the members of the legislative body of the commons and to attach to the order also some peculiar honors in the possession of which such complacency would be felt as would more than replace the unworthy satisfaction of being supposed richer than others which to many men is the principal charm of their wealth and although no law of this purport would ever be imposed on themselves by the actual upper classes there is no hindrance to its being gradually brought into force from beneath without any violent or impatient proceedings and this i will endeavor to show you in my next letter     letter iii  of true legislation that every man may be a law to himself                                                   february 17 1867  9 no i have not been much worse in health but i was asked by a friend to look over some work in which you will all be deeply interested one day so that i could not write again till now i was the more sorry because there were several things i wished to note in your last letter one especially leads me directly to what i in any case was desirous of urging upon you you say in vol 6th of frederick the great i find a great deal that i feel quite certain if our queen or government could make law thousands of our english workmen would hail with a shout of joy and gladness i do not remember to what you especially allude but whatever the rules you speak of may be unless there be anything in them contrary to the rights of present english property why should you care whether the government makes them law or not can you not you thousands of english workmen simply make them a law to yourselves by practising them  it is now some five or six years since i first had occasion to speak to the members of the london working mens college on the subject of reform and the substance of what i said to them was this you are all agape my friends for this mighty privilege of having your opinions represented in parliament the concession might be desirableat all events courteousif only it were quite certain you had got any opinions to represent but have you are you agreed on any single thing you systematically want less work and more wages of course but how much lessening of work do you suppose is possible do you think the time will ever come for everybody to have no work and all wages or have you yet taken the trouble so much as to think out the nature of the true connection between wages and work and to determine even approximately the real quantity of the one that can according to the laws of god and nature be given for the other for rely on it make what laws you like that quantity only can you at last get  10 do you know how many mouths can be fed on an acre of land or how fast those mouths multiply and have you considered what is to be done finally with unfeedable mouths send them to be fed elsewhere do you say have you then formed any opinion as to the time at which emigration should begin or the countries to which it should preferably take place or the kind of population which should be left at home have you planned the permanent state which you would wish england to hold emigrating over her edges like a full well constantly how full would you have her be of people first and of what sort of people do you want her to be nothing but a large workshop and forge so that the name of englishman shall be synonymous with ironmonger all over the world or would you like to keep some of your lords and landed gentry still and a few green fields and trees  11 you know well enough that there is not one of these questions i do not say which you can answer but which you have ever thought of answering and yet you want to have voices in parliament your voices are not worth a rats squeak either in parliament or out of it till you have some ideas to utter with them and when you have the thoughts you will not want to utter them for you will see that your way to the fulfilling of them does not lie through speech you think such matters need debating about by all means debate about them but debate among yourselves and with such honest helpers of your thoughts as you can find if by that way you cannot get at the truth do you suppose you could get at it sooner in the house of commons where the only aim of many of the members would be to refute every word uttered in your favor and where the settlement of any question whatever depends merely on the perturbations of the balance of conflicting interests  12 that was in main particulars what i then said to the men of the working mens college and in this recurrent agitation about reform that is what i would steadfastly say again do you think it is only under the lacquered splendors of westminsteryou working men of englandthat your affairs can be rationally talked over you have perfect liberty and power to talk over and establish for yourselves whatever laws you please so long as you do not interfere with other peoples liberties or properties elect a parliament of your own choose the best men among you the best at least you can find by whatever system of election you think likeliest to secure such desirable result invite trustworthy persons of other classes to join your council appoint time and place for its stated sittings and let this parliament chosen after your own hearts deliberate upon the possible modes of the regulation of industry and advisablest schemes for helpful discipline of life and so lay before you the best laws they can devise which such of you as were wise might submit to and teach their children to obey and if any of the laws thus determined appear to be inconsistent with the present circumstances or customs of trade do not make a noise about them nor try to enforce them suddenly on others nor embroider them on flags nor call meetings in parks about them in spite of railings and police but keep them in your thoughts and sight as objects of patient purpose and future achievement by peaceful strength  13 for you need not think that even if you obtained a majority of representatives in the existing parliament you could immediately compel any system of business broadly contrary to that now established by custom if you could pass laws tomorrow wholly favorable to yourselves as you might think because unfavorable to your masters and to the upper classes of societythe only result would be that the riches of the country would at once leave it and you would perish in riot and famine be assured that no great change for the better can ever be easily accomplished or quickly nor by impulsive illregulated effort nor by bad men nor even by good men without much suffering the suffering must indeed come one way or another in all greatly critical periods the only question for us is whether we will reach our ends if we ever reach them through a chain of involuntary miseries many of them useless and all ignoble or whether we will know the worst at once and deal with it by the wisely sharp methods of godsped courage  14 this i repeat to you it is wholly in your own power to do but it is in your power on one condition only that of steadfast truth to yourselves and to all men if there is not in the sum of it honesty enough among you to teach you to frame and strengthen you to obey just laws of trade there is no hope left for you no political constitution can ennoble knaves no privileges can assist them no possessions enrich them their gains are occult curses comfortless loss their truest blessing failure and pain natures only mercy to them look to it therefore first that you get some wholesome honesty for the foundation of all things without the resolution in your hearts to do good work so long as your right hands have motion in them and to do it whether the issue be that you die or live no life worthy the name will ever be possible to you while in once forming the resolution that your work is to be well done life is really won here and for ever and to make your children capable of such resolution is the beginning of all true education of which i have more to say in a future letter     letter iv  the expenses for art and for war                                                   february 19 1867  15 in the pall mall gazette of yesterday second column of second page you will find close to each other two sentences which bear closely on matters in hand the first of these is the statement that in the debate on the grant for the blacas collection mr bernal osborne got an assenting cheer when he said that whenever science and art were mentioned it was a sign to look after the national pockets i want you to notice this fact i e the debate in question being on a total grant of 164000l of which 48000l only were truly for arts sake and the rest for shops sake in illustration of a passage in my sesame and lilies pp 69 70 of the small edition and pp 46 47 of vol i of the revised series of the entire worksa to which i shall have again to refer you with some further comments in the sequel of these letters the second passage is to the effect that the trades union bill was read a second time after a claim from mr hadfield mr osborne and mr samuelson to admit working men into the commission to which mr watkin answered that the working mens friend was too conspicuous in the body and mr roebuck that when a butcher was tried for murder it was not necessary to have butchers on the jury      a appendix i  16 note this second passage with respect to what i said in my last letter as to the impossibility of the laws of work being investigated in the house of commons what admixture of elements think you would avail to obtain so much as decent hearing how should we then speak of impartial judgment of the cause of working men in an assembly which permits to one of its principal members this insolent discourtesy of language in dealing with a preliminary question of the highest importance and permits it as so far expressive of the whole color and tone of its own thoughts that the sentence is quoted by one of the most temperate and accurate of our daily journals as representing the total answer of the opposite side in the debate no be assured you can do nothing yet at westminster you must have your own parliament and if you cannot detect enough honesty among you to constitute a justly minded one for the present matters must take their course and that will be yet awhile to the worse  17 i meant to have continued this subject but i see two other statements in the pall mall gazette of today with which and a single remark upon them i think it will be well to close my present letter  1 the total sum asked for in the army estimates published this morning is 14752200l being an increase of 412000l over the previous year  2 yesterday the annual account of the navy receipts and expenditure for the year ending 31st march 1866 was issued from the admiralty the expenditure was 10268115l 7s  omitting the seven shillings and even the odd hundredthousands of pounds the net annual expenditure for army and navy appears to be twentyfour millions  the grant in science and art twothirds of which was not in reality for either but for amusement and shop interests in the paris exhibitionthe grant which the house of commons feels to be indicative of general danger to the national pocketsis as above stated 164000l now i believe the three additional ciphers which turn thousands into millions produce on the intelligent english mind usually the effect ofthree ciphers but calculate the proportion of these two sums and then imagine to yourself the beautiful state of rationality of any private gentleman who having regretfully spent 164l on pictures for his walls paid willingly 24000l annually to the policeman who looked after his shutters you practical englishwill you ever unbar the shutters of your brains and hang a picture or two in those statechambers     letter v  the corruption of modern pleasurecovent garden pantomime                                                   february 25 1867  18 there is this great advantage in the writing real letters that the direct correspondence is a sufficient reason for saying in or out of order everything that the chances of the day bring into ones head in connection with the matter in hand and as such things very usually go out of ones head again after they get tired of their lodging they would otherwise never get said at all and thus today quite out of order but in very close connection with another part of our subject i am going to tell you what i was thinking on friday evening last in covent garden theater as i was looking and not laughing at the pantomime of ali baba and the forty thieves  when you begin seriously to consider the question referred to in my second letter of the essential and in the outcome inviolable connection between quantity of wages and quantity of work you will see that wages in the full sense dont mean pay merely but the reward whatever it may be of pleasure as well as profit and of various other advantages which a man is meant by providence to get during life for work well done even limiting the idea to pay the question is not so much what quantity of coin you get aswhat you can get for it when you have it whether a shilling a day be good pay or not depends wholly on what a shillings worth is that is to say what quantity of the things you want may be had for a shilling and that again depends and a great deal more than that depends on what you do want if only drink and foul clothes such and such pay may be enough for you if you want good meat and good clothes you must have larger wage if clean rooms and fresh air larger still and so on you say perhaps every one wants these better things so far from that a wholesome taste for cleanliness and fresh air is one of the final attainments of humanity there are now not many european gentlemen even in the highest classes who have a pure and right love of fresh air they would put the filth of tobacco even into the first breeze of a may morning  19 but there are better things even than these which one may want grant that one has good food clothes lodging and breathing is that all the pay one ought to have for ones work wholesome means of existence and nothing more enough perhaps you think if everybody could get these it may be so i will not at this moment dispute it nevertheless i will boldly say that you should sometimes want more than these and for one of many things more you should want occasionally to be amused  you know the upper classes most of them want to be amused all day long they think    one moment unamused a misery   not made for feeble men  perhaps you have been in the habit of despising them for this and thinking how much worthier and nobler it was to work all day and care at night only for food and rest than to do no useful thing all day eat unearned food and spend the evening as the morning in change of follies and relays of joy no my good friend that is one of the fatalest deceptions it is not a noble thing in sum and issue of it not to care to be amused it is indeed a far higher moral state but is a much lower creature state than that of the upper classes  20 yonder poor horse calm slave in daily chains at the railroad siding who drags the detached rear of the train to the front again and slips aside so deftly as the buffers meet and within eighteen inches of death every ten minutes fulfils his changeless duty all day long content for eternal reward with his nights rest and his champed mouthful of hayanything more earnestly moral and beautiful one cannot imagei never see the creature without a kind of worship and yonder musician who used the greatest power which in the art he knew the father of spirits ever yet breathed into the clay of this worldwho used it i say to follow and fit with perfect sound the words of the zauberflöte and of don giovannifoolishest and most monstrous of conceivable human words and subjects of thoughtfor the future amusement of his raceno such spectacle of unconscious and in that unconsciousness all the more fearful moral degradation of the highest faculty to the lowest purpose can be found in history but mozart is nevertheless a nobler creature than the horse at the siding nor would it be the least nearer the purpose of his maker that he and all his frivolous audiences should evade the degradation of the profitless piping only by living like horses in daily physical labor for daily bread  21 there are three things to which man is bornalabor and sorrow and joy each of these three things has its baseness and its nobleness there is base labor and noble labor there is base sorrow and noble sorrow there is base joy and noble joy but you must not think to avoid the corruption of these things by doing without the things themselves nor can any life be right that has not all three labor without joy is base labor without sorrow is base sorrow without labor is base joy without labor is base      a i ask the readers thoughtful attention to this     paragraph on which much of what else i have to say depends  22 i dare say you think i am a long time in coming to the pantomime i am not ready to come to it yet in due course for we ought to go and see the japanese jugglers first in order to let me fully explain to you what i mean but i cant write much more today so i shall merely tell you what part of the play set me thinking of all this and leave you to consider of it yourself till i can send you another letter the pantomime was as i said ali baba and the forty thieves the forty thieves were girls the forty thieves had forty companions who were girls the forty thieves and their forty companions were in some way mixed up with about four hundred and forty fairies who were girls there was an oxford and cambridge boatrace in which the oxford and cambridge men were girls there was a transformation scene with a forest in which the flowers were girls and a chandelier in which the lamps were girls and a great rainbow which was all of girls  23 mingled incongruously with these seraphic and as far as my boyish experience extends novel elements of pantomime there were yet some of its old and fastexpiring elements there were in speciality two thoroughly good pantomime actorsmr w h payne and mr frederick payne all that these two did was done admirably there were two subordinate actors who played subordinately well the fore and hind legs of a donkey and there was a little actress of whom i have chiefly to speak who played exquisitely the little part she had to play the scene in which she appeared was the only one in the whole pantomime in which there was any dramatic effort or with a few rare exceptions any dramatic possibility it was the home scene in which ali babas wife on washing day is called upon by butcher baker and milkman with unpaid bills and in the extremity of her distress hears her husbands knock at the door and opens it for him to drive in his donkey laden with gold the children who have been beaten instead of getting breakfast presently share in the raptures of their father and mother and the little lady i spoke of eight or nine years olddances a pasdedeux with the donkey  24 she did it beautifully and simply as a child ought to dance she was not an infant prodigy there was no evidence in the finish or strength of her motion that she had been put to continual torture through half her eight or nine years she did nothing more than any child well taught but painlessly might easily do she caricatured no older personattempted no curious or fantastic skill she was dressed decentlyshe moved decentlyshe looked and behaved innocentlyand she danced her joyful dance with perfect grace spirit sweetness and selfforgetfulness and through all the vast theater full of english fathers and mothers and children there was not one hand lifted to give her sign of praise but mine  presently after this came on the forty thieves who as i told you were girls and there being no thieving to be presently done and time hanging heavy on their hands arms and legs the forty thiefgirls proceeded to light forty cigars whereupon the british public gave them a round of applause whereupon i fell a thinking and saw little more of the piece except as an ugly and disturbing dream     letter vi  the corruption of modern pleasurethe japanese jugglers                                                   february 28 1867  25 i have your pleasant letter with references to frederick i will look at them carefullya mr carlyle himself will be pleased to hear this letter when he comes home i heard from him last week at mentone he is well and glad of the light and calm of italy i must get back to the evil light and uncalm of the places i was taking you through      a appendix 2  parenthetically did you see the article in the times of yesterday on bribery and the conclusion of the commissionno one sold any opinions for no one had any opinions to sell  both on thursday and friday last i had been tormented by many things and wanted to disturb my course of thought any way i could i have told you what entertainment i got on friday first for it was then that i began meditating over these letters let me tell you now what entertainment i found on thursday  26 you may have heard that a company of japanese jugglers has come over to exhibit in london there has long been an increasing interest in japanese art which has been very harmful to many of our own painters and i greatly desired to see what these people were and what they did well i have seen blondin and various english and french circus work but never yet anything that surprised me so much as one of these mens exercises on a suspended pole its special character was a close approximation to the action and power of the monkey even to the prehensile power in the foot so that i asked a sculptorfriend who sat in front of me whether he thought such a grasp could be acquired by practice or indicated difference in race he said he thought it might be got by practice there was also much inconceivably dexterous work in spinning of topsmaking them pass in balanced motion along the edge of a sword and along a level string and the likethe father performing in the presence of his two children who encouraged him continually with short sharp cries like those of animals then there was some fairly good sleightofhand juggling of little interest ending with a dance by the juggler first as an animal and then as a goblin now there was this great difference between the japanese masks used in this dance and our common pantomime masks for beasts and demonsthat our english masks are only stupidly and loathsomely ugly by exaggeration of feature or of defect of feature but the japanese masks like the frequent monsters of japanese art were inventively frightful like fearful dreams and whatever power it is that acts on human minds enabling them to invent such appears to me not only to deserve the term demoniacal as the only word expressive of its character but to be logically capable of no other definition  27 the impression therefore produced upon me by the whole scene was that of being in the presence of human creatures of a partially inferior race but not without great human gentleness domestic affection and ingenious intellect who were nevertheless as a nation afflicted by an evil spirit and driven by it to recreate themselves in achieving or beholding the achievement through years of patience of a certain correspondence with the nature of the lower animals  28 these then were the two forms of diversion or recreation of my mind possible to me in two days when i needed such help in this metropolis of england i might as a rich man have had better music if i had so chosen though even so not rational or helpful but a poor man could only have these or worse than these if he cared for any manner of spectacle i am not at present observe speaking of pure acting which is a study and recreative only as a noble book is but of means of mere amusement  now lastly in illustration of the effect of these and other such amusements and of the desire to obtain them on the minds of our youth read the times correspondents letter from paris in the tenth page of the paper todaya and that will be quite enough for you to read for the present i believe      a appendix 3     letter vii  of the various expressions of national festivity                                                       march 4 1867  29 the subject which i want to bring before you is now branched and worse than branched reticulated in so many directions that i hardly know which shoot of it to trace or which knot to lay hold of first  i had intended to return to those japanese jugglers after a visit to a theater in paris but i had better perhaps at once tell you the piece of the performance which in connection with the scene in the english pantomime bears most on matters in hand  it was also a dance by a little girlthough one older than ali babas daughter i suppose a girl of twelve or fourteen a dance so called which consisted only in a series of short sharp contractions and jerks of the body and limbs resulting in attitudes of distorted and quaint ugliness such as might be produced in a puppet by sharp twitching of strings at its joints these movements being made to the sound of two instruments which between them accomplished only a quick vibratory beating and strumming in nearly the time of a hearthcrickets song but much harsher and of course louder and without any sweetness only in the monotony and unintended aimless construction of it reminding one of various other insect and reptile cries or warnings partly of the cicalas hiss partly of the little melancholy german frog which says mu mu mu all summerday long with its nose out of the pools by dresden and leipsic and partly of the deadened quivering and intense continuousness of the alarm of the rattlesnake  while this was going on there was a bible text repeating itself over and over again in my head whether i would or noand miriam the prophetess the sister of aaron took a timbrel in her hand and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances to which text and some others i shall ask your attention presently but i must go to paris first  30 not at once however to the theater but to a booksellers shop no 4 rue voltaire where in the year 1858 was published the fifth edition of balzacs contes drôlatiques illustrated by 425 designs by gustave doré  both text and illustrations are as powerful as it is ever in the nature of evil things to be there is no final strength but in rightness nothing more witty nor more inventively horrible has yet been produced in the evil literature or by the evil art of man nor can i conceive it possible to go beyond either in their specialities of corruption the text is full of blasphemies subtle tremendous hideous in shamelessness some put into the mouths of priests the illustrations are in a word one continuous revelry in the most loathsome and monstrous aspects of death and sin enlarged into fantastic ghastliness of caricature as if seen through the distortion and trembling of the hot smoke of the mouth of hell take this following for a general type of what they seek in death one of the most labored designs is of a man cut in two downwards by the sweep of a swordone half of him falls toward the spectator the other half is elaborately drawn in its sectiongiving the profile of the divided nose and lips cleft jawbreastand entrails and this is done with farther pollution and horror of intent in the circumstances which i do not choose to describestill less some other of the designs which seek for fantastic extreme of sin as this for the utmost horror of death but of all the 425 there is not one which does not violate every instinct of decency and law of virtue or life written in the human soul  31 now my friend among the many signs of the times the production of a book like this is a significant one but it becomes more significant still when connected with the farther fact that m gustave doré the designer of this series of plates has just been received with loud acclaim by the british evangelical public as the fittest and most able person whom they could at present find to illustrate to their minds and recommend with grace of sacred art their hitherto unadorned bible for them  of which bible and of the use we at present make of it in england having a grave word or two to say in my next letter preparatory to the examination of that verse which haunted me through the japanese juggling and of some others also i leave you first this sign of the public esteem of it to consider at your leisure     letter viii  the four possible theories respecting the authority of the bible                                                       march 7 1867  32 i have your yesterdays letter but must not allow myself to be diverted from the business in hand for this once for it is the most important of which i have to write to you  you must have seen long ago that the essential difference between the political economy i am trying to teach and the popular science is that mine is based on presumably attainable honesty in men and conceivable respect in them for the interests of others while the popular science founds itself wholly on their supposed constant regard for their own and on their honesty only so far as thereby likely to be secured  it becomes therefore for me and for all who believe anything i say a great primal question on what this presumably attainable honesty is to be based  33 is it to be based on religion you may ask are we to be honest for fear of losing heaven if we are dishonest or to put it as generously as we may for fear of displeasing god or are we to be honest on speculation because honesty is the best policy and to invest in virtue as in an undepreciable stock  and my answer isnot in any hesitating or diffident way and you know my friend that whatever people may say of me i often do speak diffidently though when i am diffident of things i like to avoid speaking of them if it may be but here i say with no shadow of doubtyour honesty is not to be based either on religion or policy both your religion and policy must be based on it your honesty must be based as the sun is in vacant heaven poised as the lights in the firmament which have rule over the day and over the night if you ask why you are to be honestyou are in the question itself dishonored because you are a man is the only answer and therefore i said in a former letter that to make your children capable of honesty is the beginning of education make them men first and religious men afterwards and all will be sound but a knaves religion is always the rottenest thing about him  34 it is not therefore because i am endeavoring to lay down a foundation of religious concrete on which to build piers of policy that you so often find me quoting bible texts in defense of this or that principle or assertion but the fact that such references are an offense as i know them to be to many of the readers of these political essays is one among many others which i would desire you to reflect upon whether you are yourself one of the offended or not as expressive of the singular position which the mind of the british public has at present taken with respect to its worshiped book the positions honestly tenable before i use any more of its texts i must try to define for you  35 all the theories possible to theological disputants respecting the bible are resolvable into four and four only  1 the first is that of the illiterate modern religious world that every word of the book known to them as the bible was dictated by the supreme being and is in every syllable of it his word  this theory is of course tenable by no ordinarily welleducated person  2 the second theory is that although admitting verbal error the substance of the whole collection of books called the bible is absolutely true and furnished to man by divine inspiration of the speakers and writers of it and that every one who honestly and prayerfully seeks for such truth in it as is necessary for his salvation will infallibly find it there  this theory is that held by most of our good and upright clergymen and the better class of the professedly religious laity  3 the third theory is that the group of books which we call the bible were neither written nor collected under any divine guidance securing them from substantial error and that they contain like all other human writings false statements mixed with true and erring thoughts mixed with just thoughts but that they nevertheless relate on the whole faithfully the dealings of the one god with the first races of man and his dealings with them in aftertime through christ that they record true miracles and bear true witness to the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come  this is a theory held by many of the active leaders of modern thought  4 the fourth and last possible theory is that the mass of religious scripture contains merely the best efforts which we hitherto know to have been made by any of the races of men towards the discovery of some relations with the spiritual world that they are only trustworthy as expressions of the enthusiastic visions or beliefs of earnest men oppressed by the worlds darkness and have no more authoritative claim on our faith than the religious speculations and histories of the egyptians greeks persians and indians but are in common with all these to be reverently studied as containing a portion divinely appointed of the best wisdom which human intellect earnestly seeking for help from god has hitherto been able to gather between birth and death  this has been for the last halfcentury the theory of the soundest scholars and thinkers of europe  36 there is yet indeed one farther condition of incredulity attainable and sorrowfully attained by many men of powerful intellectthe incredulity namely of inspiration in any sense or of help given by any divine power to the thoughts of men but this form of infidelity merely indicates a natural incapacity for receiving certain emotions though many honest and good men belong to this insentient class  37 the educated men therefore who may be seriously appealed to in these days on questions of moral responsibility as modified by scripture are broadly divisible into three classes severally holding the last three theories above stated  now whatever power a passage from the statedly authoritative portions of the bible may have over the mind of a person holding the fourth theory it will have a proportionately greater over that of persons holding the third or the second i therefore always imagine myself speaking to the fourth class of theorists if i can persuade or influence them i am logically sure of the others i say logically for the actual fact strange as it may seem is that no persons are so little likely to submit to a passage of scripture not to their fancy as those who are most positive on the subject of its general inspiration  38 addressing then this fourth class of thinkers i would say to them when asking them to enter on any subject of importance to national morals or conduct this book which has been the accepted guide of the moral intelligence of europe for some fifteen hundred years enforces certain simple laws of human conduct which you know have also been agreed upon in every main point by all the religious and by all the greatest profane writers of every age and country this book primarily forbids pride lasciviousness and covetousness and you know that all great thinkers in every nation of mankind have similarly forbidden these mortal vices this book enjoins truth temperance charity and equity and you know that every great egyptian greek and indian enjoins these also you know besides that through all the mysteries of human fate and history this one great law of fate is written on the walls of cities or in their dust written in letters of light and letters of bloodthat where truth temperance and equity have been preserved all strength and peace and joy have been preserved alsothat where lying lasciviousness and covetousness have been practised there has followed an infallible and for centuries irrecoverable ruin and you know lastly that the observance of this common law of righteousness commending itself to all the pure instincts of men and fruitful in their temporal good is by the religious writers of every nation and chiefly in this venerated scripture of ours connected with some distinct hope of better life and righteousness to come  39 let it not then offend you if deducing principles of action first from the laws and facts of nature i nevertheless fortify them also by appliance of the precepts or suggestive and probable teachings of this book of which the authority is over many around you more distinctly than over you and which confessing to be divine they at least can only disobey at their moral peril  on these grounds and in this temper i am in the habit of appealing to passages of scripture in my writings on political economy and in this temper i will ask you to consider with me some conclusions which appear to me derivable from that text about miriam which haunted me through the jugglery and from certain others     letter ix  the use of music and dancing under the jewish theocracy compared with their use by the modern french                                                      march 10 1867  40 having i hope made you now clearly understand with what feeling i would use the authority of the book which the british public professing to consider sacred have lately adorned for themselves with the work of the boldest violator of the instincts of human honor and decency known yet in arthistory i will pursue by the help of that verse about miriam and some others the subject which occupied my mind at both theaters and to which though in so apparently desultory manner i have been nevertheless very earnestly endeavoring to lead you  41 the going forth of the women of israel after miriam with timbrels and with dances was as you doubtless remember their expression of passionate triumph and thankfulness after the full accomplishment of their deliverance from the egyptians that deliverance had been by the utter death of their enemies and accompanied by stupendous miracle no human creatures could in an hour of triumph be surrounded by circumstances more solemn i am not going to try to excite your feelings about them consider only for yourself what that seeing of the egyptians dead upon the seashore meant to every soul that saw it and then reflect that these intense emotions of mingled horror triumph and gratitude were expressed in the visible presence of the deity by music and dancing if you answer that you do not believe the egyptians so perished or that god ever appeared in a pillar of cloud i reply be it sobelieve or disbelieve as you choosethis is yet assuredly the fact that the author of the poem or fable of the exodus supposed that under such circumstances of divine interposition as he had invented the triumph of the israelitish women would have been and ought to have been under the direction of a prophetess expressed by music and dancing  42 nor was it possible that he should think otherwise at whatever period he wrote both music and dancing being among all great ancient nations an appointed and very principal part of the worship of the gods  and that very theatrical entertainment at which i sate thinking over these things for youthat pantomime which depended throughout for its success on an appeal to the vices of the lower london populace was in itself nothing but a corrupt remnant of the religious ceremonies which guided the most serious faiths of the greek mind and laid the foundation of their gravest moral and didacticmore forcibly so because at the same time dramaticliterature  43 returning to the jewish history you find soon afterwards this enthusiastic religious dance and song employed in their more common and habitual manner in the idolatries under sinai but beautifully again and tenderly after the triumph of jephthah and behold his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances again still more notably at the triumph of david with saul the women came out of all the cities of israel singing and dancing to meet king saul with tabrets with joy and with instruments of music and you have this joyful song and dance of the virgins of israel not only incidentally alluded to in the most solemn passages of hebrew religious poetry as in psalm lxviii 24 25 and psalm cxlix 2 3 but approved and the restoration of it promised as a sign of gods perfect blessing most earnestly by the saddest of the hebrew prophets and in one of the most beautiful of all his sayings  the lord hath appeared of old unto me saying yea i have loved thee with an everlasting love therefore with lovingkindness have i drawn theei will build thee and thou shalt be built o virgin of israel thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets and thou shalt go forth in dances with them that make merry jer xxxi 3 4 and compare v 13 and finally you have in two of quite the most important passages in the whole series of scripture one in the old testament one in the new the rejoicing in the repentance from and remission of sins expressed by means of music and dancing namely in the rapturous dancing of david before the returning ark and in the joy of the fathers household at the repentance of the prodigal son  44 i could put all this much better and more convincingly before you if i were able to take any pains in writing at present but i am not as i told you being weary and ill neither do i much care now to use what in the very truth are but tricks of literary art in dealing with this so grave subject you see i write you my letter straightforward and let you see all my scratchings out and puttings in and if the way i say things shocks you or any other reader of these letters i cannot help it this only i know that what i tell you is true and written more earnestly than anything i ever wrote with my best literary care and that you will find it useful to think upon however it be said now therefore to draw towards our conclusion supposing the bible inspired in any of the senses above defined you have in these passages a positively divine authority for the use of song and dance as a means of religious service and expression of national thanksgiving supposing it not inspired you have taking the passages for as slightly authoritative as you choose record in them nevertheless of a state of mind in a great nation producing the most beautiful religious poetry and perfect moral law hitherto known to us yet only expressible by them to the fulfilment of their joyful passion by means of professional dance and choral song  45 now i want you to contrast this state of religious rapture with some of our modern phases of mind in parallel circumstances you see that the promise of jeremiahs thou shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry is immediately followed by this thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of samaria and again at the yearly feast to the lord in shiloh the dancing of the virgins was in the midst of the vineyards judges xxi 21 the feast of the vintage being in the south as our harvest home in the north a peculiar occasion of joy and thanksgiving i happened to pass the autumn of 1863 in one of the great vine districts of switzerland under the slopes of the outlying branch of the jura which limits the arable plain of the canton zurich some fifteen miles north of zurich itself that city has always been a renowned stronghold of swiss protestantism next in importance only to geneva and its evangelical zeal for the conversion of the catholics of uri and endeavors to bring about that spiritual result by stopping the supplies of salt they needed to make their cheeses with brought on the uri men reading their matt v 13 in a different sense the battle of keppel and the death of the reformer zwinglius the town itself shows the most gratifying signs of progress in all the modern arts and sciences of life it is nearly as black as newcastlehas a railroad station larger than the london terminus of the chatham and doverfouls the stream of the limmat as soon as it issues from the lake so that you might even venture to compare the formerly simple and innocent swiss river i remember it thirty years agoa current of pale green crystal with the highly educated english streams of weare or tyne and finally has as many french prints of dissolute tendency in its principal shop windows as if they had the privilege of opening on the parisian boulevards  46 i was somewhat anxious to see what species of thanksgiving or exultation would be expressed at their vintage by the peasantry in the neighborhood of this much enlightened evangelical and commercial society it consisted in two ceremonies only during the day the servants of the farms where the grapes had been gathered collected in knots about the vineyards and slowly fired horsepistols from morning to evening at night they got drunk and staggered up and down the hill paths uttering at short intervals yells and shrieks differing only from the howling of wild animals by a certain intended and insolent discordance only attainable by the malignity of debased human creatures  47 i must not do the injustice to the zurich peasantry of implying that this manner of festivity is peculiar to them a year before in 1862 i had formed the intention of living some years in the neighborhood of geneva and had established myself experimentally on the eastern slope of the mont salève but i was forced to abandon my purpose at last because i could not endure the rabid howling on sunday evenings of the holidaymakers who came out from geneva to get drunk in the mountain village by the way your last letter with its extracts about our traffic in gin is very valuable i will come to that part of the business in a little while meantime my friend note this respecting what i have told you that in the very center of europe in a country which is visited for their chief pleasure by the most refined and thoughtful persons among all christian nationsa country made by gods hand the most beautiful in the temperate regions of the earth and inhabited by a race once capable of the sternest patriotism and simplest purity of life your modern religion in the very stronghold of it has reduced the song and dance of ancient virginal thanksgiving to the howlings and staggerings of men betraying in intoxication a nature sunk more than halfway towards the beasts and you will begin to understand why the bible should have been illustrated by gustave doré  48 one word more is needful though this letter is long already the peculiar ghastliness of this swiss mode of festivity is in its utter failure of joy the paralysis and helplessness of a vice in which there is neither pleasure nor art but we are not throughout europe wholly thus there is such a thing yet as rapturous song and dance among us though not indicative by any means of joy over repentant sinners you must come back to paris with me again i had an evening to spare there last summer for investigation of theaters and as there was nothing at any of them that i cared much about seeing i asked a valetdeplace at meurices what people were generally going to he said all the english went to see the lanterne magique i do not care to tell you what general entertainment i received in following for once the lead of my countrymen but it closed with the representation of the characteristic dancing of all ages of the world and the dance given as characteristic of modern time was the cancan which you will see alluded to in the extract given in the note at page 80 of sesame and lilies the small edition and page 54 of vol i of the revised series of the entire works the ball terminated with a devilish chain and a cancan of hell at seven in the morning it was led by four principal dancers who have since appeared in london in the huguenot captain and it is many years since i have seen such perfect dancing as far as finish and accuracy of art and fulness of animal power and fire are concerned nothing could be better done in its own evil way the object of the dance throughout being to express in every gesture the wildest fury of insolence and vicious passions possible to human creatures so that you see though for the present we find ourselves utterly incapable of a rapture of gladness or thanksgiving the dance which is presented as characteristic of modern civilization is still rapturous enoughbut it is with rapture of blasphemy     letter x  the meaning and actual operation of satanic or demoniacal influence                                                      march 16 1867  49 you may gather from the facts given you in my last letter that as the expression of true and holy gladness was in old time statedly offered up by men for a part of worship to god their father so the expression of false and unholy gladness is in modern times with as much distinctness and plainness asserted by them openly to be offered to another spirit chain of the devil and cancan of hell being the names assigned to these modern forms of joyous procession  now you know that among the best and wisest of our present religious teachers there is a gradual tendency to disbelieve and to preach their disbelief in the commonly received ideas of the devil and of his place and his work while among some of our equally wellmeaning but far less wise religious teachers there is in consequence a panic spreading in anticipation of the moral dangers which must follow on the loss of the help of the devil one of the last appearances in public of the author of the christian year was at a conclave of clergymen assembled in defense of faith in damnationa the sense of the meeting generally was that there must be such a place as hell because no one would ever behave decently upon earth unless they were kept in wholesome fear of the fires beneath it and mr keble especially insisting on this view related a story of an old woman who had a wicked son and who having lately heard with horror of the teaching of mr maurice and others exclaimed pathetically my son is bad enough as it is and if he were not afraid of hell what would become of him i write from memory and cannot answer for the words but i can for their purport      a physical damnation i should have said it is strange     how seldom pain of heart is spoken of as a possible element     of future or as the worst of present pain  50 now my friend i am afraid that i must incur the charge of such presumption as may be involved in variance from both these systems of teaching  i do not merely believe there is such a place as hell i know there is such a place and i know also that when men have got to the point of believing virtue impossible but through dread of it they have got into it  i mean that according to the distinctness with which they hold such a creed the stain of nether fire has passed upon them in the depth of his heart mr keble could not have entertained the thought for an instant and i believe it was only as a conspicuous sign to the religious world of the state into which they were sinking that this creed possible in its sincerity only to the basest of them was nevertheless appointed to be uttered by the lips of the most tender gracious and beloved of their teachers  51 virtue impossible but for fear of hella lofty creed for your english youthand a holy one and yet my friend there was something of right in the terrors of this clerical conclave for though you should assuredly be able to hold your own in the straight ways of god without always believing that the devil is at your side it is a state of mind much to be dreaded that you should not know the devil when you see him there for the probability is that when you do see him the way you are walking in is not one of gods ways at all but is leading you quite into other neighborhoods than his on his way indeed you may often like albert dürers knight see the fiend behind you but you will find that he drops always farther and farther behind whereas if he jogs with you at your side it is probably one of his own bypaths you are got on and in any case it is a highly desirable matter that you should know him when you set eyes on him which we are very far from doing in these days having convinced ourselves that the graminivorous form of him with horn and tail is extant no longer but in fearful truth the presence and power of him is here in the world with us and within us mock as you may and the fight with him for the time sore and widely unprosperous  do not think i am speaking metaphorically or rhetorically or with any other than literal and earnest meaning of words hear me i pray you therefore for a little while as earnestly as i speak  52 every faculty of mans soul and every instinct of it by which he is meant to live is exposed to its own special form of corruption and whether within man or in the external world there is a power or condition of temptation which is perpetually endeavoring to reduce every glory of his soul and every power of his life to such corruption as is possible to them and the more beautiful they are the more fearful is the death which is attached as a penalty to their degradation  53 take for instance that which in its purity is the source of the highest and purest mortal happinesslove think of it first at its highestas it may exist in the disciplined spirit of a perfect human creature as it has so existed again and again and does always wherever it truly exists at all as the purifying passion of the soul i will not speak of the transcendental and imaginative intensity in which it may reign in noble hearts as when it inspired the greatest religious poem yet given to men but take it in its true and quiet purity in any simple lovers heartas you have it expressed for instance thus exquisitely in the angel in the house    and there with many a blissful tear   i vowed to love and prayed to wed   the maiden who had grown so dear   thanked god who had set her in my path   and promised as i hoped to win   i never would sully my faith   by the least selfishness or sin   whatever in her sight id seem   id really be i neer would blend   with my delight in her a dream   twould change her cheek to comprehend   and if she wished it would prefer   anothers to my own success   and always seek the best for her   with unofficious tenderness  take this for the pure type of it in its simplicity and then think of what corruption this passion is capable i will give you a type of that also and at your very doors i cannot refer you to the time when the crime happened but it was some four or five years ago near newcastle and it has remained always as a ghastly landmark in my mind owing to the horror of the external circumstances the body of the murdered woman was found naked rolled into a heap of ashes at the mouth of one of your pits  54 you have thus two limiting examples of the pure passion and of its corruption now whatever influence it is without or within us which has a tendency to degrade the one towards the other is literally and accurately satanic and this treacherous or deceiving spirit is perpetually at work so that all the worst evil among us is a betrayed or corrupted good take religion itself the desire of finding out god and placing ones self in some true sons or servants relation to him the devil that is to say the deceiving spirit within us or outside of us mixes up our own vanity with this desire makes us think that in our love to god we have established some connection with him which separates us from our fellowmen and renders us superior to them then it takes but one wave of the devils hand and we are burning them alive for taking the liberty of contradicting us  55 take the desire of teachingthe entirely unselfish and noble instinct for telling to those who are ignorant the truth we know and guarding them from the errors we see them in danger ofthere is no nobler no more constant instinct in honorable breasts but let the devil formalize it and mix the pride of a profession with itget foolish people entrusted with the business of instruction and make their giddy heads giddier by putting them up in pulpits above a submissive crowdand you have it instantly corrupted into its own reverse you have an alliance against the light shrieking at the sun and the moon and stars as profane spectraa company of the blind beseeching those they lead to remain blind also the heavens and the lights that rule them are untrue the laws of creation are treacherous the poles of the earth are out of poise but we are true light is in us only shut your eyes close and fast and we will lead you  56 take the desire and faith of mutual help the virtue of vowed brotherhood for the accomplishment of common purpose without which nothing great can be wrought by multitudinous bands of men let the devil put pride of caste into it and you have a military organization applied for a thousand years to maintain that higher caste in idleness by robbing the laboring poor let the devil put a few small personal interests into it and you have all faithful deliberation on national law rendered impossible in the parliaments of europe by the antagonism of parties  57 take the instinct for justice and the natural sense of indignation against crime let the devil color it with personal passion and you have a mighty race of true and tenderhearted men living for centuries in such bloody feud that every note and word of their national songs is a dirge and every rock of their hills is a gravestone take the love of beauty and power of imagination which are the source of every true achievement in art let the devil touch them with sensuality and they are stronger than the sword or the flame to blast the cities where they were born into ruin without hope take the instinct of industry and ardor of commerce which are meant to be the support and mutual maintenance of man let the devil touch them with avarice and you shall see the avenues of the exchange choked with corpses that have died of famine  58 now observei leave you to call this deceiving spirit what you likeor to theorize about it as you like all that i desire you to recognize is the fact of its being here and the need of its being fought with if you take the bibles account of it or dantes or miltons you will receive the image of it as a mighty spiritual creature commanding others and resisted by others if you take Æschyluss or hesiods account of it you will hold it for a partly elementary and unconscious adversity of fate and partly for a group of monstrous spiritual agencies connected with death and begotten out of the dust if you take a modern rationalists you will accept it for a mere treachery and want of vitality in our own moral nature exposing it to loathsomeness or moral disease as the body is capable of mortification or leprosy i do not care what you call itwhose history you believe of itnor what you yourself can imagine about it the origin or nature or name may be as you will but the deadly reality of the thing is with us and warring against us and on our true war with it depends whatever life we can win deadly reality i say the puffadder or horned asp is not more real unbelievablethoseunless you had seen them no fable could have been coined out of any human brain so dreadful within its own poor material sphere as that bluelipped serpentworking its way sidelong in the sand as real but with sting of eternal deaththis worm that dies not and fire that is not quenched within our souls or around them eternal death i saysure that whatever creed you holdif the old scriptural one death of perpetual banishment from before gods face if the modern rationalist one death eternal for us instant and unredeemable ending of lives wasted in misery  this is what this unquestionably presentthis according to his power omnipresentfiend brings us towards daily he is the person to be voted against my working friend it is worth something having a vote against him if you can get it which you can indeed but not by gift from cabinet ministers you must work warily with your own hands and drop sweat of hearts blood before you can record that vote effectually  of which more in next letter     letter xi  the satanic power is mainly twofold the power of causing falsehood and the power of causing pain the resistance is by law of honor and law of delight                                                      march 19 1857  59 you may perhaps have thought my last three or four letters mere rhapsodies they are nothing of the kind they are accurate accounts of literal facts which we have to deal with daily this thing or power opposed to gods power and specifically called mammon in the sermon on the mount is in deed and in truth a continually present and active enemy properly called archenemy that is to say beginning and prince of enemies and daily we have to record our vote for or against him of the manner of which record we were next to consider  60 this enemy is always recognizable briefly in two functions he is preeminently the lord of lies and the lord of pain wherever lies are he is wherever pain is he has beenso that of the spirit of wisdom who is called gods helper as satan his adversary it is written not only that by her kings reign and princes decree justice but also that her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths peace  therefore you will succeed you working men in recording your votes against this archenemy precisely in the degree in which you can do away with falsehood and pain in your work and lives and bring truth into the one and pleasure into the other all education being directed to make yourselves and your children capable of honesty and capable of delight and to rescue yourselves from iniquity and agony and this is what i meant by saying in the preface to unto this last that the central requirement of education consisted in giving habits of gentleness and justice gentleness as i will show you presently being the best single word i could have used to express the capacity for giving and receiving true pleasure and justice being similarly the most comprehensive word for all kind of honest dealing  61 now i began these letters with the purpose of explaining the nature of the requirements of justice first and then those of gentleness but i allowed myself to be led into that talk about the theaters not only because the thoughts could be more easily written as they came but also because i was able thus to illustrate for you more directly the nature of the enemy we have to deal with you do not perhaps know though i say this diffidently for i often find working men know many things which one would have thought were out of their way that music was among the greeks quite the first means of education and that it was so connected with their system of ethics and of intellectual training that the god of music is with them also the god of righteousnessthe god who purges and avenges iniquity and contends with their satan as represented under the form of python the corrupter and the greeks were incontrovertibly right in this music is the nearest at hand the most orderly the most delicate and the most perfect of all bodily pleasures it is also the only one which is equally helpful to all the ages of manhelpful from the nurses song to her infant to the music unheard of others which so often haunts the deathbed of pure and innocent spirits and the action of the deceiving or devilish power is in nothing shown quite so distinctly among us at this daynot even in our commercial dishonesties nor in our social crueltiesas in its having been able to take away music as an instrument of education altogether and to enlist it almost wholly in the service of superstition on the one hand and of sensuality on the other  62 this power of the muses then and its proper influence over you workmen i shall eventually have much to insist upon with you and in doing so i shall take that beautiful parable of the prodigal son which i have already referred to and explain as far as i know the significance of it and then i will take the three means of festivity or wholesome human joy therein statedfine dress rich food and musicbring forth the fairest robe for himbring forth the fatted calf and kill it as he drew nigh he heard music and dancing and i will show you how all these three things fine dress rich food and music including ultimately all the other arts are meant to be sources of life and means of moral discipline to all men and how they have all three been made by the devil the means of guilt dissoluteness and deatha but first i must return to my original plan of these letters and endeavor to set down for you some of the laws which in a true working mens parliament must be ordained in defense of honesty      a see fors clavigera letter xxiv  of which laws preliminary to all others and necessary above all others having now somewhat got my raveled threads together again i will begin talk in my next letter     letter xii  the necessity of imperative law to the prosperity of states                                                      march 20 1867  63 i have your most interesting lettera which i keep for reference when i come to the consideration of its subject in its proper place under the head of the abuse of food i do not wonder that your life should be rendered unhappy by the scenes of drunkenness which you are so often compelled to witness nor that this so gigantic and infectious evil should seem to you the root of the greater part of the misery of our lower orders i do not wonder that george cruikshank has warped the entire current of his thoughts and life at once to my admiration and my sorrow from their natural field of work that he might spend them in struggle with this fiend for the poor lowest people whom he knows so well i wholly sympathize with you in indignation at the methods of temptation employed and at the use of the fortunes made by the vendors of death and whatever immediately applicable legal means there might be of restricting the causes of drunkenness i should without hesitation desire to bring into operation but all such appliance i consider temporary and provisionary nor while there is record of the miracle at cana not to speak of the sacrament can i conceive it possible without logically the denial of the entire truth of the new testament to reprobate the use of wine as a stimulus to the powers of life supposing we did deny the words and deeds of the founder of christianity the authority of the wisest heathens especially that of plato in the laws is wholly against abstinence from wine and much as i can believe and as i have been endeavoring to make you believe also of the subtlety of the devil i do not suppose the vine to have been one of his inventions of this however more in another place by the way was it not curious that in the manchester examiner in which that letter of mine on the abuse of dancing appeared there chanced to be in the next column a paragraph giving an account of a girl stabbing her betrayer in a ballroom and another paragraph describing a parisian character which gives exactly the extreme type i wanted for example of the abuse of foodb      a appendix 4      b appendix 5  64 i return however now to the examination of possible means for the enforcement of justice in temper and in act as the first of political requirements and as in stating my conviction of the necessity of certain stringent laws on this matter i shall be in direct opposition to mr stuart mill and more or less in opposition to other professors of modern political economy as well as to many honest and active promoters of the privileges of working men as if privilege only were wanted and never restraint i will give you as briefly as i can the grounds on which i am prepared to justify such opposition  65 when the crew of a wrecked ship escape in an open boat and the boat is crowded the provisions scanty and the prospect of making land distant laws are instantly established and enforced which no one thinks of disobeying an entire equality of claim to the provisions is acknowledged without dispute and an equal liability to necessary labor no man who can row is allowed to refuse his oar no man however much money he may have saved in his pocket is allowed so much as half a biscuit beyond his proper ration any riotous person who endangered the safety of the rest would be bound and laid in the bottom of the boat without the smallest compunction for such violation of the principles of individual liberty and on the other hand any child or woman or aged person who was helpless and exposed to great danger and suffering by their weakness would receive more than ordinary care and indulgence not unaccompanied with unanimous selfsacrifice on the part of the laboring crew  there is never any question under circumstances like these of what is right and wrong worthy and unworthy wise or foolish if there be any question there is little hope for boat or crew the right man is put at the helm every available hand is set to the oars the sick are tended and the vicious restrained at once and decisively or if not the end is near  66 now the circumstances of every associated group of human society contending bravely for national honors and felicity of life differ only from those thus supposed in the greater instead of less necessity for the establishment of restraining law there is no point of difference in the difficulties to be met nor in the rights reciprocally to be exercised vice and indolence are not less but more injurious in a nation than in a boats company the modes in which they affect the interests of worthy persons being far more complex and more easily concealed the right of restraint vested in those who labor over those who would impede their labor is as absolute in the large as in the small society the equal claim to share in whatever is necessary to the common life or commonwealth is as indefeasible the claim of the sick and helpless to be cared for by the strong with earnest selfsacrifice is as pitiful and as imperative the necessity that the governing authority should be in the hands of a true and trained pilot is as clear and as constant in none of these conditions is there any difference between a nation and a boats company the only difference is in this that the impossibility of discerning the effects of individual error and crime or of counteracting them by individual effort in the affairs of a great nation renders it tenfold more necessary than in a small society that direction by law should be sternly established assume that your boats crew is disorderly and licentious and will by agreement submit to no orderthe most troublesome of them will yet be easily discerned and the chance is that the best man among them knocks him down common instinct of selfpreservation will make the rioters put a good sailor at the helm and impulsive pity and occasional help will be by heart and hand here and there given to visible distress not so in the ship of the realm the most troublesome persons in it are usually the least recognized for such and the most active in its management the best men mind their own business patiently and are never thought of the good helmsman never touches the tiller but in the last extremity and the worst forms of misery are hidden not only from every eye but from every thought on the deck the aspect is of cleopatras galleyunder hatches there is a slave hospital while finally and this is the most fatal difference of all even the few persons who care to interfere energetically with purpose of doing good can in a large society discern so little of the real state of evil to be dealt with and judge so little of the best means of dealing with it that half of their best efforts will be misdirected and some may even do more harm than good whereas it is the sorrowful law of this universe that evil even unconscious and unintended never fails of its effect and in a state where the evil and the good under conditions of individual liberty are allowed to contend together not only every stroke on the devils side tellsbut every slip the mistakes of wicked men being as mischievous as their successes while on the side of right there will be much direct and fatal defeat and even of its measure of victory half will be fruitless  67 it is true of course that in the end of ends nothing but the right conquers the prevalent thorns of wrong at last crackle away in indiscriminate flame and of the good seed sown one grain in a thousand some day comes upand somebody lives by it but most of our great teachers not excepting carlyle and emerson themselves are a little too encouraging in their proclamation of this comfort not to my mind very sufficient when for the present our fields are full of nothing but darnel instead of wheat and cockle instead of barley and none of them seem to me yet to have enough insisted on the inevitable power and infectiousness of all evil and the easy and utter extinguishableness of good medicine often fails of its effectbut poison never and while in summing the observation of past life not unwatchfully spent i can truly say that i have a thousand times seen patience disappointed of her hope and wisdom of her aim i have never yet seen folly fruitless of mischief nor vice conclude but in calamity  68 there is however one important condition in national economy in which the analogy of that of a ships company is incomplete namely that while labor at oar or sail is necessarily united and can attain no independent good or personal profit the labor properly undertaken by the several members of a political community is necessarily and justly within certain limits independent and obtains for them independent advantage of which if you will glance at the last paragraph of the first chapter of munera pulveris you will see i should be the last person to propose depriving them this great difference in final condition involves necessarily much complexity in the system and application of general laws but it in no wise abrogateson the contrary it renders yet more imperativethe necessity for the firm ordinance of such laws which marking the due limits of independent agency may enable it to exist in full energy not only without becoming injurious but so as more variously and perfectly to promote the entire interests of the commonwealth  i will address myself therefore in my next letter to the statement of some of these necessary laws     letter xiii  the proper offices of the bishop and duke or overseer and leader                                                      march 21 1867  69 i see by your last letter for which i heartily thank you that you would not sympathize with me in my sorrow for the desertion of his own work by george cruikshank that he may fight in the front of the temperance ranks but you do not know what work he has left undone nor how much richer inheritance you might have received from his hand it was no more his business to etch diagrams of drunkenness than it is mine at this moment to be writing these letters against anarchy it is the first mild day of march high time i think that it should be and by rights i ought to be out among the budding banks and hedges outlining sprays of hawthorn and clusters of primrose that is my right work and it is not in the inner gist and truth of it right nor good for you or for anybody else that cruikshank with his great gift and i with my weak but yet thoroughly clear and definite one should both of us be tormented by agony of indignation and compassion till we are forced to give up our peace and pleasure and power and rush down into the streets and lanes of the city to do the little that is in the strength of our single hands against their uncleanliness and iniquity but as in a sorely besieged town every man must to the ramparts whatsoever business he leaves so neither he nor i have had any choice but to leave our household stuff and go on crusade such as we are called to not that i mean if fate may be anywise resisted to give up the strength of my life as he has given his for i think he was wrong in doing so and that he should only have carried the fiery cross his appointed leagues and then given it to another hand and for my own part i mean these very letters to close my political work for many a day and i write them not in any hope of their being at present listened to but to disburthen my heart of the witness i have to bear that i may be free to go back to my garden lawns and paint birds and flowers there  70 for these same statutes which we are to consider today have indeed been in my mind now these fourteen years ever since i wrote the last volume of the stones of venice in which you will find in the long note on modern education most of what i have been now in detail writing to you hinted in abstract and at the close of it this sentence of which i solemnly now avouch in thankfulness that i was permitted to write it every word finally i hold it for indisputable that the first duty of a state is to see that every child born therein shall be well housed clothed fed and educated till it attain years of discretion but in order to the effecting this the government must have an authority over the people of which we now do not so much as dream  that authority i did not then endeavor to define for i knew all such assertions would be useless and that the necessarily resultant outcry would merely diminish my influence in other directions but now i do not care about influence any more it being only my concern to say truly that which i know and if it may be get some quiet life yet among the fields in the evening shadow  71 there is i suppose no word which men are prouder of the right to attach to their names or more envious of others who bear it when they themselves may not than the word noble do you know what it originally meant and always in the right use of it means it means a known person one who has risen far enough above others to draw mens eyes to him and to be known honorably for such and such an one ignoble on the other hand is derived from the same root as the word ignorance it means an unknown inglorious person and no more singular follies have been committed by weak human creatures than those which have been caused by the instinct pure and simple of escaping from this obscurity instinct which corrupted will hesitate at no means good or evil of satisfying itself with notorietyinstinct nevertheless which like all other natural ones has a true and pure purpose and ought always in a worthy way to be satisfied  all men ought to be in this sense noble known of each other and desiring to be known and the first law which a nation desiring to conquer all the devices of the father of lies should establish among its people is that they shall be so known  72 will you please now read § 22 of sesame and lilies the reviewers in the ecclesiastical journals laughed at it as a rhapsody when the book came out none having the slightest notion of what i meant nor indeed do i well see how it could be otherwise nevertheless i meant precisely and literally what is there said namely that a bishops duty being to watch over the souls of his people and give account of every one of them it becomes practically necessary for him first to get some account of their bodies which he was wont to do in the early days of christianity by help of a person called deacon or ministering servant whose name is still retained among preliminary ecclesiastical dignities vainly enough putting however all questions of forms and names aside the thing actually needing to be done is thisthat over every hundred more or less of the families composing a christian state there should be appointed an overseer or bishop to render account to the state of the life of every individual in those families and to have care both of their interest and conduct to such an extent as they may be willing to admit or as their faults may justify so that it may be impossible for any person however humble to suffer from unknown want or live in unrecognized crimesuch help and observance being rendered without officiousness either of interference or inquisition the limits of both being determined by national law but with the patient and gentle watchfulness which true christian pastors now exercise over their flocks only with a higher legal authority presently to be defined of interference on due occasion  and with this farther function that such overseers shall be not only the pastors but the biographers of their people a written statement of the principal events in the life of each family being annually required to be rendered by them to a superior state officer these records laid up in public offices would soon furnish indications of the families whom it would be advantageous to the nation to advance in position or distinguish with honor and aid by such reward as it should be the object of every government to distribute no less punctually and far more frankly than it distributes punishment compare munera pulveris essay iv in paragraph on critic law while the mere fact of permanent record being kept of every event of importance whether disgraceful or worthy of praise in each family would of itself be a deterrent from crime and a stimulant to welldeserving conduct far beyond mere punishment or reward  73 nor need you think that there would be anything in such a system unenglish or tending to espionage no uninvited visits should ever be made in any house unless law had been violated nothing recorded against its will of any family but what was inevitably known of its publicly visible conduct and the results of that conduct what else was written should be only by the desire and from the communications of its head and in a little while it would come to be felt that the true history of a nation was indeed not of its wars but of its households and the desire of men would rather be to obtain some conspicuous place in these honorable annals than to shrink behind closed shutters from public sight until at last george herberts grand word of command would hold not only on the conscience but the actual system and outer economy of life    think the king sees thee still for his king does  74 secondly above these bishops or pastors who are only to be occupied in offices of familiar supervision and help should be appointed higher officers of state having executive authority over as large districts as might be conveniently according to the number and circumstances of their inhabitants committed to their care officers who according to the reports of the pastors should enforce or mitigate the operation of too rigid general law and determine measures exceptionally necessary for public advantage for instance the general law being that all children of the operative classes at a certain age should be sent to public schools these superior officers should have power on the report of the pastors to dispense with the attendance of children who had sick parents to take charge of or whose homelife seemed to be one of better advantage for them than that of the common schools or who for any other like cause might justifiably claim remission and it being the general law that the entire body of the public should contribute to the cost and divide the profits of all necessary public works and undertakings as roads mines harbor protections and the like and that nothing of this kind should be permitted to be in the hands of private speculators it should be the duty of the district officer to collect whatever information was accessible respecting such sources of public profit and to represent the circumstances in parliament and then with parliamentary authority but on his own sole personal responsibility to see that such enterprises were conducted honestly and with due energy and order  the appointment to both these offices should be by election and for life by what forms of election shall be matter of inquiry after we have determined some others of the necessary constitutional laws  75 i do not doubt but that you are already beginning to think it was with good reason i held my peace these fourteen yearsand that for any good likely to be done by speaking i might as well have held it altogether  it may be so but merely to complete and explain my own work it is necessary that i should say these things finally and i believe that the imminent danger to which we are now in england exposed by the gradually accelerated fall of our aristocracy wholly their own fault and the substitution of moneypower for their martial one and by the correspondingly imminent prevalence of mob violence here as in america together with the continually increasing chances of insane war founded on popular passion whether of pride fear or acquisitivenessall these dangers being further darkened and degraded by the monstrous forms of vice and selfishness which the appliances of recent wealth and of vulgar mechanical art make possible to the millionwill soon bring us into a condition in which men will be glad to listen to almost any words but those of a demagogue and to seek any means of safety rather than those in which they have lately trusted so with your good leave i will say my say to the end mock at it who may  psi take due note of the regulations of trade proposed in your letter just receivedaall excellent i shall come to them presently cash payment above all you may write that on your tradebanners in letters of gold wherever you would have them raised victoriously      a appendix 6     letter xiv  the first group of essential lawsagainst theft by false work and by bankruptcynecessary publicity of accounts                                                      march 26 1867  76 i feel much inclined to pause at this point to answer the kind of questions and objections which i know must be rising in your mind respecting the authority supposed to be lodged in the persons of the officers just specified but i can neither define nor justify to you the powers i would desire to see given to them till i state to you the kind of laws they would have to enforce of which the first group should be directed to the prevention of all kinds of thieving but chiefly of the occult and polite methods of it and of all occult methods chiefly the making and selling of bad goods no form of theft is so criminal as thisnone so deadly to the state if you break into a mans house and steal a hundred pounds worth of plate he knows his loss and there is an end besides that you take your risk of punishment for your gain like a man and if you do it bravely and openly and habitually live by such inroad you may retain nearly every moral and manly virtue and become a heroic rider and reiver and hero of song but if you swindle me out of twenty shillings worth of quality on each of a hundred bargains i lose my hundred pounds all the same and i get a hundred untrustworthy articles besides which will fail me and injure me in all manner of ways when i least expect it and you having done your thieving basely are corrupted by the guilt of it to the very hearts core  77 this is the first thing therefore which your general laws must be set to punish fiercely immitigably to the utter prevention and extinction of it or there is no hope for you no religion that ever was preached on this earth of gods rounding ever proclaimed any salvation to sellers of bad goods if the ghost that is in you whatever the essence of it leaves your hand a jugglers and your heart a cheats it is not a holy ghost be assured of that and for the rest all political economy as well as all higher virtue depends first on sound work  let your laws then i say in the beginning be set to secure this you cannot make punishment too stern for subtle knavery keep no truce with this enemy whatever pardon you extend to more generous ones for light weights and false measures or for proved adulteration or dishonest manufacture of article the penalty should be simply confiscation of goods and sending out of the country the kind of person who desires prosperity by such practices could not be made to emigrate too speedily what to do with him in the place you appoint to be blessed by his presence we will in time consider  78 under such penalty however and yet more under the pressure of such a right public opinion as could pronounce and enforce such penalty i imagine that sham articles would become speedily as rare as sound ones are now the chief difficulty in the matter would be to fix your standard this would have to be done by the guild of every trade in its own manner and within certain easily recognizable limits and this fixing of standard would necessitate much simplicity in the forms and kinds of articles sold you could only warrant a certain kind of glazing or painting in china a certain quality of leather or cloth bricks of a certain clay loaves of a defined mixture of meal advisable improvements or varieties in manufacture would have to be examined and accepted by the trade guild when so accepted they would be announced in public reports and all puffery and selfproclamation on the part of tradesmen absolutely forbidden as much as the making of any other kind of noise or disturbance  79 but observe this law is only to have force over tradesmen whom i suppose to have joined voluntarily in carrying out a better system of commerce outside of their guild they would have to leave the rogue to puff and cheat as he chose and the public to be gulled as they chose all that is necessary is that the said public should clearly know the shops in which they could get warranted articles and as clearly those in which they bought at their own risk  and the abovenamed penalty of confiscation of goods should of course be enforced only against dishonest members of the trade guild if people chose to buy of those who had openly refused to join an honest society they should be permitted to do so at their pleasure and peril and this for two reasonsthe first that it is always necessary in enacting strict law to leave some safety valve for outlet of irrepressible vice nearly all the stern lawgivers of old time erred by oversight in this so that the morbid elements of the state which it should be allowed to get rid of in a cutaneous and openly curable manner were thrown inwards and corrupted its constitution and broke all downthe second that operations of trade and manufacture conducted under and guarded by severe law ought always to be subject to the stimulus of such erratic external ingenuity as cannot be tested by law or would be hindered from its full exercise by the dread of it not to speak of the farther need of extending all possible indulgence to foreign traders who might wish to exercise their industries here without liability to the surveillance of our trade guilds  80 farther while for all articles warranted by the guild as above supposed the prices should be annually fixed for the trade throughout the kingdom and the producing workmans wages fixed so as to define the masters profits within limits admitting only such variation as the nature of the given article of sale rendered inevitableyet in the production of other classes of articles whether by skill of applied handicraft or fineness of material above the standard of the guild attaining necessarily values above its assigned prices every firm should be left free to make its own independent efforts and arrangements with its workmen subject always to the same penalty if it could be proved to have consistently described or offered anything to the public for what it was not and finally the state of the affairs of every firm should be annually reported to the guild and its books laid open to inspection for guidance in the regulation of prices in the subsequent year and any firm whose liabilities exceeded its assets by a hundred pounds should be forthwith declared bankrupt and i will anticipate what i have to say in succeeding letters so far as to tell you that i would have this condition extend to every firm in the country large or small and of whatever rank in business and thus you perceive my friend i shall not have to trouble you or myself much with deliberations respecting commercial panics nor to propose legislative cures for them by any laxatives or purgatives of paper currency or any other change of pecuniary diet     letter xv  the nature of theft by unjust profitscrime can finally be arrested only by education                                                          29th march  81 the first methods of polite robbery by dishonest manufacture and by debt of which we have been hitherto speaking are easily enough to be dealt with and ended when once men have a mind to end them but the third method of polite robbery by dishonest acquisition has many branches and is involved among honest arts of acquisition so that it is difficult to repress the one without restraining the other  observe first large fortunes cannot honestly be made by the work of any one mans hands or head if his work benefits multitudes and involves position of high trust it may be i do not say that it is expedient to reward him with great wealth or estate but fortune of this kind is freely given in gratitude for benefit not as repayment for labor also men of peculiar genius in any art if the public can enjoy the product of their genius may set it at almost any price they choose but this i will show you when i come to speak of art is unlawful on their part and ruinous to their own powers genius must not be sold the sale of it involves in a transcendental but perfectly true sense the guilt both of simony and prostitution your labor only may be sold your soul must not  82 now by fair pay for fair labor according to the rank of it a man can obtain means of comfortable or if he needs it refined life but he cannot obtain large fortune such fortunes as are now the prizes of commerce can be made only in one of three ways  1 by obtaining command over the labor of multitudes of other men and taxing it for our own profit  2 by treasuretroveas of mines useful vegetable products and the likein circumstances putting them under our own exclusive control  3 by speculation commercial gambling  the first two of these means of obtaining riches are in some forms and within certain limits lawful and advantageous to the state the third is entirely detrimental to it for in all cases of profit derived from speculation at best what one man gains another loses and the net results to the state is zero pecuniarily with the loss of the time and ingenuity spent in the transaction besides the disadvantage involved in the discouragement of the losing party and the corrupted moral natures of both this is the result of speculation at its best at its worst not only b loses what a gains having taken his fair risk of such loss for his fair chance of gain but c and d who never had any chance at all are drawn in by bs fall and the final result is that a sets up his carriage on the collected sum which was once the means of living to a dozen families  83 nor is this all for while real commerce is founded on real necessities or uses and limited by these speculation of which the object is merely gain seeks to excite imaginary necessities and popular desires in order to gather its temporary profit from the supply of them so that not only the persons who lend their money to it will be finally robbed but the work done with their money will be for the most part useless and thus the entire body of the public injured as well as the persons concerned in the transaction take for instance the architectural decorations of railways throughout the kingdomrepresenting many millions of money for which no farthing of dividend can ever be forthcoming the public will not be induced to pay the smallest fraction of higher fare to rochester or dover because the ironwork of the bridge which carries them over the thames is covered with floral cockades and the piers of it edged with ornamental cornices all that work is simply put there by the builders that they may put the percentage upon it into their own pockets and the rest of the money being thrown into that floral form there is an end of it as far as the shareholders are concerned millions upon millions have thus been spent within the last twenty years on ornamental arrangements of zigzag bricks black and blue tiles castiron foliage and the like of which millions as i said not a penny can ever return into the shareholders pockets nor contribute to public speed or safety on the line it is all sunk forever in ornamental architecture and trust me for this all that architecture is bad as such it had incomparably better not have been built its only result will be to corrupt what capacity of taste or right pleasure in such work we have yet left to us and consider a little what other kind of result than that might have been attained if all those millions had been spent usefully say in buying land for the people or building good houses for them or if it had been imperatively required to be spent decoratively in laying out gardens and parks for themor buying noble works of art for their permanent possessionor best of all establishing frequent public schools and libraries count what those lost millions would have so accomplished for you but you left the affair to supply and demand and the british public had not brains enough to demand land or lodging or books it demanded castiron cockades and zigzag cornices and is supplied with them to its beatitude for evermore  84 now the theft we first spoke of by falsity of workmanship or material is indeed so far worse than these thefts by dishonest acquisition that there is no possible excuse for it on the ground of selfdeception while many speculative thefts are committed by persons who really mean to do no harm but think the system on the whole a fair one and do the best they can in it for themselves but in the real fact of the crime when consciously committed in the numbers reached by its injury in the degree of suffering it causes to those whom it ruins in the baseness of its calculated betrayal of implicit trust in the yet more perfect vileness of the obtaining such trust by misrepresentation only that it may be betrayed and in the impossibility that the crime should be at all committed except by persons of good position and large knowledge of the worldwhat manner of theft is so wholly unpardonable so inhuman so contrary to every law and instinct which binds or animates society  and then consider farther how many of the carriages that glitter in our streets are driven and how many of the stately houses that gleam among our english fields are inhabited by this kind of thief  85 i happened to be reading this morning 29th march some portions of the lent services and i came to a pause over the familiar words and with him they crucified two thieves have you ever considered i speak to you now as a professing christian why in the accomplishment of the numbering among transgressors the transgressors chosen should have been especially thievesnot murderers nor as far as we know sinners by any gross violence do you observe how the sin of theft is again and again indicated as the chiefly antagonistic one to the law of christ this he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the bag of judas and again though barabbas was a leader of sedition and a murderer besidesthat the popular election might be in all respects perfectyet st john in curt and conclusive account of him fastens again on the theft then cried they all again saying not this man but barabbas now barabbas was a robber i believe myself the reason to be that theft is indeed in its subtle forms the most complete and excuseless of human crimes sins of violence usually are committed under sudden or oppressive temptation they may be the madness of moments or they may be apparently the only means of extrication from calamity in other cases they are the diseased acts or habits of lower and brutified naturesa but theft involving deliberative intellect and absence of passion is the purest type of wilful iniquity in persons capable of doing right which being so it seems to be fast becoming the practice of modern society to crucify its christ indeed as willingly as ever in the persons of his poor but by no means now to crucify its thieves beside him it elevates its thieves after another fashion sets them upon a hill that their light may shine before men and that all may see their good works and glorify their father inthe opposite of heaven      a see the analysis of the moral system of dante respecting     punishment given in fors clavigera letter xxiii  86 i think your trade parliament will have to put an end to this kind of business somehow but it cannot be done by laws merely where the interests and circumstances are so extended and complex nay even as regards lower and more defined crimes the assigned punishment is not to be thought of as a preventive means but only as the seal of opinion set by society on the fact crime cannot be hindered by punishment it will always find some shape and outlet unpunishable or unclosed crime can only be truly hindered by letting no man grow up a criminalby taking away the will to commit sin not by mere punishment of its commission crime small and great can only be truly stayed by educationnot the education of the intellect only which is on some men wasted and for others mischievous but education of the heart which is alike good and necessary for all so on this matter i will try in my next letter to say one or two things of which the silence has kept my own heart heavy this many a day     letter xvi  of public education irrespective of classdistinction it consists essentially in giving habits of mercy and habits of truth gentlenessa and justice                                                    march 30th 1867  87 thank you for sending me the pamphlet containing the account of the meeting of clergy and workmen and of the reasonings which there took place i cannot promise you that i shall read much of them for the question to my mind most requiring discussion and explanation is not why workmen dont go to church butwhy other people do however this i know that if among our many spiritual teachers there are indeed any who heartily and literally believe that the wisdom they have to teach is more precious than rubies and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her and if so believing they will further dare to affront their congregations by the assertion and plainly tell them they are not to hunt for rubies or gold any more at their peril till they have gained that which cannot be gotten for gold nor silver weighed for the price thereofsuch believers so preaching and refusing to preach otherwise till they are in that attended to will never want congregations both of working men and every other kind of men      a mercy in its full sense means delight in perceiving     nobleness or in doing kindness compare § 50  88 did you ever hear of anything else so illnamed as the phantom called the philosophers stone a talisman that shall turn base metal into precious metal nature acknowledges not nor would any but fools seek after it but a talisman to turn base souls into noble souls nature has given us and that is a philosophers stone indeed but it is a stone which the builders refuse  89 if there were two valleys in california or australia with two different kinds of gravel in the bottom of them and in the one stream bed you could dig up occasionally and by good fortune nuggets of gold and in the other stream bed certainly and without hazard you could dig up little caskets containing talismans which gave length of days and peace and alabaster vases of precious balms which were better than the arabian dervishs ointment and made not only the eyes to see but the mind to know whatever it wouldi wonder in which of the stream beds there would be most diggers  90 time is moneyso say your practised merchants and economists none of them however i fancy as they draw towards death find that the reverse is true and that money is time perhaps it might be better for them in the end if they did not turn so much of their time into money lest perchance they also turn eternity into it there are other things however which in the same sense are money or can be changed into it as well as time health is money wit is money knowledge is money and all your health and wit and knowledge may be changed for gold and the happy goal so reached of a sick insane and blind auriferous old age but the gold cannot be changed in its turn back into health and wit  91 time is money the words tingle in my ears so that i cant go on writing is it nothing better then if we could thoroughly understand that time wasitselfwould it not be more to the purpose a thing of which loss or gain was absolute loss and perfect gain and that it was expedient also to buy health and knowledge with money if so purchasable but not to buy money with them  and purchasable they are at the beginning of life though not at its close purchasable always for others if not for ourselves you can buy and cheaply life endless life according to your christians creedtheres a bargain for you butlong years of knowledge and peace and power and happiness of lovethese assuredly and irrespectively of any creed or questionfor all those desolate and haggard children about your streets  92 that is not political economy however pardon me the allcomfortable saying what he layeth out it shall be paid him again is quite literally true in matters of education no money seed can be sown with so sure and large return at harvesttime as that only of this moneyseed more than of fleshseed it is utterly true that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die you must forget your money and every other material interest and educate for educations sake only or the very good you try to bestow will become venomous and that and your money will be lost together  93 and this has been the real cause of failure in our efforts for education hithertowhether from above or below there is no honest desire for the thing itself the cry for it among the lower orders is because they think that when once they have got it they must become upper orders there is a strange notion in the mobs mind nowadays including all our popular economists and educators as we most justly may under that brief term mob that everybody can be uppermost or at least that a state of general scramble in which everybody in his turn should come to the top is a proper utopian constitution and that once give every lad a good education and he cannot but come to ride in his carriage the methods of supply of coachmen and footmen not being contemplated and very sternly i say to youand say from sure knowledgethat a man had better not know how to read and write than receive education on such terms  94 the first condition under which it can be given usefully is that it should be clearly understood to be no means of getting on in the world but a means of staying pleasantly in your place there and the first elements of state education should be calculated equally for the advantage of every order of person composing the state from the lowest to the highest class every child born in this island should be required by law to receive these general elements of human discipline and to be baptizednot with a drop of water on its foreheadbut in the cloud and sea of heavenly wisdom and of earthly power  and the elements of this general state education should be briefly these  95 firstthe body must be made as beautiful and perfect in its youth as it can be wholly irrespective of ulterior purpose if you mean afterwards to set the creature to business which will degrade its body and shorten its life first i should say simplyyou had better let such business alonebut if you must have it done somehow yet let the living creature whom you mean to kill get the full strength of its body first and taste the joy and bear the beauty of youth after that poison it if you will economically the arrangement is a wiser one for it will take longer in the killing than if you began with it younger and you will get an excess of work out of it which will more than pay for its training  therefore first teachas i have said in the preface to unto this lastthe laws of health and exercises enjoined by them and to this end your schools must be in fresh country and amidst fresh air and have great extents of land attached to them in permanent estate riding running all the honest personal exercises of offense and defense and music should be the primal heads of this bodily education  96 next to these bodily accomplishments the two great mental graces should be taught reverence and compassion not that these are in a literal sense to be taught for they are innate in every wellborn human creature but they have to be developed exactly as the strength of the body must be by deliberate and constant exercise i never understood why goethe in the plan of education in wilhelm meister says that reverence is not innate but must be taught from without it seems to me so fixedly a function of the human spirit that if men can get nothing else to reverence they will worship a fool or a stone or a vegetablea but to teach reverence rightly is to attach it to the right persons and things first by setting over your youth masters whom they cannot but love and respect next by gathering for them out of past history whatever has been most worthy in human deeds and human passion and leading them continually to dwell upon such instances making this the principal element of emotional excitement to them and lastly by letting them justly feel as far as may be the smallness of their own powers and knowledge as compared with the attainments of others      a by steady preaching against it one may quench reverence     and bring insolence to its height but the instinct cannot be     wholly uprooted  97 compassion on the other hand is to be taught chiefly by making it a point of honor collaterally with courage and in the same rank as indeed the complement and evidence of courage so that in the code of unwritten school law it shall be held as shameful to have done a cruel thing as a cowardly one all infliction of pain on weaker creatures is to be stigmatized as unmanly crime and every possible opportunity taken to exercise the youths in offices of some practical help and to acquaint them with the realities of the distress which in the joyfulness of entering into life it is so difficult for those who have not seen home suffering to conceive  98 reverence then and compassion we are to teach primarily and with these as the bond and guardian of them truth of spirit and word of thought and sight truth earnest and passionate sought for like a treasure and kept like a crown  this teaching of truth as a habit will be the chief work the master has to do and it will enter into all parts of education first you must accustom the children to close accuracy of statement this both as a principle of honor and as an accomplishment of language making them try always who shall speak truest both as regards the fact he has to relate or express not concealing or exaggerating and as regards the precision of the words he expresses it in thus making truth which indeed it is the test of perfect language and giving the intensity of a moral purpose to the study and art of words then carrying this accuracy into all habits of thought and observation also so as always to think of things as they truly are and to see them as they truly are as far as in us rests and it does rest much in our power for all false thoughts and seeings come mainly of our thinking of what we have no business with and looking for things we want to see instead of things that ought to be seen  99 do not talk but of what you know do not think but of what you have materials to think justly upon and do not look for things only that you like when there are others to be seenthis is the lesson to be taught to our youth and inbred in them and that mainly by our own example and continence never teach a child anything of which you are not yourself sure and above all if you feel anxious to force anything into its mind in tender years that the virtue of youth and early association may fasten it there be sure it is no lie which you thus sanctify there is always more to be taught of absolute incontrovertible knowledge open to its capacity than any child can learn there is no need to teach it anything doubtful better that it should be ignorant of a thousand truths than have consecrated in its heart a single lie  100 and for this as well as for many other reasons the principal subjects of education after history ought to be natural science and mathematics but with respect to these studies your schools will require to be divided into three groups one for children who will probably have to live in cities one for those who will live in the country and one for those who will live at sea the schools for these last of course being always placed on the coast and for children whose life is to be in cities the subjects of study should be as far as their disposition will allow of it mathematics and the arts for children who are to live in the country natural history of birds insects and plants together with agriculture taught practically and for children who are to be seamen physical geography astronomy and the natural history of seafish and seabirds  101 this then being the general course and material of education for all children observe farther that in the preface to unto this last i said that every child besides passing through this course was at school to learn the calling by which it was to live and it may perhaps appear to you that after or even in the early stages of education such as this above described there are many callings which however much called to them the children might not willingly determine to learn or live by probably you may say after they have learned to ride and fence and sing and know birds and flowers it will be little to their liking to make themselves into tailors carpenters shoemakers blacksmiths and the like and i cannot but agree with you as to the exceeding probability of some such reluctance on their part which will be a very awkward state of things indeed since we can by no means get on without tailoring and shoemaking and one to be meditated upon very seriously in next letter  102 psthank you for sending me your friends letter about gustave doré he is wrong however in thinking there is any good in those illustrations of elaine i had intended to speak of them afterwards for it is to my mind quite as significantalmost as awfula sign of what is going on in the midst of us that our great english poet should have suffered his work to be thus contaminated as that the lower evangelicals never notable for sense in the arts should have got their bibles dishonored those elaine illustrations are just as impure as anything else that doré has done but they are also vapid and without any one merit whatever in point of art the illustrations to the contes drôlatiques are full of power and invention but those to elaine are merely and simply stupid theatrical bêtises with the taint of the charnelhouse on them besides     letter xvii  the relations of education to position in life                                                       april 3 1867  103 i am not quite sure that you will feel the awkwardness of the dilemma i got into at the end of last letter as much as i do myself you working men have been crowing and peacocking at such a rate lately and setting yourselves forth so confidently for the cream of society and the top of the world that perhaps you will not anticipate any of the difficulties which suggest themselves to a thoroughbred tory and conservative like me perhaps you will expect a youth properly educateda good ridermusicianand wellgrounded scholar in natural philosophy to think it a step of promotion when he has to go and be made a tailor of or a coalheaver if you do i should very willingly admit that you might be right and go on to the farther development of my notions without pausing at this stumblingblock were it not that unluckily all the wisest men whose sayings i ever heard or read agree in expressing one way or another just such contempt for those useful occupations as i dread on the part of my foolishly refined scholars shakespeare and chaucerdante and virgilhorace and pindarhomer Æschylus and platoall the men of any age or country who seem to have had heavens music on their lips agree in their scorn of mechanic life and i imagine that the feeling of prudent englishmen and sensible as well as sensitive englishwomen on reading my last letter would mostly beis the man mad or laughing at us to propose educating the working classes this way he could not if his wild scheme were possible find a better method of making them acutely wretched  104 it may be so my sensible and polite friends and i am heartily willing as well as curious to hear you develop your own scheme of operative education so only that it be universal orderly and careful i do not say that i shall be prepared to advocate my athletics and philosophies instead only observe what you admit or imply in bringing forward your possibly wiser system you imply that a certain portion of mankind must be employed in degrading work and that to fit them for this work it is necessary to limit their knowledge their active powers and their enjoyments from childhood upwards so that they may not be able to conceive of any state better than the one they were born in nor possess any knowledge or acquirements inconsistent with the coarseness or disturbing the monotony of their vulgar occupation and by their labor in this contracted state of mind we superior beings are to be maintained and always to be curtseyed to by the properly ignorant little girls and capped by the properly ignorant little boys whenever we pass by  105 mind i do not say that this is not the right state of things only if it be you need not be so overparticular about the slavetrade it seems to me what is the use of arguing so pertinaciously that a blacks skull will hold as much as a whites when you are declaring in the same breath that a whites skull must not hold as much as it can or it will be the worse for him it does not appear to me at all a profound state of slavery to be whipped into doing a piece of low work that i dont like but it is a very profound state of slavery to be kept myself low in the forehead that i may not dislike low work  106 you see my friend the dilemma is really an awkward one whichever way you look at it but what is still worse i am not puzzled only at this part of my scheme about the boys i shall have to make workmen of i am just as much puzzled about the boys i shall have to make nothing of grant that by hook or crook by reason or rattan i persuade a certain number of the roughest ones into some serviceable business and get coats and shoes made for the restwhat is the business of the rest to be naturally according to the existing state of things one supposes they are to belong to some of the gentlemanly professions to be soldiers lawyers doctors or clergymen but alas i shall not want any soldiers of special skill or pugnacity all my boys will be soldiers so far from wanting any lawyers of the kind that live by talking i shall have the strongest possible objection to their appearance in the country for doctors i shall always entertain a profound respect but when i get my athletic education fairly established of what help to them will my respect be they will all starve and for clergymen it is true i shall have a large number of episcopatesone over every hundred familiesand many positions of civil authority also for civil officers above them and below but all these places will involve much hard work and be anything but covetable while of clergymens usual work admonition theological demonstration and the like i shall want very little done indeed and that little done for nothing for i will allow no man to admonish anybody until he has previously earned his own dinner by more productive work than admonition  well i wish my friend you would write me a word or two in answer to this telling me your own ideas as to the proper issue out of these difficulties i should like to know what you think and what you suppose others will think before i tell you my own notions about the matter     letter xviii  the harmful effects of servile employments the possible practice and exhibition of sincere humility by religious persons                                                       april 7 1867  107 i have been waiting these three days to know what you would say to my last questions and now you send me two pamphlets of combes to read i never read anything in springtime except the ai ai on the sanguine flower inscribed with woe and besides if as i gather from your letter combe thinks that among welleducated boys there would be a percentage constitutionally inclined to be cobblers or looking forward with unction to establishment in the oil and tallow line or fretting themselves for a flunkeys uniform nothing that he could say would make me agree with him i know as well as he does the unconquerable differences in the clay of the human creature and i know that in the outset whatever system of education you adopted a large number of children could be made nothing of and would necessarily fall out of the ranks and supply candidates enough for degradation to common mechanical business but this enormous difference in bodily and mental capacity has been mainly brought about by difference in occupation and by direct maltreatment and in a few generations if the poor were cared for their marriages looked after and sanitary law enforced a beautiful type of face and form and a high intelligence would become all but universal in a climate like this of england even as it is the marvel is always to me how the race resists at least in its childhood influences of illregulated birth poisoned food poisoned air and soul neglect i often see faces of children as i walk through the black district of st giless lying as it does just between my own house and the british museum which through all their pale and corrupt misery recall the old non angli and recall it not by their beauty but by their sweetness of expression even though signed already with trace and cloud of the coming lifea life so bitter that it would make the curse of the 137th psalm true upon our modern babylon though we were to read it thus happy shall thy children be if one taketh and dasheth them against the stones  108 yes very solemnly i repeat to you that in those worst treated children of the english race i yet see the making of gentlemen and gentlewomennot the making of dogstealers and gindrinkers such as their parents were and the child of the average english tradesman or peasant even at this day well schooled will show no innate disposition such as must fetter him forever to the clod or the counter you say that many a boy runs away or would run away if he could from good positions to go to sea of course he does i never said i should have any difficulty in finding sailors but i shall in finding fishmongers i am at no loss for gardeners either but what am i to do for greengrocers  109 the fact is a great number of quite necessary employments are in the accuratest sense servile that is they sink a man to the condition of a serf or unthinking worker the proper state of an animal but more or less unworthy of men nay unholy in some sense so that a day is made holy by the fact of its being commanded thou shalt do no servile work therein and yet if undertaken in a certain spirit such work might be the holiest of all if there were but a thread or two of sound fiber here and there left in our modern religion so that the stuff of it would bear a real strain one might address our two opposite groups of evangelicals and ritualists somewhat after this fashiongood friends these differences of opinion between you cannot but be painful to your christian charity and they are unseemly to us the profane and prevent us from learning from you what perhaps we ought but as we read your book we for our part gather from it that you might without danger to your own souls set an undivided example to us for the benefit of ours you both of you as far as we understand agree in the necessity of humility to the perfection of your character we often hear you of calvinistic persuasion speaking of yourselves as sinful dust and asheswould it then be inconsistent with your feelings to make yourselves into serviceable dust and ashes we observe that of late many of our roads have been hardened and mended with cinders now if in a higher sense you could allow us to mend the roads of the world with you a little it would be a great proof to us of your sincerity suppose only for a little while in the present difficulty and distress you were to make it a test of conversion that a man should regularly give zaccheuss portion half his goods to the poor and at once adopt some disagreeable and despised but thoroughly useful trade you cannot think that this would finally be to your disadvantage you doubtless believe the texts he that giveth to the poor lendeth to the lord and he that would be chief among you let him be your servant the more you parted with and the lower you stooped the greater would be your final reward and final exaltation you profess to despise human learning and worldly riches leave both of these to us undertake for us the illiterate and illpaid employments which must deprive you of the privileges of society and the pleasures of luxury you cannot possibly preach your faith so forcibly to the world by any quantity of the finest words as by a few such simple and painful acts and over your counters in honest retail business you might preach a gospel that would sound in more ears than any that was ever proclaimed over pulpit cushions or tabernacle rails and whatever may be your gifts of utterance you cannot but feel studying st pauls epistles as carefully as you do that you might more easily and modestly emulate the practical teaching of the silent apostle of the gentiles than the speech or writing of his companion amidst the present discomforts of your brethren you may surely with greater prospect of good to them seek the title of sons of consolation than of sons of thunder and be satisfied with barnabass confession of faith if you can reach no farther who having land sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet  110 to you on the other hand gentlemen of the embroidered robe who neither despise learning nor the arts we know that sacrifices such as these would be truly painful and might at first appear inexpedient but the doctrine of selfmortification is not a new one to you and we should be sorry to thinkwe would not indeed for a moment dishonor you by thinkingthat these melodious chants and prismatic brightnesses of vitreous pictures and floral graces of deepwrought stone were in any wise intended for your own poor pleasures whatever profane attraction they may exercise on more fleshlyminded persons and as you have certainly received no definite order for the painting carving or lighting up of churches while the temple of the body of so many poor living christians is so pale so misshapen and so illlighted but have on the contrary received very definite orders for the feeding and clothing of such sad humanity we may surely ask you not unreasonably to humiliate yourselves in the most complete waynot with a voluntary but a sternly involuntary humilitynot with a show of wisdom in willworship but with practical wisdom in all honor to the satisfying of the flesh and to associate yourselves in monasteries and convents for the better practice of useful and humble trades do not burn any more candles but mould some do not paint any more windows but mend a few where the wind comes in in winter time with substantial clear glass and putty do not vault any more high roofs but thatch some low ones and embroider rather on backs which are turned to the cold than only on those which are turned to congregations and you will have your reward afterwards and attain with all your flocks thus tended to a place where you may have as much gold and painted glass and singing as you like  thus much it seems to me one might say with some hope of acceptance to any very earnest member of either of our two great religious parties if as i say their faith could stand a strain i have not however based any of my imaginary political arrangements on the probability of its doing so and i trust only to such general good nature and willingness to help each other as i presume may be found among men of the world to whom i should have to make quite another sort of speech which i will endeavor to set down the heads of for you in next letter     letter xix  the general pressure of excessive and improper work in english life                                                      april 10 1867  111 i cannot go on today with the part of my subject i had proposed for i was disturbed by receiving a letter last night which i herewith enclose to you and of which i wish you to print here following the parts i have not underlined                        1 phene street chelsea april 8 1867       my dear r       it is long since you have heard of me and now i ask your      patience with me for a little i have but just returned from      the funeral of my dear dear friend  the first artist      friend i made in londona loved and prized one for years      past he had lived in the very humblest way fighting his      battle of life against mean appreciation of his talents the      wants of a rising family and frequent attacks of illness      crippling him for months at a time the wolf at the door      meanwhile       but about two years since his prospects brightened    and      he had but a few weeks since ventured on removal to a larger      house his eldest boy of seventeen years a very intelligent      youth so strongly desired to be a civil engineer that mr       not being able to pay the large premium required for      his apprenticeship had been made very glad by the consent      of mr penn of millwall to receive him without a premium      after the boy should have spent some time at kings college      in the study of mechanics the rest is a sad story about a      fortnight ago mr  was taken ill and died last week      the doctors say of sheer physical exhaustion not      thirtynine years old leaving eight young children and his      poor widow expecting her confinement and so weak and ill as      to be incapable of effort this youth is the eldest and the      other children range downwards to a babe of eighteen months      there is not one who knew him i believe that will not give      cheerfully to their ability for his widow and children      but such aid will go but a little way in this painful case      and it would be a real boon to this poor widow if some of      her children could be got into an orphan asylum          if you are able to do anything i would send particulars of      the age and sex of the children               i remain dear sir ever obediently yours                                              fred j shields       psi ought to say that poor  has been quite unable to      save with his large family and that they would be utterly      destitute now but for the kindness of some with whom he was      professionally connected  112 now this case of which you see the entire authenticity is out of the many of which i hear continually a notably sad one only in so far as the artist in question has died of distress while he was catering for the public amusement hardly a week now passes without some such misery coming to my knowledge and the quantity of pain and anxiety of daily effort through the best part of life ending all at last in utter grief which the lower middle classes in england are now suffering is so great that i feel constantly as if i were living in one great churchyard with people all round me clinging feebly to the edges of the open graves and calling for help as they fall back into them out of sight  113 now i want you to observe here in a definite case the working of your beautiful modern political economy of supply and demand here is a man who could have supplied you with good and entertaining artsay for fifty good yearsif you had paid him enough for his days work to find him and his children peacefully in bread but you like having your prints as cheap as possibleyou triumph in the little that your laugh costsyou take all you can get from the man give the least you can give to himand you accordingly kill him at thirtynine and thereafter have his children to take care of or to kill also whichever you choose but now observe you must take care of them for nothing or not at all and what you might have had good value for if you had given it when it would have cheered the fathers heart you now can have no return for at all to yourselves and what you give to the orphans if it does not degrade them at least afflicts coming not through their fathers hand its honest earnings but from strangers  observe farther whatever help the orphans may receive will not be from the public at all it will not be from those who profited by their fathers labors it will be chiefly from his fellowlaborers or from persons whose money would have been beneficially spent in other directions from whence it is drawn away to this need which ought never to have occurredwhile those who waste their money without doing any service to the public will never contribute one farthing to this distress  114 now it is this double fault in the helpthat it comes too late and that the burden of it falls wholly on those who ought least to be charged with itwhich would be corrected by that institution of overseers of which i spoke to you in the twelfth of these letters saying you remember that they were to have farther legal powers which i did not then specify but which would belong to them chiefly in the capacity of public almoners or helpgivers aided by their deacons the reception of such help in time of true need being not held disgraceful but honorable since the fact of its reception would be so entirely public that no impostor or idle person could ever obtain it surreptitiously  115 11th april i was interrupted yesterday and i am glad of it for here happens just an instance of the way in which the unjust distribution of the burden of charity is reflected on general interests i cannot help what taint of ungracefulness you or other readers of these letters may feel that i incur in speaking in this instance of myself if i could speak with the same accurate knowledge of any one else most gladly i would but i also think it right that whether people accuse me of boasting or not they should know that i practise what i preach i had not intended to say what i now shall but the coming of this letter last night just turns the balance of the decision with me i enclose it with the other you see it is one from my bookseller mr quaritch offering me fischers work on the flora of java and latours on indian orchidaceæ bound together for twenty guineas now i am writing a book on botany just now for young people chiefly on wild flowers and i want these two books very much but i simply cannot afford to buy them because i sent my last spare twenty guineas to mr shields yesterday for this widow and though you may think it not the affair of the public that i have not this book on indian flowers it is their affair finally that what i write for them should be founded on as broad knowledge as possible whatever value my own book may or may not have it will just be in a given degree worth less to them because of my want of this knowledge  116 so againfor having begun to speak of myself i will do so yet more franklyi suppose that when people see my name down for a hundred pounds to the cruikshank memorial and for another hundred to the eyre defense fund they think only that i have more money than i know what to do with well the giving of those subscriptions simply decides the question whether or no i shall be able to afford a journey to switzerland this year in the negative and i wanted to go not only for healths sake but to examine the junctions of the molasse sandstones and nagelfluh with the alpine limestone in order to complete some notes i meant to publish next spring on the geology of the great northern swiss valley notes which must now lie by me at least for another year and i believe this delay though i say it will be really something of a loss to the traveling public for the little essay was intended to explain to them in a familiar way the real wonderfulness of their favorite mountain the righi and to give them some amusement in trying to find out where the manycolored pebbles of it had come from but it is more important that i should with some stoutness assert my respect for the genius and earnest patriotism of cruikshank and my much more than disrespect for the jamaica committee than that i should see the alps this year or get my essay finished next spring but i tell you the fact because i want you to feel how in thus leaving their men of worth to be assisted or defended only by those who deeply care for them the public more or less cripple to their own ultimate disadvantage just the people who could serve them in other ways while the speculators and moneyseekers who are only making their profit out of the said public of course take no part in the help of anybody and even if the willing bearers could sustain the burden anywise adequately none of us would complain but i am certain there is no man whatever his fortune who is now engaged in any earnest offices of kindness to these sufferers especially of the middle class among his acquaintance who will not bear me witness that for one we can relieve we must leave three to perish i have left three myself in the first three months of this year one was the artist paul gray for whom an appeal was made to me for funds to assist him in going abroad out of the bitter english winter i had not the means by me and he died a week afterwards another case was that of a widow whose husband had committed suicide for whom application was made to me at the same time and the third was a personal friend to whom i refused a sum which he said would have saved him from bankruptcy i believe six times as much would not have saved him however i refused and he is ruined  117 and observe also it is not the mere crippling of my means that i regret it is the crippling of my temper and waste of my time the knowledge of all this distress even when i can assist itmuch more when i cannotand the various thoughts of what i can and cannot or ought and ought not to do are a far greater burden to me than the mere loss of the money it is peremptorily not my businessit is not my gift bodily or mentally to look after other peoples sorrow i have enough of my own and even if i had not the sight of pain is not good for me i dont want to be a bishop in a most literal and sincere sense nolo episcopari i dont want to be an almoner nor a counselor nor a member of parliament nor a voter for members of parliament what would mr holyoake say to me if he knew that i have never voted for anybody in my life and never mean to do so i am essentially a painter and a leaf dissector and my powers of thought are all purely mathematical seizing ultimate principles onlynever accidents a line is always to me length without breadth it is not a cable or a crowbar and though i can almost infallibly reason out the final law of anything if within reach of my industry i neither care for nor can trace the minor exigencies of its daily appliance so in every way i like a quiet life and i dont like seeing people cry or die and should rejoice more than i can tell you in giving up the full half of my fortune for the poor provided i knew that the public would make lord overstone also give the half of his and other people who were independent give the half of theirs and then set men who were really fit for such office to administer the fund and answer to us for nobodys perishing innocently and so leave us all to do what we chose with the rest and with our days in peace  thus far of the publics fault in the matter next i have a word or two to say of the sufferers own faultfor much as i pity them i conceive that none of them do perish altogether innocently but this must be for next letter     letter xx  of improvidence in marriage in the middle classes and of the advisable restrictions of it                                                      april 12 1867  118 it is quite as well whatever irregularity it may introduce in the arrangement of the general subject that yonder sad letter warped me away from the broad inquiry to this speciality respecting the present distress of the middle classes for the immediate cause of that distress in their own imprudence of which i have to speak to you today is only to be finally vanquished by strict laws which though they have been many a year in my mind i was glad to have a quiet hour of sunshine for the thinking over again this morning sunshine which happily rose cloudless and allowed me to meditate my tyrannies before breakfast under the just opened blossoms of my orchard and assisted by much melodious advice from the birds who my gardener having positive orders never to trouble any of them in anything or object to their eating even my best peas if they like their flavor rather now get into my way than out of it when they see me about the walks and take me into most of their counsels in nestbuilding  119 the letter from mr shields which interrupted us reached me as you see on the evening of the 9th instant on the morning of the 10th i received another which i herewith forward to you for verification it ischaracteristically enoughdateless so you must take the time of its arrival on my word and substituting m n for the name of the boy referred to and withholding only the address and name of the writer you see that it may be printed word for wordas follows       sir       may i beg for the favor of your presentation to christs      hospital for my youngest son m n i have nine children      and no means to educate them i ventured to address you      believing that my husbands name is not unknown to you as      an artist                   believe me to remain faithfully yours                                                              120 now this letter is only a typical example of the entire class of those which being a governor of christs hospital i receive in common with all the other governors at the rate of about three a day for a month or six weeks from the date of our names appearing in the printed list of the governors who have presentations for the current year having been a governor now some twentyfive years i have documentary evidence enough to found some general statistics upon from which there have resulted two impressions on my mind which i wish here specially to note to you and i do not doubt but that all the other governors if you could ask them would at once confirm what i say my first impression is a heavy and sorrowful sense of the general feebleness of intellect of that portion of the british public which stands in need of presentations to christs hospital this feebleness of intellect is mainly shown in the nearly total unconsciousness of the writers that anybody else may want a presentation besides themselves with the exception here and there of a soldiers or a sailors widow hardly one of them seems to have perceived the existence of any distress in the world but their own none know what they are asking for or imagine unless as a remote contingency the possibility of its having been promised at a prior date the second most distinct impression on my mind is that the portion of the british public which is in need of presentations to christs hospital considers it a merit to have large families with or without the means of supporting them  121 now it happened also and remember all this is strictly true nor in the slightest particular represented otherwise than as it chanced though the said chance brought thus together exactly the evidence i wanted for my letter to youit happened i say that on this same morning of the 10th april i became accidentally acquainted with a case of quite a different kind that of a noble girl who engaged at sixteen and having received several advantageous offers since has remained for ten years faithful to her equally faithful lover while their circumstances rendering it as they rightly considered unjustifiable in them to think of marriage each of them simply and happily aided and cheered by the others love discharged the duties of their own separate positions in life  122 in the nature of things instances of this kind of noble life remain more or less concealed while imprudence and error proclaim themselves by misfortune but they are assuredly not unfrequent in our english homes let us next observe the political and national result of these arrangements you leave your marriages to be settled by supply and demand instead of wholesome law and thus among your youths and maidens the improvident incontinent selfish and foolish ones marry whether you will or not and beget families of children necessarily inheritors in a great degree of these parental dispositions and for whom supposing they had the best dispositions in the world you have thus provided by way of educators the foolishest fathers and mothers you could find the only rational sentence in their letters usually is the invariable one in which they declare themselves incapable of providing for their childrens education on the other hand whosoever is wise patient unselfish and pure among your youth you keep maid or bachelor wasting their best days of natural life in painful sacrifice forbidding them their best help and best reward and carefully excluding their prudence and tenderness from any offices of parental duty  is not this a beatific and beautifully sagacious system for a celestial empire such as that of these british isles  123 i will not here enter into any statement of the physical laws which it is the province of our physicians to explain and which are indeed at last so far beginning to be understood that there is hope of the nations giving some of the attention to the conditions affecting the race of man which it has hitherto bestowed only on those which may better its races of cattle  it is enough i think to say here that the beginning of all sanitary and moral law is in the regulation of marriage and that ugly and fatal as is every form and agency of license no licentiousness is so mortal as licentiousness in marriage  124 briefly then and in main points subject in minor ones to such modifications in detail as local circumstances and characters would render expedient those following are laws such as a prudent nation would institute respecting its marriages permission to marry should be the reward held in sight of its youth during the entire latter part of the course of their education and it should be granted as the national attestation that the first portion of their lives had been rightly fulfilled it should not be attainable without earnest and consistent effort though put within the reach of all who were willing to make such effort and the granting of it should be a public testimony to the fact that the youth or maid to whom it was given had lived within their proper sphere a modest and virtuous life and had attained such skill in their proper handicraft and in arts of household economy as might give wellfounded expectations of their being able honorably to maintain and teach their children  125 no girl should receive her permission to marry before her seventeenth birthday nor any youth before his twentyfirst and it should be a point of somewhat distinguished honor with both sexes to gain their permission of marriage in the eighteenth and twentysecond years and a recognized disgrace not to have gained it at least before the close of their twentyfirst and twentyfourth i do not mean that they should in any wise hasten actual marriage but only that they should hold it a point of honor to have the right to marry in every year there should be two festivals one on the first of may and one at the feast of harvest home in each district at which festivals their permissions to marry should be given publicly to the maidens and youths who had won them in that halfyear and they should be crowned the maids by the old french title of rosières and the youths perhaps by some name rightly derived from one supposed signification of the word bachelor laurel fruit and so led in joyful procession with music and singing through the city street or village lane and the day ended with feasting of the poor  126 and every bachelor and rosière should be entitled to claim if they needed it according to their position in life a fixed income from the state for seven years from the day of their marriage for the setting up of their homes and however rich they might be by inheritance their income should not be permitted to exceed a given sum proportioned to their rank for the seven years following that in which they had obtained their permission to marry but should accumulate in the trust of the state until that seventh year in which they should be put on certain conditions finally in possession of their property and the men thus necessarily not before their twentyeighth nor usually later than their thirtyfirst year become eligible to offices of state so that the rich and poor should not be sharply separated in the beginning of the war of life but the one supported against the first stress of it long enough to enable them by proper forethought and economy to secure their footing and the other trained somewhat in the use of moderate means before they were permitted to have the command of abundant ones and of the sources from which these state incomes for the married poor should be supplied or of the treatment of those of our youth whose conduct rendered it advisable to refuse them permission to marry i defer what i have to say till we come to the general subjects of taxation and criminal discipline leaving the proposals made in this letter to bear for the present whatever aspect of mere romance and unrealizable vision they probably may and to most readers such as they assuredly will nor shall i make the slightest effort to redeem them from these imputations for though there is nothing in all their purport which would not be approved as in the deepest sense practicalby the spirit of paradise    which gives to all the selfsame bent   whose lives are wise and innocent  and though i know that national justice in conduct and peace in heart could by no other laws be so swiftly secured i confess with much dispeace of heart that both justice and happiness have at this day become in england romantic impossibilities     letter xxi  of the dignity of the four fine arts and of the proper system of retail trade                                                      april 15 1867  127 i return now to the part of the subject at which i was interruptedthe inquiry as to the proper means of finding persons willing to maintain themselves and others by degrading occupations  that on the whole simply manual occupations are degrading i suppose i may assume you to admit at all events the fact is so and i suppose few general readers will have any doubt of ita      a many of my working readers have disputed this statement     eagerly feeling the good effect of work in themselves but     observe i only say simply or totally manual work and     that alone is degrading though often in measure     refreshing wholesome and necessary so it is highly     necessary and wholesome to eat sometimes but degrading to     eat all day as to labor with the hands all day but it is     not degrading to think all dayif you can a highlybred     court lady rightly interested in politics and literature     is a much finer type of the human creature than a servant of     all work however clever and honest  granting this it follows as a direct consequence that it is the duty of all persons in higher stations of life by every means in their power to diminish their demand for work of such kind and to live with as little aid from the lower trades as they can possibly contrive  128 i suppose you see that this conclusion is not a little at variance with received notions on political economy it is popularly supposed that it benefits a nation to invent a want but the fact is that the true benefit is in extinguishing a wantin living with as few wants as possible  i cannot tell you the contempt i feel for the common writers on political economy in their stupefied missing of this first principle of all human economyindividual or politicalto live namely with as few wants as possible and to waste nothing of what is given you to supply them  129 this ought to be the first lesson of every rich mans political code sir his tutor should early say to him you are so placed in societyit may be for your misfortune it must be for your trialthat you are likely to be maintained all your life by the labor of other men you will have to make shoes for nobody but some one will have to make a great many for you you will have to dig ground for nobody but some one will have to dig through every summers hot day for you you will build houses and make clothes for no one but many a rough hand must knead clay and many an elbow be crooked to the stitch to keep that body of yours warm and fine now remember whatever you and your work may be worth the less your keep costs the better it does not cost money only it costs degradation you do not merely employ these people you also tread upon them it cannot be helpedyou have your place and they have theirs but see that you tread as lightly as possible and on as few as possible what food and clothes and lodging you honestly need for your health and peace you may righteously take see that you take the plainest you can serve yourself withthat you waste or wear nothing vainlyand that you employ no man in furnishing you with any useless luxury  130 that is the first lesson of christianor humaneconomy and depend upon it my friend it is a sound one and has every voice and vote of the spirits of heaven and earth to back it whatever views the manchester men or any other manner of men may take respecting demand and supply demand what you deserve and you shall be supplied with it for your good demand what you do not deserve and you shall be supplied with something which you have not demanded and which nature perceives that you deserve quite to the contrary of your good that is the law of your existence and if you do not make it the law of your resolved acts so much precisely the worse for you and all connected with you  131 yet observe though it is out of its proper place said here this law forbids no luxury which men are not degraded in providing you may have paul veronese to paint your ceiling if you like or benvenuto cellini to make cups for you but you must not employ a hundred divers to find beads to stitch over your sleeve did you see the account of the sales of the esterhazy jewels the other day  and the degree in which you recognize the difference between these two kinds of services is precisely what makes the difference between your being a civilized person or a barbarian if you keep slaves to furnish forth your dressto glut your stomachsustain your indolenceor deck your pride you are a barbarian if you keep servants properly cared for to furnish you with what you verily want and no more than thatyou are a civil persona person capable of the qualities of citizenshipa      a compare the crown of wild olive §§ 79 118 and 122  132 now farther observe that in a truly civilized and disciplined state no man would be allowed to meddle with any material who did not know how to make the best of it in other words the arts of working in wood clay stone and metal would all be fine arts working in iron for machinery becoming an entirely distinct business there would be no joiners work no smiths no pottery nor stonecutting so debased in character as to be entirely unconnected with the finer branches of the same art and to at least one of these finer branches generally in metalwork every painter and sculptor would be necessarily apprenticed during some years of his education there would be room in these four trades alone for nearly every grade of practical intelligence and productive imagination  133 but it should not be artists alone who are exercised early in these crafts it would be part of my scheme of physical education that every youth in the statefrom the kings son downwardsshould learn to do something finely and thoroughly with his hand so as to let him know what touch meant and what stout craftsmanship meant and to inform him of many things besides which no man can learn but by some severely accurate discipline in doing let him once learn to take a straight shaving off a plank or draw a fine curve without faltering or lay a brick level in its mortar and he has learned a multitude of other matters which no lips of man could ever teach him he might choose his craft but whatever it was he should learn it to some sufficient degree of true dexterity and the result would be in after life that among the middle classes a good deal of their house furniture would be made and a good deal of rough work more or less clumsily but not ineffectively got through by the master himself and his sons with much furtherance of their general health and peace of mind and increase of innocent domestic pride and pleasure and to the extinction of a great deal of vulgar upholstery and other mean handicraft  134 farther a great deal of the vulgarity and nearly all the vice of retail commerce involving the degradation of persons occupied in it depends simply on the fact that their minds are always occupied by the vital or rather mortal question of profits i should at once put an end to this source of baseness by making all retail dealers merely salaried officers in the employ of the trade guilds the stewards that is to say of the salable properties of those guilds and purveyors of such and such articles to a given number of families a perfectly welleducated person might without the least degradation hold such an office as this however poorly paid and it would be precisely the fact of his being well educated which would enable him to fulfil his duties to the public without the stimulus of direct profit of course the current objection to such a system would be that no man for a regularly paid salary would take pains to please his customers and the answer to that objection is that if you can train a man to so much unselfishness as to offer himself fearlessly to the chance of being shot in the course of his daily duty you can most assuredly if you make it also a point of honor with him train him to the amount of selfdenial involved in looking you out with care such a piece of cheese or bacon as you have asked for  135 you see that i have already much diminished the number of employments involving degradation and raised the character of many of those that are left there remain to be considered the necessarily painful or mechanical works of mining forging and the like the unclean noisome or paltry manufacturesthe various kinds of transportby merchant shipping etc and the conditions of menial service  it will facilitate the examination of these if we put them for the moment aside and pass to the other division of our dilemma the question namely what kind of lives our gentlemen and ladies are to live for whom all this hard work is to be done     letter xxii  of the normal position and duties of the upper classes general statement of the land question                                                      april 17 1867  136 in passing now to the statement of conditions affecting the interests of the upper classes i would rather have addressed these closing letters to one of themselves than to you for it is with their own faults and needs that each class is primarily concerned as however unless i kept the letters private this change of their address would be but a matter of courtesy and form not of any true prudential use and as besides i am now no more inclined to reticenceprudent or otherwise but desire only to state the facts of our national economy as clearly and completely as may be i pursue the subject without respect of persons  137 before examining what the occupation and estate of the upper classes ought as far as may reasonably be conjectured finally to become it will be well to set down in brief terms what they actually have been in past ages for this in many respects they must also always be the upper classes broadly speaking are originally composed of the bestbred in the mere animal sense of the term the most energetic and most thoughtful of the population who either by strength of arm seize the land from the rest and make slaves of them or bring desert land into cultivation over which they have therefore within certain limits true personal right or by industry accumulate other property or by choice devote themselves to intellectual pursuits and though poor obtain an acknowledged superiority of position shown by benefits conferred in discovery or in teaching or in gifts of art this is all in the simple course of the law of nature and the proper offices of the upper classes thus distinguished from the rest become therefore in the main threefold  138 a those who are strongest of arm have for their proper function the restraint and punishment of vice and the general maintenance of law and order releasing only from its original subjection to their power that which truly deserves to be emancipated  b those who are superior by forethought and industry have for their function to be the providences of the foolish the weak and the idle and to establish such systems of trade and distribution of goods as shall preserve the lower orders from perishing by famine or any other consequence of their carelessness or folly and to bring them all according to each mans capacity at last into some harmonious industry  c the third class of scholars and artists of course have for function the teaching and delighting of the inferior multitude  the office of the upper classes then as a body is to keep order among their inferiors and raise them always to the nearest level with themselves of which those inferiors are capable so far as they are thus occupied they are invariably loved and reverenced intensely by all beneath them and reach themselves the highest types of human power and beauty  139 this then being the natural ordinance and function of aristocracy its corruption like that of all other beautiful things under the devils touch is a very fearful one its corruption is that those who ought to be the rulers and guides of the people forsake their task of painful honorableness seek their own pleasure and preeminence only and use their power subtlety conceded influence prestige of ancestry and mechanical instrumentality of martial power to make the lower orders toil for them and feed and clothe them for nothing and become in various ways their living property goods and chattels even to the point of utter regardlessness of whatever misery these serfs may suffer through such insolent domination or they themselves their masters commit of crime to enforce it  140 and this is especially likely to be the case when means of various and tempting pleasures are put within the reach of the upper classes by advanced conditions of national commerce and knowledge and it is certain to be the case as soon as position among those upper classes becomes any way purchasable with money instead of being the assured measure of some kind of worth either strength of hand or true wisdom of conduct or imaginative gift it has been becoming more and more the condition of the aristocracy of europe ever since the fifteenth century and is gradually bringing about its ruin and in that ruin checked only by the power which here and there a good soldier or true statesman achieves over the putrid chaos of its vain policy the ruin of all beneath it which can be arrested only either by the repentance of that old aristocracy hardly to be hoped or by the stern substitution of other aristocracy worthier than it  141 corrupt as it may be it and its laws together i would at this moment if i could fasten every one of its institutions down with bands of iron and trust for all progress and help against its tyranny simply to the patience and strength of private conduct and if i had to choose i would tenfold rather see the tyranny of old austria triumphant in the old and new worlds and trust to the chance or rather the distant certainty of some day seeing a true emperor born to its throne than with every privilege of thought and act run the most distant risk of seeing the thoughts of the people of germany and england become like the thoughts of the people of america  my american friends of whom one charles eliot norton of cambridge is the dearest i have in the world tell me i know nothing about america it may be so and they must do me the justice to observe that i therefore usually say nothing about america but this much i have said because the americans as a nation set their trust in liberty and in equality of which i detest the one and deny the possibility of the other and because also as a nation they are wholly undesirous of rest and incapable of it irreverent of themselves both in the present and in the future discontented with what they are yet having no ideal of anything which they desire to becomea      a some following passages in this letter containing     personal references which might in permanence have given     pain or offense are now omittedthe substance of them being     also irrelevant to my main purpose these few words about the     american war with which they concluded are i think worth     retainingall methods of right government are to be     communicated to foreign nations by perfectness of example and     gentleness of patiently expanded power not suddenly nor at     the bayonets point and though it is the duty of every     nation to interfere at bayonet point if they have the     strength to do so to save any oppressed multitude or even     individual from manifest violence it is wholly unlawful to     interfere in such matter except with sacredly pledged     limitation of the objects to be accomplished in the oppressed     persons favor and with absolute refusal of all selfish     advantage and increase of territory or of political power     which might otherwise accrue from the victory  142 but however corrupted the aristocracy of any nation may thus be always divided into three great classes first the landed proprietors and soldiers essentially one political body for the possession of land can only be maintained by military power secondly the moneyed men and leaders of commerce thirdly the professional men and masters in science art and literature  and we were to consider the proper duties of all these and the laws probably expedient respecting them whereupon in the outset we are at once brought face to face with the great land question  143 great as it may be it is wholly subordinate to those we have hitherto been considering the laws you make regarding methods of labor or to secure the genuineness of the things produced by it affect the entire moral state of the nation and all possibility of human happiness for them the mode of distribution of the land only affects their numbers by this or that law respecting land you decide whether the nation shall consist of fifty or of a hundred millions but by this or that law respecting work you decide whether the given number of millions shall be rogues or honest menshall be wretches or happy men and the question of numbers is wholly immaterial compared with that of character or rather its own materialness depends on the prior determination of character make your nation consist of knaves and as emerson said long ago it is but the case of any other verminthe more the worse or to put the matter in narrower limits it is a matter of no final concern to any parent whether he shall have two children or four but matter of quite final concern whether those he has shall or shall not deserve to be hanged the great difficulty in dealing with the land question at all arises from the false though very natural notion on the part of many reformers and of large bodies of the poor that the division of the land among the said poor would be an immediate and everlasting relief to them an immediate relief it would be to the extent of a small annual sum you may easily calculate how little if you choose to each of them on the strength of which accession to their finances they would multiply into as much extra personality as the extra pence would sustain and at that point be checked by starvation exactly as they are now  144 any other form of pillage would benefit them only in like manner and in reality the difficult part of the question respecting numbers is not where they shall be arrested but what shall be the method of their arrest  an island of a certain size has standing room only for so many people feeding ground for a great many fewer than could stand on it reach the limits of your feeding ground and you must cease to multiply must emigrate or starve the modes in which the pressure is gradually brought to bear on the population depend on the justice of your laws but the pressure itself must come at last whatever the distribution of the land and arithmeticians seem to me a little slow to remark the importance of the old childs puzzle about the nails in the horseshoewhen it is populations that are doubling themselves instead of farthings  145 the essential land question then is to be treated quite separately from that of the methods of restriction of population the land question isat what point will you resolve to stop it is separate matter of discussion how you are to stop at it  and this essential land questionat what point will you stopis itself twofold you have to consider first by what methods of land distribution you can maintain the greatest number of healthy persons and secondly whether if by any other mode of distribution and relative ethical laws you can raise their character while you diminish their numbers such sacrifice should be made and to what extent i think it will be better for clearness sake to end this letter with the putting of these two queries in their decisive form and to reserve suggestions of answer for my next     letter xxiii  of the just tenure of lands and the proper functions of high public officers                                                    20th april 1867  146 i must repeat to you once more before i proceed that i only enter on this part of our inquiry to complete the sequence of its system and explain fully the bearing of former conclusions and not for any immediately practicable good to be got out of the investigation whatever i have hitherto urged upon you it is in the power of all men quietly to promote and finally to secure by the patient resolution of personal conduct but no action could be taken in redistribution of land or in limitation of the incomes of the upper classes without grave and prolonged civil disturbance  such disturbance however is only too likely to take place if the existing theories of political economy are allowed credence much longer in the writings of the vulgar economists nothing more excites my indignation than the subterfuges by which they endeavor to accommodate their pseudoscience to the existing abuses of wealth by disguising the true nature of rent i will not waste time in exposing their fallacies but will put the truth for you into as clear a shape as i can  147 rent of whatever kind is briefly the price continuously paid for the loan of the property of another person it may be too little or it may be just or exorbitant or altogether unjustifiable according to circumstances exorbitant rents can only be exacted from ignorant or necessitous rentpayers and it is one of the most necessary conditions of state economy that there should be clear laws to prevent such exaction  148 i may interrupt myself for a moment to give you an instance of what i mean the most wretched houses of the poor in london often pay ten or fifteen per cent to the landlord and i have known an instance of sanitary legislation being hindered to the loss of many hundreds of lives in order that the rents of a nobleman derived from the necessities of the poor might not be diminished and it is a curious thing to me to see mr j s mill foaming at the mouth and really afflicted conscientiously because he supposes one man to have been unjustly hanged while by his own failure i believe wilful failurea in stating clearly to the public one of the first elementary truths of the science he professes he is aiding and abetting the commission of the cruelest possible form of murder on many thousands of persons yearly for the sake simply of putting money into the pockets of the landlords i felt this evil so strongly that i bought in the worst part of london one freehold and one leasehold property consisting of houses inhabited by the lowest poor in order to try what change in their comfort and habits i could effect by taking only a just rent but that firmly the houses of the leasehold pay me five per cent the families that used to have one room in them have now two and are more orderly and hopeful besides and there is a surplus still on the rents they pay after i have taken my five per cent with which if all goes well they will eventually be able to buy twelve years of the lease from me the freehold pays three per cent with similar results in the comfort of the tenant this is merely an example of what might be done by firm state action in such matters      a see § 156  149 next of wholly unjustifiable rents these are for things which are not and which it is criminal to consider as personal or exchangeable property bodies of men land water and air are the principal of these things  parenthetically may i ask you to observe that though a fearless defender of some forms of slavery i am no defender of the slave trade it is by a blundering confusion of ideas between governing men and trading in men and by consequent interference with the restraint instead of only with the sale that most of the great errors in action have been caused among the emancipation men i am prepared if the need be clear to my own mind and if the power is in my hands to throw men into prison or any other captivityto bind them or to beat themand force them for such periods as i may judge necessary to any kind of irksome labor and on occasion of desperate resistance to hang or shoot them but i will not sell them  150 bodies of men or women then and much more as i said before their souls must not be bought or sold neither must land nor water nor air these being the necessary sustenance of mens bodies and souls  yet all these may on certain terms be bound or secured in possession to particular persons under certain conditions for instance it may be proper at a certain time to give a man permission to possess land as you give him permission to marry and farther if he wishes it and works for it to secure to him the land needful for his life as you secure his wife to him and make both utterly his own without in the least admitting his right to buy other peoples wives or fields or to sell his own  151 and the right action of a state respecting its land is indeed to secure it in various portions to those of its citizens who deserve to be trusted with it according to their respective desires and proved capacities and after having so secured it to each to exercise only such vigilance over his treatment of it as the state must give also to his treatment of his wife and servants for the most part leaving him free but interfering in cases of gross mismanagement or abuse of power and in the case of great old families which always ought to be and in some measure however decadent still truly are the noblest monumental architecture of the kingdom living temples of sacred tradition and heros religion so much land ought to be granted to them in perpetuity as may enable them to live thereon with all circumstances of state and outward nobleness but their income must in no wise be derived from the rents of it nor must they be occupied even in the most distant or subordinately administered methods in the exaction of rents that is not noblemens work their income must be fixed and paid them by the state as the kings is  152 so far from their land being to them a source of income it should be on the whole costly to them great part of it being kept in conditions of natural grace which return no rent but their loveliness and the rest made at whatever cost exemplary in perfection of such agriculture as develops the happiest peasant lifea agriculture which as i will show you hereafter must reject the aid of all mechanism except that of instruments guided solely by the human hand or by animal or directly natural forces and which therefore cannot compete for profitableness with agriculture carried on by aid of machinery      a compare fors clavigera letter xxi page 22  and now for the occupation of this body of men maintained at fixed perennial cost of the state  153 you know i said i should want no soldiers of special skill or pugnacity for all my boys would be soldiers but i assuredly want captains of soldiers of special skill and pugnacity and also i said i should strongly object to the appearance of any lawyers in my territory meaning however by lawyers people who live by arguing about lawnot people appointed to administer law and people who live by eloquently misrepresenting factsnot people appointed to discover and plainly represent them  therefore the youth of this landed aristocracy would be trained in my schools to these two great callings not by which but in which they are to live  they would be trained all of them in perfect science of war and in perfect science of essential law and from their body should be chosen the captains and the judges of england its advocates and generally its state officers all such functions being held for fixed pay as already our officers of the church and army are paid and no function connected with the administration of law ever paid by casual fee and the head of such family should in his own right having passed due and high examination in the science of law and not otherwise be a judge lawward or lord having jurisdiction both in civil and criminal cases such as our present judges have after such case shall have been fully represented before and received verdict from a jury composed exclusively of the middle or lower orders and in which no member of the aristocracy should sit but from the decision of these juries or from the lords sentence there should be a final appeal to a tribunal the highest in the land held solely in the kings name and over which in the capital the king himself should preside and therein give judgment on a fixed number of days in each yearand in other places and at other times judges appointed by election under certain conditions out of any order of men in the state the election being national not provincial and all causes brought before these judges should be decided without appeal by their own authority not by juries this then recasting it for you into brief view would be the entire scheme of state authorities  154 1 the king exercising as part both of his prerogative and his duty the office of a supreme judge at stated times in the central court of appeal of his kingdom  2 supreme judges appointed by national election exercising sole authority in courts of final appeal  3 ordinary judges holding the office hereditarily under conditions and with power to add to their number and liable to have it increased if necessary by the kings appointment the office of such judges being to administer the national laws under the decision of juries  4 state officers charged with the direction of public agency in matters of public utility  5 bishops charged with offices of supervision and aid to family by family and person by person  6 the officers of war of various ranks  7 the officers of public instruction of various ranks  i have sketched out this scheme for you somewhat prematurely for i would rather have conducted you to it step by step and as i brought forward the reasons for the several parts of it but it is on other grounds desirable that you should have it to refer to as i go on  155 without depending anywise upon nomenclature yet holding it important as a sign and record of the meanings of things i may tell you further that i should call the elected supreme judges princes the hereditary judges lords and the officers of public guidance dukes and that the social rank of these persons would be very closely correspondent to that implied by such titles under our present constitution only much more real and useful and in conclusion of this letter i will but add that if you or other readers think it idle of me to write or dream of such things as if any of them were in our power or within possibility of any near realization and above all vain to write of them to a workman at sunderland you are to remember what i told you at the beginning that i go on with this part of my subject in some fulfilment of my longconceived plan too large to receive at present any deliberate execution from my failing strength being the body of the work to which munera pulveris was intended merely as an introduction and that i address it to you because i know that the working men of england must for some time be the only body to which we can look for resistance to the deadly influence of moneyed power  i intend however to write to you at this moment one more letter partly explanatory of minor details necessarily omitted in this and chiefly of the proper office of the soldier and then i must delay the completion of even this poor task until after the days have turned for i have quite other work to do in the brightness of the fullopened spring  156 psas i have used somewhat strong language both here and elsewhere of the equivocations of the economists on the subject of rent i had better refer you to one characteristic example you will find in paragraph 5th and 6th of book ii chap 2 of mr mills principles that the right to tenure of land is based by his admission only on the proprietors being its improver  without pausing to dwell on the objection that land cannot be improved beyond a certain point and that at the reaching of that point farther claim to tenure would cease on mr mills principletake even this admission with its proper subsequent conclusion that in no sound theory of private property was it ever contemplated that the proprietor of land should be merely a sinecurist quartered on it now had that conclusion been farther followed it would have compelled the admission that all rent was unjustifiable which normally maintained any person in idleness which is indeed the whole truth of the matter but mr mill instantly retreats from this perilous admission and after three or four pages of discussion quite accurate for its part of the limits of power in management of the land itself which apply just as strictly to the peasant proprietor as to the cottiers landlord he begs the whole question at issue in one brief sentence slipped cunningly into the middle of a long one which appears to be telling all the other way and in which the fatal assertion of the right to rent nestles itself as if it had been already provedthusi italicize the unproved assertion in which the venom of the entire falsehood is concentrated  even in the case of cultivated land a man whom though only one among millions the law permits to hold thousands of acres as his single share is not entitled to think that all is given to him to use and abuse and deal with it as if it concerned nobody but himself the rents or profits which he can obtain from it are his and his only but with regard to the land in everything which he abstains from doing he is morally bound and should whenever the case admits be legally compelled to make his interest and pleasure consistent with the public good  157 i say this sentence in italics is slipped cunningly into the long sentence as if it were of no great consequence and above i have expressed my belief that mr mills equivocations on this subject are wilful it is a grave accusation but i cannot by any stretch of charity attribute these misrepresentations to absolute dulness and bluntness of brain either in mr mill or his follower mr fawcett mr mill is capable of immense involuntary error but his involuntary errors are usually owing to his seeing only one or two of the many sides of a thing not to obscure sight of the side he does see thus his essay on liberty only takes cognizance of facts that make for liberty and of none that make for restraint but in its statement of all that can be said for liberty it is so clear and keen that i have myself quoted it before now as the best authority on that side and if arguing in favor of rent absolutely and with clear explanation of what it was he had then defended it with all his might i should have attributed to him only the honest shortsightedness of partisanship but when i find his defining sentences full of subtle entanglement and reserveand that reserve held throughout his treatment of this particular subjecti cannot whether i utter the suspicion or not keep the sense of wilfulness in the misrepresentation from remaining in my mind and if there be indeed ground for this blame and mr mill for fear of fostering political agitationa has disguised what he knows to be the facts about rent i would ask him as one of the leading members of the jamaica committee which is the greater crime boldly to sign warrant for the sudden death of one man known to be an agitator in the immediate outbreak of such agitation or by equivocation in a scientific work to sign warrants for the deaths of thousands of men in slow misery for fear of an agitation which has not begun and if begun would be carried on by debate not by the sword      a with at last the natural consequences of     cowardicenitroglycerine and fireballs let the upper     classes speak the truth about themselves boldly and they     will know how to defend themselves fearlessly it is     equivocation in principle and dereliction from duty which     melt at last into tears in a mobs presencedec 16th     1867     letter xxiv  the office of the soldier                                                      april 22 1867  158 i must once more deprecate your probable supposition that i bring forward this ideal plan of state government either with any idea of its appearing to our present public mind practicable even at a remote period or with any positive and obstinate adherence to the particular form suggested there are no wiser words among the many wise ones of the most rational and keensighted of old english men of the world than these    for forms of government let fools contest   that which is best administered is best  for indeed no form of government is of any use among bad men and any form will work in the hands of the good but the essence of all government among good men is this that it is mainly occupied in the production and recognition of human worth and in the detection and extinction of human unworthiness and every government which produces and recognizes worth will also inevitably use the worth it has found to govern with and therefore fall into some approximation to such a system as i have described and as i told you i do not contend for names nor particular powersthough i state those which seem to me most advisable on the contrary i know that the precise extent of authorities must be different in every nation at different times and ought to be so according to their circumstances and character and all that i assert with confidence is the necessity within afterwards definable limits of some such authorities as these that is to say  159 i an observant oneby which all men shall be looked after and taken note of  ii a helpful one from which those who need help may get it  iii a prudential one which shall not let people dig in wrong places for coal nor make railroads where they are not wanted and which shall also with true providence insist on their digging in right places for coal in a safe manner and making railroads where they are wanted  iv a martial one which will punish knaves and make idle persons work  v an instructive one which shall tell everybody what it is their duty to know and be ready pleasantly to answer questions if anybody asks them  vi a deliberate and decisive one which shall judge by law and amend or make law  vii an exemplary one which shall show what is loveliest in the art of life  you may divide or name those several offices as you will or they may be divided in practice as expediency may recommend the plan i have stated merely puts them all into the simplest forms and relations  160 you see i have just defined the martial power as that which punishes knaves and makes idle persons work for that is indeed the ultimate and perennial soldiership that is the essential warriors office to the end of time there is no discharge in that war to the compelling of sloth and the scourging of sin the strong hand will have to address itself as long as this wretched little dusty and volcanic world breeds nettles and spits fire the soldiers office at present is indeed supposed to be the defense of his country against other countries but that is an office whichutopian as you may think the sayingwill soon now be extinct i say so fearlessly though i say it with wide war threatened at this moment in the east and west for observe what the standing of nations on their defense really means it means that but for such armed attitude each of them would go and rob the other that is to say that the majority of active persons in every nation are at presentthieves i am very sorry that this should still be so but it will not be so long national exhibitions indeed will not bring peace but national education will and that is soon coming i can judge of this by my own mind for i am myself naturally as covetous a person as lives in this world and am as eagerlyminded to go and steal some things the french have got as any housebreaker could be having clue to attractive spoons if i could by military incursion carry off paul veroneses marriage in cana and the venus victrix and the hours of st louis it would give me the profoundest satisfaction to accomplish the foray successfully nevertheless being a comparatively educated person i should most assuredly not give myself that satisfaction though there were not an ounce of gunpowder nor a bayonet in all france i have not the least mind to rob anybody however much i may covet what they have got and i know that the french and british public may and will with many other publics be at last brought to be of this mind also and to see farther that a nations real strength and happiness do not depend on properties and territories nor on machinery for their defense but on their getting such territory as they have well filled with none but respectable persons which is a way of infinitely enlarging ones territory feasible to every potentate and dependent no wise on getting trent turned or rhineedge reached  161 not but that in the present state of things it may often be soldiers duty to seize territory and hold it strongly but only from banditti or savage and idle persons  thus both calabria and greece ought to have been irresistibly occupied long ago instead of quarreling with austria about venice the italians ought to have made a truce with her for ten years on condition only of her destroying no monuments and not taxing italians more than germans and then thrown the whole force of their army on calabria shot down every bandit in it in a week and forced the peasantry of it into honest work on every hillside with stout and immediate help from the soldiers in embanking streams building walls and the like and italian finance would have been a much pleasanter matter for the king to take account of by this time and a fleet might have been floating under garganus strong enough to sweep every hostile sail out of the adriatic instead of a disgraced and useless remnant of one about to be put up to auction  and similarly we ought to have occupied greece instantly when they asked us whether russia liked it or not given them an english king made good roads for them and stout laws and kept them and their hills and seas with righteous shepherding of arcadian fields and righteous ruling of salaminian wave until they could have given themselves a greek king of men again and obeyed him like men                                                            april 24  162 it is strange that just before i finish work for this time there comes the first real and notable sign of the victory of the principles i have been fighting for these seven years it is only a newspaper paragraph but it means much look at the second column of the 11th page of yesterdays pall mall gazette the paper has taken a wonderful fit of misprinting lately unless my friend john simon has been knighted on his way to weimar which would be much too right and good a thing to be a likely one but its straws of talk mark which way the wind blows perhaps more early than those of any other journaland look at the question it puts in that page whether political economy be the sordid and materialistic science some account it or almost the noblest on which thought can be employed might not you as well have determined that question a little while ago friend public and known what political economy was before you talked so much about it  but hark againostentation parental pride and a host of moral immoral qualities must be recognized as among the springs of industry political economy should not ignore these but to discuss them it must abandon its pretensions to the precision of a pure science  163 well done the pall mall had it written prudence and parental affection instead of ostentation and parental pride must be recognized among the springs of industry it would have been still better and it would then have achieved the expression of a part of the truth which i put into clear terms in the first sentence of unto this last in the year 1862which it has thus taken five years to get half way into the publics head  among the delusions which at different periods have possessed themselves of the minds of large masses of the human race perhaps the most curiouscertainly the least creditableis the modern soidisant science of political economy based on the idea that an advantageous code of social action may be determined irrespectively of the influence of social affection  look also at the definition of skill p 87  under the term skill i mean to include the united force of experience intellect and passion in their operation on manual labor and under the term passion to include the entire range of the moral feelings  164 i say half way into the publics head because you see a few lines further on the pall mall hopes for a pause half way between the rigidity of ricardo and the sentimentality of ruskin  with one hand on their pocket and the other on their heart be it so for the present we shall see how long this statuesque attitude can be maintained meantime it chances strangelyas several other things have chanced while i was writing these notes to youthat they should have put in that sneer two lines before at my note on the meaning of the homeric and platonic sirens at the very moment when i was doubting whether i would or would not tell you the significance of the last song of ariel in the tempest  i had half determined not but now i shall and this was what brought me to think of it  165 yesterday afternoon i called on mr h c sorby to see some of the results of an inquiry he has been following all last year into the nature of the coloring matter of leaves and flowers  you most probably have heard at all events may with little trouble hear of the marvelous power which chemical analysis has received in recent discoveries respecting the laws of light  my friend showed me the rainbow of the rose and the rainbow of the violet and the rainbow of the hyacinth and the rainbow of forest leaves being born and the rainbow of forest leaves dying  and last he showed me the rainbow of blood it was but the threehundredth part of a grain dissolved in a drop of water and it cast its measured bars for ever recognizable now to human sight on the chord of the seven colors and no drop of that red rain can now be shed so small as that the stain of it cannot be known and the voice of it heard out of the ground  166 but the seeing these flower colors and the iris of blood together with them just while i was trying to gather into brief space the right laws of war brought vividly back to me my dreaming fancy of long ago that even the trees of the earth were capable of a kind of sorrow as they opened their innocent leaves in vain for men and along the dells of england her beeches cast their dappled shades only where the outlaw drew his bow and the king rode his careless chase amidst the fair defiles of the apennines the twisted olivetrunks hid the ambushes of treachery and on their meadows day by day the lilies which were white at the dawn were washed with crimson at sunset  and so also now this chance word of the daily journal about the sirens brought to my mind the divine passage in the cratylus of plato about the place of the dead  and none of those who dwell there desire to depart thenceno not even the sirens but even they the seducers are there themselves beguiled and they who lulled all men themselves laid to restthey and all otherssuch sweet songs doth death know how to sing to them  so also the hebrew  and desire shall fail because man goeth to his long home for you know i told you the sirens were not pleasures but desires being always represented in old greek art as having human faces with birds wings and feet and sometimes with eyes upon their wings and there are not two more important passages in all literature respecting the laws of labor and of life than those two great descriptions of the sirens in homer and platothe sirens of death and sirens of eternal life representing severally the earthly and heavenly desires of men the heavenly desires singing to the motion of circles of the spheres and the earthly on the rocks of fatalest shipwreck a fact which may indeed be regarded sentimentally but it is also a profoundly important politicoeconomical one  and now for shakespeares song  167 you will find if you look back to the analysis of it given in munera pulveris § 134 that the whole play of the tempest is an allegorical representation of the powers of true and therefore spiritual liberty as opposed to true and therefore carnal and brutal slavery there is not a sentence nor a rhyme sung or uttered by ariel or caliban throughout the play which has not this undermeaning  168 now the fulfilment of all human liberty is in the peaceful inheritance of the earth with its herb yielding seed and fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind the pasture or arable land and the blossoming or wooded and fruited land uniting the final elements of life and peace for body and soul therefore we have the two great hebrew forms of benediction his eyes shall be red with wine and his teeth white with milk and again butter and honey shall he eat that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good and as the work of war and sin has always been the devastation of this blossoming earth whether by spoil or idleness so the work of peace and virtue is also that of the first day of paradise to dress it and to keep it and that will always be the song of perfectly accomplished liberty in her industry and rest and shelter from troubled thoughts in the calm of the fields and gaining by migration the long summers day from the shortening twilight    where the bee sucks there lurk i   in a cowslips bell i lie   there i couch when owls do cry   on the bats back i do fly   after summer merrily   merrily merrily shall i live now   under the blossom that hangs on the bough  and the security of this treasure to all the poor and not the ravage of it down the valleys of the shenandoah is indeed the true warriors work but that they may be able to restrain vice rightly soldiers must themselves be first in virtue and that they may be able to compel labor sternly they must themselves be first in toil and their spears like jonathans at bethaven enlighteners of the eyes     letter xxv  of inevitable distinction of rank and necessary submission to authority the meaning of pureheartedness conclusion   169 i was interrupted yesterday just as i was going to set my soldiers to work and today here comes the pamphlet you promised me containing the debates about churchgoing in which i find so interesting a text for my concluding letter that i must still let my soldiers stand at ease for a little while look at its twentyfifth page and you will find in the speech of mr thomas carpenter this beautiful explanation of the admitted change in the general public mind of which mr thomas for his part highly approves the getting out of the unreasonable habit of paying respect to anybody there were many reasons to mr thomass mind why the working classes did not attend places of worship one was that the parson was regarded as an object of reverence in the little town he came from if a poor man did not make a bow to the parson he was a marked man this was no doubt wearing away to a great extent the base habit of making bows because the poor man was beginning to get education and to think for himself it was only while the priest kept the press from him that he was kept ignorant and was compelled to bow as it were to the parson it was the case all over england the clergyman seemed to think himself something superior now he mr thomas did not admit there was any inferiority laughter audience throughout course of meeting mainly in the right except perhaps on the score of his having received a classical education which the poor man could not get  now my dear friend here is the element which is the veriest devil of all that have got into modern flesh this infidelity of the nineteenth century st thomas in there being anything better than himself alivea coupled as it always is with the farther resolutionif unwillingly convinced of the factto seal the better living thing down again out of his way under the first stone handy i had not intended till we entered on the second section of our inquiry namely into the influence of gentleness having hitherto you see been wholly concerned with that of justice to give you the clue out of our dilemma about equalities produced by education but by the speech of our superior carpenter i am driven into it at once and it is perhaps as well      a compare crown of wild olive § 136  170 the speech is not observe without its own root of truth at the bottom of it nor at all as i think ill intended by the speaker but you have in it a clear instance of what i was saying in the sixteenth of these lettersthat education was desired by the lower orders because they thought it would make them upper orders and be a leveler and effacer of distinctions they will be mightily astonished when they really get it to find that it is on the contrary the fatalest of all discerners and enforcers of distinctions piercing even to the division of the joints and marrow to find out wherein your body and soul are less or greater than other bodies and souls and to sign deed of separation with unequivocal seal  171 education is indeed of all differences not divinely appointed an instant effacer and reconciler whatever is undivinely poor it will make rich whatever is undivinely maimed and halt and blind it will make whole and equal and seeing the blind and the lame are to it as to david at the siege of the tower of the kings hated of davids soul but there are other divinelyappointed differences eternal as the ranks of the everlasting hills and as the strength of their ceaseless waters and these education does not do away with but measures manifests and employs  in the handful of shingle which you gather from the seabeach which the indiscriminate sea with equality of fraternal foam has only educated to be every one round you will see little difference between the noble and mean stones but the jewelers trenchant education of them will tell you another story even the meanest will be better for it but the noblest so much better that you can class the two together no more the fair veins and colors are all clear now and so stern is natures intent regarding this that not only will the polish show which is best but the best will take most polish you shall not merely see they have more virtue than the others but see that more of virtue more clearly and the less virtue there is the more dimly you shall see what there is of it  172 and the law about education which is sorrowfulest to vulgar pride is thisthat all its gains are at compound interest so that as our work proceeds every hour throws us farther behind the greater men with whom we began on equal terms two children go to school hand in hand and spell for half an hour over the same page through all their lives never shall they spell from the same page more one is presently a page aheadtwo pages ten pagesand evermore though each toils equally the interval enlargesat birth nothing at death infinite  173 and by this you may recognize true education from false false education is a delightful thing and warms you and makes you every day think more of yourself and true education is a deadly cold thing with a gorgons head on her shield and makes you every day think worse of yourself  worse in two ways also mores the pity it is perpetually increasing the personal sense of ignorance and the personal sense of fault and this last is the truth which is at the bottom of the common evangelical notion about conversion and which the devil has got hold of and hidden until instead of seeing and confessing personal ignorance and fault as compared with the sense and virtue of others people see nothing but corruption in human nature and shelter their own sins under accusation of their race the worst of all assertions of equality and fraternity and so they avoid the blessed and strengthening pain of finding out wherein they are fools as compared with other men by calling everybody else a fool too and avoid the pain of discerning their own faults by vociferously claiming their share in the great capital of original sin  i must also therefore tell you here what properly ought to have begun the next following section of our subjectthe point usually unnoticed in the parable of the prodigal son  174 first have you ever observed that all christs main teachings by direct order by earnest parable and by his own permanent emotion regard the use and misuse of money we might have thought if we had been asked what a divine teacher was most likely to teach that he would have left inferior persons to give directions about money and himself spoken only concerning faith and love and the discipline of the passions and the guilt of the crimes of soul against soul but not so he speaks in general terms of these but he does not speak parables about them for all mens memory nor permit himself fierce indignation against them in all mens sight the pharisees bring him an adulteress he writes her forgiveness on the dust of which he had formed her another despised of all for known sin he recognized as a giver of unknown love but he acknowledges no love in buyers and sellers in his house one should have thought there were people in that house twenty times worse than theycaiaphas and his likefalse priests false prayermakers false leaders of the peoplewho needed putting to silence or to flight with darkest wrath but the scourge is only against the traffickers and thieves the two most intense of all the parables the two which lead the rest in love and terror this of the prodigal and of dives relate both of them to management of riches the practical order given to the only seeker of advice of whom it is recorded that christ loved him is briefly about his property sell that thou hast  and the arbitrament of the day of the last judgment is made to rest wholly neither on belief in god nor in any spiritual virtue in man nor on freedom from stress of stormy crime but on this only i was an hungered and ye gave me drink naked and ye clothed me sick and ye came unto me  175 well then the first thing i want you to notice in the parable of the prodigal son and the last thing which people usually do notice in it isthat it is about a prodigal he begins by asking for his share of his fathers goods he gets it carries it off and wastes it it is true that he wastes it in riotous living but you are not asked to notice in what kind of riot he spends it with harlotsbut it is not the harlotry which his elder brother accuses him of mainly but of having devoured his fathers living nay it is not the sensual life which he accuses himself ofor which the manner of his punishment accuses him of but the wasteful life it is not said that he had become debauched in soul or diseased in body by his vice but that at last he would fain have filled his belly with husks and could not it is not said that he was struck with remorse for the consequences of his evil passions but only that he remembered there was bread enough and to spare even for the servants at home  now my friend do not think i want to extenuate sins of passion though in very truth the sin of magdalene is a light one compared to that of judas but observe sins of passion if of real passion are often the errors and backfalls of noble souls but prodigality is mere and pure selfishness and essentially the sin of an ignoble or undeveloped creature and i would rather ten times rather hear of a youth that certain degrees of temptation and conditions of resistance being understood he had fallen into any sin you chose to name of all the mortal ones than that he was in the habit of running bills which he could not pay  farther though i hold that the two crowning and most accursed sins of the society of this present day are the carelessness with which it regards the betrayal of women and the brutality with which it suffers the neglect of children both these head and chief crimes and all others are rooted first in abuse of the laws and neglect of the duties concerning wealth and thus the love of money with the parallel and observe mathematically commensurate looseness in management of it the mal tener followed necessarily by the mal dare is indeed the root of all evil  176 then secondly i want you to note that when the prodigal comes to his senses he complains of nobody but himself and speaks of no unworthiness but his own he says nothing against any of the women who tempted himnothing against the citizen who left him to feed on husksnothing of the false friends of whom no man gave unto himabove all nothing of the corruption of human nature or the corruption of things in general he says that he himself is unworthy as distinguished from honorable persons and that he himself has sinned as distinguished from righteous persons and that is the hard lesson to learn and the beginning of faithful lessons all right and fruitful humility and purging of heart and seeing of god is in that it is easy to call yourself the chief of sinners expecting every sinner round you to declineor returnthe compliment but learn to measure the real degrees of your own relative baseness and to be ashamed not in heavens sight but in mans sight and redemption is indeed begun observe the phrase i have sinned against heaven against the great law of that and before thee visibly degraded before my human sire and guide unworthy any more of being esteemed of his blood and desirous only of taking the place i deserve among his servants  177 now i do not doubt but that i shall set many a readers teeth on edge by what he will think my carnal and material rendering of this beautiful parable but i am just as ready to spiritualize it as he is provided i am sure first that we understand it if we want to understand the parable of the sower we must first think of it as of literal husbandry if we want to understand the parable of the prodigal we must first understand it as of literal prodigality and the story has also for us a precious lesson in this literal sense of it namely this which i have been urging upon you throughout these letters that all redemption must begin in subjection and in the recovery of the sense of fatherhood and authority as all ruin and desolation begin in the loss of that sense the lost son began by claiming his rights he is found when he resigns them he is lost by flying from his father when his fathers authority was only paternal he is found by returning to his father and desiring that his authority may be absolute as over a hired stranger  and this is the practical lesson i want to leave with you and all other working men  178 you are on the eve of a great political crisis and every rascal with a tongue in his head will try to make his own stock out of you now this is the test you must try them with those that say to you stand up for your rightsget your division of livingbe sure that you are as well off as others and have what they havedont let any man dictate to youhave not you all a right to your opinionare you not all as good as everybody elselet us have no governors or fatherslet us all be free and alike those i say who speak thus to you take nelsons rough order forand hate them as you do the devil for they are his ambassadors but those the few who have the courage to say to you my friends you and i and all of us have somehow got very wrong weve been hardly treated certainly but here we are in a piggery mainly by our own fault hungry enough and for ourselves anything but respectable we must get out of this there are certainly laws we may learn to live by and there are wiser people than we are in the world and kindly ones if we can find our way to them and an infinitely wise and kind father above all of them and us if we can but find our way to him and ask him to take us for servants and put us to any work he will so that we may never leave him more the people who will say that to you and for by no saying but by their fruits only you shall finally know them who are themselves orderly and kindly and do their own business welltake those for your guides and trust them on ice and rock alike tie yourselves well together with them and with much scrutiny and cautious walking perhaps nearly as much back as forward at first you will verily get off the glacier and into meadow land in gods time  179 i meant to have written much to you respecting the meaning of that word hired servants and to have gone on to the duties of soldiers for you know soldier means a person who is paid to fight with regular payliterally with soldi or sousthe penny a day of the vineyard laborers but i cant now only just this much that our whole system of work must be based on the nobleness of soldiershipso that we shall all be soldiers of either plowshare or sword and literally all our actual and professed soldiers whether professed for a time only or for life must be kept to hard work of hand when not in actual war their honor consisting in being set to service of more pain and danger than others to lifeboat service to redeeming of ground from furious rivers or seaor mountain ruin to subduing wild and unhealthy land and extending the confines of colonies in the front of miasm and famine and savage races  and much of our harder home work must be done in a kind of soldiership by bands of trained workers sent from place to place and town to town doing with strong and sudden hand what is needed for help and setting all things in more prosperous courses for the future  of all which i hope to speak in its proper place after we know what offices the higher arts of gentleness have among the lower ones of force and how their prevalence may gradually change spear to pruninghook over the face of all the earth  180 and nowbut one word moreeither for you or any other readers who may be startled at what i have been saying as to the peculiar stress laid by the founder of our religion on right dealing with wealth let them be assured that it is with no fortuitous choice among the attributes or powers of evil that mammon is assigned for the direct adversary of the master whom they are bound to serve you cannot by any artifice of reconciliation be gods soldier and his nor while the desire of gain is within your heart can any true knowledge of the kingdom of god come there no one shall enter its strongholdno one receive its blessing except he that hath clean hands and a pure heart clean hands that have done no cruel deedpure heart that knows no base desire and therefore in the highest spiritual sense that can be given to words be assured not respecting the literal temple of stone and gold but of the living temple of your body and soul that no redemption nor teaching nor hallowing will be anywise possible for it until these two verses have been for it also fulfilled  and he went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold therein and them that bought and he taught daily in the temple     appendices     appendix i  page 21expenditure on science and art   the following is the passage referred to the fact it relates is so curious and so illustrative of our national interest in science that i do not apologize for the repetition  two years ago there was a collection of the fossils of solenhofen to be sold in bavaria the best in existence containing many specimens unique for perfectness and one unique as an example of a species a whole kingdom of unknown living creatures being announced by that fossil this collection of which the mere market worth among private buyers would probably have been some thousand or twelve hundred pounds was offered to the english nation for seven hundred but we would not give seven hundred and the whole series would have been in the munich museum at this moment if professor owena had not with loss of his own time and patient tormenting of the british public in the person of its representatives got leave to give four hundred pounds at once and himself become answerable for the other threewhich the said public will doubtless pay him eventually but sulkily and caring nothing about the matter all the while only always ready to cackle if any credit comes of it consider i beg of you arithmetically what this fact means your annual expenditure for public purposes a third of it for military apparatus is at least fifty millions now seven hundred pounds is to fifty million pounds roughly as seven pence to two thousand pounds suppose then a gentleman of unknown income but whose wealth was to be conjectured from the fact that he spent two thousand a year on his park walls and footmen only professes himself fond of science and that one of his servants comes eagerly to tell him that an unique collection of fossils giving clue to a new era of creation is to be had for the sum of sevenpence sterling and that the gentleman who is fond of science and spends two thousand a year on his park answers after keeping his servant waiting several months well ill give you fourpence for them if you will be answerable for the extra threepence yourself till next year      a i originally stated this fact without professor owens     permission which of course he could not with propriety     have granted had i asked it but i considered it so     important that the public should be aware of the fact that i     did what seemed to me right though rude     appendix ii  page 33legislation of frederick the great   the following are the portions of mr dixons letters referred to  well i am now busy with frederick the great i am not now astonished that carlyle calls him great neither that this work of his should have had such a sad effect upon him in producing it when i see the number of volumes he must have had to wade through to produce such a clear terse set of utterances and yet i do not feel the work as a book likely to do a reader of it the good that some of his other books will do it is truly awful to read these battles after battles lies after lies called diplomacy its fearful to read all this and one wonders how he that set himself to thishe of all mencould have the rare patience to produce such a labored heartrending piece of work again when one reads of the stupidity the shameful waste of our moneys by our forefathers to see our national debt the curse to our labor now the millstone to our commerce to our fair chance of competition in our day thus created and for what even carlyle cannot tell then how are we to tell now who will deliver us that is the question who will help us in these days of idle or no work while our foreign neighbors have plenty and are actually selling their produce to our men of capital cheaper than we can make it houserent getting dearer taxes getting dearer rates clothing food etc sad times my master do seem to have fallen upon us and the cause of nearly all this lies embedded in that frederick and yet so far as i know of it no critic has yet given an exposition of such laying there for our behoof is there no one that will take this that there lies so woven in with much other stuff so sad to read to any man that does not believe man was made to fight alone to be a butcher of his fellowman who will do this work or piece of work so that all who care may know how it is that our debt grew so large and a great deal more that we ought to knowthat clearly is one great reason why the book was written and was printed well i hope some day all this will be clear to our people and some man or men will arise and sweep us clear of these hindrances these sad drawbacks to the vitality of our work in this world                            57 nile street sunderland feb 7 1867  dear sir  i beg to acknowledge the receipt of two letters as additions to your books which i have read with deep interest and shall take care of them and read them over again so that i may thoroughly comprehend them and be able to think of them for future use i myself am not fully satisfied with our cooperation and never have been it is too much tinged with the very elements that they complain of in our present systems of tradeselfishness i have for years been trying to direct the attention of the editor of the cooperator to such evils that i see in it now further i may state that i find you and carlyle seem to agree quite on the idea of the masterhood qualification there again i find you both feel and write as all working men consider just i can assure you there is not an honest noble working man that would not by far serve under such masterhood than be the employé or workman of a cooperative store working men do not as a rule make good masters neither do they treat each other with that courtesy as a noble master treats his working man george fox shadows forth some such treatment that friends ought to make law and guidance for their working men and slaves such as you speak of in your letters i will look the passage up as it is quite to the point so far as i now remember it in vol vi of frederick the great i find a great deal there that i feel quite certain if our queen or government could make law thousands of english working men would hail it with such a shout of joy and gladness as would astonish the continental world these changes suggested by carlyle and placed before the thinkers of england are the noblest the truest utterances on real kinghood that i have ever read the more i think over them the more i feel the truth the justness and also the fitness of them to our nations present dire necessities yet this is the man and these are the thoughts of his that our critics seem never to see or if seen dont think worth printing or in any way wisely directing the attention of the public thereto alas all this and much more fills me with such sadness that i am driven almost to despair i see from the newspapers yorkshire lancashire and other places are sternly endeavoring to carry out the short time movement until such times as trade revives and i find the masters and men seem to adopt it with a good grace and friendly spirit i also beg to inform you i see a mr morley a large manufacturer at nottingham has been giving pensions to all his old workmen i hope such a noble example will be followed by other wealthy masters it would do more to make a master loved honored and cared for than thousands of pounds expended in other ways the government savings banks is one of the wisest acts of late years done by our government i myself often wish the government held all our banks instead of private men that would put an end to false speculations such as we too often in the provinces suffer so severely by so i hail with pleasure and delight the shadowing forth by you of these noble plans for the future i feel glad and uplifted to think of the good that such teaching will do for us all                                            yours truly                                                      thomas dixon                           57 nile street sunderland feb 24 1867  dear sir  i now give you the references to frederick the great vol vi land question 365 page where he increases the number of small farmers to 4000 202 204 english soldiers and t cs remarks on our system of purchase etc his law 620 623 624 state of poland and how he repaired it 487 488 489 490 i especially value the way he introduced all kinds of industries therein and so soon changed the chaos into order again the schoolmasters also are given not yet in england says t c again the use he made of 15000l surplus in brandenburg how it was applied to better his staff of masters to me the vol vi is one of the wisest pieces of modern thought in our language i only wish i had either your power c kingsley maurice or some such able pengeneralship to illustrate and show forth all the wise teaching on law government and social life i see in it and shining like a star through all its pagesa i feel also the truth of all you have written and will do all i can to make such men or women that care for such thoughts see it or read it i am copying the letters as fast and as well as i can and will use my utmost endeavor to have them done that justice to they merit                                            yours truly                                                      thomas dixon      a i have endeavored to arrange some of the passages to     which mr dixon here refers in a form enabling the reader to     see their bearing on each other more distinctly as a sequel     to the essay on war in the crown of wild olive     appendix iii  page 33effect of modern entertainments on the mind of youth   the letter of the times correspondent referred to contained an account of one of the most singular cases of depravity ever brought before a criminal court but it is unnecessary to bring any of its details under the readers attention for nearly every other number of our journals has of late contained some instances of atrocities before unthought of and it might have seemed impossible to humanity the connection of these with the modern love of excitement in the sensational novel and drama may not be generally understood but it is direct and constant all furious pursuit of pleasure ending in actual desire of horror and delight in death i entered into some fuller particulars on this subject in a lecture given in the spring at the royal institution  any part of the lecture referred to likely to be of permanent interest will be printed somewhere in this series     appendix iv  page 76drunkenness as the cause of crime   the following portions of mr dixons letter referred to will be found interesting   dear sir  your last letter i think will arouse the attention of thinkers more than any of the series it being on topics they in general feel more interested in than the others especially as in these you do not assail their pockets so much as in the former ones since you seem interested with the notes or rough sketches on gin g    of dublin was the man i alluded to as making his money by drink and then giving the results of such traffic to repair the cathedral of dublin it was thousands of pounds i call such charity robbing peter to pay paul immense fortunes are made in the liquor traffic and i will tell you why it is all paid for in cash at least such as the poor people buy they get credit for clothes butchers meat groceries etc while they give the ginpalace keeper cash they never begrudge the price of a glass of gin or beer they never haggle over its price never once think of doing that but in the purchase of almost every other article they haggle and begrudge its price to give you an idea of its profitsthere are houses here whose average weekly takings in cash at their bars is 50l 60l 70l 80l 90l to 150l per week nearly all the men of intelligence in it say it is the curse of the working classes men whose earnings are say 20s to 30s per week spend on the average 3s to 6s per week some even 10s its my mode of living to supply these houses with corks that makes me see so much of the drunkenness and that is the cause why i never really cared for my trade seeing the misery that was entailed on my fellow men and women by the use of this stuff again a house with a license to sell spirits wine and ale to be consumed on the premises is worth two to three times more money than any other class of property one house here worth nominally 140l sold the other day for 520l another one worth 200l sold for 800l i know premises with a license that were sold for 1300l and then sold again two years after for 1800l another place was rented for 50l now rents at 100lthis last is a house used by working men and laborers chiefly no i honor men like sir w trevelyan that are teetotalers or total abstainers as an example to poor men and to prevent his workpeople being tempted will not allow any publichouse on his estate if our land had a few such men it would help the cause we possess one such a man here a banker i feel sorry to say the progress of temperance is not so great as i would like to see it the only religious body that approaches to your ideas of political economy is quakerism as taught by george fox carlyle seems deeply tinged with their teachings silence to them is as valuable to him again why should people howl and shriek over the law that the alliance is now trying to carry out in our land called the permissive bill if we had just laws we then would not be so miserable or so much annoyed now and then with cries of reform and cries of distress i send you two pamphletsone gives the working mans reasons why he dont go to church in it you will see a few opinions expressed very much akin to those you have written to me the other gives an account how it is the poor indians have died of famine simply because they have destroyed the very system of political economy or one having some approach to it that you are now endeavoring to direct the attention of thinkers to in our country the sesame and lilies i have read as you requested i feel now fully the aim and object you have in view in the letters but i cannot help directing your attention to that portion where you mention or rather exclaim against the florentines pulling down their ancient walls to build a boulevard that passage is one that would gladden the hearts of all true italians especially men that love italy and dante     appendix v  page 78abuse of food   paragraphs cut from manchester examiner of march

hesitation in complying with the request and immediately called one of the waiters and desired him to follow him he went into the office unbuttoned a certain indispensable garment and taking off a broad leather belt somewhat startled the waiter by displaying two hundred gold pieces each worth one hundred francs taking up one of them he tossed it to the waiter and desired him to pay whatever he owed he never again appeared at that restaurant and died a few days ago of indigestion   revenge in a ballrooma distressing event lately took place at castellaz a little commune of the alpesmaritimes near mentone all the young people of the place being assembled in a dancingroom one of the young men was seen to fall suddenly to the ground whilst a young woman his partner brandished a poniard and was preparing to inflict a second blow on him having already desperately wounded him in the stomach the author of the crime was at once arrested she declared her name to be marie p twentyone years of age and added that she had acted from a motive of revenge the young man having led her astray formerly with a promise of marriage which he had never fulfilled in the morning of that day she had summoned him to keep his word and upon his refusal had determined on making the dancingroom the scene of her revenge she was at first locked up in the prison of mentone and afterwards sent on to nice the young man continues in an alarming state     appendix vi  page 94regulations of trade   i print portions of two letters of mr dixons in this place one referring to our former discussion respecting the sale of votes                          57 nile street sunderland march 21 1867  i only wish i could write in some tolerable good style so that i could idealize or rather realize to folks the life and love and marriage of a working man and his wife it is in my opinion a working man that really does know what a true wife is for his every want his every comfort in life depends on her and his childrens home their daily lives and future lives are shaped by her napoleon wisely said france needs good mothers more than brave men good mothers are the makers or shapers of good and brave men i cannot say that these are the words but it is the import of his speech on the topic we have a saying amongst us the man may spend and money lend if his wife be oughti e good wifebut he may work and try to save but will have nought if his wife be noughti e bad or thriftless wife  now since you are intending to treat of the working mans parliament and its duties i will just throw out a few suggestions of what i consider should be the questions or measures that demand an early inquiry into and debate on that guilds be established in every town where masters and men may meet so as to avoid the temptations of the publichouse and drink and then let it be made law that every lad should serve an apprenticeship of not less than seven years to a trade or art before he is allowed to be a member of such guild also that all wages be based on a rate of so much per hour and not day as at present and let every man prove his workmanship before such a guild and then allow to him such payment per hour as his craft merits let there be three grades and then let there be trials of skill in workmanship every year and then if the workman of the third grade prove that he has made progress in his craft reward him accordingly then before a lad is put to any trade why not see what he is naturally fitted for combes book entitled the constitution of man throws a good deal of truth on to these matters now here are two branches of the science of life that so far have never once been given trial of in this way we certainly use them after a crime has been committed but not till then  next to that cash payment for all and everything needed in life credit is a curse to him that gives it and that takes it he that lives by credit lives in general carelessly if there was no credit people then would have to live on what they earned then after that the statute of limitations of fortune you propose by the hour system not a single man need be idle it would give employment to all and even two hours per day would realize more to a man than breaking stones thus you would make every one selfdependentalso no fear of being out of work altogether then let there be a government fund for all the savings of the working man i am afraid you will think this a wild discursive sort of a letter                                            yours truly                                                      thomas dixon   i have read your references to the times on bribery well that has long been my own opinion they simply have a vote to sell and sell it the same way as they sell potatoes or a coat or any other salable article voters generally say what does this gentleman want in parliament why to help himself and his family or friends he does not spend all the money he spends over his election for pure good of his country no its to benefit his pocket to be sure why should i not make a penny with my vote as well as he does with his in parliament i think that if the system of canvassing or election agents were done away with and all personal canvassing for votes entirely abolished it would help to put down bribery let each gentleman send to the electors his political opinions in a circular and then let papers be sent or cards to each elector and then let them go and record their votes in the same way they do for a councillor in the corporation it would save a great deal of expense and prevent those scenes of drunkenness so common in our towns during elections bewicks opinions of these matters are quite to the purpose i think see page 201 of memoir again respecting the paris matter referred to in your last letter i have read it does it not manifest plainly enough that europeans are also in a measure possessed with that same demoniacal spirit like the japanese     appendix vii   the following letter did not form part of the series written to mr dixon but is perhaps worth reprinting i have not the date of the number of the gazette in which it appeared but it was during the tailors strike in london     to the editor of the pall mall gazette  sir  in your yesterdays article on strikes you have very neatly and tersely expressed the primal fallacy of modern political economyto wit that the value of any piece of labor cannot be definedand that all that can be ascertained is simply whether any man can be got to do it for a certain sum now sir the value of any piece of labor that is to say the quantity of food and air which will enable a man to perform it without losing actually any of his flesh or his nervous energy is as absolutely fixed a quantity as the weight of powder necessary to carry a given ball a given distance and within limits varying by exceedingly minor and unimportant circumstances it is an ascertainable quantity i told the public this five years agoand under pardon of your politicoeconomical contributorsit is not a sentimental but a chemical fact  let any halfdozen of recognized london physicians state in precise terms the quantity and kind of food and space of lodging they consider approximately necessary for the healthy life of a laborer in any given manufacture and the number of hours he may without shortening his life work at such business daily if so sustained  and let all masters be bound to give their men a choice between an order for that quantity of food and lodging or such wages as the market may offer for that number of hours work  proper laws for the maintenance of families would require further concessionbut in the outset let but this law of wages be established and if then we have any more strikes you may denounce them without one word of remonstrance either from sense or sensibility                                    i am sir                                          your obedient servant                                                       john ruskin
