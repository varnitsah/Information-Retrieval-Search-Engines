12381726	grisly grisell or the laidly lady of whitburn  a tale of the wars of the roses     chapter ian explosion    it was a great pity so it was this villanous saltpetre should be diggd out of the bowels of the harmless earth  shakespeare king henry iv part i  a terrible shriek rang through the great manorhouse of amesbury  it was preceded by a loud explosion and there was agony as well as terror in the cry  then followed more shrieks and screams some of pain some of fright others of anger and recrimination  every one in the house ran together to the spot whence the cries proceeded namely the lower court where the armourer and blacksmith had their workshops  there was a group of children the young people who were confided to the great earl richard and countess alice of salisbury for education and training  boys and girls were alike there some of the latter crying and sobbing others mingling with the lads in the hot dispute as to who did it  by the time the gentle but stately countess had reached the place all the grownup persons of the establishmentknights squires grooms scullions and females of every degreehad thronged round them but parted at her approach though one of the knights said nay lady countess tis no sight for you  the poor little maid is dead or nigh upon it  but who is it  what is it asked the countess still advancing  a confused medley of voices replied the lord of whitburns little wenchleonard copelandgunpowder  and no marvel said a sturdy begrimed figure if the malapert young gentles be let to run all over the courts and handle that with which they have no concern lads and wenches alike  nay how can i stop it when my lady will not have the maidens kept ever at their distaffs and needles in seemly fashion cried a small but stout and selfassertive dame known as mother of the maidens then starting oh my lady i crave your pardon i knew not you were in this coil  and if the menatarms be let to have their perilous goods strewn all over the place no wonder at any mishap  do not wrangle about the cause said the countess  who is hurt how much  the crowd parted enough for her to make way to where a girl of about ten was lying prostrate and bleeding with her head on a womans lap  poor maid was the cry poor maid  tis all over with her  it will go ill with young leonard copeland  worse with hodge smith for letting him touch his irons  nay what call had dick jenner to lay his foul burning gunpowdera device of satanin this yard  a mercy we are not all blown to the winds  the countess again ordering peace reached the girl whose moans showed that she was still alive and between the barbersurgeon and the porters wife she was lifted up and carried to a bed the countess alice keeping close to her though the mother of the maidens who was a somewhat helpless personage hung back declaring that the sight of the wounds made her swoon  there were terrible wounds upon the face and neck which seemed to be almost bared of skin  the lady who had been bred to some knowledge of surgical skill together with the barbersurgeon did their best to allay the agony with applications of sweet oil  perhaps if they had had more of what was then considered skill it might have been worse for her  the countess remained anxiously trying all that could allay the suffering of the poor little semiconscious patient who kept moaning for nurse  she was grisell dacre the daughter of the baron of whitburn and had been placed young as she was in the household of the countess of salisbury on her mother being made one of the ladies attending on the young queen margaret of anjou lately married to king henry vi  attendance on the patient had prevented the countess from hearing the history of the accident but presently the clatter of horses feet showed that her lord was returning and committing the girl to her old nurse she went down to the hall to receive him  the grave grizzled warrior had taken his seat on his crosslegged roundbacked chair and a boy of some twelve years old stood before him in a sullen attitude one foot over the other and his shoulder held fast by a squire while the motley crowd of retainers stood behind  there was a move at the entrance of the lady and her husband rose came forward and as he gave her the courteous kiss of greeting demanded what is all this coil  is the little wench dead  nay but i fear me she cannot live was the answer  will dacre of whitburns maid  thats ill poor child  how fell it out  that i know as little as you was the answer  i have been seeing to the poor little maids hurts  lord salisbury placed her in the chair like his own  in point of fact she was countess in her own right he richard nevil had been created earl of salisbury in her right on the death of her father the staunch warrior of henry v in the siege of orleans  speak out leonard copeland said the earl  what hast thou done  the boy only growled i never meant to hurt the maid  speak to the point sir said lord salisbury sternly give yourself at least the grace of truth  leonard grew more silent under the show of displeasure and only hung his head at the repeated calls to him to speak  the earl turned to those who were only too eager to accuse him  he took a bar of iron from the forge so please you my lord and put it to the barrel of powder  is this true leonard demanded the earl again amazed at the frantic proceeding and leonard muttered aye vouchsafing no more and looking black as thunder at a fair handsome boy who pressed to his side and said uncle doffing his cap so please you my lord the barrels had just been brought in upon hob carters wain and leonard said they ought to have the lord earls arms on them  so he took a bar of hot iron from the forge to mark the saltire on them and thereupon there was this burst of smoke and flame and the maid who was leaning over prying into his doings had the brunt thereof  thanks to the saints that no further harm was done ejaculated the lady shuddering while her lord proceededit was not malice but malapert meddling then  master leonard copeland thou must be scourged to make thee keep thine hands off where they be not needed for the rest thou must await what my lord of whitburn may require take him away john ellerby chastise him and keep him in ward till we see the issue  leonard with his head on high marched out of the hall not uttering a word but shaking his shoulder as if to get rid of the squires grasp but only thereby causing himself to be gripped the faster  next lord salisburys severity fell upon hob the carter and hodge the smith for leaving such perilous wares unwatched in the court yard  servants were not dismissed for carelessness in those days but soundly flogged a punishment considered suitable to the blackguard at any age even under the mildest rule  the gunner being somewhat higher in position and not in charge at the moment was not called to account but the next question was how the mother of the maidsthe gouvernante in charge of the numerous damsels who formed the train of the lady of salisbury and were under education and trainingcould have permitted her maidens to stray into the regions appropriated to the yeomen and archers and others of the meine where they certainly had no business  it appeared that the good and portly lady had last seen the girls in the gardens a playing at the ball with some of the pages and that there on a sunny garden seat slumber had prevented her from discovering the absence of the younger part of the bevy  the demure elder damsels deposed that at the sound of wains coming into the court the boys had rushed off and the younger girls had followed them whether with or without warning was not made clear  poor little grisells condition might have been considered a sufficient warning nevertheless the two companions in her misdemeanour were condemned to a whipping to enforce on them a lesson of maidenliness and though the mother of the maids could not partake of the flagellation she remained under her lords and ladys grave displeasure and probably would have to submit to a severe penance from the priest for her carelessness  yet as she observed mistress grisell was a north country maid never couthly or conformable but like a boy who would moreover always be after leonard copeland whether he would or no  it was the more unfortunate as lord salisbury lamented to his wife because the copelands were devoted to the somerset faction and the king had been labouring to reconcile them to the dacres and to bring about a contract of marriage between these two unfortunate children but he feared that whatever he could do there would only be additional feud and bitterness though it was clear that the mishap was accidental  the lord of whitburn himself was in ireland with the duke of york while his lady was in attendance on the young queen and it was judged right and seemly to despatch to her a courier with the tidings of her daughters disaster although in point of fact where a house could number sons damsels were not thought of great value except as the means of being allied with other houses  a message was also sent to sir william copeland that his son had been the death of the daughter of whitburn for poor little grisell lay moaning in a state of much fever and great suffering so that the lady salisbury could not look at her nor hear her sighs and sobs without tears and the barbersurgeon unaccustomed to the effects of gunpowder had little or no hope of her life  leonard copelands mood was sullen not to say surly  he submitted to the chastisement without a word or cry for blows were the lot of boys of all ranks and were dealt out without much respect to justice and he also had to endure a sort of captivity in a dismal little circular room in a turret of the manorial house with merely a narrow loophole to look out from and this was only accessible by climbing up a steep broken slope of brickwork in the thickness of the wall  here however he was visited by his chief friend and comrade edmund plantagenet of york who found him lying on the floor building up fragments of stone and mortar into the plan of a castle  how dost thou leonard he asked  did old hal strike very hard  i reck not growled leonard  how long will my uncle keep thee here asked edmund sympathisingly  till my father comes unless the foolish wench should go and die she brought it on me the peevish girl  she is always after me when i want her least  yea is not she contracted to thee  so they say but at least this puts a stop to my being plagued with herdo what they may to me  theres an end to it if i hang for it  they would never hang thee  none knows what you traitor folk of nevil would do to a loyal house growled leonard  traitor saidst thou cried edmund clenching his fists  tis thy base somerset crew that be the traitors  ill brook no such word from thee burst forth leonard flying at him  ha ha laughed edmund even as they grappled  who is the traitor forsooth  why tis my father who should be king  tis whitefaced harry and his beauforts  the words were cut short by a blow from leonard and the warder presently found the two boys rolling on the floor together in hot contest  and meanwhile poor grisell was trying to frame with her torn and flayed cheeks and lips o lady lady visit it not on him  let not leonard be punished  it was my fault for getting into his way when i should have been in the garden  dear madge canst thou speak for him  madge was edmunds sister margaret of york who stood trembling and crying by grisells bed    chapter iithe broken match    the earl of salisbury called prudence  contemporary poem  little grisell dacre did not die though day after day she lay in a suffering condition tenderly watched over by the countess alice her mother had been summoned from attendance on the queen but at first there only was returned a message that if the maid was dead she should be embalmed and sent north to be buried in the family vault when her father would be at all charges  moreover that the boy should be called to account for his crime his father being as the lady of whitburn caused to be written an evilminded minion and fosterer of the house of somerset the very bane of the king and the enemies of the noble duke of york and earl of warwick  the story will be clearer if it is understood that the earl of salisbury was richard nevil one of the large family of nevil of raby castle in westmoreland and had obtained his title by marriage with alice montagu heiress of that earldom  his youngest sister had married richard plantagenet duke of york who being descended from lionel duke of clarence was considered to have a better right to the throne than the house of lancaster though this had never been put forward since the earlier years of henry v  salisbury had several sons  the eldest had married anne beauchamp and was in her right earl of warwick and had estates larger even than those of his father  he had not however as yet come forward and the disputes at court were running high between the friends of the duke of somerset and those of the duke of york  the king and queen both were known to prefer the house of somerset who were the more nearly related to henry and the more inclined to uphold royalty while york was considered as the champion of the people  the gentle king and the beauforts wished for peace with france the nation and with them york thought this was giving up honour land and plunder and suspected the queen as a frenchwoman of truckling to the enemy  jack cades rising and the murder of the duke of suffolk had been the outcome of this feeling  indeed lord salisburys messenger reported the country about london to be in so disturbed a state that it was no wonder that the lady of whitburn did not make the journey  she was not as the countess suspected a very tender mother  grisells moans were far more frequently for her nurse than for her but after some space they ceased  the child became capable of opening first one eye then the other and both barber and lady perceived that she was really unscathed in any vital part and was on the way to recovery though apparently with hopelessly injured features  leonard copeland had already been released from restraint and allowed to resume his usual place among the earls pages when the warder announced that he saw two parties approaching from opposite sides of the down one as if from salisbury the other from the north and presently he reported that the former wore the family badge a white rosette the latter none at all whence it was perceived that the latter were adherents of the beauforts of somerset for though the rose of snow had been already adopted by york somerset had in point of fact not plucked the red rose in the temple gardens nor was it as yet the badge of lancaster  presently it was further reported that the lady of whitburn was in the fore front of the party and the lord of salisbury hastened to receive her at the gates his suite being rapidly put into some order  she was a tall ruggedfaced north country dame not very smooth of speech and she returned his salute with somewhat rough courtesy demanding as she sprang off her horse with little aid lives my wench still  yes madam she lives and the leech trusts that she will yet be healed  ah  methought you would have sent to me if aught further had befallen her  be that as it may no doubt you have given the malapert boy his deserts  i hope i have madam began the earl  i kept him in close ward while she was in peril of death but  a fresh bugle blast interrupted him as there clattered through the resounding gate the other troop at sight of whom the lady of whitburn drew herself up redoubling her grim dignity and turning it into indignation as a young page rushed forward to meet the newcomers with a cry of father  lord father come at last then composing himself doffed his cap and held the stirrup then bent a knee for his fathers blessing  you told me lord earl the mischievous murderous fellow was in safe hold said the lady bending her dark brows  while the maid was in peril hastily answered salisbury  pardon me madam my countess will attend you  the countesss high rank and great power were impressive to the baroness of whitburn who bent in salutation but almost her first words were madam you at least will not let the murderous traitors of somerset and the queen prevail over the loyal friends of york and the nation  there is happily no murder in the case  praise be to the saints said countess alice your little maid  aye thats what they said as to the poor good duke humfrey returned the irate lady but that you madam the goodsister of the noble york should stand up for the enemies of him and the friends of france is more than a plain north country woman like me can understand  and therethere turning round upon the steep steps there is my lord earl hand and glove with that minion fellow of somerset who was no doubt at the bottom of the plot  none would believe it at raby  none at raby would believe that my lord could be lacking in courtesy to a guest returned lady salisbury with dignity nor that a north country dame could expect it of him  those who are under his roof must respect it by fitting demeanour towards one another  the lady of whitburn was quenched for the time and the countess asked whether she did not wish to see her daughter leading the way to a chamber hung with tapestry and with a great curtained bed nearly filling it up for the patient had been installed in one of the best guestchambers of the castle  lady whitburn was surprised but was too proud to show herself gratified by what she thought was the due of the dignity of the dacres  an old woman in a hood sat by the bed where there was a heap of clothes and a darkhaired little girl stood by the window whence she had been describing the arrivals in the castle court  here is your mother my poor child began the lady of salisbury but there was no token of joy  grisell gave a little gasp and tried to say lady mother pardon but the lady of whitburn at sight of the reddened half of the face which alone was as yet visible gave a cry she will be a fright  you evil little baggage thus to get yourself scarred and made hideous  running where you ought not i warrant and she put out her hand as if to shake the patient but the countess interposed and her niece margaret gave a little cry grisell is still very weak and feeble  she cannot bear much we have only just by heavens grace brought her round  as well she were dead as like this cried this untender parent who is to find her a husband now and as to a nunnery where is one to take her without a dower such as is hard to find with two sons to be fitly provided  i looked that in a household like this better rule should be kept  none can mourn it more than myself and the earl said the gentle countess but young folks can scarce be watched hour by hour  the rod is all that is good for them and i trusted to you to give it them madam said lady whitburn  now the least that can be done is to force yonder malapert lad and his father into keeping his contract to her since he has spoilt the market for any other  is he contracted to her asked the countess  not fully but as you know yourself lady your lord and the king and all the rest thought to heal the breach between the houses by planning a contract between their son and my daughter  he shall keep it now at his peril  grisell was cowering among her pillows and no one knew how much she heard or understood  the countess was glad to get lady whitburn out of the room but both she and her earl had a very trying evening in trying to keep the peace between the two parents  sir william copeland was devoted to the somerset family of whom he held his manor and had had a furious quarrel with the baron of whitburn when both were serving in france  the gentle king had tried to bring about a reconciliation and had induced the two fathers to consent to a contract for the future marriage of leonard copelands second son to grisell dacre then the only child of the lord of whitburn  he had also obtained that the two children should be bred up in the household of the earl of salisbury by way of letting them grow up together  on the same principle the lady of whitburn had been made one of the attendants of queen margaretbut neither arrangement had been more successful than most of those of poor king henry  grisell indeed considered leonard as a sort of property of hers but she beset him in the manner that boys are apt to resent from younger girls and when he was thirteen and she ten years old there was very little affection on his side  moreover the birth of two brothers had rendered grisells hand a far less desirable prize in the eyes of the copelands  to attend on the court was penance to the north country dame used to a hardy rough life in her seaside tower with absolute rule and no hand over her save her husbands while the young and outspoken queen bred up in the graceful poetical court of aix or nancy looked on her as no better than a barbarian and if she did not show this openly reporters were not wanting to tell her that the queen called her the great northern hag or that her rugged unwilling curtsey was said to look as if she were stooping to draw water at a well  her husband had kept her in some restraint but when be had gone to ireland with the duke of york offences seemed to multiply upon her  the last had been that when she had tripped on her train dropped the salver wherewith she was serving the queen and broken out with a loud lawk a daisy all the ladies and margaret herself had gone into fits of uncontrollable laughter and the queen had begged her to render her exclamation into good french for her benefit  madam she had exclaimed if a plain womans plain english be not good enough for you she can have no call here  and without further ceremony she had flown out of the royal presence  margaret of anjou naturally offended and never politic had sent her a message that her attendance was no longer required  so here she was going out of her way to make a casual inquiry from the court at winchester whether that very unimportant article her only daughter were dead or alive  the earl absolutely prohibited all conversation on affairs in debate during the supper which was spread in the hall with quite as much state as and even greater profusion and splendour than was to be found at windsor winchester or westminster  all the high born sat on the dais raised on two steps with gorgeous tapestry behind and a canopy overhead the earl and countess on chairs in the centre of the long narrow table  lady whitburn sat beside the earl sir william copeland by the countess watching with pleasure how deftly his son ran about among the pages carrying the trenchers of food and the cups  he entered on a conversation with the countess telling her of the kings interest and delight in his beautiful freshlyfounded colleges at eton and cambridge how the king rode down whenever he could to see the boys listen to them at their tasks in the cloisters watch them at their sports in the playing fields and join in their devotions in the chapela most holy example for them  ay for such as seek to be monks and shavelings broke in the north country voice sarcastically  there are otherssons of gentlemen and esquireslodged in houses around said sir william who are not meant for cowl or for mass priests  yea forsooth called lady whitburn across the earl and the countess what for but to make them as feckless as the priests unfit to handle lance or sword  so lady you think that the same hand cannot wield pen and lance said the earl  i should like to see one of your clerks on a border foray laughed the dame of dacre  tis all a device of the frenchwoman  verily said the earl in an interrogative tone  ay to take away the strength and might of englishmen with this clerkly lore so that her folk may have the better of them in france and the poor witless king gives in to her  and so while the beauforts rule the roast  salisbury caught her up  ay the roast  will you partake of these roast partridges madam  they were brought round skewered on a long spit held by a page for the guest to help herself  whether by her awkwardness or that of the boy it so chanced that the bird made a sudden leap from the impalement and deposited itself in the lap of lady whitburns scarlet kirtle  the fact was proclaimed by her loud rude cry a murrain on thee thou neerdoweel lad together with a sounding box on the ear  tis thine own greed who dost not  leonard be stillknow thy manners cried both at once the earl and sir william for unfortunately the offender was no other than leonard copeland and contrary to all the laws of pagedom he was too angry not to argue the point  twas no doing of mine  she knew not how to cut the bird  answering again was a far greater fault than the first and his father only treated it as his just desert when he was ordered off under the squire in charge to be soundly scourged all the more sharply for his continuing to mutter it was her fault  and sore and furrowed as was his back he continued to exclaim when his friend edmund of york came to condole with him as usual in all his scrapes tis she that should have been scourged for clumsiness a foul uncouth border dame  well one blessing at least is that now i shall never be wedded to her daughterlet the wench live or die as she lists  that was not by any means the opinion of the lady of whitburn and no sooner was the meal ended than in the midst of the hall the debate began the lady declaring that in all honour sir william copeland was bound to affiance his son instantly to her poor daughter all the more since the injuries he had inflicted to her face could never be done away with  on the other hand sir william copeland was naturally far less likely to accept such a daughterinlaw since her chances of being an heiress had ceased and he contended that he had never absolutely accepted the contract and that there had been no betrothal of the children  the earl of salisbury could not but think that a strictly honourable man would have felt poor grisells disaster inflicted by his sons hands all the more reason for holding to the former understanding but the loud clamours and rude language of lady whitburn were enough to set any one in opposition to her and moreover the words he said in favour of her side of the question appeared to copeland merely spoken out of the general enmity of the nevils to the beauforts and all their following  thus all the evening lady whitburn raged and appealed to the earl whose support she thought cool and unfriendly while copeland stood sullen and silent but determined  my lord she said were you a true friend to york and raby you would deal with this scowling fellow as we should on the border  we are not on the border madam quietly said salisbury  but you are in your own castle and can force him to keep faith  no contract forsooth  i hate your mincing south country forms of law then perhaps irritated by a little ironical smile which salisbury could not suppress  is this your castle or is it not  then bring him and his lad to my poor wenchs side and see their troth plighted or lay him by the heels in the lowest cell in your dungeon then will you do good service to the king and the duke of york whom you talk of loving in your shillyshally fashion  madam said the earl his grave tones coming in contrast to the shrill notes of the angry woman i counsel you in the south at least to have some respect to these same forms of law  i bid you a fair goodnight  the chamberlain will marshal you    chapter iiithe mirror    of all the maids the foulest maid    from teviot unto dee ah sighing said that lady then    can neer young hardens be  scott the reivers wedding  they are gone said margaret of york standing half dressed at the deepset window of the chamber where grisell lay in state in her big bed  who are gone asked grisell turning as well as she could under the great heraldicallyembroidered covering  leonard copeland and his father  didst not hear the horses tramp in the court  i thought it was only my lords horses going to the water  it was the copelands going off without breaking their fast or taking a stirrup cup like discourteous rogues as they be said margaret in no measured language  and are they gone  and wherefore asked grisell  wherefore but for fear my noble uncle of salisbury should hold them to their contract  sir william sat as surly as a bear just about to be baited while thy mother rated and raved at him like a very sleuthhound on the chase  and leonardwhat thinkst thou he saith that he would as soon wed the loathly lady as thee the cruel somerset villain as he is and yet my brother edmund is fain to love him  so off they are gone like recreant curs as they are lest my uncle should make them hear reason  but lady madge dear lady madge am i so very loathly asked poor grisell  mine aunt of salisbury bade that none should tell thee responded margaret in some confusion  ah me  i must know sooner or later  my mother she shrieked at sight of me  i would not have your mother said the outspoken daughter of proud cis  my lady duchess mother is stern enough if we do not bridle our heads and if we make ourselves too friendly with the meine but she never frets nor rates us and does not heed so long as we do not demean ourselves unlike our royal blood  she is no termagant like yours  it was not polite but grisell had not seen enough of her mother to be very sensitive on her account  in fact she was chiefly occupied with what she had heard about her own appearancea matter which had not occurred to her before in all her suffering  she returned again to entreat margaret to tell her whether she was so foully ill favoured that no one could look at her and the damsel of york adhering to the letter rather young than the spirit of the cautions which she had received pursed up her lips and reiterated that she had been commanded not to mention the subject  then entreated grisell dodo dear madgeonly bring me the little hand mirror out of my lady countesss chamber  i know not that i can or may  only for the space of one ave reiterated grisell  my lady aunt would never  thereharktheres the bell for mass  thou canst run into her chamber when she and the tirewomen are gone down  but i must be there  thou canst catch them up after  they will only think thee a sluga bed  madge dear madge prithee i cannot rest without  weeping will be worse for me  she was crying and caressing margaret so vehemently that she gained her point  indeed the other girl was afraid of her sobs being heard and inquired into and therefore promised to make the attempt keeping a watch out of sight till she had seen the lady of salisbury in her padded headgear of gold net and long purple train sweep down the stair followed by her tirewomen and maidens of every degree  then darting into the chamber she bore away from a stage where lay the articles of the toilette a little silverbacked and handled venetian mirror with beautiful tracery in silvered glass diminishing the very small oval left for personal reflection and inspection  that however was quite enough and too much for poor grisell when lady margaret had thrown it to her on her bed and rushed down the stair so as to come in the rear of the household just in time  a glance at the mirror disclosed not the fair rosy face set in light yellow curls that grisell had now and then peeped at in a bucket of water or a polished breastplate but a piteous sight  one half as she expected was hidden by bandages but the other was fiery red except that from the corner of the eye to the ear there was a purple scar the upper lip was distorted the hair eyebrows and lashes were all gone  the poor child was found in an agony of sobbing when after the service the old woman who acted as her nurse came stumping up in her wooden clogs to set the chamber and bed in order for lady whitburns visit  the dame was in hot haste to get home  rumours were rife as to scottish invasions and her tower was not too far south not to need to be on its guard  her plan was to pack grisell on a small litter slung to a sumpter mule and she snorted a kind of defiant contempt when the countess backed by the household barbersurgeon declared the proceeding barbarous and impossible  indeed she had probably forgotten that grisell was far too tall to be made up into the bundle she intended but she then declared that the wench might ride pillion behind old diccon and she would not be convinced till she was taken up to the sick chamber  there the first sound that greeted them was a choking agony of sobs and moans while the tirewoman stood over the bed exclaiming aye no wonder it serves thee right thou evil wench filching my lady countesss mirror from her very chamber when it might have been broken for all thanks to thee  the venice glass that the merchant gave her  thou art not so fair a sight i trow as to be in haste to see thyself  at the bottom of all the scathe in the castle  we shall be well rid of thee  so loud was the objurgation of the tirewoman that she did not hear the approach of her mistress nor indeed the first words of the countess hush maudlin the poor child is not to be thus rated silence  see my lady what she has done to your ladyships venice glass which she never should have touched  she must have run to your chamber while you were at mass  all false her feigning to be so sick and feeble  ay replied lady whitburn she must updon her clothes and away with me  hush i pray you madam  how how grisell my poor child  call master miles maudlin  give me that water  the countess was raising the poor child in her arms and against her bosom for the shock of that glance in the mirror followed by the maids harsh reproaches and fright at the arrival of the two ladies had brought on a choking hysterical sort of convulsive fit and the poor girl writhed and gasped on lady salisburys breast while her mother exclaimed heed her not lady it is all put on to hinder me from taking her home  if she could go stealing to your room  no no broke out a weeping frightened voice  it was i lady aunt  you bade me never tell her how her poor face looked and when she begged and prayed me i did not say but i fetched the mirror oh oh  it has not been the death of her  nay nay by gods blessing  take away the glass margaret  go and tell thy beads child thou hast done much scathe unwittingly  ah master miles come to the poor maids aid  canst do aught for her  these humours must be drawn off my lady said the barbersurgeon who advanced to the bed and felt the pulse of the poor little patient  i must let her blood  maudlin whose charge she was came to his help and countess alice still held her up while after the practice of those days he bled the already almost unconscious child till she fainted and was laid down again on her pillows under the keeping of maudlin while the clanging of the great bell called the family down to the meal which broke fast whether to be called breakfast or dinner  it was plain that grisell was in no state to be taken on a journey and her mother went grumbling down the stair at the unchancy bairn always doing scathe  lord salisbury beside whom she sat courteously though perhaps hardly willingly invited her to remain till her daughter was ready to move  nay my lord i am beholden to you but i may scarce do that  i be sorely needed at whitburn tower  the knaves go all agee when both my lord and myself have our backs turned and my lad bairnsworth a dozen of yon whining maidshould no longer be left to old cuthbert ridley and nurse  now the queen and somerset have their way tis all misrule and who knows what the scots may do  there are nevils and dacres enough between whitburn and the border observed the earl gravely  however the visitor was not such an agreeable one as to make him anxious to press her stay beyond what hospitality demanded and his wife could not bear to think of giving over her poor little patient to such usage as she would have met with on the journey  lady whitburn was overheard saying that those who had mauled the maid might mend her if they could and accordingly she acquiesced not too graciously when the countess promised to tend the child like her own and send her by and by to whitburn under a safe escort and as middleham castle lay on the way to whitburn it was likely that means would be found of bringing or sending her  this settled lady whitburn was restless to depart so as to reach a hostel before night  she donned her camlet cloak and hood and looked once more in upon grisell who after her loss of blood had on reviving been made to swallow a draught of which an infusion of poppy heads formed a great part so that she lay breathing heavily in a deep sleep moaning now and then  her mother did not scruple to try to rouse her with calls of grizzy  look up wench but could elicit nothing but a half turn on the pillow and a little louder moan and master miles who was still watching absolutely refused to let his patient be touched or shaken  well a day said lady whitburn softened for a moment what the saints will must be i trow but it is hard and i shall let st cuthbert of durham know it that after all the candles i have given him he should have let my poor maid be so mauled and marred and then forsaken by the rascal who did it so that she will never be aught but a dead weight on my two fair sons  the least he can do for me now is to give me my revenge upon that lurdane runaway knight and his son  but he hath no care for lassies  mayhap st hilda may serve me better  wherewith the lady of whitburn tramped down stairs  it may be feared that in the ignorance in which northern valleys were left she was very little more enlightened in her ideas of what would please the saints or what they could do for her than were the old heathen of some unknown antiquity who used to worship in the mysterious circles of stones which lay on the downs of amesbury    chapter ivparting    there in the holy house at almesbury weeping none with her save a little maid  tennyson idylls of the king  the agitations of that day had made grisell so much worse that her mind hardly awoke again to anything but present suffering from fever and in consequence the aggravation of the wounds on her neck and cheek  she used to moan now and then dont take me away or cower in terror she is coming being her cry or sometimes so foul and loathly  she hung again between life and death and most of those around thought death would be far better for the poor child but the countess and the chaplain still held to the faith that she must be reserved for some great purpose if she survived so much  great families with all their train used to move from one castle or manor to another so soon as they had eaten up all the produce of one place and the time had come when the nevils must perforce quit amesbury  grisell was in no state for a long journey she was exceedingly weak and as fast as one wound in her face and neck healed another began to break out so that often she could hardly eat and whether she would ever have the use of her left eye was doubtful  master miles was at his wits end maudlin was weary of waiting on her and so in truth was every one except the good countess and she could not always be with the sufferer nor could she carry such a patient to london whither her lord was summoned to support his brotherinlaw the duke of york against the duke of somerset  the only delay was caused by the having to receive the newly appointed bishop richard beauchamp who had been translated from his former see at hereford on the murder of his predecessor william ayscough by some of jack cades party  in full splendour he came with a train of chaplains and cross bearers and the clergy of salisbury sent a deputation to meet him and to arrange with him for his reception and installation  it was then that the countess heard that there was a nun at wilton abbey so skilled in the treatment of wounds and sores that she was thought to work miracles being likewise a very holy woman  the earl and countess would accompany the new bishop to be present at his enthronement and the ensuing banquet and the lady made this an opportunity of riding to the convent on her way back consulting the abbess whom she had long known and likewise seeing sister avice and requesting that her poor little guest might be received and treated there  there was no chance of a refusal for the great nobles were sovereigns in their own domains the countess owned half wiltshire and was much loved and honoured in all the religious houses for her devotion and beneficence  the nuns were only too happy to undertake to receive the demoiselle grisell dacre of whitburn or any other whom my lady countess would entrust to them and the abbess had no doubt that sister avice could effect a cure  lady salisbury dreaded that grisell should lie awake all night crying so she said nothing till her whirlicote as the carriage of those days was called was actually being prepared and then she went to the chamber where the poor child had spent five months and where she was now sitting dressed but propped up on a sort of settle and with half her face still bandaged  my little maid this is well said the countess  come with me  i am going to take thee to a kind and holy dame who will i trust with the blessing of heaven be able to heal thee better than we have done  oh lady lady do not send me away cried grisell not from you and madge  my child i must do so i am going away myself with my lord and madge is to go back with her brother to her father the duke  thou couldst not brook the journey and i will take thee myself to the good sister avice  a nun a nunnery sighed grisell  oh  i shall be mewed up there and never come forth again  do not i pray do not good my lady send me thither  perhaps my lady thought that to remain for life in a convent might be the fate and perhaps the happiest of the poor blighted girl but she only told her that there was no reason she should not leave wilton as she was not put there to take the vows but only to be cured  long nursing had made grisell unreasonable and she cried as much as she dared over the order but no child ventured to make much resistance to elders in those days and especially not to the countess so grisell a very poor little wasted being was carried down and only delayed in the hall for an affectionate kiss from margaret of york  and here is a keepsake grisell she said  mine own beauteous pouncet box with the forgetmenots in turquoises round each little hole  i will keep it for ever said grisell and they parted but not as girls part who hope to meet again and can write letters constantly but with tearful eyes and clinging hands as little like to meet again or even to hear more of one another  the whirlicote was not much better than an ornamental waggon and lady salisbury with the mother of the maids did their best to lessen the force of the jolts as by six stout horses it was dragged over the chalk road over the downs passing the wonderful stones of amesburya wider circle than even stonehenge though without the triliths ie the stones laid one over the tops of the other two like a doorway  grisell heard some thing murmured about merlin and arthur and guinevere but she did not heed and she was quite worn out with fatigue by the time they reached the descent into the long smooth valley where wilton abbey stood and the spire of the cathedral could be seen rising tall and beautiful  the convent lay low among meadows all shut in with fine elm trees and the cows belonging to the sisters were being driven home their bells tinkling  there was an outer court within an arched gate kept by a stout porter and thus far came the whirlicote and the countesss attendants but a lay porteress in a cap and veil and black dress came out to receive her as the door of the carriage was opened and held out her arms to receive the muffled figure of the little visitor  ah poor maid she said but sister avice will soon heal her  at the deeply ornamented round archway of the inner gate to the cloistered court stood the lady abbess at the head of all her sisters drawn up in double line to receive the countess whom they took to their refectory and to their chapel  of this however grisell saw nothing for she had been taken into the arms of a tall nun in a black veil  at first she shuddered and would have screamed if she had been a little stronger and less tired for illness and weakness had brought back the babyish horror of anything black but she felt soothed by the sweet voice and tender words poor little one she is fore spent  she shall lie down on a soft bed and have some sweet milk anon  still a deadly feeling of faintness came upon her before she had been carried to the little bed which had been made ready for her  when she opened her eyes while a spoon was held to her lips the first thing she saw was the sweetest calmest most motherly of faces bent over her one arm round her the other giving her the spoon of some cordial  she looked up and even smiled though it was a sad contorted smile which brought a tear into the good sisters eyes but then she fell asleep and only half awoke when the countess came up to see her for the last time and bade her farewell with a kiss on her forehead and a charge to sister avice to watch her well and be tender with her  indeed no one could look at sister avices gentle face and think there was much need of the charge  sister avice was one of the women who seem to be especially born for the gentlest tasks of womanhood  she might have been an excellent wife and mother but from the very hour of her birth she had been vowed to be a nun in gratitude on her mothers part for her fathers safety at agincourt  she had been placed at wilton when almost a baby and had never gone farther from it than on very rare occasions to the cathedral at salisbury but she had grown up with a wonderful instinct for nursing and healing and had a curious insight into the properties of herbs as well as a soft deft hand and touch so that for some years she had been sister infirmarer and moreover the sick were often brought to the gates for her counsel treatment or as some believed even her healing touch  when grisell awoke she was alone in the long large low room which was really built over the norman cloister  the walls were of pale creamy stone but at the end where she lay there were hangings of faded tapestry  at one end there was a window through the thick glass of which could be dimly seen as grisell raised herself a little beautiful trees and the splendid spire of the cathedral rising as she dreamily thought like a finger pointing upwards nearer were several more narrow windows along the side of the room and that beside her bed had the lattice open so that she saw a sloping green bank with a river at the foot and there was a trim garden between  opposite to her there seemed to be another window with a curtain drawn across it through which came what perhaps had wakened her a low clear murmuring tone pausing and broken by the full sweet if rather shrill response in womens voices  beneath that window was a little altar with a crucifix and two candlesticks a holywater stoup by the side and there was above the little deep window a carving of the blessed virgin with the holy child on either side a niche one with a figure of a nun holding a taper the other of a bishop with a book  grisell might have begun crying again at finding herself alone but the sweet chanting lulled her and she lay back on her pillows half dozing but quite content except that the wound on her neck felt stiff and dry and by and by when the chanting ceased the kind nun with a lay sister came back again carrying water and other appliances at sight of which grisell shuddered for master miles never touched her without putting her to pain  benedicite my little maid thou art awake said sister avice  i thought thou wouldst sleep till the vespers were ended  now let us dress these sad wounds of thine and thou shalt sleep again  grisell submitted as she knew she must but to her surprise sister avices touch was as soft and soothing as were her words and the ointment she applied was fragrant and delicious and did not burn or hurt her  she looked up gratefully and murmured her thanks and then the evening meal was brought in and she sat up to partake of it on the seat of the window looking out on the cathedral spire  it was a milk posset far more nicely flavoured than what she had been used to at amesbury where in spite of the countesss kindness the master cook had grown tired of any special service for the dacre wench and unless margaret of york secured fruit for her she was apt to be regaled with only the scraps that maudlin managed to cater for her after the meals were over  after that sister avice gently undressed her took care that she said her prayers and sat by her till she fell asleep herself telling her that she should sleep beside her and that she would hear the voices of the sisters singing in the chapel their matins and lauds  grisell did hear them as in a dream but she had not slept so well since her disaster as she slept on that night    chapter vsister avice    love to her ear was but a name combined with vanity and shame her hopes her fears her joys were all bounded within the cloister wall  scott marmion  sister avice sat in the infirmary diligently picking the leaves off a large mass of woodsorrel which had been brought to her by the children around to make therewith a conserve  grisell lay on her couch  she had been dressed and had knelt at the window where the curtain was drawn back while mass was said by the chaplain the nuns kneeling in their order and making their responses  it was a lowbrowed chapel of norman or even older days with circular arches and heavy round piers and so dark that the gleam of the candles was needed to light it  grisell watched till tired with kneeling she went back to her couch slept a little and then wondered to see sister avice still compounding her simples  she moved wearily and sighed for madge to come in and tell her all the news of amesburywho was riding at the ring or who had shot the best bolt or who had had her work picked out as not neat or well shaded enough  sister avice came and shook up her pillow and gave her a dried plum and a little milk and began to talk to her  you will soon be better she said and then you will be able to play in the garden  is there any playfellow for me asked grisell  there is a little maid from bemerton who comes daily to learn her hornbook and her sampler  mayhap she will stay and play with you  i had madge at amesbury i shall love no one as well as madge  see what she gave me  grisell displayed her pouncet box which was duly admired and then she asked wearily whether she should always have to stay in the convent  oh no not of need said the sister  many a maiden who has been here for a time has gone out into the world but some love this home the best as i have done  did yonder nun on the wall asked grisell  yea truly  she was bred here and never left it though she was a kings daughter  edith was her name and two days after holy cross day we shall keep her feast  shall i tell you her story  prithee prithee exclaimed grisell  i love a tale dearly  sister avice told the legend how st edith grew in love and tenderness at wilton and how she loved the gliding river and the flowers in the garden and how all loved her her young playmates especially  she promised one who went away to be wedded that she would be godmother to her first little daughter but ere the daughter was born the saintly edith had died  the babe was carried to be christened in the font at winchester cathedral and by a great and holy man no other than alphegius who was then bishop of winchester but was made archbishop of canterbury and died a holy martyr  then said sister avice there was a great marvel for among the sponsors around the square black font there stood another figure in the dress of our mother abbess and as the bishop spake and said bear this taper in token that thy lamp shall be alight when the bridegroom cometh the form held the torch shining bright clear and like no candle or light on earth ever shone and the face was the face of the holy edith  it is even said that she held the babe but that i know not being a spirit without a body but she spake the name her own name edith  and when the holy rite was over she had vanished away  and that is she with the lamp in her hand  oh i should have been afraid cried grisell  not of the holy soul said the sister  oh  i hope she will never come in here by the little window into the church cried grisell trembling  indeed for some time in spite of all sister avice could say grisell could not at night be free from the fear of a visit from st edith who as she was told slept her long sleep in the church below  it may be feared that one chief reliance was on the fact that she could not be holy enough for a vision of the saint but this was not so valuable to her as the touch of sister avices kind hand or the very knowing her present  that story was the prelude to many more  grisell wanted to hear it over again and then who was the archbishop martyr and who were the virgins in memory of whom the lamps were carried  both these and many another history parable or legend were told her by sister avice training her soul throughout the long recovery which was still very slow but was becoming more confirmed every day  grisell could use her eye turn her head and the wounds closed healthily under the sisters treatment without showing symptoms of breaking out afresh and she grew in strength likewise first taking a walk in the trim garden and orchard and by and by being pronounced able to join the other girl scholars of the convent  only here was the first demur  her looks did not recover with her health  she remained with a muchseamed neck and a terrible scar across each cheek on one side purple and her eyebrows were entirely gone  she seemed to have forgotten the matter while she was entirely in the infirmary with no companion but sister avice and occasionally a lay sister who came to help but the first time she went down the turret stair into the cloistera beautiful succession of arches round a green courtshe met a novice and a girl about her own age the elder gave a little scream at the sight and ran away  the other hung back  mary come hither said sister avice  this is grisell dacre who hath suffered so much  wilt thou not come and kiss and welcome her  mary came forward rather reluctantly but grisell drew up her head within oh if you had liefer not and turned her back on the girl  sister avice followed as grisell walked away as fast as her weakness allowed and found her sitting breathless at the third step on the stairs  oh nogo awaydont bring her  every one will hate me sobbed the poor child  avice could only gather her into her arms though embraces were against the strict rule of benedictine nuns and soothe and coax her to believe that by one at least she was not hated  i had forgotten said grisell  i saw myself once at amesbury but my face was not well then  let me see again sister  wheres a mirror  ah my child we nuns are not allowed the use of worldly things like mirrors i never saw one in my life  but oh for pitys sake tell me what like am i  am i so loathly  nay my dear maid i love thee too well to think of aught save that thou art mine own little one given back to us by the will of heaven aye and so will others think of thee if thou art good and loving to them  nay nay none will ever love me  all will hate and flee from me as from a basilisk or cockatrice or the loathly worm of spindlesheugh sobbed grisell  then my maid thou must win them back by thy sweet words and kind deeds  they are better than looks  and here too they shall soon think only of what thou art not of what thou lookst  but know you sister howhow i should have been married to leonard copeland the very youth that did me this despite and he is fair and beauteous as a very angel and i did love him so and now he and his father rid away from amesbury and left me because i am so foul to see cried grisell between her sobs  if they could treat thee thus despiteously he would surely not have made thee a good husband reasoned the sister  but i shall never have a husband now wailed grisell  belike not said sister avice but my sweetheart there is better peace and rest and cheer in such a home as this holy house than in the toils and labours of the world  when my sisters at dunbridge and dinton come to see me they look old and careworn and are full of tales of the turmoil and trouble of husbands and sons and dues and tenants fees and villeins and i know not what that i often think that even in this worlds sense i am the best off  and far above and beyond that she added in a low voice the virgin hath a hope a spouse beyond all human thought  grisell did not understand the thought and still wept bitterly must she be a nun all her life was all she thought of and the shady cloister seemed to her like a sort of prison  sister avice had to soothe and comfort her till her tears were all spent as so often before and she had cried herself so ill that she had to be taken back to her bed and lie down again  it was some days before she could be coaxed out again to encounter any companions  however as time went on health and with it spirits and life came back to grisell dacre at wilton and she became accustomed to being with the other inmates of the fine old convent as they grew too much used to her appearance to be startled or even to think about it  the absence of mirrors prevented it from ever being brought before her and sister avice set herself to teach her how goodness sweetness and kindness could endear any countenance and indeed grisell saw for herself how much more loved was the old and very plain mother anne than the very beautiful young sister isabel who had been forced into the convent by her tyrannical brother and wore out her life in fretting and rudeness to all who came in her way  she declared that the sight of grisell made her ill and insisted that the veiled hood which all the girls wore should be pulled forward whenever they came near one another and that grisells place should be out of her sight in chapel or refectory  every one else however was very kind to the poor girl sister avice especially so and grisell soon forgot her disfigurement when she ceased to suffer from it  she had begun to learn reading writing and a little latin besides spinning stitchery and a few housewifely arts in the countess of salisburys household for every lady was supposed to be educated in these arts and great establishments were schools for the damsels there bred up  it was the same with convent life and each nunnery had traditional works of its own either in embroidery cookery or medicine  some secrets there were not imparted beyond the professed nuns and only to the more trustworthy of them so that each sisterhood might have its own especial glory in confections whether in portraitworked vestments in illuminations in sweetmeats or in salves and unguents but the pensioners were instructed in all those common arts of bakery needlework notability and surgery which made the lady of a castle or manor so important and within the last century in the more fashionable abbeys latin of a sort french of the school of stratford le bowe and the like were added  thus grisell learnt as an apt scholar these arts and took especial delight in helping sister avice to compound her simples and acquired a tender hand with which to apply them  moreover she learnt not only to say and sing her breviary but to know the signification in english  there were translations of the lords prayer and creed in the hands of all careful and thoughtful people even among the poor if they had a good parish priest or had come under the influence of the better sort of friars  in convents where discipline was kept up the meaning was carefully taught and there were english primers in the hands of all the devout so that the services could be intelligently followed even by those who did not learn latin as did grisell  selections from scripture history generally clothed in rhyme and versified lives of the saints were read aloud at mealtimes in the refectory and grisell became so good a reader that she was often chosen to chant out the sacred story and her sweet northern voice was much valued in the singing in the church  she was quite at home there and though too young to be admitted as a novice she wore a black dress and white hood like theirs and the annual gifts to the nunnery from the countess of salisbury were held to entitle her to the residence there as a pensioner  she had fully accepted the idea of spending her life there sheltered from the world among the kind women whom she loved and who had learnt to love her and in devotion to god and works of mercy to the sick    chapter vithe proctor    but if a mannes soul were in his purse for in his purse he should yfurnished be  chaucer canterbury pilgrims  five years had passed since grisell had been received at wilton when the abbess died  she had been infirm and confined to her lodging for many months and grisell had hardly seen her but her death was to change the whole tenor of the maidens life  the funeral ceremonies took place in full state  the bishop himself came to attend them and likewise all the neighbouring clergy and the monks friars and nuns overflowing the chapel while peasants and beggars for whom there was no room in the courts encamped outside the walls to receive the dole and pray for the soul of the right reverend mother abbess  for nine days constant services were kept up and the requiem mass was daily said the dirges daily sung and the alms bestowed on the crowd who were by no means specially sorrowful or devout but beguiled the time by watching jongleurs and mountebanks performing beyond the walls  there was the months mind still to come and then the chapter of nuns intended to proceed to the election of their new abbess unanimously agreeing that she should be their present prioress who had held kindly rule over them through the slow todecay of the late abbess  before however this could be done a messenger arrived on a mule bearing an inhibition to the sisters to proceed in the election  his holiness pope calixtus had reserved to himself the next appointment to this as well as to certain other wealthy abbeys  the nuns in much distress appealed to the bishop but he could do nothing for them  such reservations had been constant in the subservient days that followed king johns homage and though the great edwards had struggled against them and the yoke had been shaken off during the great schism no sooner had this been healed than the former claims were revived nay redoubled and the pious henry vi was not the man to resist them  the sisters therefore waited in suspense daring only meekly to recommend their prioress in a humble letter written by the chaplain and backed by a recommendation from bishop beauchamp  both alike were disregarded as all had expected  the new abbess thus appointed was the madre matilda de borgia a relation of pope calixtus very noble and of spanish birth as the commissioner assured the nuns but they had never heard of her before and were not at all gratified  they had always elected their abbess before and had quite made up their minds as to the choice of the present mother prioress as abbess and of sister avice as prioress  however they had only to submit  to appeal to the king or to their bishop would have been quite useless they could only do as the pope commanded and elect the mother matilda consoling themselves with the reflection that she was not likely to trouble herself about them and their old prioress would govern them  and so she did so far as regarded the discipline of the house but what they had not so entirely understood was the mother de borgias desire to squeeze all she could out of the revenues of the house  her proctor arrived a little pinched man in a black gown and square cap and desired to see the mother prioress and her steward and to overlook the income and expenditure of the convent to know who had duly paid her dowry to the nunnery what were the rents and the like  the sisters had already raised a considerable gift in silver merks to be sent through lombard merchants to their new abbess and this requisition was a fresh blow  presently the proctor marked out grisell dacre and asked on what terms she was at the convent  it was explained that she had been brought thither for her cure by the lady of salisbury and had stayed on without fee or payment from her own home in the north but the ample donations of the earl of salisbury had been held as full compensation and it had been contemplated to send to the maidens family to obtain permission to enrol her as a sister after her novitiatewhich might soon begin as she was fifteen years old  the proctor however was much displeased  the nuns had no right to receive a pensioner without payment far less to admit a novice as a sister without a dowry  mistress grisell must be returned instantly upon the hands either of her own family or of the countess of salisbury and certainly not readmitted unless her dowry were paid  he scarcely consented to give time for communication with the countess to consider how to dispose of the poor child  the prioress sent messengers to amesbury and to christ church but the earl and countess were not there nor was it clear where they were likely to be  whitburn was too far off to send to in the time allowed by the proctor and grisell had heard nothing from her home all the time she had been at wilton  the only thing that the prioress could devise was to request the chaplain to seek her out at salisbury a trustworthy escort pilgrim merchant or other with whom grisell might safely travel to london and if the earl and countess were not there some responsible person of theirs or of their sons was sure to be found who would send the maiden on  the chaplain mounted his mule and rode over to salisbury whence he returned bringing with him news of a merchants wife who was about to go on pilgrimage to fulfil a vow at walsingham and would feel herself honoured by acting as the convoy of the lady grisell dacre as far at least as london  there was no further hope of delay or failure  poor grisell must be cast out on the worldthe proctor even spoke of calling the countess or her steward to account for her maintenance during these five years  there was weeping and wailing in the cloisters at the parting and grisell clung to sister avice mourning for her peaceful holy life  nay my child none can take from thee a holy life  if i make a vow of virginity none can hinder me  that was not what i meant  no maid has a right to take such a vow on herself without consent of her father nor is it binding otherwise  no but no one can take away from a christian maid the power of holiness  bear that for ever in mind sweetheart  naught that can be done by man or by devil to the body can hurt the soul that is fixed on christ and does not consent to evil  the saints forefend that everever i should consent to evil  it is the blessed spirit alone who can guard thy will my child will and soul not consenting nor being led astray thou art safe nay the lack of a fairfavoured face may be thy guard  all will hate me  alack alack  not so  see thou hast won love amongst us  wherefore shouldst not thou in like manner win love among thine own people  my mother hates me already and my father heeds me not  love them child  do them good offices  none can hinder thee from that  can i love those who love not me  yea little one  to serve and tend another brings the heart to love  even as thou seest a poor dog love the master who beats him so it is with us only with the higher christian love  service and prayer open the heart to love hoping for nothing again and full oft that which was not hoped for is vouchsafed  that was the comfort with which grisell had to start from her home of peace conducted by the chaplain and even the prioress who would herself give her into the hands of the good mistress hall  very early they heard mass in the convent and then rode along the bank of the river with the downs sloping down on the other side and the grand spire ever seeming as it were taller as they came nearer while the sound of the bells grew upon them for there was then a second tower beyond to hold the bells whose reverberation would have been dangerous to the spire and most sweet was their chime the sound of which had indeed often reached wilton in favourable winds but it sounded like a sad farewell to grisell  the prioress thought she ought to begin her journey by kneeling in the cathedral so they crossed the shaded close and entered by the west door with the long vista of clustered columns and pointed arches before them  low sounds of mass being said at different altars met their ears for it was still early in the day  the prioress passed the length of nave and went beyond the choir to the lady chapel with its slender supporting columns and exquisite arches and there she with grisell by her side joined in earnest supplications for the child  the chaplain touched her as she rose and made her aware that the dame arrayed in a scarlet mantle and hood and dark ridingdress was mistress hall  silence was not observed in cathedrals or churches especially in the naves except when any sacred rite was going on and no sooner was the mass finished and ite missa est pronounced than the scarlet cloak rose and hastened into the south transept where she waited for the chaplain prioress and grisell  no introduction seemed needed  the holy mother prioress she began bending her knee and kissing the ladys hand  much honoured am i by the charge of this noble little lady  grisell by the by was far taller than the plump little goodwoman hall but that was no matter and the prioress had barely space to get in a word of thanks before she went on  i will keep her and tend her as the apple of mine eye  she shall pray with me at all the holy shrines for the good of her soul and mine  she shall be my bedfellow wherever we halt and sit next me and be cherished as though she were mine own daughterladybird as she is till i can give her into the hands of the good lady countess  oh

their brethren  oh you may trust me reverend mother ill never have the young lady bless her sweet face out of my sight till i have safe bestowed her with my lady countess our good customer for all manner of hardware or else with her own kin  the good womans stream of conversation lasted almost without drawing breath all the way down the nave  it was a most goodhumoured hearty voice and her plump figure and rosy face beamed with good nature while her bright black eyes had a lively glance  the chaplain had inquired about her and found that she was one of the good women to whom pilgrimage was an annual dissipation consecrated and meritorious as they fondly believed and gratifying their desire for change and variety  she was a kindly person of good reputation trustworthy and kind to the poor and stout john hall her husband could manage the business alone and was thought not to regret a little reprieve from her continual tongue  she wanted the prioress to do her the honour of breaking her fast with her but the good nun was in haste to return after having once seen her charge in safe hands and excused herself while grisell blessed by the chaplain and hiding her tears under her veil was led away to the substantial smiths abode where she was to take a first meal before starting on her journey on the strong forest pony which the chaplains care had provided for her    chapter viithe pilgrim of salisbury    she hadde passed many a strange shrine at rome she had been and at boleine at galice at st james and at coleine she could moche of wandering by the way  chaucer canterbury pilgrims  grisell found herself brought into a hall where a stout oak table occupied the centre covered with homespun napery on which stood trenchers wooden bowls pewter and a few silver cups and several large pitchers of ale small beer or milk  a pie and a large piece of bacon also a loaf of barley bread and a smaller wheaten one were there  shelves all round the walls shone with pewter and copper dishes cups kettles and vessels and implements of all household varieties and ranged round the floor lay ploughshares axes and mattocks all polished up  the ring of hammers on the anvil was heard in the court in the rear  the front of the hall was open for the most part without windows but it could be closed at night  breakfast was never a regular meal and the household had partaken of it so that there was no one in the hall excepting master hall a stout brawny grizzled man with a goodhumoured face and his son more slim but growing into his likeness also a young notable looking daughterinlaw with a swaddled baby tucked under her arm  they seated grisell at the table and implored her to eat  the wheaten bread and the fowl were it seemed provided in her honour and she could not but take her little knife from the sheath in her girdle turn back her nunlike veil and prepare to try to drive back her sobs and swallow the milk of almonds pressed on her  eh cried the daughterinlaw in amaze  shes only scarred after all  well what else should she be bless her poor heart said mrs hall the elder  why wasnt it thou thyself good mother that brought home word that they had the pigfaced lady at wilton there  bless thee agnes thou shouldst know better than to lend an ear to all the idle tales thy poor old mother may hear at market or fair  then should we have enough to do muttered her husband  and as thou seest tis a sweet little face only cruelly marred by the evil hap  poor grisell was crimson at finding all eyes on her an ordeal she had never undergone in the convent and she hastily pulled forward her veil  nay now my sweet young lady take not the idle words in ill part pleaded the good hostess  we all know how to love thee and what is a smooth skin to a true heart  take a bit more of the pasty ladybird well have far to ride ere we get to wherwell where the good sisters will give us a meal for young st edwards sake and thy prioresss  ayei turn out of my way for that i never yet paid my devotion to poor young king edward and he might take it in dudgeon being a king and his shrine so near at hand  ha ha laughed the smith trust my dame for being on the right side of the account with the saints  well for me and jack that we have little agnes here to mind the things on earth meanwhile  nay nay dame i say nought to hinder thee i know too well what it means when spring comes and thou beginnst to moan and tell up the tale of the shrines where thou hast not told thy beads  it was all in good humour and master hall walked out to the city gate to speed his gadabout or pious wife whichever he might call her on her way apparently quite content to let her go on her pilgrimages for the summer quarter  she rode a stout mule and was attended by two sturdy varletsquite sufficient guards for pilgrims who were not supposed to carry any valuables  grisell sadly rode her pony keeping her veil well over her face yearning over the last view of the beloved spire thinking of sister avice ministering to her poor and with a very definite fear of her own reception in the world and dread of her welcome at home  yet there was a joy in being on horseback once more for her who had ridden moorland ponies as soon as she could walk  goodwife hall talked on with anecdotes of every hamlet that they passed and these were not very many  at each church they dismounted and said their prayers and if there were a hostel near they let their animals feed the while and obtained some refreshment themselves  england was not a very safe place for travellers just then but the cockleshells sewn to the pilgrims hat of the dame and to that of one of her attendants and the tall staff and wallet each carried were passports of security  nothing could be kinder than mistress hall was to her charge of whom she was really proud and when they halted for the night at the nunnery of queen elfrida at wherwell she took care to explain that this was no burgesss daughter but the lady grisell dacre of whitburn trusted to her convoy and thus obtained for her quarters in the guestchamber of the refectory instead of in the general hospitium but on the whole grisell had rather not have been exposed to the shock of being shown to strangers even kindly ones for even if they did not exclaim some one was sure to start and whisper  after another halt for the night the travellers reached london and learned at the city gate that the earl and countess of salisbury were absent but that their eldest son the earl of warwick was keeping court at warwick house  thither therefore mistress hall resolved to conduct grisell  the way lay through narrow streets with houses overhanging the roadway but the house itself was like a separate castle walled round enclosing a huge space and with a great arched porters lodge where various menatarms lounged all adorned on the arm of their red jackets with the bear and ragged staff  they were courteous however for the earl richard of warwick insisted on civility to all comers and they respected the scallop shell on the dames hat  they greeted her goodhumouredly  ha goodday good pilgrim wife  art bound for st pauls  heres supper to the fore for all comers  thanks sir porter but this maid is of other mould she is the lady grisell dacre and is company for my lord and my lady  nay her hood and veil look like company for the abbess  come this way dame and we will find the steward to marshal her  grisell had rather have been left to the guardianship of her kind old friend but she was obliged to follow  they dismounted in a fine court with cloisterlike buildings round it and full of people of all kinds for no less than six hundred stout yeomen wore red coats and the bear and ragged staff  grisell would fain have clung to her guide but she was not allowed to do so  she was marshalled up stone steps into a great hall where tables were being laid covered with white napery and glittering with silver and pewter  the seneschal marched before her all the length of the hall to where there was a large fireplace with a burning log summer though it was and shut off by handsome tapestried and carved screens sat a half circle of ladies with a younglooking lady in a velvet furtrimmed surcoat in their midst  a tall man with a keen resolute face in long robes and gold belt and chain stood by her leaning on her chair  the seneschal announced place place for the lady grisell dacre of whitburn and grisell bent low putting back as much of her veil as she felt courtesy absolutely to require  the lady rose the knight held out his hand to raise the bending figure  he had that power of recollection and recognition which is so great an element in popularity  the lady grisell dacre he said  she who met with so sad a disaster when she was one of my lady mothers household  grisell glowing all over signed acquiescence and he went on welcome to my poor house lady  let me present you to my wife  the countess of warwick was a pale somewhat inane lady  she was the heiress of the beauchamps and de spensers in consequence of the recent death of her brother the king of the isle of wightand through her inheritance her husband had risen to his great power she was delicate and feeble almost apathetic and she followed her husbands lead and received her guest with fair courtesy and grisell ventured in a trembling voice to explain that she had spent those years at wilton but that the new abbesss proctor would not consent to her remaining there any longer not even long enough to send to her parents or to the countess of salisbury  poor maiden  such are the ways of his holiness where the king is not man enough to stand in his way said warwick  so fair maiden if you will honour my house for a few days as my ladys guest i will send you north in more fitting guise than with this whitesmith dame  she hath been very good to me grisell ventured to add to her thanks  she shall have good entertainment here said the earl smiling  no doubt she hath already as sarum born  see that goodwife hall the white smiths wife and her following have the best of harbouring he added to his silverchained steward  you are a dacre of whitburn he added to grisell  your father has not taken sides with dacre of gilsland and the percies  then seeing that grisell knew nothing of all this he laughed and said little convent birds you know nought of our worldly strifes  in fact grisell had heard nothing from her home for the last five years which was the less marvel as neither her father nor her mother could write if they had cared to do so  nor did the convent know much of the state of england though prayers had been constantly said for the kings recovery and of late there had been thanksgivings for the birth of the prince of wales but it was as much as she did know that just now the duke of york was governing for the poor king seemed as senseless as a stone and the earl of salisbury was his chancellor  nevertheless salisbury was absent in the north and there was a quarrel going on between the nevils and the percies which warwick was going to compose and thus would be able to take grisell so far in his company  the great household was larger than even what she remembered at the houses of the countess of salisbury before her accident and fresh from the stillness of the convent as she was the noises were amazing to her when all sat down to supper  tables were laid all along the vast hall  she was placed at the upper one to her relief beside an old lady dame gresford whom she remembered to have seen at montacute castle in her childhood as one of the attendants on the countess  she was forced to put back her veil and she saw some of the young knights and squires staring at her then nudging one another and laughing  never mind them sweetheart said dame gresford kindly they are but unmannerly lurdanes and the lord earl would make them know what is befitting if his eye fell on them  the good lady must have had a hint from the authorities for she kept grisell under her wing in the huge household which was like a city in itself  there was a knight who acted as steward with innumerable knights squires and pages under him besides the six hundred red jacketed yoemen and servants of all degrees in the immense court of the buttery and kitchen as indeed there had need to be for six oxen were daily cooked with sheep and other meats in proportion and any friend or acquaintance of any one in this huge establishment might come in and not only eat and drink his fill but carry off as much meat as he could on the point of his dagger  goodwife hall as coming from salisbury stayed there in free quarters while she made the round of all the shrines in london and she was intensely gratified by the great earl recollecting or appearing to recollect her and inquiring after her husband that hearty burgess whose pewter was so lasting and he was sure was still in use among his black guard  when she saw grisell on finally departing for st albans she was carrying her head a good deal higher on the strength of my lord earls grace to her  she hoped that her sweet lady grisell would remain here as the best hap she could have in the most noble excellent and openhanded house in the world  grisells own wishes were not the same for the great household was very bewilderinga strange change from her quietlybusy convent  the countess was quiet enough but dull and sickly and chiefly occupied by her ailments she seemed to be always thinking about leeches wise friars wonderful nuns or even wizards and cunning women and was much concerned that her husband absolutely forbade her consulting the witch of spitalfields  nay dame said he an thou didst the next thing we should hear would be that thou hadst been sticking pins into king harrys waxen image and roasting him before the fire and that nothing but roasting thee in life and limb within a fire would bring him to life and reason  they would never dare cried the lady  who can tell what the queen would dare if she gets her will demanded the earl  wouldst like to do penance with sheet and candle like gloucesters wife  such a possibility was enough to silence the lady of warwick on the score of witches and the only time she spoke to grisell was to ask her about sister avice and her cures  she set herself to persuade her husband to let her go down to one of his mothers wiltshire houses to consult the nun but warwick had business in the north nor would he allow her to be separated from him lest she might be detained as a hostage  dame gresford continued to be grisells protector and let the girl sit and spin or embroider beside her while the other ladies of the house played at ball in the court or watched the exercises of the pages and squires  the dames presence and authority prevented grisells being beset with uncivil remarks but she knew she was like a toad among the butterflies as she overheard some saucy youth calling her while a laugh answered him and she longed for her convent    chapter viiiold playfellows          alone thou goest forth    thy face unto the north moor and pleasance all around thee and beneath thee  e barrett browning a valediction  one great pleasure fell to grisells share but only too brief  the family of the duke of york on their way to baynards castle halted at warwick house and the duchess cecily tall fair and stately sailed into the hall followed by three fair daughters while warwick her nephew though nearly of the same age advanced with his wife to meet and receive her  in the midst of the exchange of affectionate but formal greetings a cry of joy was heard my grisell yes it is my grisell and springing from the midst of her mothers suite margaret plantagenet a tall lovely darkhaired girl threw her arms round the thin slight maiden with the scarred face which excited the scorn and surprise of her two sisters  margaret  what means this demanded the duchess severely  it is my grisell dacre fair mother my dear companion at my aunt of salisburys manor said margaret trying to lead forward her shrinking friend  she who was so cruelly scathed  grisell curtsied low but still hung back and lord warwick briefly explained  daughter to will dacre of whitburn a staunch baron of the north  my mother bestowed her at wilton whence the creature of the popes intruding abbess has taken upon him to expel her  so i am about to take her to middleham where my mother may see to her further bestowal  we have even now come from middleham said the duchess  my lord duke sent for me but he looks to you my lord to compose the strife between your father and the insolent percies  the duke was at windsor with the poor insane king and the earl and the duchess plunged into a discussion of the latest news of the northern counties and of the court  the elder daughters were languidly entertained by the countess but no one disturbed the interview of margaret and grisell who hand in hand had withdrawn into the embrasure of a window and there fondled each other and exchanged tidings of their young lives and margaret told of friends in the nevil household  all too soon the interview came to an end  the duchess after partaking of a manchet was ready to proceed to baynards castle and the lady margaret was called for  again in spite of surprised not to say displeased looks she embraced her dear old playfellow dont go into a convent grisell she entreated  when i am wedded to some great earl you must come and be my lady mine own own dear friend  promise me  your pledge grisell  there was no time for the pledge  margaret was peremptorily summoned  they would not meet again  the duchesss intelligence had quickened warwicks departure and the next day the first start northwards was to be made  it was a mighty cavalcade  the black guard namely the kitchen menage with all their pots and pans kettles and spits were sent on a days march beforehand then came the yeomen the knights and squires followed by the more immediate attendants of the earl and countess and their court  she travelled in a whirlicote and there were others provided for her elder ladies the rest riding singly or on pillions according to age or taste  grisell did not like to part with her pony and dame gresford preferred a pillion to the bumps and jolts of the waggonlike conveyances called chariots so grisell rode by her side the fresh spring breezes bringing back the sense of being really a northern maid and she threw back her veil whenever she was alone with the attendants who were used to her though she drew it closely round when she encountered town or village  there were restingplaces on the way  in great monasteries all were accommodated being used to close quarters in castles there was room for the gentles who if they fared well heeded little how they slept and their attendants found lairs in the kitchens or stables in towns there was generally harbour for the noble portion indeed in some warwick had dwellings of his own or his fathers but these at first were at long distances apart such as would be ridden by horsemen alone not encumbered with ladies and there were intermediate stages where some of the party had to be dispersed in hostels  it was in one of these at dunstable that dame gresford had taken grisell and there were also sundry of the gentlemen of the escort a minstrel was esconced under the wide spread of the chimney and began to sound his harp and sing long ballads in recitative to the company  whether he did it in all innocence and ignorance or one of the young squires had mischievously prompted him there was no knowing dame gresford suspected the latter when he began the ballad of sir gawaines wedding  she would have silenced it but feared to draw more attention on her charge who had never heard the song and did not know what was coming but listened with increasing eagerness as she heard of king arthur and of the giant and the secret that the king could not guess till as he rode    he came to the green forest    underneath a green hollen tree there sat that lady in red scarlet    that unseemly was to see   some eyes were discourteously turned on the maiden but she hardly saw them and at any rate her nose was not crooked nor had her eyes and mouth changed places as in the case of the loathly lady  she heard of the condition on which the lady revealed the secret and how king arthur bound himself to bring a fair young knight to wed the hideous being  then when he revealed to his assembled knights    then some took up their hawks    and some took up their hounds and some sware they would not marry her    for cities nor for towns   glances again went towards the scarred visage but grisell was heedless of them only listening how sir gawaine arthurs nephew felt that his uncles oath must be kept and offered himself as the bridegroom  then after the marriage when he looked on the lady instead of the loathly hag he beheld a fair damsel  and he was told by her that he might choose whether she should be foul at night and fair by day or fair each evening and frightful in the daylight hours  his choice at first was that her beauty should be for him alone in his home but when she objected that this would be hard on her since she could thus never show her face when other dames ride with their lords    then buke him gentle gawayne    said lady thats but a shill because thou art mine own lady    thou shalt have all thy will   and his courtesy broke the spell of the stepdame as the lady related    she witched me being a fair young lady    to the green forest to dwell and there must i walk in womans likeness    most like a fiend in hell   thenceforth the enchantment was broken and sir gawaines bride was fair to see  grisell had listened intently absorbed in the narrative so losing personal thought and feeling that it was startling to her to perceive that dame gresford was trying to hush a rude laugh and one of the young squires was saying hush hush for very shame  then she saw that they were applying the story to her and the blood rushed into her face but the more courteous youth was trying to turn away attention by calling on the harper for the beggar of bethnal green or lord thomas and fair annet or any merry ballad  so it was borne in on grisell that to these young gentlemen she was the lady unseemly to see  yet though a few hot tears flowed indignant and sorrowful the sanguine spirit of youth revived  sister avice had told her how to be not loathly in the sight of those whom she could teach to love her  there was one bound by a pledge  ah he would never fulfil it  if he should grisell felt a resolute purpose within her that though she could not be transformed he should not see her loathly in his sight and in that hope she slept    chapter ixthe kingmaker    o where is faith  o where is loyalty  shakespeare henry vi part ii  grisell was disappointed in her hopes of seeing her countess of salisbury again for as she rode into the castle of york she heard the earls hearty voice of greeting  ha stout will of whitburn well met  what from the north  the earl stood talking with a tall brawny man lean and strong brown and weatherbeaten in a frayed suit of buff leather stained to all sorts of colours in which rust predominated and a face all brown and red except for the grizzled eyebrows hair and stubbly beard she had not seen her father since she was five years old and she would not have known him  i am from the south now my lord she heard his gruff voice say i have been taking my lad to be bred up in the duke of yorks house for better nurture than can be had in my seaside tower  quite right  well done in you responded warwick  the duke of york is the man to hold by  we have an exchange for you a daughter for a son and he was leading the way towards grisell who had just dismounted from her pony and stood by it trembling a little and bending for her fathers blessing  it was not more than a crossing of her and he was talking all the time  ha how now  methought my lady of salisbury had bestowed her in the abbeyhow call you it  aye returned warwick but since we have not had king or parliament with spirit to stand up to the pope he thrusts his claw in everywhere puts a strange abbess into wilton and what must she do but send down her proctor to treat the poor nunnery as it were a sponge and spite of all my lady mothers bounties to the place what lists he do but turn out the poor maid for lack of a dowry not so much as giving time for a notice to be sent  if we had such a rogue in the north country we should know how to serve him observed sir william and warwick laughed as befitted a westmoreland nevil albeit he was used to more civilised ways  scurvy usage he said but the prioress had no choice save to put her in such keeping as she could and send her away to my lady mother or failing her to her home  soh  she must een jog off with me though how it is to be with her my lady may tell not i since every groat those villain yeomen and fisher folk would raise went to fit out young rob and there has not been so much as a border raid these four years and more  there are the nuns at gateshead as hard as nails will not hear of a maid without a dower and yonder mansworn fellow copeland casts her off like an old glove  let us look at you wench  ha  face is unsightly enough but thou wilt not be a badlymade woman  take heart whats thy namegrisell  may be theres luck for thee still though it be hard of coming to whitburn he added turning to warwick  theres this wench scorched to a cinder enough to fright one and my other lad racked from head to foot with pain and sores so as it is a misery to hear the poor child cry out and even if he be reared he will be good for nought save a convent  grisell would fain have heard more about this poor little brother but the ladies were entering the castle and she had to follow them she saw no more of her father except from the far end of the table but orders were issued that she should be ready to accompany him on his homeward way the next morning at six oclock  her brother robert had been sent in charge of some of the duke of yorks retainers to join his household as a page though they had missed him on the route and the lord of whitburn was anxious to get home again never being quite sure what the scots or the percies or his kinsmen of gilsland might attempt in his absence  though as he said my lady was as good as a dozen menatarms but somehow she had not been the same woman since little bernard had fallen sick  there was no one in the company with whom grisell was very sorry to part for though dame gresford had been kind to her it had been merely the attending to the needs of a charge not showing her any affection and she had shrunk from the eyes of so large a party  when she came down early into the hall her fathers halfdozen retainers were taking their morning meal at one end of a big board while a manchet of bread and a silver cup of ale was ready for each of them at the other and her father while swallowing his was in deep conversation over northern politics with the courteous earl who had come down to speed his guests  as she passed the retainers she heard here comes our grisly grisell and a smothered laugh and in fact grisly grisell continued to be her name among the freespoken people of the north  the earl broke off bowed to her and saw that she was provided breaking into his conversation with the baron evidently much to the impatience of the latter and again the polite noble came down to the door with her and placed her on her palfrey bidding her a kind farewell ere she rode away with her father  it would be long before she met with such courtesy again  her father called to his side his old ruggedlooking esquire cuthbert ridley and began discussing with him what lord warwick had said both wholly absorbed in the subject and paying no attention to the girl who rode by the barons side so that it was well that her old infantine training in horsemanship had come back to her  she remembered cuthbert ridley who had carried her about and petted her long ago and to her surprise looked no older than he had done in those days when he had seemed to her infinitely aged  indeed it was to him far more than to her father that she owed any attention or care taken of her on the journey  her father was not unkind but never seemed to recollect that she needed any more care than his rough followers and once or twice he and all his people rode off headlong over the fell at sight of a stag roused by one of their great deerhounds  then cuthbert ridley kept beside her and when the ground became too rough for a new forest pony and a hand unaccustomed to northern ground he drew up  she would probablyif not thrown and injuredhave been left behind to feel herself lost on the moors  she minded the less his somewhat rude ejaculation ho ho  south  south  forgot how to back a horse on rough ground  eh and what a poor softpaced beast  only fit to ride on my ladys pilgrimage or in a state procession  he said gang but neither the old english nor the northern dialect could be understood by the writer or the reader and must be taken for granted  they are all gone responded grisell rather frightened  never guessed you were not among them replied ridley  why my lady would be among the foremost in at the death belike if she did not cut the throat of the quarry  grisell could well believe it but used to gentle nuns she shuddered a little as she asked what they were to do next  turn back to the track and go softly on till my lord comes up with us answered ridley  or you might be fain to rest under a rock for a while  the rest was far from unwelcome and grisell sat down on a mossy stone while ridley gathered bracken for her shelter and presently even brought her a branch or two of whortleberries  she felt that she had a friend and was pleased when he began to talk of how he remembered her long ago  ah  i mind you a little fat ball of a thing when you were fetched home from herring dicks house how you used to run after the dogs like a kitten after her tail and used to crave to be put up on old black durhams back  i remember black durham  had he not a white star on his forehead  a white blaze sure enough  is he at the tower still  i did not see him in the plump of spears  no no poor beast  he broke his leg four years ago come martinmas in a rabbithole on berwick law last raid that we made and i tarried to cut his throat with my daggerthough it went to my heart for his good old eyes looked at me like christians and my lord told me i was a fool for my pains for the elliots were hard upon us but i could not leave him to be a mark for them and i was up with the rest in time though i had to cut down the foremost lad  certainly home would be very unlike the experience of grisells education  ridley gave her a piece of advice  do not be daunted at my lady her bark is ever worse than her bite and what she will not bear with is the seeming cowed before her  she is all the sharper with her tongue now that her heart is sore for master bernard  what ails my brother bernard then asked grisell anxiously  the saints may know but no man does unless it was that crooked nan of strait glen overlooked the poor child returned the esquire ever since he fell into the red beck he hath done nought but peak and pine and be twisted with cramps and aches with sores breaking out on him though theres a honeycombstone from roker over his bed my lord took out all the retainers to lay hold on crooked nan but she got scent of it no doubt for jack of burhill took his oath that he had seen a muckle hare run up the glen that morn and when we got there she was not to be seen or heard of  we have heard of her in the gilsland ground where they would all the sooner see a the young lad of whitburn crippled and a mere misery to see or hear  grisell was quite as ready to believe in witchcraft as was the old squire and to tremble at their capacities for mischief  she asked what nunneries were near and was disappointed to find nothing within easy reach  st cuthberts diocese had not greatly favoured womankind and whitby was far away  by and by her father came back the thundering tramp of the horses being heard in time enough for her to spring up and be mounted again before he came in sight the yeomen carrying the antlers and best portions of the deer  left out my wench he shouted  we must mount you better  ho cuthbert thou a squire of dames  ha ha  the maid could not be left to lose herself on the fells muttered the squire rather ashamed of his courtesy  she must get rid of nunnery breeding  we want no trim and dainty lassies here growled her father  look you ridley that horse of hobs and the rest was lost in a discussion on horseflesh  long rides which almost exhausted grisell and halts in exceedingly uncomfortable hostels where she could hardly obtain tolerable seclusion brought her at last within reach of home  there was a tall church tower and some wretched hovels round it  the lord of whitburn halted and blew his bugle with the peculiar note that signified his own return then all rode down to the old peel the outline of which grisell saw with a sense of remembrance against the gray sealine with the little breaking glancing waves which she now knew herself to have unconsciously wanted and missed for years past  whitburn tower stood on the south side on a steep cliff overlooking the sea  the peel tower itself looked high and strong but to grisell accustomed to the widespread courts of the great castles and abbeys of the south the circuit of outbuildings seemed very narrow and cramped for truly there was need to have no more walls than could be helped for the few defenders to guard  all was open now and under the arched gateway with the portcullis over her head fitly framing her stood the tall gaunt figure of the lady grayer thinner more haggard than when grisell had last seen her and beside her leaning on a crutch a whitefaced boy small and stunted for six years old  ha dame  ha bernard how goes it shouted the baron in his gruff hoarse voice  he willed to come down to greet you though he cannot hold your stirrup said the mother  you are soon returned  is all well with rob  o aye i found thorslan of danby and a plump of spears on the way to the duke of york at windsor  they say he will need all his following if the beauforts put it about that the king has recovered as much wit as ever he had  so i een sent rob on with him and came back so as to be ready in case theres a call for me  soh  berney on thy feet again  thats well my lad but well have thee up the steps  he seemed quite to have forgotten the presence of grisell and it was cuthbert ridley who helped her off her horse but just then little bernard in his fathers arms exclaimed  black nun woman  by st cuthbert cried the baron i mind me  here wench  i have brought back the maid in her brothers stead  and as grisell in obedience to his call threw back her veil bernard screamed ugsome wench send her away threw his arms round his fathers neck and hid his face with a babyish gesture  saints have mercy cried the mother thou hast not mended much since i saw thee last  they that marred thee had best have kept thee  whatever shall we do with the maid  send her away the loathly thing reiterated the boy lifting up his head from his fathers shoulder for another glimpse which produced a puckering of the face in readiness for crying  nay nay bernard said ridley feeling for the poor girl and speaking up for her when no one else would  she is your sister and you must be a fond brother to her for an illnurtured lad spoilt her poor face when it was as fair as your own  kiss your sister like a good lad and   no no shouted bernard  take her away  i hate her  he began to cry and kick  get out of his sight as fast as may be commanded the mother alarmed by her sickly darlings paroxysm of passion  grisell scarce knowing where to go could only allow herself to be led away by ridley who seeing her tears tried to comfort her in his rough way  tis the petted bairns way you see mistressand my lady has no thought save for him  he will get over it soon enough when he learns your gentle conventbred conditions  still the cry of grisly grisell picked up as if by instinct or by some echo from the rear of the escort rang in her ears in the angry fretful voice of the poor little creature towards whom her heart was yearning  even the two womenservants there were no more looked at her askance as they took her to a seat in the hall and consulted where my lady would have her bestowed  she was wiping away bitter tears as she heard her only friend cuthbert settle the matter  the chamber within the solar is the place for the noble damsels  that is full of old armour and dried herrings and stockfish  move them then  a fair greeting to give to my lords daughter  there was some further muttering about a bed and grisell sprang up oh hush hush  i can sleep on a cloak i have done so for many nights  only let me be no burthen  show me where i can go to be an anchoress since they will not have me in a convent or anywhere and bitterly she wept  peace peace lady said the squire kindly  i will deal with these illtongued lasses  shame on them  go off and make the chamber ready or ill find a scourge for you  and as to my lady she is wrapped up in the sick bairn but she has only to get used to you to be friendly enough  o what a hope in a mother thought poor grisell  o that i were at wilton or some nunnery where my looks would be pardoned  mother avice dear mother what wouldst thou say to me now  the peel tower had been the original building and was still as it were the citadel but below had been built the very strong but narrow castle court containing the stables and the well and likewise the hall and kitchenwhich were the dwelling and sleeping places of the men of the household excepting cuthbert ridley who being of gentle blood would sit above the salt and had his quarters with rob when at home in the tower  the solar was a room above the hall where was the great boxbed of the lord and lady and a little bed for bernard  entered through it in a small turret was a chamber designed for the daughters and maids and this was rightly appropriated by ridley to the lady grisell  the two womenservantsbell and madgewere wives to the cook and the castle smith so the place had been disused and made a receptacle for drying fish fruit and the like  thus the sudden call for its use provoked a storm of murmurs in no gentle voices and grisell shrank into a corner of the hall only wishing she could efface herself  and as she looked out on the sea from her narrow window it seemed to her dismally gray moaning restless and dreary    chapter xcold welcome    seek not for others to love you    but seek yourself to love them best and you shall find the secret true    of love and joy and rest  i williams  to lack beauty was a much more serious misfortune in the middle ages than at present  of course it was probable that there might be a contract of marriage made entirely irrespective of attractiveness long before the development of either of the principal parties concerned but even then the rude openspoken husband would consider himself absolved from any attention to an illfavoured wife and the free tongues of her surroundings would not be slack to make her aware of her defects  the cloister was the refuge of the unmarried woman if of gentle birth as a nun if of a lower grade as a laysister but the fifteenth century was an age neither of religion nor of chivalry dowers were more thought of than devotion in convents as elsewhere whitby being one of the oldest and grandest foundations was sure to be inaccessible to a highborn but unportioned girl and grisell in her sense of loneliness saw nothing before her but to become an anchoress that is to say a female hermit such as generally lived in strict seclusion under shelter of the church  there at least thought poor grisell there would be none to sting me to the heart with those jeering eyes of theirs  and i might feel in time that god and his saints loved me and not long for my father and mother and oh my poor little brotheryes and leonard copeland and sister avice and the rest  but would sister avice call this devotion  nay would she not say that these cruel eyes and words are a cross upon me and i must bear them and love in spiteat least till i be old enough to choose for myself  she was summoned to supper and this increased the sense of dreariness for bernard screamed that the grisly one should not come near him or he would not eat and she had to take her meal of dried fish and barley bread in the wide chimney corner where there always was a fire at every season of the year  her chamber which cuthbert ridleys exertions had compelled the women to prepare for her wasas seen in the light of the long eveninga desolate place within a turret opening from the solar or chamber of her parents and bernard the loophole window devoid of glass though a shutter could be closed in bad weather the walls circular and of rough untouched unconcealed stone a pallet bed the only attempt at furniture except one chestand grisells own mails tumbled down anyhow and all pervaded by an ancient and fishy smell  she felt too downhearted even to creep out and ask for a pitcher of water  she took a long look over the gray heaving sea and tired as she was it was long before she could pray and cry herself to sleep and accustomed as she was to convent beds this one appeared to be stuffed with raw apples and she awoke with aching bones  her request for a pitcher or pail of water was treated as southland finery for those who washed at all used the horse trough but fortunately for her cuthbert ridley heard the request  he had been enough in the south in attendance on his master to know how young damsels lived and what treatment they met with and he was soon rating the women in no measured terms for the disrespect they had presumed to show to the lady grisell encouraged by the neglect of her parents  the lord of whitburn appearing on the scene at the moment backed up his retainer and made it plain that he intended his daughter to be respected and obeyed and the grumbling women had to submit  nor did he refuse to acknowledge on ridleys representation that grisell ought to have an attendant of her own and the lady of the castle coming down with bernard clinging to her skirt with one hand and leaning on his crutch consented  if the maid was to be here she must be treated fitly and bell and madge had enough to do without conventbred fancies  so cuthbert descended the steep path to the ravine where dwelt the fisher folk and came back with a girl barefooted bareheaded with long streaming lintwhite locks and the scantiest of garments crying bitterly with fright and almost struggling to go back  she was the orphan remnant of a family drowned in the bay and was a burthen on her fisher kindred who were rejoiced thus to dispose of her  she sobbed the more at sight of the grisly lady and almost screamed when grisell smiled and tried to take her by the hand  ridley fairly drove her upstairs step by step and then shut her in with his young lady when she sank on the floor and hid her face under all her bleached hair  poor little thing thought grisell it is like having a fresh caught seagull  she is as forlorn as i am and more afraid  so she began to speak gently and coaxingly begging the girl to look up and assuring her that she would not be hurt  grisell had a very soft and persuasive voice  her chief misfortune as regarded her appearance was that the muscles of one cheek had been so drawn that though she smiled sweetly with one side of her face the other was contracted and went awry so that when the kind tones had made the girl look up for a moment the next she cried o dontdont  holy mary forbid the spell  i have no spells my poor maid indeed i am only a poor girl a stranger here in my own home  come and do not fear me  madge said you had witches marks on your face sobbed the child  only the marks of gunpowder said grisell  listen i will tell thee what befell me  gunpowder seemed to be quite beyond all experience of whitburn nature but the history of the catastrophe gained attention and the girls terror abated so that grisell could ask her name which was thora and learning too that she had led a hard life since her granny died and her uncles wife beat her and made her carry heavy loads of seaweed when it froze her hands besides a hundred other troubles  as to knowing any kind of feminine art she was as ignorant as if the rough and extremely dirty woollen garment she wore belted round with a strip of leather had grown upon her and though grisells own stock of garments was not extensive she was obliged for very shame to dress this strange attendant in what she could best spare as well as in spite of sobs and screams to wash her face hands and feet and it was wonderful how great a difference this made in the wild creature by the time the clang of the castle bell summoned all to the midday meal when as before bernard professed not to be able to look at his sister but when she had retreated he was seen spying at her through his fingers with great curiosity  afterwards she went up to her mother to beg for a few necessaries for herself and for her maid and to offer to do some spinning  she was not very graciously answered but she was allowed an old frayed horsecloth on which thora might sleep and for the rest she might see what she could find under the stairs in the turret or in the chest in the hall window  the broken dilapidated fragments which seemed to grisell mere rubbish were treasures and wonders to thora and out of them she picked enough to render her dreary chamber a very few degrees more habitable  thora would sleep there and certainly their relations were reversed for carrying water was almost the only office she performed at first since grisell had to dress her and teach her to keep herself in a tolerable state of neatness and likewise how to spin luring her with the hope of spinning yarn for a new dress for herself  as to prayers her mind was a mere blank though she said something that sounded like a spell except that it began with pater  she did not know who made her and entirely believed in niord and rana the stormgods of norseland  yet she had always been to mass every sunday morning  so went all the family at the castle as a matter of course but except when the sacringbell hushed them the baron freely discussed crops or fish with the tenants and the lady wrangled about dues of lambs eggs and fish  grisells attention was a new thing and the priests pronunciation was so defective to her ear that she could hardly follow  that first week grisell had plenty of occupation in settling her room and training her uncouth maid who proved a much more apt scholar than she had expected and became devoted to her like a little faithful dog  no one else took much notice of either except that at times cuthbert ridley showed himself to be willing to stand up for her  her father was out a great deal hunting or hawking or holding consultations with neighbouring knights or the men of sunderland  her mother with the loudest and most peremptory of voices ruled over the castle ordered the men on their guards and at the stables and the cook scullions and other servants but without much good effect as household affairs were concerned for the meals were as far removed from the delicate dainty serving of the simplest fastday meal at wilton as from the sumptuous plenty and variety of warwick house and bernard often cried and could not eat  she longed to make up for him one of the many appetising possets well known at wilton but her mother and ralf the cook both scouted her first proposal  they wanted no southbred meddlers over their fire  however one evening when bernard had been fretful and in pain the baron had growled out that the child was cockered beyond all bearing and the mother had flown out at the unnatural father and on his half laughing at her doting ways had actually rushed across with clenched fist to box his ears he had muttered that the pining brat and shrewish dame made the house no place for him and wandered out to the society of his horses  lady whitburn after exhaling her wrath in abuse of him and all around carried the child up to his bed there he was moaning and she trying to soothe him when darkness having put a stop to grisells spinning she went to her chamber with thora  in passing the moaning was still heard and she even thought her mother was crying  she ventured to approach and ask fares he no better  if i might rub that poor leg  but bernard peevishly hid his face and whined go away grisly and her mother exclaimed away with you i have enough to vex me here without you  she could only retire as fast as possible and her tears ran down her face as in the long summer twilight she recited the evening offices the same in which sister avice was joining in wilton chapel  before they were over she heard her father come up to bed and in a harsh and angered voice bid bernard to be still  there was stillness for some little time but by and by the moaning and sobbing began again and there was a jangling between the gruff voice and the shrill one now thinner and weaker  grisell felt that she must try again and crept out  if i might rub him a little while and you rest lady mother  he cannot see me now  she prevailed or rather the poor mothers utter weariness and dejection did together with the fathers growl let her bring us peace if she can  lady whitburn let her kneel down by the bed and guided her hand to the aching thigh  soft  soft  good  good muttered bernard presently  go on  grisell had acquired something of that strange almost magical touch of sister avice and bernard lay still under her hand  her mother who was quite worn out moved to her own bed and fell asleep while the snores of the baron proclaimed him to have been long appeased the boy too presently was breathing softly and grisells attitude relaxed as her prayers and her dreams mingled together and by and by what she thought was the organ in wilton chapel and the light of st ediths taper proved to be the musical rush of the incoming tide and the golden sunrise over the sea while all lay sound asleep around her and she ventured gently to withdraw into her own room  that night was grisells victory though bernard still held aloof from her all the ensuing day when he was really the better and fresher for his long sleep but at bedtime when as usual the pain came on he wailed for her to rub him and as it was still daylight and her father had gone out in one of the boats to fish she ventured on singing to him as she rubbed to his great delight and still greater boon to her yearning heart  even by day as she sat at work the little fellow limped up to her and said grisly sing that again staring hard in her face as she did so    chapter xibernard    i do remember an apothecary  and hereabouts he dwells  shakespeare romeo and juliet  bernards affection was as strong as his aversion had been  poor little boy no one had been accustomed enough to sickly children or indeed to children at all to know how to make him happy or even comfortable and his life had been sad and suffering ever since the blight that had fallen on him through either the evil eye of nan the witch or through his fall into a freezing stream  his brother a great strong lad had teased and bullied him his father though not actually unkind except when wearied by his fretfulness held him as a miserable failure scarcely worth rearing his mother though her pride was in her elder son and the only softness in her heart for the little one had been so rugged and violent a woman all the years of her life and had so despised all gentler habits of civilisation that she really did not know how to be tender to the child who was really her darling  her infants had been nursed in the cottages and not returned to the castle till they were old enough to rough it indeed they were soon sent off to be bred up elsewhere  some failure in health too made it harder for her to be patient with an ailing child and her love was apt to take the form of anger with his petulance or even with his suffering or else of fierce battles with her husband in his defence  the comfort would have been in burning crooked nan but that beldame had disposed of herself out of reach though lady whitburn still cherished the hope of forcing the gilsland dacres or the percies to yield the woman up  failing this the boy had been shown to a travelling friar who had promised cure through the relics he carried about but bernard had only screamed at him and had been none the better  and now the little fellow had got over the first shock he found that grisly as he still called her but only as an affectionate abbreviation was the only person who could relieve his pain or amuse him in the whole castle and he was incessantly hanging on her  she must put him to bed and sing lullabies to him she must rub his limbs when they ached with rheumatic pains hers was the only hand which might touch the sores that continually broke out and he would sit for long spaces on her lap sometimes stroking down the scar and pitying it with poor grisly when i am a man i will throw down my glove and fight with that lad and kill him  o nay nay bernard he never meant to do me evil  he is a fair brave good boy  he scorned and ran away from you  he is mansworn and recreant persisted bernard  rob and i will make him say that you are the fairest of ladies  o nay nay  that he could not  but you are you areon this sidemine own grisly cried bernard whose experiences of fair ladies had not been extensive and who curled himself on her lap giving unspeakable rest and joy to her weary yearning spirit as she pressed him to her breast  now a story a story he entreated and she was rich in tales from scripture history and legends of the saints or she would sing her sweet monastic hymns and chants as he nestled in her lap  the mother had fits of jealousy at the exclusive preference and now and then would rail at grisell for cosseting the bairn and keeping him a helpless baby or at bernard for leaving his mother for this illfavoured useless sister and would even snatch away the boy and declare that she wanted no one to deal with him save herself but bernard had a will of his own and screamed for his grisly throwing himself about in such a manner that lady whitburn was forced to submit and quite to the alarm of her daughter on one of these occasions she actually burst into a flood of tears sobbing loud and without restraint  indeed though she hotly declared that she ailed nothing there was a lassitude about her that made it a relief to have the care of bernard taken off her hands and the barons grumbling at disturbed nights made the removal of bernards bed to his sisters room generally acceptable  once when grisell was found to have taught both him and thora the english version of the lords prayer and creed and moreover to be telling him the story of the gospel there came no one knew from where an accusation which made her father tramp up and say mark you wench ill have no lollards here  lollards sir i never saw a lollard said grisell trembling  where then didst learn all this making holy things common  we all learnt it at wilton sir from the reverend mothers and the holy father  the baron was fairly satisfied and muttered that if the bairn was fit only for a shaveling it might be all right  poor child would he ever be fit for that or any occupation of manhood  however grisell had won permission to compound broths cakes and possets for him over the hall fire for the cook and his wife would not endure her approach to their domain and with great reluctance allowed her the materials  bernard watched her operations with intense delight and amusement and tasted with a sense of triumph and appetite calling on his mother to taste likewise and she on whose palate semiraw or overroasted joints had begun to pall allowed that the nuns had taught grisell something  and thus as time went on grisell led no unhappy life  every one around was used to her scars and took no notice of them and there was nothing to bring the thought before her except now and then when a fishwifes baby brought to her for cure would scream at her  she never went beyond the castle except to mass now and then to visit a sick person and to seek some of the herbs of which she had learnt the use and then she was always attended by thora and ridley who made a great favour of going  bernard had given her the greater part of his heart and she soothed his pain made his hours happy and taught him the knowledge she brought from the convent  her affections were with him and though her mother could scarcely be said to love her she tolerated and depended more and more on the daughter who alone could give her more help or solace  that was grisells second victory when she was actually asked to compound a warm relishing hot bowl for her father when be was caught in a storm and came in drenched and weary  she wanted to try on her little brother the effect of one of sister avices ointments which she thought more likely to be efficacious than melted mutton fat mixed with pounded worms scrapings from the church bells and boiled seaweed but some of her ingredients were out of reach unless they were attainable at sunderland and she obtained permission to ride thither under the escort of cuthbert ridley and was provided with a small pursethe proceeds of the barons dues out of the fishermens sales of herrings  she was also to purchase a warm gown and mantle for her mother and enough of cloth to afford winter garments for bernard and a steady old packhorse carried the bundles of yarn to be exchanged for these commodities since the whitburn household possessed no member dexterous with the old disused loom and the itinerant weavers did not come that wayit was whispered because they were afraid of the fisher folk and got but sorry cheer from the lady  the commissions were important and grisell enjoyed the two miles ride along the cliffs of roker bay looking up at the curious caverns in the rock and seeking for the very strangelyformed stones supposed to have magic power which fell from the rock  in the distance beyond the river to the southward ridley pointed to the tall square tower of monks wearmouth church dominating the great monastery around it which had once held the venerable bede though to both ridley and grisell he was only a name of a patron saint  the harbour formed by the mouth of the river wear was a marvel to grisell crowded as it was with low squarelyrigged and gaily coloured vessels of holland friesland and flanders very new sights to one best acquainted with noahs ark or st peters ship in illuminations  sunderland is a noted place for shipbuilding said ridley moreover these come for wool saltfish and our earth coal and they bring us fine cloth linen and stout armour  i am glad to see yonder flemish ensign  if luck goes well with us i shall get a fresh pair of gauntlets for my lord straight from gaunt the place of gloves  gant for glove said grisell  how  you speak french  then you may aid me in chaffering and i will straight to the fleming with whom i may do better than with hodge of the lamb  how now heres a shower coming up fast  it was so indeed a heavy cloud had risen quickly and was already bursting overhead  ridley hurried on along a thoroughfare across salt marshes nowdocks but the speed was not enough to prevent their being drenched by a torrent of rain and hail before they reached the talltimbered houses of wearmouth  in good time cried ridley heres the poticarys sign  you had best halt here at once  in front of a highroofed house with a projecting upper story hung a sign bearing a green serpent on a red ground over a stall open to the street which the owner was sheltering with a deep canvas awning  hola master lambert groats called ridley  heres the young demoiselle of whitburn would have some dealings with you  jumping off his horse he helped grisell to dismount just as a small keenfaced elderly man in dark gown came forward doffing his green velvet cap and hoping the young lady would take shelter in his poor house  grisell glancing round the little booth was aware of sundry marvellous curiosities hanging round such as a dried crocodile the shells of tortoises of seaurchins and crabs all to her eyes most strange and weird but master lambert was begging her to hasten in at once to his dwellingroom beyond and let his wife dry her clothes and at once there came forward a plump smooth pleasantlooking personage greatly his junior dressed in a tight goldedged cap over her fair hair a dark skirt black bodice bright apron and white sleeves curtseying low but making signs to invite the newcomers to the fire on the hearth  my housewife is stone deaf explained their host and she knows no tongue save her own and the unspoken language of courtesy but she is rejoiced to welcome the demoiselle ah she is drenched  ah if she will honour my poor house  the wife curtsied low and by hospitable signs prayed the demoiselle to come to the fire and take off her wet mantle  it was a very comfortable room with a wide chimney and deep windows glazed with thick circles of glass the spaces between leaded around in diamond panes through which vine branches could dimly be seen flapping and beating in the storm  a table stood under one with various glasses and vessels of curious shapes and a big book and at the other was a distaff a workbasket and other feminine gear  shelves with pewter dishes and red yellow and striped crocks surrounded the walls there was a savoury cauldron on the open fire  it was evidently sittingroom and kitchen in one with offices beyond and grisell was at once installed in a fine carved chair by the firea more comfortable seat than had ever fallen to her share  look you here mistress said ridley you are in safe quarters here and i will leave you awhile take the horses to the hostel and do mine errands across the rivertis not fit for youand come back to you when the shower is over and you can come and chaffer for your womans gear  from the two good hosts the welcome was decided and grisell was glad to have time for consultation  an apothecary of those days did not rise to the dignity of a leech but was more like the present owner of a chemists shop though a chemist then meant something much more abstruse who studied occult sciences such as alchemy and astrology  in fact lambert groot which was his real name though english lips had made it groats belonged to one of the prosperous guilds of the great merchant city of bruges but he had offended his family by his determination to marry the deaf and almost dumb portionless orphan daughter of an old friend and contemporary and to save her from the scorn and slights of his relativesthough she was quite as wellborn as themselveshe had migrated to england where wearmouth and sunderland had a brisk trade with the low countries  these cities enjoyed the cultivation of the period and this room daintily clean and fresh seemed to grisell more luxurious than any she had seen since the countess of warwicks  a silver bowl of warm soup extracted from the pot au feu was served to her by the hausfrau on a little table spread with a fine white cloth edged with embroidery with an earnest gesture begging her to partake and a slender venice glass of wine was brought to her with a cake of wheaten bread  much did grisell wish she could have transferred such refreshing fare to bernard  she ventured to ask master poticary whether he sold balsam of egypt  he was interested at once and asked whether it were for her own use  nay good master you are thinking of my face but that was a burn long ago healed  it is for my poor little brother  therewith grisell and master groats entered on a discussions of symptoms drugs ointments and ingredients in which she learnt a good deal and perhaps disclosed more of sister avices methods than wilton might have approved  in the midst the sun broke out gaily after the shower and disclosed beyond the window a garden where every leaf and spray were glittering and glorious with their own diamond drops in the sunshine  a garden of herbs was a needful part of an apothecarys business as he manufactured for himself all of the medicaments which he did not import from foreign parts but this had been laid out between its high walls with all the care taste and precision of the netherlander and grisell exclaimed in perfect ecstasy  oh the garden the garden  i have seen nothing so fair and sweet since i left wilton  master lambert was delighted and led her out  there is no describing how refreshing was the sight to eyes after the bare dry walls of the castle and the tossing sea which the maiden had not yet learnt to love  nor was the garden dull though meant for use there was a well in the centre with roses trained over it roses of the dark old damask kind and the dainty musk used to be distilled for the eyes some flowers lingering still there was the brown dittany or fraxinella whose dried blossoms are phosphoric at night delicate pink centaury good for ague purple mallows good for wounds leopards bane with yellow blossoms many and many more old and dear friends of grisell redolent of wilton cloister and sister avice and she ran from one to the other quite transported and forgetful of all the dignities of the young lady of whitburn while lambert was delighted and hoped she would come again when his lilies were in bloom  so went the time till ridley returned and when the price was asked of the packet of medicaments prepared for her lambert answered that the value was fully balanced by what he had learnt from the lady this however did not suit the honour of the dacres and grisell as well as her squire who looked offended insisted on leaving two gold crowns in payment  the vrow kissed her hand putting into it the last sprays of roses which grisell cherished in her bosom  she was then conducted to a booth kept by a dutchman where she obtained the warm winter garments that she needed for her mother and brother and likewise some linen for the lady of whitburn had never been housewife enough to keep up a sufficient supply for bernard and grisell was convinced that the cleanliness which the nuns had taught her would mitigate his troubles  with thora to wash for her she hoped to institute a new order of things  much pleased with her achievements she rode home  she was met there by more grumbling than satisfaction  her father had expected more coin to send to robert who like other absent youths called for supplies  the yeoman who had gone with him returned bearing a scrap of paper with the words   mine honoured lord and fatheri pray you to send me black lightning and xvj crowns by the hand of ralf and so the saints have you in their keepingyour dutiful sonne  robert dacre   xvj crowns were a heavy sum in those days and lord whitburn vowed that he had never so called on his father except when he was knighted but those were the good old days when spoil was to be won in france  what could rob want of such a sum  welladay sir the house of the duke of york is no place to stint in  the two young earls of march and of rutland as they call them walk in red and blue and gold bravery and chains of jewels even like kings sons and none of the squires and pages can be behind them  black lightning too my best colt when i deemed the lad fitted out for years to come  i never sent home the like message to my father under the last good king henry but purveyed myself of a horse on the battlefield more than once  but those good old days are over and lads think more of velvet and broidery than of lances and swords forsooth their coatsofarms are good to wear on silk robes instead of helm and shield and as to our maids give them their rein and they spend more than all the rest on womens tawdry gear  poor grisell when she had bought nothing ornamental and nothing for herself except a few needles  however in spite of murmurs the xvj crowns were raised and sent away with black lightning and as time went on grisell became more and more a needful person  bernard was stronger and even rode out on a pony and the fame of his improvement brought other patients to the lady grisell from the vassals with whom she dealt as best she might successfully or the reverse while her mother as her health failed let fall more and more the reins of household rule    chapter xiiword from the wars    above below the rose of snow twined with her blushing face we spread  grays bard  news did not travel very fast to whitburn but one summers day a tall gallant fairfaced esquire in full armour of the cumbrous plate fashion rode up to the gate and blew the family note on his bugle  my son my son rob cried the lady starting up from the cushions with which grisell had furnished her settle  robert it was who came clanking in met by his father at the gate by his mother at the door and by bernard on his crutch in the rear while grisell who had never seen this brother hung back  the youth bent his knee but his outward courtesy did not conceal a good deal of contempt for the rude northern habits  how small and dark the hall is  my lady how old you have grown  what bernard still fit only for a shaven friar  not shorn yet eh  ha is that grisell  st cuthbert to wit  copeland has made a hag of her  tis a good maid none the less replied her father the first direct praise that she had ever had from him and which made her heart glow  she will neer get a husband with such a visage as that observed robert who did not seem to have learnt courtesy or forbearance yet on his travels but he was soon telling his father what concerned them far more than the maidens fate  sir i have come on the part of the duke of york to summon you what you have not heard  he needs as speedily as may be the arms of every honest man  how many can you get together  but what is it  how is it  your duke ruled the roast last time i heard of him  you know as little as my horse here in the north cried rob  this i did hear last time there was a boat come in that the queen that mother of mischief had tried to lay hands on our lord of salisbury and that he and your duke of york had soundly beaten her and the men of cheshire  yea at blore heath and i thought to win my spurs on the copeland banner but even as i was making my way to it and the recreant that bore it i was stricken across my steel cap and dazed  ill warrant it muttered his father  when i could look up again all was changed the banner nowhere in sight but i kept my saddle and cut down half a dozen rascaille after that  ha half incredulously for it was a mere boy who boasted  thats my brave lad  and what then  more hopes of the spurs eh  then what does the queen do but seeing that no one would willingly stir a lance against an old witless saint like king harry she gets a host together dragging the poor man hither and thither with her at ludlow  nay we even heard the king was dead and a mass was said for the repose of his soul but with the morning what should we see on the other side of the river teme but the royal standard and who should be under it but king harry himself with his meek face and fair locks twirling his fingers after his wont  so the men would have it that they had been gulled and they fell away one after another till there was nothing for it but for the duke and his sons and my lords of salisbury and warwick and a few score more of us to ride off as best we might with sir andrew trollope and his men after us as hard as might be so that we had to break up and keep few together  i went with the duke of york and young lord edmund into wales and thence in a bit of a fishingboat across to ireland  ask me to fight in full field with twice the numbers but never ask me to put to sea again  theres nothing like it for taking heart and soul out of a man  i have crossed the sea often enow in the good old days and known nothing worse than a qualm or two  that was to france said his son  this irish sea is far wider and far more tossing i know for my own part  id have given a knights fee to any one who would have thrown me overboard  i felt like an empty bag  but once there they could not make enough of us  the duke had got their hearts before and odd sort of hearts they are  i was deaf with the wild kernes shouting round about in their gibberishsuch figures too as they are with their blue cloaks streaming hair and long glibbes moustaches and the lords of the pale as they call the english sort are nigh about as wild and savage as the mere irish  it was as much as my lord duke could do to hinder two of them from coming to blows in his presence and you should have heard them howl at one another  however they are all with him and a mighty force of them mean to go back with him to england  my lord of warwick came from calais to hold counsel with him and they have sworn to one another to meet with all their forces and require the removal of the kings evil councillors and my lord duke with his own mouth bade me go and summon his trusty will dacre of whitburnso he spake sirto be with him with all the spears and bowmen you can raise or call for among the neighbours and it is my belief sir that he means not to stop at the councillors but to put forth his rights  hurrah for king richard of the white rose ended robert throwing up his cap  nay now said his father  id be loth to put down our gallant king harrys only son  no one breathes a word against king harry returned robert no more than against a carven saint in a church and he is about as much of a king as old stone king edmund or king oswald or whoever he is over the porch  he is welcome to reign as long as he likes or lives provided he lets our duke govern for him and rids the country of the foreign woman and her brat who is no more hers than i am but a mere babe of westminster town carried into the palace when the poor king harry was beside himself  nay now rob cried his mother  so tis said sturdily persisted rob  tis well known that the king never looked at him the first time he was shown the little imp and next time when he was not so distraught he lifted up his hands and said he wotted nought of the matter  hap what hap king harry may roam from church to shrine from abbey to chantry so long as he lists but none of us will brook to be ruled or misruled by the foreign woman and the beauforts in his name nor reigned over by the french dame or the beggars brat and the traitor coward beaufort but be under our own noble duke and the white rose the only badge that makes the frenchman flee  the boy was scarcely fifteen but his political tone as of one who knew the world made his father laugh and say hark to the cockerel crowing loud  spurs forsooth  the lords edward and edmund are knighted grunted rob and theres but few years betwixt us  but a good many earldoms and lands said the baron  hadst spoken of being out of pagedom twere another thing  you are coming sir cried rob willing to put by the subject you are coming to see how i can win honours  aye aye said his father  when nevil calls then must dacre come though his old bones might well be at rest now  salisbury and warwick taking to flight like attainted traitors to please the foreign woman saidst thou  then it is the time men were in the saddle  well i knew you would say so and so i told my lord exclaimed robert  thou didst quotha  without doubt the duke was greatly reassured by thy testimony said his father drily while the mother full of pride and exultation in her goodly firstborn son could not but exclaim daunt him not my lord he has done well thus to be sent home in charge  i daunt him returned lord whitburn in his teasing mood  by his own showing not a troop of somersets best horsemen could do that  therewith more amicably father and son fell to calculations of resources which they kept up all through suppertime and all the evening till the names of hobs wills dicks and the like rang like a repeating echo in grisells ears  all through those long days of summer the father and son were out incessantly riding from one tenant or neighbour to another trying to raise menatarms and means to equip them if raised  all the dues on the herringboats and the two whalers on which grisell had reckoned for the winter needs were pledged to sunderland merchants for armour and weapons the colts running wild on the moors were hastily caught and reduced to a kind of order by rough breaking in  the women of the castle and others requisitioned from the village toiled under the superintendence of the lady and grisell at preparing such provision and equipments as were portable such as dried fish salted meat and barley cakes as well as linen and there was a good deal of tailoring of a rough sort at jerkins buff coats and sword belts not by any means the gentle work of embroidering pennons or scarves notable in romance  besides scoffed robert who would wear grisly grisells scarf  i would manfully shouted bernard i would cram it down the throat of that recreant copeland  oh hush hush bernard exclaimed grisell who was toiling with aching fingers at the repairs of her fathers greasy old buff coat such things are as robin well says for noble demoiselles with fair faces and leisure times like the lady margaret  and oh robin you have never told me of the lady margaret my dear mate at amesbury  what should i know of your lady margarets and such gear growled robin whose chivalry had not reached the point of caring for ladies  the lady margaret plantagenet the young lady margaret of york grisell explained  oh  thats what you mean is it  theres a whole troop of wenches at the high table in hall  they came after us with the duchess as soon as we were settled in trim castle but they are kept as demure and mim as may be in my ladys bower and theres a pretty sharp eye kept on them  some of the young squires who are fools enough to hanker after a few maids or look at the fairer ones get their noses wellnigh pinched off by proud ciss mother of the maids  then it would not avail to send poor grisells greetings by you  i should like to see myself delivering them  besides we shall meet my lord in camp with no cumbrance of woman gear  lord whitburns own castle was somewhat of a perplexity to him for though his lady had once been quite sufficient captain for his scanty garrison she was in too uncertain health and what was worse too much broken in spirit and courage to be fit for the charge  he therefore decided on leaving cuthbert ridley who in winter at least was scarcely as capable of roughing it as of old to protect the castle with a few old or partly disabled men who could man the walls to some degree therefore it was unlikely that there would be any attack  so on a may morning the old weatherbeaten dacre pennon with its three crusading scallopshells was uplifted in the court and round it mustered about thirty men of whom eighteen had been raised by the baron some being his own vassals and others hired at sunderland the rest were volunteersgentlemen their younger sons and their attendantsplacing themselves under his leadership either from goodwill to york and nevil or from love of enterprise and hope of plunder    chapter xiiia knot    i would mine heart had caught that wound    and slept beside him rather i think it were a better thing than murdered friend and marriagering    forced on my life together  e b browning the romaunt of the page  ladies were accustomed to live for weeks months nay years without news of those whom they had sent to the wars and to live their life without them  the lady of whitburn did not expect to see her husband or son again till the summer campaign was over and she was not at all uneasy about them for the full armour of a gentleman had arrived at such a pitch of perfection that it was exceedingly difficult to kill him and such was the weight that his danger in being overthrown was of never being able to get up but lying there to be smothered made prisoner or killed by breaking into his armour the knights could not have moved at all under the weight if they had not been trained from infancy and had nearly reduced themselves to the condition of great tortoises  it was no small surprise when very late on a july evening when though twilight still prevailed all save the warder were in bed and he was asleep on his post a buglehorn rang out the masters note at first in the usual tones then more loudly and impatiently hastening out of bed to her loophole window grisell saw a party beneath the walls her fathers scallopshells dimly seen above them and a little in the rear one who was evidently a prisoner  the blasts grew fiercer the warder and the castle were beginning to be astir and when grisell hurried into the outer room she found her mother afoot and hastily dressing  my lord my lord it is his note she cried  father come home shouted bernard just awake  grisly  grisly help me don my clothes  lady whitburn trembled and shook with haste and grisell could not help her very rapidly in the dark with bernard howling rather than calling for help all the time and before she still less grisell was fit for the public her fathers heavy step was on the stairs and she heard fragments of his words  all abed  we must have supperridden from ayton since last baiting  aye got a prisoneryoung copelandold one slaingreat victorynorthampton  king takenbuckingham and egremont killed rob wellproud as a pyet  ho grisell as she appeared bestir thyself  we be ready to eat a horse behind the saddle  serve up as fast as may be  grisell durst not stop to ask whether she had heard the word copeland aright and ran downstairs with a throbbing heart just crossing the hall where she thought she saw a figure bowed down with hands over his face and elbows on his knees but she could not pause and went on to the kitchen where the peat fire was never allowed to expire and it was easy to stir it into heat  whatever was cold she handed over to the servants to appease the hunger of the arrivals while she broiled steaks and heated the great perennial cauldron of broth with all the expedition in her power with the help of thora and the grumbling cook when he appeared angry at being disturbed  morning light was beginning to break before her toils were over for the dozen hungry men pounced so suddenly in on her and when she again crossed the hall most of them were lying on the strawbestrewn floor fast asleep  one she specially noticed his long limbs stretched out as he lay on his side his head on his arm as if he had fallen asleep from extreme fatigue in spite of himself  his light brown hair was short and curly his cheeks fair and ruddy and all reminded her of leonard copeland as he had been those long years ago before her accident  save for that she would have been long ago his wife she with her marred face the mate of that nobly fair countenance  how strange to remember  how she would have loved him frank and often kind as she remembered him though rough and impatient of restraint  what was that which his fingers had held till sleep had unclasped them  an ivory chessrook  such was a favourite token of ladies to their true loves  what did it mean might she pause to pray a prayer over him as once hersthat all might be well with him for she knew that in this unhappy war important captives were not treated as frenchmen would have been as prisoners of war but executed as traitors to their king  she paused over him till a low sound and the bright eyes of one of the dogs warned her that all might in another moment be awake and she fled up the stair to the solar where her parents were both fast asleep and across to her own room where she threw herself on her bed dressed as she was but could not sleep for the multitude of strange thoughts that crowded over her in the increasing daylight  by and by there was a stir some words passed in the outer room and then her mother came in  wake grisly  busk and bonne for thy weddingmorning instantly copeland is to keep his troth to thee at once  the earl of warwick hath granted his life to thy father on that condition only  oh mother is he willing cried grisell trembling  what skills that child  his hand was pledged and he must fulfil his promise now that we have him  was it troth  i cannot remember it said grisell  that matters not  your fathers plight is the same thing  his father was slain in the battle so tis between him and us  put on thy best clothes as fast as may be  thou shalt have my weddingveil and miniver mantle  speed i say  my lord has to hasten away to join the earl on the way to london  he will see the knot tied beyond loosing at once  to dress herself was all poor grisell could do in her bewilderment remonstrance was vain  the actual marriage without choice was not so repugnant to all her feelings as to a modern maiden it was the ordinary destiny of womanhood and she had been used in her childhood to look on leonard copeland as her property but to be forced on the poor youth instantly on his fathers death and as an alternative to execution set all her maidenly feelings in revolt  bernard was sitting up in bed crying out that he could not lose his grisly  her mother was running backwards and forwards bringing portions of her own bridal gear and directing thora who was combing out her young ladys hair which was long of a beautiful brown and was to be worn loose and flowing in the bridal fashion  grisell longed to kneel and pray but her mother hurried her  my lord must not be kept waiting there would be time enough for prayer in the church  then bernard clamouring loudly threw his arms round the thick old heavy silken gown that had been put on her and declared that he would not part with his grisly and his mother tore him away by force declaring that he need not fear copeland would be in no hurry to take her away and again when she bent to kiss him he clung tight round her neck almost strangling her and rumpling her tresses  ridley had come up to say that my lord was calling for the young lady and it was he who took the boy off and held him in his arms as the mother who seemed endued with new strength by the excitement threw a large white muffling veil over grisells head and shoulders and led or rather dragged her down to the hall  the first sounds she there heard were sir i have given my faith to the lady eleanor of audley whom i love  what is that to me  twas a precontract to my daughter  not made by me nor her  by your parents with myself  you went near to being her death outright marred her face for life so that none other will wed her what say you  not hurt by your own will  who said it was  what matters that  sir said leonard it is true that by mishap nay if you will have it so by a childs inadvertence i caused this evil chance to befall your daughter but i deny and my father denies likewise that there was any troth plight between the maid and me  she will own the same if you ask her  as i spake before there was talk of the like kind between you sir and my father and it was the desire of the good king that thus the families might be reconciled but the contract went no farther as the holy king himself owned when i gave my faith to the lord audleys daughter and with it my heart  aye we know that the frenchwoman can make the poor fool of a king believe and avouch anything she choose  this is not the point  no more words young man  here stands my daughter there is the rope choosewed or hang  leonard stood one moment with a look of agonised perplexity over his face  then he said if i consent am i at liberty free at once to depart  aye said whitburn  so you fulfil your contract the rest is nought to me  i am then at liberty  free to carry my sword to my queen and king  free  you swear it on the holy cross  lord whitburn held up the cross hilt of his sword before him and made oath on it that when once married to his daughter leonard copeland was no longer his prisoner  grisell through her veil read on the youthful face a look of grief and renunciation he was sacrificing his love to the needs of king and country and his words chimed in with her conviction  sir i am ready  if it were myself alone i would die rather than be false to my love but my queen needs good swords and faithful hearts and i may not fail her  i am ready  it is well said lord whitburn  ho you there  bring the horses to the door  grisell in all the strange suspense of that decision had been thinking of sir gawaine whose lines rang in her head but that look of grief roused other feelings  sir gawaine had no other love to sacrifice  sir sir she cried as her father turned to bid her mount the pillion behind ridley  can you not let him go free without  i always looked to a cloister  that is for you and he to settle girl  obey me now or it will be the worse for him and you  one word i would say added the mother  how far hath this matter with the audley maid gone  there is no troth plight i trow  no by all that is holy no  would the lad not have pleaded it if there had been  no more dillydallying  up on the horse grisly and have done with it  we will show the young recreant how promises are kept in durham county  he dragged rather than led his daughter to the door and lifted her passively to the pillion seat behind cuthbert ridley  a fine horse copelands own was waiting for him  he was allowed to ride freely but old whitburn kept close beside him so that escape would have been impossible  he was in the armour in which he had fought dimmed and duststained but still glancing in the morning sun which glittered on the sea though a heavy western thundercloud purple in the sun was rising in front of this strange bridal cavalcade  it was overhead by the time the church was reached and the heavy rain that began to fall caused the priest to bid the whole party come within for the part of the ceremony usually performed outside the west door  it was very dark within  the windows were small and old and filled with dusky glass and the arches were low browed  grisells mufflings were thrown aside and she stood as became a maiden bride with all her hair flowing over her shoulders and long tresses over her face but even without this her features would hardly have been visible as the dense cloud rolled overhead and indeed so tall and straight was her figure that no one would have supposed her other than a fair young spouse  she trembled a good deal but was too much terrified and as it were stunned for tears and she durst not raise her drooping head even to look at her bridegroom though such light as came in shone upon his fair hair and was reflected on his armour and on one golden spur that still he wore the other no doubt lost in the fight  all was done regularly  the lord of whitburn was determined that no ceremony that could make the wedlock valid should be omitted  the priest a kind old man but of peasant birth and entirely subservient to the dacres proceeded to ask each of the pair when they had been assoiled namely absolved  grisell as he well knew had been shriven only last friday leonard muttered three days since when i was dubbed knight ere the battle  that suffices put in the baron impatiently  on with you sir lucas  the thoroughly personal parts of the service were in english and grisell could not but look up anxiously when the solemn charge was given to mention whether there was any lawful letting to their marriage  her heart bounded as it were to her throat when leonard made no answer  but then what lay before him if he pleaded his promise  it went onthose betrothal vows dictated while the two cold hands were linked his with a kind of limp passiveness hers quaking especially as in the old use of york he took her for laither for fairerlaith being equivalent to loathlytill death us do part and with failing heart but still resolute heart she faltered out her vow to cleave to him for better for worse for richer for poorer in sickness or health and to be bonner debonair or cheerful and boughsome obedient till that final parting  the troth was plighted and the silver markpoor leonards sole available property at the momentlaid on the priests book as the words were said with worldly cathel i thee endow and the ring an old one of her mothers was held on grisells finger  it was done though alas the bridegroom could hardly say with truth with my body i thee worship  then followed the procession to the altar the chilly hands barely touching one another and the mass was celebrated when latin did not come home to the pair like english though both fairly understood it grisells feeling was by this time concentrated in the one hope that she should be dutiful to the poor unwilling bridegroom far more to be pitied than herself and that she should be guarded by god whatever befell  it was over  signing of registers was not in those days but there was some delay for the darkness was more dense than ever the rush of furious hail was heard without a great blue flash of intense light filled every corner of the church the thunder pealed so sharply and vehemently overhead that the small company looked at one another and at the church to ascertain that no stroke had fallen then the lord of whitburn first recovering himself cried come sir knight kiss your bride  ha where is he  sir leonardhere who hath seen him  not vanished in yon flash  eh  no but the men without cowering under the wall deposed that sir leonard copeland had rushed out shouted to them that he had fulfilled the conditions and was a free man taken his horse and galloped away through the storm    chapter xivthe lonely bride       grace for the callant if he marries our mucklemouth meg  browning  the recreant  shall we follow him was the cry of lord whitburns younger squire harry featherstone with his hand on his horses neck in spite of the torrents of rain and the fresh flash that set the horses quivering  no no roared the baron  i tell you no  he has fulfilled his promise i fulfil mine  he has his freedom  let him go  for the rest we will find the way to make him good husband to you my wench and as harry murmured something theres work enow in hand without spending our horses breath and our own in chasing after a runaway groom  a brief space we will wait till the storm be over  grisell shrank back to pray at a little side altar telling her beads and repeating the latin formula but in her heart all the time giving thanks that she was going back to bernard and her mother whose needs had been pressing strongly on her yet that she might do right by this newlyespoused husband whose downcast dejected look had filled her not with indignation at the slight to hershe was far past thatbut with yearning compassion for one thus severed from his true love  when the storm had subsided enough for these hardy northlanders to ride home and grisell was again perched behind old cuthbert ridley he asked well my dame of copeland dost peak and pine for thy runaway bridegroom  nay i had far rather be going home to my little bernard than be away with yonder stranger i ken not whither  thou art in the right my wench  if the lad can break the marriage by pleading precontract you may lay your reckoning on it that so he will  when they came home to the attempt at a marriagefeast which lady whitburn had improvised they found that this was much her opinion  he will get the knot untied she said  so thick as the king and his crew are with the pope it will cost him nothing but we may for very shame force a dowry out of his young knighthood to get the wench into whitby withal  so he even proffered on his way said the baron  he is a fair and knightly youth  tis pity of him that he holds with the frenchwoman ha bernard tis for thy good  for the boy was clinging tight to his sister and declaring that his grisly should never leave him again not for twenty vile runaway husbands  grisell returned to all her old habits and there was no difference in her position excepting that she was scrupulously called dame grisell copeland  her father was soon called away by the summons to parliament sent forth in the name of king henry who was then in the hands of the earl of warwick in london  the sheriffs messenger who brought him the summons plainly said that all the friends of york salisbury and warwick were needed for a great change that would dash the hopes of the frenchwoman and her son  he went with all his train leaving the defence of the castle to ridley and the ladies and assuring grisell that she need not be downhearted  he would yet bring her fine husband sir leonard to his marrow bones before her  grisell had not much time to think of sir leonard for as the summer waned both her mother and bernard sickened with low fever  in the ladys case it was intermittent and she spent only the third day in her bed the others in crouching over the fire or hanging over the childs bed where he lay constantly tossing and fevered all night sometimes craving to be on his sisters lap but too restless long to lie there  both manifestly became weaker in spite of all grisells simple treatment and at last she wrung from the lady permission to send ridley to wearmouth to try if it was possible to bring out master lambert groot to give his advice or if not to obtain medicaments and counsel from him  the good little man actually came riding a mule  ay ay quoth ridley i brought him though he vowed at first it might never be but when he heard it concerned you mistressi mean dame grisellhe was ready to come to your aid  good little man standing trim and neat in his burghers dress and little frilllike ruff he looked quite out of place in the dark old hall  lady whitburn seemed to think him a sort of magician though inferior enough to be under her orders  ha  is that your poticary she demanded when grisell brought him up to the solar  look at my bairn master dutchman see to healing him she continued imperiously  lambert was too well used to incivility from nobles to heed her manner though in point of fact a flemish noble was far more civilised than this north country dame  he looked anxiously at bernard who moaned a little and turned his head away  nay now bernard entreated his sister look up at the good man he that sent you the sugarballs  he is come to try to make you well  bernard let her coax him to give his poor little wasted hand to the leech and looked with wonder in his heavy eyes at the stranger who felt his pulse and asked to have him lifted up for better examination  there was at first a dismal little whine at being touched and moved but when a pleasantly acid drop was put into his little parched mouth he smiled with brief content  his mother evidently expected that both he and she herself would be relieved on the spot but the apothecary durst not be hopeful though he gave the child a draught which he called a febrifuge and which put him to sleep and bade the lady take another of the like if she wished for a good nights rest  he added however that the best remedy would be a pilgrimage to lindisfarne which be it observed really meant absence from the foul close feverish air of the castle and all the evil odours of the court  to the lady he thought it would really be healing but he doubted whether the poor little boy was not too far gone for such revival indeed he made no secret that he believed the child was stricken for death  then what boots all your vaunted chirurgery cried the mother passionately  you outlandish cheat you  what did you come here for  you have not even let him blood  let him blood good madame exclaimed master lambert  in his state to take away his blood would be to kill him outright  false fool and pretender cried lady whitburn as if all did not ken that the first duty of a leech is to take away the infected humours of the blood  demented as i was to send for you  had you been worth but a pinch of salt you would have shown me how to lay hands on nan the witchwife the cause of all the scathe to my poor bairn  master lambert could only protest that he laid no claim to the skill of a witchfinder whereupon the lady stormed at him as having come on false pretences and at her daughter for having brought him and finally fell into a paroxysm of violent weeping during which grisell was thankful to convey her guest out of the chamber and place him under the care of ridley who would take care he had food and rest and safe convoy back to wearmouth when his mule had been rested and baited  oh master lambert she said it grieves me that you should have been thus treated  heed not that sweet lady  it oft falls to our share to brook the like and i fear me that yours is a weary lot  but my brother my little brother she asked  it is all out of my mothers love for him  alack lady what can i say  the child is sickly and little enough is there of peace or joy in this world for such be he high or low born  were it not better that the saints should take him to their keeping while yet a sackless babe  grisell wrung her hands together  ah he hath been all my joy or bliss through these years but i will strive to say it is well and yield my will  the crying of the poor little sufferer for his grisly called her back before she could say or hear more  her mother lay still utterly exhausted on her bed and hardly noticed her but all that evening and all the ensuing night grisell held the boy sometimes on her lap sometimes on the bed while all the time his moans grew more and more feeble his words more indistinct  by and by as she sat on the bed holding him on her breast he dropped asleep and perhaps outwearied as she was she slept too  at any rate all was still till she was roused by a cry from thora holy st hilda the bairn has passed  and indeed when grisell started the little head and hand that had been clasped to her fell utterly prone and there was a strange cold at her breast  her mother woke with a loud wail  my bairn  my bairn snatching him to her arms  this is none other than your dutchmans doings girl  have him to the dungeon  where are the stocks  oh my pretty boy  he breathed he is living  give me the wine  then as there was no opening of the pale lips she fell into another tempest of tears during which grisell rushed to the stair where on the lowest step she met lambert and ridley  have him away  have him away cuthbert she cried  out of the castle instantly  my mother is distraught with grief i know not what she may do to him o go  not a word  they could but obey riding away in the early morning and leaving the castle to its sorrow  so tenderly and sadly was little bernard carried to the vault in the church while grisell knelt as his chief mourner for her mother after her burst of passion subsided lay still and listless hardly noticing anything as if there had fallen on her some stroke that affected her brain  tidings of the baron were slow to come and though grisell sent a letter by a wandering friar to york with information of the childs death and the mothers illness it was very doubtful when or whether they would ever reach him    chapter xvwakefield bridge    i come to tell you things since then befallen after the bloody fray at wakefield fought where your brave father breathed his latest gasp  shakespeare king henry vi part iii  christmas went by sadly in whitburn tower but the succeeding weeks were to be sadder still  it was on a long dark evening that a commotion was heard at the gate and lady whitburn who had been sitting by the smouldering fire in her chamber seemed suddenly startled into life  tidings she cried  news of my lord and son  bring them grisell bring them up  grisell obeyed and hurried down to the hall  all the household men and maids were gathered round some one freshly come in and the first sound she heard was alack  alack my lady  howwhathow she asked breathlessly just recognising harry featherstone pale dusty bloodstained  it is evil news dear lady said old ridley turning towards her with outstretched hands and tears flowing down his cheeks  my knight  oh my knight  and i was not by  slain almost under her breath asked grisell  even so  at wakefield bridge began featherstone but at that instant walking stiff upright and rigid like a figure moved by mechanism lady whitburn was among them  my lord she said still as if her voice belonged to some one else slain  and thou recreant here to tell the tale  madam he fell before i had time to strike  she seemed to hear no word but again demanded my son  he hesitated a moment but she fiercely reiterated  my son  speak out thou coward loon  madam robert was cut down by the lord clifford beside the earl of rutland  tis a lost field  i barely scaped with a dozen men  i came but to bear the tidings and see whether you needed an arm to hold out the castle for young bernard  or i would be on my way to my own folk on the border for the queens men will anon be everywhere since the duke is slain  the duke  the duke of york was the cry as if a tower were down  what would you  we were caught by somerset like deer in a buck stall  here  give me a cup of ale i can scarce speak for chill  he sank upon the settle as one quite worn out  the ale was brought by some one and he drank a long draught while at a sign from ridley one of the servingmen began to draw off his heavy boots and greaves covered with frosted mud snow and blood all melting together but all the time he talked and the hearers remained stunned and listening to what had hardly yet penetrated their understanding  lady whitburn had collapsed into her own chair and was as still as the rest  he spoke incoherently and ridley now and then asked a question but his fragmentary narrative may be thus expanded  all had in yorkist opinion gone well in london  henry was in the power of the white rose and had actually consented that richard of york should be his next heir but in the meantime queen margaret had been striving her utmost to raise the welsh and the border lords on behalf of her son  she had obtained aid from scotland and the percies the dacres of gilsland and many more had followed her standard  the duke of york and earl of salisbury set forth to repress what they called a riot probably unaware of the numbers who were daily joining the queen  with them went lord whitburn hoping thence to return home and his son robert still a squire of the dukes household  they reached yorks castle of sendal and there merrily kept christmas but on st thomas of canterburys day they heard that the foe were close at hand many thousands strong and on the morrow queen margaret with her boy beside her and the duke of somerset came before the gate and called on the duke to surrender the castle and his own vaunting claims with it or else come out and fight  sir davy hall entreated the duke to remain in the castle till his son edward earl of march could bring reinforcements up from wales but york held it to be dishonourable to shut himself up on account of a scolding woman and the prudence of the earl of salisbury was at fault since both presumed on the easy victories they had hitherto gained  therefore they sallied out towards wakefield bridge to confront the main body of margarets army ignorant or careless that she had two wings in reserve  these closed in on them and their fate was certain  my lord fell in the melee among the first said featherstone  i was down beside him trying to lift him up when a big scot came with his bill and struck at my head and i knew no more till i found my master lying stark dead and stripped of all his armour  my sword was gone but i got off save for this cut and he pushed back his hair and a horses kick or two for the whole battle had gone over me and i heard the shouting far away  as my lord lay past help methought i had best shift myself ere more rascaille came to strip the slain  and as luck or my good saint would have it as i stumbled among the corpses i heard a whinnying and saw mine own horse brown weardale running masterless  glad enough was he poor brute to have my hand on his rein  the bridge was choked with fighting men so i was about to put him to the river when whom should i see on the bridge but young master robin and with him young lord edmund of rutland  there on the other side holding parley with them was the knight mistress grisell wedded and though he wore the white rose he gave his hand to them and was letting them go by in safety  i was calling to master rob to let me pass as one of his own when thundering on came the grim lord clifford roaring like the wind in roker caves  i heard him howl at young copeland for a traitor letting go the accursed spoilers of york  copeland tried to speak but clifford dashed him aside against the wall and ah woes me lady when master robin threw himself between the fellowa murrain on his nameran the fair youth through the neck with his sword and swept him off into the river then he caught hold of lord edmund crying out thy father slew mine and so do i thee and dashed out his brains with his mace for me i rode along farther swam my horse over the river in the twilight with much ado to keep clear of the dead horses and poor slaughtered comrades that cumbered the stream and what was even worse some not yet dead borne along and crying out  a woful day it was to all who loved the kindly duke of york or this same poor house  as luck would have it i fell in with jock of redesdale and a few more honest fellows who had scaped  we found none but friends when we were well past the river  they succoured us at the first abbey we came to  the rest have sped to their homes and here am i  such was the tenor of featherstones doleful history of that blood thirsty lancastrian victory  all had hung in dire suspense on his words and not till they were ended did grisell become conscious that her mother was sitting like a stone with fixed glassy eyes and dropped lip in the highbacked chair quite senseless and breathing strangely  they took her up and carried her upstairs as one who had received her death stroke as surely as had her husband and son on the slopes between sendal and wakefield  grisell and thora did their utmost but without reviving her and they watched by her hardly conscious of anything else as they tried their simple ineffective remedies one after another with no thought or possibility of sending for further help since the roads would be impassable in the long january night and besides the lancastrians might make them doubly perilous  moreover this dumb paralysis was accepted as past cure and needing not the doctor but the priest before the first streak of dawn on that tardy northern morning ridleys ponderous step came up the stair into the feeble light of the rush candle which the watchers tried to shelter from the draughts  the sad question and answer of no change passed and then ridley his gruff voice unnecessarily hushed said featherstone would speak with you lady  he would know whether it be your pleasure to keep him in your service to hold out the tower or whether he is free to depart  mine said grisell bewildered  yea exclaimed ridley  you are lady of whitburn  ah  it is true exclaimed grisell clasping her hands  woe is me that it should be so  and oh  cuthbert my husband if he lives is a queens man  what can i do  if it were of any boot i would say hold out the tower  he deserves no better after the scurvy way he treated you said cuthbert grimly he may be dead too though harry fears he was but stunned  but oh cried grisell as if she saw one gleam of light did not i hear something of his trying to save my brother and lord edmund  you had best come down and hear said ridley  featherstone cannot go till he has spoken with you and he ought to depart betimes lest the gilsland folk and all the rest of them be ravening on their way back  grisell looked at her mother who lay in the same state entirely past her reach  the hard stern woman who had seemed to have no affection to bestow on her daughter had been entirely broken down and crushed by the loss of her sons and husband  probably neither had realised that by forcing grisell on young copeland they might be giving their tower to their enemy  she went down to the hall where harry featherstone whose night had done him more good than hers had came to meet her looking much freshened and with a bandage over his forehead  he bent low before her and offered her his services but as he told her he and ridley had been talking it over and they thought it vain to try to hold out the tower even if any stout men did straggle back from the battle for the country round was chiefly lancastrian and it would be scarcely possible to get provisions or to be relieved  moreover the gilsland branch of the family who would be the male heirs were on the side of the king and queen and might drive her out if she resisted  thus there seemed no occasion for the squire to remain and he hoped to reach his own family and save himself from the risk of being captured  no sir we do not need you said grisell  if sir leonard copeland lives and claims this tower there is no choice save to yield it to him  i would not delay you in seeking your own safety but only thank you for your true service to my lord and father  she held out her hand which featherstone kissed on his knee  his horse was terribly jaded and he thought he could make his way more safely on foot than in the panoply of an esquire for in this war the poorer sort were hardly touched the attacks were chiefly made on nobles and gentlemen  so he prepared to set forth but grisell obtained from him what she had scarcely understood the night before the entire history of the fall of her father and brother and how gallantly leonard copeland had tried to withstand cliffords rage  he did his best for them she said as if it were her one drop of hope and comfort  ridley very decidedly hoped that cliffords blow had freed her from her reluctant husband and mayhap the marriage would give her claims on the copeland property  but grisell somehow could not join in the wish  she could only remember the merry boy at amesbury and the fair face she had seen sleeping in the hall and she dwelt on featherstones assurance that no wound had pierced the knight and that he would probably be little the worse for his fall against the parapet of the bridge  use her as he might she could not wish him dead though it was a worthy death in defence of his old playfellow and of her own brother    chapter xvia new master    in the dark chambere if the bride was fair    ye wis i could not see           and the bride rose from her knee and kissed the smile of her mother dead  e b browning the romaunt of the page  the lady of whitburn lingered from day to day sometimes showing signs of consciousness and of knowing her daughter but never really reviving  at the end of a fortnight she seemed for one day somewhat better but that night she had a fresh attack and was so evidently dying that the priest sir lucas was sent for to bring her the last sacrament  the passing bell rang out from the church and the old man with his little server before him came up the stair and was received by grisell thora and one or two other servants on their knees  ridley was not there  for even then while the priest was crossing the hall a party of spearmen with a young knight at their head rode to the gate and demanded entrance  the frightened porter hurried to call master ridley who instead of escorting the priest with the host to his dying lady had to go to the gate where he recognised sir leonard copeland far from dead in very different guise from that in which he had been brought to the castle before  he looked however awed as he said bending his head   is it sooth master ridley  is death beforehand with me  my old lady is in extremis sir replied ridley  poor soul she hath never spoken since she heard of my lords death and his sons  the younger lad  lives here demanded copeland  is it as i have heard  aye sir  the child passed away on the eve of st luke  i have my ladys orders he added reluctantly to open the castle to you as of right  it is well returned sir leonard  then turning round to the twenty men who followed him he said menatarms as you saw and heard there is death here  draw up here in silence  this good esquire will see that you have food and fodder for the horses  kemp hardcastle to his squires see that all is done with honour and respect as to the lady of the castle and mine  aught unseemly shall be punished  wherewith he dismounted and entered the narrow little court looking about him with a keen critical soldierly eye but speaking with low grave tones  i may not tarry he said to ridley but this place since it falls to me and mine must be held for the king and queen  my lady bows to your will sir returned ridley  copeland continued to survey the walls and very antiquated defences observing that there could have been few alarms there  this lasted till the rites in the sickroom were ended and the priest came forth  sir he said to copeland you will pardon the young lady  her mother is in articulo mortis and she cannot leave her  i would not disturb her said leonard  the saints forbid that i should vex her  i come but as in duty bound to damn this tower on behalf of king harry queen margaret and the prince of wales against all traitors  i will not tarry here longer than to put it into hands who will hold it for them and for me  how say you sir squire he added turning to ridley not discourteously  we ever did hold for king harry sir returned the old esquire  yea but against his true friends york and warwick  one is cut off ay and his aider and defender salisbury who should rather have stood by his king has suffered a traitors end at pomfret  my lord of salisbury  ah that will grieve my poor young lady sighed ridley  he was a kind lord save for his treason to the king said leonard we of his household long ago were happy enough though strangely divided now  for the rest till that young wolf cub edward of march and his mischiefstirring cousin of warwick be put down this place must be held against them and theirswhosoever bears the white rose  wilt do so master seneschal  i hold for my lady  that is all i know said ridley and she holds herself bound to you sir  faithful  ay  you will be her guardian i see but i must leave half a score of fellows for the defence and will charge them that they show all respect and honour to the lady and leave to you as seneschal all the household and of all save the wardship of the tower calling on you first to make oath of faith to me and to do nought to the prejudice of king henry the queen or prince nor to favour the friends of york or warwick  i am willing sir returned ridley who cared a great deal more for the house of whitburn than for either party whose cause he by no means understood perhaps no more than they had hitherto done themselves  as long as he was left to protect his lady it was all he asked and more than he expected and the courtesy not to say delicacy of the young knight greatly impressed both him and the priest though he suspected that it was a relief to sir leonard not to be obliged to see his bride of a few months  the selected garrison were called in  ridley would rather have seen them more of the north country yeoman type than of the regular weatherbeaten menatarms whom wars always bred up but their officer was a slender daintylooking pale young squire with his arm in a sling named pierce hardcastle selected apparently because his wound rendered rest desirable  sir leonard reiterated his charge that all honour and respect was to be paid to the lady of whitburn and that she was free to come and go as she chose and to be obeyed in every respect save in what regarded the defence of the tower  he himself was going on to monks wearmouth where he had a kinsman among the monks  with an effort just as he remounted his horse he said to ridley commend me to the lady  tell her that i am grieved for her sorrow and to be compelled to trouble her at such a time but tis for my queens service and when this troublous times be ended she shall hear more from me  turning to the priest he added i have no coin to spare but let all be done that is needed for the souls of the departed lord and lady and i will be answerable  nothing could be more courteous but as he rode off priest and squire looked at one another and ridley said he will untie your knot sir lucas  he takes kindly to castle and lands was the answer with a smile they may make the lady to be swallowed  i trow tis for his causes sake replied ridley  mark you he never once said my lady nor my wife  may the sweet lady come safely out of it any way sighed the priest  she would fain give herself and her lands to the church  may be tis the best that is like to befall her said ridley but if that young featherpate only had the wit to guess it he would find that he might seek christendom over for a better wife  they were interrupted by a servant who came hurrying down to say that my lady was even now departing and to call sir lucas to the bedside  all was over a few moments after he reached the apartment and grisell was left alone in her desolation  the only real deep mutual love had been between her and poor little bernard her elder brother she had barely seen her father had been indifferent chiefly regarding her as a damaged piece of property a burthen to the estate her mother had been a hard masculine untender woman only softened in her latter days by the dependence of ill health and her passion for her sickly youngest but on her grisell had experienced sister avices lesson that ministry to others begets and fosters love  and now she was alone in her house last of her household her work for her mother over a wife but loathed and deserted except so far as that the tie had sanctioned the occupation of her home by a hostile garrison  her spirit sank within her and she bitterly felt the impoverishment of the always scanty means which deprived her of the power of laying out sums of money on those rites which were universally deemed needful for the repose of souls snatched away in battle  it was a mercenary age among the clergy and besides it was the depth of a northern winter and the funeral rites of the lady of whitburn would have been poor and maimed indeed if a whole band of black benedictine monks had not arrived from wearmouth saying they had been despatched at special request and charge of sir leonard copeland    chapter xviistrange guests    the needle having nought to do    was pleased to let the magnet wheedle till closer still the tempter drew    and off at length eloped the needle  t moore  the nine days of mourning were spent in entire seclusion by grisell who went through every round of devotions prescribed or recommended by the church and felt relief and rest in them  she shrank when ridley on the tenth day begged her no longer to seclude herself in the solar but to come down to the hall and take her place as lady of the castle otherwise he said he could not answer for the conduct of copelands men  master hardcastle desires it too he said  he is a good lad enough but i doubt me whether his hand is strong enough over those fellows  you need not look for aught save courtesy from him  come down lady or you will never have your rights  ah cuthbert what are my rights  to be mistress of your own castle returned ridley and that you will never be unless you take the upper hand  here are all our household eating with these rogues of copelands and who is to keep rule if the lady comes not  alack and how am i to do so  however the consideration brought her to appear at the very early dinner the first meal of the day which followed on the return from mass  pierce hardcastle met her shyly  he was a tall slender stripling looking weak and ill and he bowed very low as he said greet you well lady and looked up for a moment as if in fear of what he might encounter  grisell indeed was worn down with long watching and grief and looked haggard and drawn so as to enhance all her scars and distortion of feature into more uncomeliness than her wont  she saw him shudder a little but his lame arm and wan looks interested her kind heart  i fear me you are still feeling your wound sir she said in the sweet voice which was evidently a surprise to him  it is my plea for having been a slugabed this morning he answered  they sat down at the table  grisell between ridley and hardcastle the servants and menatarms beyond  porridge and broth and very small ale were the fare and salted meat would be for supper and as grisell knew but too well already her own retainers were grumbling at the voracious appetites of the menatarms as much as did their unwilling guests at the plainness and niggardliness of the supply  thora had begged for a further allowance of beer for them or even to broach a cask of wine  for said she they are none such fiends as we thought if one knows how to take them courteously  there is no need that you should have any dealings with them thora said her lady with some displeasure master ridley sees to their provision  thora tossed up her head a little and muttered something about not being mewed out of sight and speech of all men  and when she attended her lady to the hall there certainly were glances between her and a slim young archer  the ladys presence was certainly a restraint on the rude menat arms though two or three of them seemed to her rough reckless looking men  after the meal all her kindly instincts were aroused to ask what she could do for the young squire and he willingly put himself into her hands for his hurt had become much more painful within the last day or two as indeed it proved to be festering and in great need of treatment  before the day was over the two had made friends and grisell had found him to be a gentle scholarly youth whom the defence of the queen had snatched from his studies into the battlefield  he told her a great deal about the good king and his encouragement of his beloved scholars at eton and he spoke of queen margaret with an enthusiasm new to grisell who had only heard her reviled as the frenchwoman  pierce could speak with the greatest admiration too of his own knight sir leonard whom he viewed as the pink of chivalry assuring lady copeland as he called her that she need never doubt for a moment of his true honour and courtesy  grisell longed to know but modest pride forbade her to ask whether he knew how matters stood with her rival lady eleanor audley  ridley however had no such feeling and he reported to grisell what he had discovered  young hardcastle had only once seen the lady and had thought her very beautiful as she looked from a balcony when king henry was riding to his parliament  leonard copeland then a squire was standing beside her and it had been currently reported that he was to be her bridegroom  he had returned from his captivity after the battle of northampton exceedingly downcast but striving vehemently in the cause of lancaster and hardcastle had heard that the question had been discussed whether the forced marriage had been valid or could be dissolved but since the bodies of lord whitburn and his son had been found on the ground at wakefield this had ceased and it was believed that queen margaret had commanded sir leonard on his allegiance to go and take possession of whitburn and its vassals in her cause  but pierce hardcastle had come to ridleys opinion that did his knight but shut his eyes the lady grisell was as good a mate as man could wish both in word and deed  i would fain said he have the lady eleanor to look at but this lady to dress my hurts ay and talk with me  never met i woman who was so good company  she might almost be a scholar at oxford for her wit  however much solace the lady might find in the courtesy of master hardcastle she was not pleased to find that her handmaiden thora exchanged glances with the young menatarms and in a few days ridley spoke to grisell and assured her that mischief would ensue if the silly wench were not checked in her habit of loitering and chattering whenever she could escape from her ladys presence in the solar which grisell used as her bower only descending to the hall at mealtimes  grisell accordingly rebuked her the next time she delayed unreasonably over a message but the girl pouted and muttered something about young ralph hart helping her with the heavy pitcher up the stair  it is unseemly for a maiden to linger and get help from strange soldiers said grisell  no more unseemly than for the dame to be ever holding converse with their captain retorted the north country handmaiden free of speech and with a toss of the head  whist thora or you must take a buffet said grisell clenching a fist unused to striking and trying to regard chastisement as a duty you know full well that my only speech with master hardcastle is as his hostess  thora laughed  ay lady i ken well what the men say  how that poor youth is spellbound and that you are casting your glamour over him as of old over my poor old lady and little master bernard  for shame thora to bring me such tales and grisells hand actually descended on her maidens face but so slight was the force that it only caused a contemptuous laugh which so angered the young mistress as to give her energy to strike again with all her might  and youd beat me observed her victim roused to anger  you are so ill favoured yourself that you cannot bear a man to look on a fair maid  what insolence is this cried grisell utterly amazed  go into the turret room spin out this hank and stay there till i call you to supper  say your ave and recollect what beseems a modest maiden  she spoke with authority which thora durst not resist and withdrew still pouting and grumbling  grisell was indeed young herself and inexperienced and knew not that her wrath with the girl might be perilous to herself while sympathy might have evoked wholesome confidence  for the maiden just developing into northern comeliness was attractive enough to win the admiration of soldiers in garrison with nothing to do and on her side their notice their rough compliments and even their jests were delightful compared with the dulness of her mistresss mourning chamber and court enough was paid to her completely to turn her head  if there were love and gratitude lurking in the bottom of her heart towards the lady who had made a fair and skilful maiden out of the wild fisher girl all was smothered in the first strong impulse of love for this young ralph hart the first to awaken the woman out of the child  the obstacles which grisell like other prudent mistresses in all times placed in the course of this true love did but serve to alienate the girl and place her in opposition  the creature had grown up as wild and untamed as one of the seals on the shore and though she had had a little training and teaching of late years it was entirely powerless when once the passion was evoked in her by the new intercourse and rough compliments of the young archer and she was for the time at his beck and call regarding her lady as her tyrant and enemy  it was the old story of many a household    chapter xviiiwitchery    the lady has gone to her secret bower the bower that was guarded by word and by spell  scott the lay of the last minstrel  master squire said the principal manatarms of the garrison to pierce hardcastle is it known to you what this laidly dames practices be  i know her for a dame worthy of all honour and esteem returned the esquire turning hastily round in wrath  he much disliked this man a regular mercenary of the free lance description a fellow of french or alsatian birth of middle age much strength and on account of a great gash and sideways twist of his snub nose always known as tordu and strongly suspected that he had been sent as a sort of spy or check on sir leonard copeland and on himself  the man replied with a growl  ah ha  sans doubt she makes her niggard fare seem dainty cakes to those under her art  in fact the evident pleasure young hardcastle took in the lady castellanes society the great improvement in his wound under her treatment and the manner in which the serfs around came to ask her aid in their maladies had excited the suspicion of the menatarms they were older men hardened and roughened inclined to despise his youth and to resent the orderly discipline of the household which under ridley went on as before and the murmurs of thora led to inquiries answered after the exaggerated fashion of gossip  there were outcries about provisions and wine or ale and shouts demanding more and when pierce declared that he would not have the lady insulted there was a hoarse loud laugh  he was about to order tordu as ringleader into custody but ridley said to him aside best not sir his fellows will not lay a finger on him and if we did so there would be a brawl and we might come by the worst  so pierce could only say with all the force he could bear in mind that sir leonard copeland is lord here and all miscourtesy to his lady is an offence to himself which will be visited with his wrath  the sneering laugh came again and tordu made answer ay ay sir she has bewitched you and well soon have him and you free  pierce was angered into flying at the man with his sword but the other men came between and ridley held him back  you are still a maimed man sir  to be foiled would be worse than to let it pass  there fellow ill spare you so you ask pardon of me and the lady  perhaps they thought they had gone too far for there was a sulky growl that might pass for an apology and ridleys counsel was decided that pierce had better not pursue the matter  what had been said however alarmed him and set him on the watch and the next evening when hardcastle was walking along the cliffs beyond the castle the lad who acted as his page came to him with round wondering eyes sir said he after a little hesitation is it sooth that the lady spake a spell over your arm  not to my knowledge said pierce smiling  it might be without your knowledge said the boy  they say it healed as no chirurgeon could have healed it and by magic arts  ha the lubbard oafs  you know better than to believe them dick  nay sir but tis her bowerwoman and madge the cooks wife  both aver that the lady hath bewitched whoever comes in her way ever since she crossed the door  she hath wrought strange things with her father mother and brothers  they say she bound them to her that the little one could not brook to have her out of sight yet she worked on him so that he was crooked and shrivelled  yet he wept and cried to have her ever with him while he peaked and pined and dwindled away  and her mother who was once a fine stately masterful dame pined to mere skin and bone and lay in lethargy and now she is winding her charms on you sir  pierce made an exclamation of loathing and contempt  dick lowered his voice to a whisper of awe  nay sir but le tordu and ned of the bludgeon purpose to ride over to shields to the wise and they will deal with her when he has found the witchs mark  the lady cried hardcastle in horror  you see her what she is  a holy woman if ever there was one  at mass each morning  ay but the wench thora told ralph that tis prayers backward she says there  thora has oft heard her at night and twas no ave nor credo as they say them here  pierce burst out laughing  i should think not  they speak gibberish and she for i have heard her in church speaks words with a meaning as her priest and nuns taught her  but her face sir  theres the evil ones mark  one side says nay to the other  the evil one  nay dick he is none other than sir leonard himself twas he that all unwittingly when a boy fired a barrel of powder close to her and marred her countenance  you are not fool and ass enough to give credence to these tales  i said not that i did sir replied the page but it is what the menatarms swear to having drawn it from the servingmaid  the adder muttered pierce  moreover continued the boy they have found out that there is a wise man witchfinder at shields  they mean to be revenged for the scanty fare and mean providings and they deem it will be a merry jest in this weary hold and that sir leonard will be too glad to be quit of his gruesome dame to call them to account  it was fearful news for pierce well knew his own incompetence to restrain these strong and violent men  he did not know where his knight was to be found and if he had known it was only too likely that these terrible intentions might be carried out before any messenger could reach him  indeed the belief in sorcery was universal and no rank was exempt from the danger of the accusation thoras treachery was specially perilous  all that the young man could do was to seek counsel with cuthbert ridley and even this he was obliged to do in the stable bidding dick keep watch outside ridley too had heard a spiteful whisper or two but it had seemed too preposterous for him to attend to it  you are young hardcastle he said with a smile or you would know that there is nothing a grumbler will not say nor how far mens tongues lie from their hands  nay but if their hands did begin to act how should we save the lady  theres nothing tordu would not do  could we get her away to some nunnery  there is no nunnery nearer at hand than gateshead and there the prioress is a musgrove no friend to my lord  she might give her up on such a charge for holy church is no guardian in them  my poor bairn  that ingrate thora too  i would fain wring her neck  yet here are our fisher folk who love her for her bounty  would they hide her asked pierce  that servingwenchwould i had drowned her ere bringing her here might turn them and were she tracked i ken not who might not be scared or tortured into giving her up  here dick looked in  tordu is crossing the yard he said  they both became immediately absorbed in studying the condition of featherstones horse which had never wholly recovered the flight from wakefield  after a time ridley was able to steal away and visit grisell in her apartment  she came to meet him and he read alarm incredulous alarm in her face  she put her hands in his  is it sooth she said in a strange awestricken voice  you have heard then my wench  thora speaks in a strange tone as though evil were brewing against me  but you and master hardcastle and sir lucas and the rest would never let them touch me  they should only do so through my hearts blood dear child but mine would be soon shed and hardcastle is a weakly lad whom those fellows believe to be bewitched  we must find some other way  sir leonard would save me if he knew  alas the good earl of salisbury is dead  tis true  if we could hide you till we be rid of these men  but where and he made a despairing gesture  grisell stood stunned and dazed as the horrible prospect rose before her of being seized by these lawless men tortured by the savage hands of the witchfinder subjected to a cruel death by fire or at best by water  she pressed her hands together feeling utterly desolate and prayed her prayer to the god of the fatherless to save her or brace her to endure  presently cuthbert exclaimed would master groats the poticary shelter you till this is overpast  his wife is deaf and must perforce keep counsel  he would  i verily believe he would exclaimed grisell and no suspicion would light on him  how soon can i go to him and how  if it may be this very night said ridley  i missed two of the rogues and who knows whither they may have gone  will there be time said the poor girl looking round in terror  certes  the nearest witchfinder is at shields and they cannot get there and back under two days  have you jewels lady  and hark you trust not to thora  she is the worst traitor of all  ask me no more but be ready to come down when you hear a whistle  that thora could be a traitress and turn against herthe girl whom she had taught trained and civilisedwas too much to believe  she would almost in spite of cautions have asked her if it were possible and tried to explain the true character of the services that were so cruelly misinterpreted but as she descended the dark winding stair to supper she heard the following colloquy  you will not deal hardly with her good ralph dear ralph  that thou shalt see maid  on thy life not a word to her  nay but she is a white witch she does no evil  what  going back on what thou saidst of her brother and her mother take thou heed or they will take order with thee  thou wilt take care of me good ralph  oh  i have done it for thee  never fear little one only shut thy pretty little mouth and there was a sound of kissing  what will they do to her in a lower voice  thou wilt see  sink or swim thou knowst  ha ha  she will have enough of the draught that is so free to us  grisell trembling and horrorstricken could only lean against the wall hoping that her beating heart did not sound loud enough to betray her till a call from the hall put an end to the terrible whispers  she hurried upwards lest thora should come up and perceive how near she had been then descended and took her seat at supper trying to converse with pierce as usual but noting with terror the absence of the two soldiers  how her evasion was to be effected she knew not  the castle keys were never delivered to her but always to hardcastle and she saw him take them but she received from ridley a look and sign which meant that she was to be ready and when she left the hall she made up a bundle of needments and in it her precious books and all the jewels she had inherited  that thora did not follow her was a boon    chapter xixa march hare    yonder is a man in sight  yonder is a housebut where no she must not enter there to the caves and to the brooks to the clouds of heaven she looks  wordsworth feast of brougham castle  long long did grisell kneel in an agony of prayer and terror as she seemed already to feel savage hands putting her to the ordeal  the castle had long been quiet and dark so far as she knew when there was a faint sound and a low whistle  she sprang to the door and held ridleys hand  now is the time he said under his breath the squire waits that treacherous little baggage is safe locked into the cellar whither i lured her to find some malvoisie for the rascaille crew come  he was without his boots and silently led the way along the narrow passage to the postern door where stood young hardcastle with the keys  he let them out and crossed the court with them to the little door leading to a steep descent of the cliffs by a narrow path  not till the sands were reached did any of the three dare to speak and then grisell held out her hands in thanks and farewell  may i not guard you on your way lady said pierce  best not sir returned ridley best not know whither she is gone i shall be back again before i am missed or your rogues are stirring  when sir leonard knows of their devices lady said pierce then will ridley tell him where to find you and bring you back in all honour  grisell could only sigh and try to speak her thanks to the young man who kissed her hand and stood watching her and ridley as the waning moon lighted them over the glistening sands till they sought the friendly shadows of the cliffs  and thus grisell dacre parted from the home of her fathers  cuthbert she said should you see sir leonard let him know that ifif he would be free from any bond to me i will aid in breaking it and ask only dowry enough to obtain entrance to a convent while he weds the lady he loves  ridley interrupted her with imprecations on the knight and exhortations to her to hold her own and not abandon her rights  if he keep the lands he should keep the wife was his cry  his word and heart began grisell  folly my wench  no question but she is bestowed on some one else you do not want to be quit of him and be mewed in a nunnery  i only crave to hide my head and not be the bane of his life  pshaw  you have seen for yourself  once get over the first glance and you are worth the fairest dame that ever was jousted for in the lists  send him at least a message as though it were not your will to cast him off  if you will have it so then said grisell tell him that if it be his desire i will strive to make him a true loyal and loving wife  the last words came with a sob and ridley gave a little inward chuckle as of one who suspected that the duties of the good and loving wife would not be unwillingly undertaken  castlebred ladies were not much given to long walks and though the distance was only two miles it was a good deal for grisell and she plodded on wearily to the sound of the lap of the sea and the cries of the gulls  the caverns of the rock looked very black and gloomy and she clung to ridley almost expecting something to spring out on her but all was still and the pale eastward light began to be seen over the sea before they turned away from it to ascend to the scattered houses of the little rising town  the bells of the convent had begun to ring for lauds but it was only twilight when they reached the wall of lamberts garden of herbs where there was a little door that yielded to ridleys push  the house was still closed and hoar frost lay on the leaves but grisell proposed to hide herself in the little shed which served the purpose of toolhouse and summerhouse till she could make her entrance  she felt sure of a welcome and almost constrained cuthbert to leave her so as to return to the tower early enough to avert suspicionan easier matter as the menatarms were given to sleeping as late as they could  he would make an errand to the apothecarys as soon as he could so as to bring intelligence  there sat grisell looking out on the brightening sky while the blackbirds and thrushes were bursting into song and sweet odours rising from the spring buds of the aromatic plants around and a morning bell rang from the great monastery church  with that she saw the house door open and master lambert in a fur cap and gown turned up with lambswool come out into the garden basket in hand and chirp to the birds to come down and be fed  it was pretty to see how the mavis and the merle the sparrow chaffinch robin and tit fluttered round and grisell waited a moment to watch them before she stepped forth and said ah  master groot here is another poor bird to implore your bounty  lady grisell he cried with a start  ah not that name she said not a word  o master lambert i came by night none have seen me none but good cuthbert ridley ken where i am  there can be no peril to you or yours if you will give shelter for a little while to a poor maid  dear lady we will do all we can returned lambert  fear not how pale you are  you have walked all night  come and rest  none will follow  you are sore spent  clemence shall bring you a warm drink  condescend dear lady and he made her lean on his arm and brought her into his large living room and placed her in the comfortable crosslegged chair with straps and cushions as a back while he went into some back settlement to inform his wife of her visitor and presently they brought her warm water with some refreshing perfume in a brass basin and he knelt on one knee to hold it to her while she bathed her face and hands with a spongea rare luxury  she started at every sound but lambert assured her that she was safe as no one ever came beyond the booth  his clemence had no gossips and the garden could not be overlooked while some broth was heated for her she began to explain her peril but he exclaimed methinks i know lady if it was thereanent that a great strapping hollander fellow from your tower came to ask me for a charm against gramarie with hints that twas in high places  twas enough to make one laugh to see the big lubber try to whisper hints and shiver and shake as he showed me a knot in his matted locks and asked if it were not the enemys tying  i told him twas tied by the enemy indeed the deadly sin of sloth and that a stout dutchman ought to be ashamed of himself for carrying such a head within or without  but i scarce bethought me the impudent schelm could have thought of you lady  hush again  forget the word  they are gone to shields in search of the witchfinder to pinch me and probe me and drown me or burn me cried grisell clasping her hands  oh take me somewhere if you cannot safely hide me i would not bring trouble on you  you need not fear he answered  none will enter here but by my goodwill and i will bar the garden door lest any idle lad should pry in but they come not here  the tortoise who crawls about in the summer fills them with too much terror for them to venture and is better than any watchdog  now let me touch your pulse  ah  i would prescribe lying down on the bed and resting for the day  she complied and clemence took her to the upper floor where it was the pride of the flemish housewife to keep a guestchamber absolutely neat though very little furnished and indeed seldom or never used but she solicitously stroked the big bed and signed to grisell to lie down in the midst of pillows of down above and below taking off her hood mantle and shoes and smoothing her down with nods and sweet smiles so that she fell sound asleep  when she awoke the sun was at the meridian and she came down to the noontide meal  master groot was looking much entertained  wearmouth he said was in a commotion  the great dutch whitburn manatarms had come in full of the wonderful story  not only had the grisly lady vanished but a crossbow man had shot an enormous hare on the moor a creature with one ear torn off and a seam on its face and masters hardcastle and ridley altogether favoured the belief that it was the sorceress herself without time to change her shape  did mynheer groot hold with them  for though dutch and flemings were not wholly friendly at home yet in a strange country they held together and remembered that they were both netherlanders and hannekin would fain know what thought the wise man  depend on it there was no time for a change gravely said groot have not nostradamus albertus magnus and rogerus bacon he was heaping names together as he saw hannekins big gray eyes grow rounder and rounder all averred that the great diabolus can give his minions power to change themselves at will into hares cats or toads to transport themselves to the sabbath on walpurgs night  you deem it in sooth said the dutchman for know you that the parish priest swears and so do the more part of the villein fisher folk that theres no sorcery in the matter but that she is a true and holy maid with no powers save what the saints had given her and that her cures were by skill  yet such was scarce like to a mere jungvrow  it went sorely against master lamberts feelings as well as somewhat against his conscience to encourage the notion of the death of his guest as a hare though it ensured her safety and prevented a search he replied that her skill certainly was uncommon in a jungvrow beyond nature no doubt and if they were unholy it was well that the arblaster had made a riddance of her  by the same token added hannekin the elf lock came out of my hair this very morn i having as you bade me combed it each morn with the horses currycomb  proof positive as lambert was glad to allow him to believe  and the next day all sunderland and the two wearmouths believed that the dead hare had shrieked in a human voice on being thrown on a fire and had actually shown the hands and feet of a woman before it was consumed  it was all the safer for grisell as long as she was not recognised and of this there was little danger  she was scarcely known in wearmouth and could go to mass at the abbey church in a deep black hood and veil  master lambert sometimes received pilgrims from his own country on their way to english shrines and she could easily pass for one of these if her presence were perceived but except to mass in very early morning she never went beyond the garden where the spring beauty was enjoyment to her in the midst of her loneliness and entire doubt as to her future  it was a grand old church too with lowbrowed arches reminding her of the dear old chapel of wilton and with a lofty though undecorated square tower entered by an archway adorned with curious twisted snakes with long beaks stretching over and under one another  the low heavy columns the round circles and the small windows casting a very dim religious light gave grisell a sense of being in the atmosphere of that best beloved place wilton abbey  she longed after sister avices wisdom and tenderness and wondered whether her lands would purchase from her knight power to return thither with dower enough to satisfy the demands of the proctor  it was a hope that seemed like an inlet of light in her loneliness when no one was faithful save cuthbert ridley and she felt cut to the heart above all by thoras defection and cruel accusations not knowing that half was owning to the intoxication of love and the other half to a gossiping tongue    chapter xxa blight on the white rose    witness aires unhappy water    where the ruthless clifford fell and when wharfe ran red with slaughter    on the day of towtons field gathering in its guilty flood the carnage and the ill spilt blood    that forty thousand lives could yield  southey funeral song of princess charlotte  grisell from the first took her part in the apothecarys household occupation was a boon to her and she not only spun and made lace with clemence but showed her new patterns learned in old days at wilton and still more did she enjoy assisting the master of the house in making his compounds learning new nostrums herself and imparting others to him showing a delicacy of finger which the old fleming could not emulate  in the fabrication of perfumes for the pouncet box and sweetmeats prepared with honey and sugar she proved to have a dainty hand so that lambert who would not touch her jewels declared that she was fully earning her maintenance by the assistance that she gave to him  they were not molested by the war which was decidedly a war of battles not of sieges but they heard far more of tidings than were wont to reach whitburn tower  they knew of the advance of edward to london and the terrible battle of towton begun was fought out while the snow fell far from bloodless on palm sunday and while the choir boys had been singing their gloria laus et honor in the gallery over the church door shivering a little at the untimely blast there had been grim and awful work when for miles around the wharfe and aire the snow lay mixed with blood  that the yorkists had gained was known and that the queen and prince had fled but nothing was heard of the fate of individuals and master lambert was much occupied with tidings from bruges whence information came in a messenger sent by a notary that his uncle an old miser whose harsh displeasure at his marriage had driven him forth was just dead leaving him heir to a fairly prosperous business and a house in the city  to return thither was of course lamberts intention as soon as he could dispose of his english property  he entreated grisell to accompany him and clemence assuming her that at the chief city of so great a prince as duke philip of burgundy she would have a better hope of hearing tidings of her husband than in a remote town like sunderland and that if she still wished to dispose of her jewels she would have a far better chance of so doing  he was arguing the point with her when there was a voice in the stall outside which made grisell start and lambert going out brought in cuthbert ridley staggering under the weight of his best suit of armour and with a bundle and bag under his mantle  grisell sprang up eagerly to meet him but as she put her hands into his he looked sorrowfully at her and she asked under her breath ah  sir leonard  no tidings of the recreant growled ridley but ill tidings for both of you  the dacres of gilsland are on us claiming your castle and lands as male heirs to your father  do they know that i live asked grisell orunable to control a little laughdo they deem that i was slain in the shape of a hare  or better than that put in lambert they have it now in the wharves that the corpse of the hare took the shape and hands of a woman when in the hall  i ken not the longtongued rogues said ridley but if my young lady were standing living and lifelike before them as thank st hilda i see her now they would claim it all the more as male heirs and this new king edward has granted old sir john seisin being that she is the wife of one of king henrys men  are they there  how did you escape  i got timely notice said cuthbert  twenty strong halted over the night at yeoman kesters farm on heather gilla fellow that would do anything for me since we fought side by side on the day of the herrings  so he sends out his two grandsons to tell me what they were after while they were drinking his good ale to health of their king edward  so forewarned forearmed  we have left them empty walls get in as they can or mayunless that traitor tordu chooses to stay and make terms with them  master hardcastle  would he fly  surely not asked grisell  master hardcastle with dutch hannekin and some of the better sort went off long since to join their knights banner and the saints know how the poor young lad sped in all the bloody work they have had  for my part i felt not bound to hold out the castle against my old lords side when there was no saving it for you so i put what belonged to me together and took poor old roan and my young ladys pony and made my way hither no one letting me  i doubt me much lady that there is little hope of winning back your lands whatever side may be uppermost yet there be true hearts among our villeins who say they will never pay dues to any save their lords daughter  then i am landless and homeless sighed grisell  the greater cause that you should make your home with us lady returned lambert groot and he went on to lay before ridley the state of the case and his own plans  house and business possibly a seat in the city council were waiting for him at bruges and the vessel from ostend which had continually brought him supplies for his traffic was daily expected  he intended so soon as she had made up her cargo of wool to return in her to his native country and he was urgent that the lady grisell should go with him representing that all the changes of fortune in the convulsed kingdom of england were sure to be quickly known there and that she was as near the centre of action in flanders as in durham besides that she would be out of reach of any enemies who might disbelieve the hare transformation  after learning the fate of her castle grisell much inclined to the proposal which kept her with those whom she had learnt to trust and love and she knew that she need be no burthen to them since she had profitable skill in their own craft and besides she had her jewels ridley moreover gave her hopes of a certain portion of her dues on the herringboats and the wool  will not you come with the lady sir asked lambert  oh come cried grisell  nay a squire of dames hath scarce been heard of in a poticars shop said ridley and there was an irresistible laugh at the rugged old gentleman so terming himself but as lambert and grisell were both about to speak he went on i can serve her better elsewhere  i am going first to my home at willimoteswick  i have not seen it these forty year and whether my brother or my nephew make me welcome or no i shall have seen the old moors and mosses  then methought i would come hither or to some of the towns about and see how it fares with the old tower and the folk and if they be as good as their word and keep their dues for my lady i could gather them and take or bring them to her with any other matter which might concern her nearly  this was thoroughly approved by grisells little council and lambert undertook to make known to the good esquire the best means of communication whether in person or by the transmission of payments since all the eastern ports of england had connections with dutch and flemish traffic which made the payment of monies possible  grisell meantime was asking for thora  her uncle ridley said had come up laid hands on her and soundly scourged her for her foul practices  he had dragged her home and when ralph hart had come after her had threatened him with a quarterstaff called out a mob of fishermen and finally had brought him to sir lucas who married them willynilly  he was the runaway son of a currier in york and had taken her en croupe and ridden off to his parents at the sign of the hart to bespeak their favour  grisell grieved deeply over thoras ingratitude to her and the two elder men foreboded no favourable reception for the pair and hoped that thora would sup sorrow  ridley spent the night at the sign of tire green serpent and before he set out for willimoteswick he confided to master groot a bag containing a silver cup or two and a variety of coins mostly french  they were he said spoils of his wars under king harry the fifth and the two lord salisburys which he had never had occasion to spend and he desired that they might be laid out on the lady grisell in case of need leaving her to think they were the dues from her faithful tenantry  to the hausvrow clemence it was a great grief to leave the peaceful home of her married life and go among kindred who had shown their scorn in neglect and cold looks but she kept a cheerful face for her husband and only shed tears over the budding roses and other plants she had to leave and she made her guest understand how great a comfort and solace was her company    chapter xxithe wounded knight    belted will howard is marching here and hot lord dacre with many a spear  scott the lay of the last minstrel  master groot a word with you  a lay brother in the coarse dark robe of st benedict was standing in the booth of the green serpent  groot knew him for brother christopher of monks wearmouth and touched his brow in recognition  have you here any balsam fit for a plaguey shot with an arquebuss the like of which our poor peaceful house never looked to harbour  for whom is it needed good brother  best not ask said brother christopher who was however an inveterate gossip and went on in reply to lamberts question as to the place of the wound  in the shoulder is the worst the bullet wound where the brother infirmarer has poured in hot oil  st bede how the poor knight howled though he tried to stop it and brought it down to moaning  his leg is broken beside but we could deal with that  his horse went down with him you see when he was overtaken and shot down by the gilsland folk  the gilsland folk  even so poor lad and he was only on his way to see after his own or his wifes since all the whitburn sons are at an end and the tower gone to the spindle side  they say too that the damsel he wedded perforce was given to magic and fled in form of a hare  but be that as it will young copelandst bede pardon me  what have i let out  reck not of that brother  the tale is all over the town  how of copeland  as i said even now he was on his way to the tower when the dacres will and harryfell on him and left him for dead but by the saints good providence his squire and groom put him on a horse and brought him to our abbey at night knowing that he is kin to our sub prior  and there he lies whether for life or death only heaven knows but for death it will be if only king edward gets a scent of him so hold your peace master groats as to who it be as you live or as you would not have his blood on you  master groats promised silence and gave numerous directions as to the application of his medicaments and brother kit took his leave reiterating assurances that sir leonards life depended on his secrecy  whatever was said in the booth was plainly audible in the inner room grisell and clemence were packing linen and the little shutter of the wooden partition was open  thus lambert found grisell standing with clasped hands and a face of intense attention and suspense  you have heard lady he said  oh yea yea  alas poor leonard she cried  the saints grant him recovery  methought you would be glad to hear you were like to be free from such a yoke  were you rid of him you of a yorkist house might win back your lands above all since as you once told me you were a playmate of the kings sister  ah dear master speak not so  think of him treacherously wounded and lying moaning  that gruesome oil  oh my poor leonard and she burst into tears  so fair and comely and young thus stricken down  bah exclaimed lambert  such are women  one would think she loved him who flouted her  i cannot brook the thought of his lying there in sore pain and dolour he who has had so sad a life baulked of his true love  master lambert could only hold up his hands at the perversity of womankind and declare to his clemence that he verily believed that had the knight been a true and devoted tristram himself ever at her feet the lady could not have been so sore troubled  the next day brought brother kit back with an earnest request from the infirmarer and the subprior that master groats would come to the monastery and give them the benefit of his advice on the wounds and the fever which was setting in since gunshot wounds were beyond the scope of the monastic surgery  to refuse would not have been possible even without the earnest entreaty of grisell and lambert who had that medical instinct which no training can supply went on his way with the lay brother  he came back after many hours sorely perturbed by the request that had been made to him  sir leonard he said was indeed sick nigh unto death grievously hurt and distraught by the fever or it might be by the blow on his head in the fall with his horse which seemed to have kicked him but there was no reason that with good guidance and rest he should not recover  but on the other hand king edward was known to be on his progress to durham and he was understood to be especially virulent against sir leonard copeland under the impression that the young knight had assisted in cliffords slaughter of his brother edmund of rutland  it was true that a monastery was a sanctuary but if all that was reported of edward plantagenet were true he might if he tracked copeland to the abbey insist on his being yielded up or might make abbot and monks suffer severely for the protection given to his enemy and there was much fear that the dacres might be on the scent  the abbot and father copeland were anxious to be able to answer that sir leonard was not within their precincts and having heard that master groats was about to sail for flanders the subprior made the entreaty that his nephew might thus be conveyed to the low countries where the fugitives of each party in turn found a refuge  father copeland promised to be at charges and in truth the scheme was the best hope for leonards chances of life  master groot had hesitated seeing various difficulties in the way of such a charge and being by no means disposed towards lady grisells unwilling husband as such though in a professional capacity he was interested in his treatment of his patient and was likewise touched by the good mien of the fine handsome straight limbed young man who was lying unconscious on his pallet in a narrow cell  he had replied that he would answer the next day when he had consulted his wife and the shipmaster whose consent was needful and there was of course another whom he did not mention  as he told all the colour rose in grisells face rosy on one side purple alas on the other  o master good master you will you will  is it your pleasure then mistress  i should have held that the kindness to you would be to rid you of him  no no no  you are mocking me  you know too well what i think is not this my best hope of making him know me and becoming his true andand  a sob cut her short but she cried i will be at all the pains and all the cost if only you will consent dear master lambert good master groot  ah would i knew what is well for her said lambert turning to his wife and making rapid signs with face and fingers in their mutual language but grisell burst in   good for her cried she  can it be good for a wife to leave her husband to be slain by the cruel men of york and warwick him who strove to save the young lord edmund  master you will suffer no such foul wrong  o master if you did i would stay behind in some poor hovel on the shore where none would track him and tend him there  i will  i vow it to st mary  hush hush lady  cease this strange passion  you could not be more moved if he were the tenderest spouse who ever breathed  but you will have pity sir  you will aid us  you will save us give him the chance for life  what say you housewife said groot turning to the silent clemence whom his signs and their looks had made to perceive the point at issue  her reply was to seize grisells two hands kiss them fervently clasp both together and utter in her deaf voice two flemish words goot vrow  grisell eagerly embraced her in tears  we have still to see what skipper vrowst says  he may not choose to meddle with english outlaws  if you cannot win him to take my knight he will not take me said grisell  there was no more to be said except something about the waywardness of the affections of women and dogs but master groot was not ill pleased at the bottom that both the females of the household took part against him and they had a merry supper that night amid the chests in which their domestic apparatus and stockintrade were packed with the dried lizard who passed for a crocodile sitting on the settle as if he were one of the company  grisells spirits rose with an undefined hope that like sir gawaines bride or her own namesake griselda the patient she should at last win her lords love and deprived as she was of all her own relatives there arose strongly within her the affection that ten long years ago had made her haunt the footsteps of the boy at amesbury manor  groot was made to promise to say not a word of her presence in his family  he was out all day while clemence worked hard at her demenagement and only with scruples accepted the assistance of her guest who was glad to work away her anxiety in the folding of curtains and stuffing of mails  at last lambert returned having been backwards and forwards many times between the vrow gudule and the abbey for skipper vrowst drove a hard bargain and made the most of the inconvenience and danger of getting into ill odour with the authorities and however anxious father copeland might be to save his nephew abbot and bursar demurred at gratifying extortion above all when the king might at any time be squeezing them for contributions hard to come by  however it had been finally fixed that a boat should put in to the abbey steps to receive the fleeces of the sheepshearing of the home grange and that rolled in one of these fleeces the wounded knight should be brought on board the vrow gudule where groot and the women would await him their freight being already embarked and all ready to weigh anchor  the chief danger was in a kings officer coming on board to weigh the fleeces and obtaining the toll on them  but sunderland either had no king or had two just at that time and father copeland handed master groot a sum which might bribe one or both while it was to the interest of the captain to make off without being overhauled by either    chapter xxiithe city of bridges    so for long hours sat enid by her lord there in the naked hall propping his head and chafing his pale hands and calling to him and at the last he wakend from his swoon  tennyson enid  the transit was happily effected and closely hidden in wool leonard copeland was lifted out the boat more than half unconscious and afterwards transferred to the vessel and placed in wrappings as softly and securely as grisell and clemence could arrange before king edwards men came to exact their poundage on the freight but happily did not concern themselves about the sick man  he might almost be congratulated on his semiinsensibility for though he suffered he would not retain the recollection of his suffering and the voyage was very miserable to every one though the weather was far from unfavourable as the captain declared  grisell indeed was so entirely taken up with ministering to her knight that she seemed impervious to sickness or discomfort  it was a great relief to enter on the smooth waters of the great canal from ostend and lambert stood on the deck recognising old landmarks and pointing them out with the joy of homecoming to clemence who perhaps felt less delight since the joys of her life had only begun when she turned her back on her unkind kinsfolk  nor did her face light up as his did while he pointed out to grisell the beauteous belfry rising on high above the manypeaked gables though she did smile when a longbilled longlegged stork flapped his wings overhead and her husband signed that it was in greeting the greeting that delighted him she could not hear the sweet chimes from that same tower which floated down the stream when he doffed his cap crossed himself and clasped his hands in devout thanksgiving  it was a wonderful scene of bustle where vessels of all kinds thronged together were drawn up to the wharf the beautiful tall painted ships of venice and genoa preeminent among the stoutlybuilt netherlanders and the english traders  shouts in all languages were heard and grisell looked round in wonder and bewilderment as to how the helpless and precious charge on the deck was ever to be safely landed  lambert however was truly at home and equal to the occasion  he secured some of the men who came round the vessel in barges clamouring for employment andgrisell scarce knew howleonard on his bed was lifted down and laid in the bottom of the barge  the big bundles and cases were committed to the care of another barge to follow close after theirs and on they went under one after another the numerous highpeaked bridges to which bruges owes its name while tall sharpgabled houses walls or sometimes pleasant green gardens bounded the margins with a narrow footway between  the houses had often pavement leading by stone steps to the river and stone steps up to the door which was under the deep projecting eaves running along the front of the housea stoop as the low countries called it  at one of thesenot one of the largest or handsomest but far superior to the old home at sunderlandhung the large handsome painted and gilded sign of the same serpent which grisell had learnt to know so well and here the barge hove to while two servants the man in a brown belted jerkin the old woman in a narrow tight white hood came out on the steps with outstretched hands  mein herr my dear master lambert  oh joy  greet thee well thanks to our lady that i have lived to see this day was the old womans cry  greet thee well dear old mother abra  greet thee trusty anton you had my message  have you a bed and chamber ready for this gentleman  such was lamberts hasty though still cordial greeting as he gave his hand to the manservant his cheek to his old nurse who was mother to anton  clemence in her gentle dumb show shared the welcome and directed as leonard was carried up an outside stone stair to a guestchamber and deposited in a stately bed with fresh cool lacebordered lavenderscented sheets and grisell put between his lips a spoonful of the cordial with which lambert had supplied her  more distinctly than before he murmured thanks sweet eleanor  the move in the open air had partly revived him partly made him feverish and he continued to murmur complacently his thanks to eleanor for tending her wounded knight little knowing whom he wounded by his thanks  on one point this decided grisell  she looked up at lambert and when he used her title of lady in begging her to leave old mother abra in charge and to come down to supper she made a gesture of silence and as she came down the broad staira refinement scarce known in englandshe entreated him to let her be grisell still  unless he accept me as his wife i will never bear his name she said  nay madame you are lady of whitburn by right  by right may be but not in fact nor could i be known as mine own self without cumbering him with my claims  no let me alone to be grisell as ever before an english orphan bowerwoman to vrow clemence if she will have me  clemence would not consent to treat her as bowerwoman and it was agreed that she should remain as one of the many orphans made by the civil war in england without precise definition of her rank and be only called by her christian name  she was astonished at the status of master groot the size and furniture of the house and the servants who awaited him all so unlike his little english establishment for the refinements and even luxuries were not only far beyond those of whitburn but almost beyond all that she had seen even in the households of the earls of salisbury and warwick  he had indeed been bred to all this for the burghers of bruges were some of the most prosperous of all the rich citizens of flanders in the golden days of the dukes of burgundy and he had left it all for the sake of his clemence but without forfeiting his place in his guild or his right to his inheritance  he was however far from being a rich man on a level with the great merchants though he had succeeded to a modest not unprosperous trade in spices drugs condiments and other delicacies  he fetched a skilful jewish physician to visit sir leonard copeland but there was no great difference in the young mans condition for many days  grisell nursed him indefatigably sitting by him so as to hear the sweet bells chime again and again and the storks clatter on the roofs at sunrise  still whenever her hand brought him some relief or she held drink to his lips his words and thanks were for eleanor and more and more did the sense sink down upon her like lead that she must give him up to eleanor  yes it was like lead for as she watched his face on the pillow her love went out to him  it might have done so even had he been disfigured like herself but his was a beautiful countenance of noble outlines and she felt a certain pride in it as hers while she longed to see it light up with reason and glow once more with health  then she thought she could rejoice even if there were no look of love for her  the eyes did turn towards her again with the mind looking out of them and he knew her for the nurse on whom he depended for comfort and relief  he thanked her courteously so that she felt a thrill of pleasure every time  he even learnt her name of grisell and once he asked whether she were not english to which she replied simply that she was and on a further question she said that she had been at sunderland with master groot and that she had lost her home in the course of the wars  there for some time it restedrested at least with the knight  but with the lady there was far from rest for every hour she was watching for some favourable token which might draw them nearer and give opportunity for making herself known  nearer they certainly drew for he often smiled at her  he liked her to wait on him and to beguile the weariness of his recovery by singing to him telling some of her store of tales or reading to him for books were more plentiful at bruges than at sunderland and there were even whispers of a wonderful mode of multiplying them far more quickly than by the scriveners hand  how her heart beat every time she thus ministered to him or heard his voice call to her but it was all as she could plainly see just as he would have spoken to clemence if she could have heard him and he evidently thought her likewise of burgher quality and much of the same age as the vrow groot  indeed the long toil and wear of the past months had made her thin and haggard and the traces of her disaster were all the more apparent so that no one would have guessed her years to be eighteen  she had taken her weddingring from her finger and wore it on a chain within her kirtle so as to excite no inquiry  but many a night ere she lay down she looked at it and even kissed it as she asked herself whether her knight would ever bid her wear it  until he did so her finger should never again be encircled by it  meantime she scarcely ever went beyond the nearest church and the garden which amply compensated clemence for that which she had left at sunderland  indeed that had been as close an imitation of this one as lambert could contrive in a colder climate with smaller means here was a fountain trellised over by a framework rich in roses and our ladys bower here were pinks gillyflowers pansies lavender and the new snowball shrub recently produced at gueldres and a little bush shown with great pride by anton the snowwhite rose grown in king renes garden of provence  these served as borders to the green walks dividing the beds of useful vegetables and fruits and aromatic herbs which the groots had long been in the habit of collecting from all parts and experimenting on  much did lambert rejoice to find himself among the familiar plants he had often needed and could not procure in england and for some of which he had a real individual love  the big improved distillery and all the jars and bottles of his youth were a joy to him almost as much as the old friends who accepted him again after a long wander year  clemence had her place too but she shrank from the society she could not share and while most of the burghers wives spent the summer evening sitting spinning or knitting on the steps of the stoop conversing with their gossips she preferred to take her distaff or needle among the roses sometimes tending them sometimes beguiling grisell to come and take the air in company with her for they understood one anothers mute language and when lambert groot was with his old friends they sufficed for one anotherso far as grisells anxious heart could find solace and perhaps in none so much as the gentle matron who could caress but could not talk    chapter xxiiithe

clerkes tale  it was on an early autumn evening when the belfry stood out beautiful against the sunset sky and the storks with their young fledglings were wheeling homewards to their nest on the roof

to them but he must keep terms with this old duke who sheltered him so long  still when he is firm fixed on his throne he may yet bring home our brave young prince and set the blessed king on his throne once more  ah  you love the king  i revere him as a saint and feel as though i drew my sword in a holy cause when i fight for him said leonard raising himself with glittering eyes  and the queen  queen margaret  ah by my troth she is a dame who makes swords fly out of their scabbards by her brave stirring words and her noble mien  her bright eyes and undaunted courage fire each mans heart in her cause till there is nothing he would not do or dare ay or give up for her and those she loves better than herself her husband and her son  you have done so faltered grisell  ah have i not  mistress i would that you bore any other name you mind me of the bane and grief of my life  verily uttered grisell with some difficulty  yea  tell me mistress have i ever when my brains were astray uttered any name  by times even so she confessed  i thought so  i deemed at times that she was here  i have never told you of the deed that marred my life  nay she said letting her bobbins fall though she drooped her head not daring to look him in the face  i was a mere lad a page in the earl of salisburys house  a good man was he but the jealousies and hatreds of the nobles had begun long ago and the good king hoped as he ever hoped to compose them so he brought about a compact between my father and the dacre of whitburn for a marriage between their children and caused us both to be bred up in the lady of salisburys household meaning i trow that we should enter into solemn contract when we were of less tender age but there never was betrothal and before any fit time for it had come i had the mishap to have the maid close to meshe was ever besetting and running after mewhen by some prank unhappily of mine a barrel of gunpowder blew up and wellnigh tore her to pieces my father came and her mother an unnurtured uncouth woman who would have forced me to wed her on the spot but my father would not hear of it more especially as there were then two male heirs so that i should not have gained her grim old tower and bare moorlands all held that i was not bound to her the queen herself owned it and that whatever the damsel might be the mother was a mere northern shebear whose child none would wish to wed and of the white rose besides  so the king had me to his school at eton and then i was a squire of my lord of somerset and there i saw my fairest eleanor audley  the queen and the duke of somersetrest his soulwould have had us wedded  on the love day when all walked together to st pauls and the king hoped all was peace we spoke our vows to one another in the garden of westminster  she gave me this rook i gave her the jewel of my cap i read her true love in her eyes like our limpid northern brooks  oh she was fair fairer than yonder star in the sunset but her father the lord audley was absent and we could go no farther and therewith came the queens summons to her liegemen to come and arrest salisbury at bloreheath  there never was rest again as you know  my father was slain at northampton i yielded me to young falconberg but i found the yorkists had set headsmen to work as though we had been traitors and i was begging for a priest to hear my shrift when who should come into the foul wretched barn where we lay awaiting the rope but old dacre of whitburn  he had craved me from the duke of york it seems and gained my life on what condition he did not tell me but he bound my feet beneath my horse and thus bore me out of the camp for all the first day  then i own he let me ride as became a knight on my word of honour not to escape but much did i marvel whether it were revenge or ransom that he wanted and as to ransom all our gold had all been riding on horseback with my poor father  what he had devised i knew not nor guessed till late at night we were at his rathole of a tower where i looked for a taste of the dungeons but no such thing  the choice that the old robber  grisell could not repress a dissentient murmur of indignation  ah well you are from sunderland and may know better of him  but any way the choice he left me was the halter that dangled from the roof and his grisly daughter  did you see her grisell contrived to ask  i thank the saints no  to hear of her was enow  they say she has a face like a cankered oak gall or a rotten apple lying cracked on the ground among the wasps  mayhap though you have seen her  grisell could truly say in a halfchoked voice never since she was a child for no mirror had come in her way since she was at warwick house  she was upborne by the thought that it would be a relief to him not to see anything like a rotten apple  he went on   my first answer and first thought was rather deathand of my word to my eleanor  ah you marvel to see me here now  i felt as though nothing would make me a recreant to her  her sweet smile and shining eyes rose up before me and half the night i dreamt of them and knew that i would rather die than be given to another and be false to them  ah but you will deem me a recreant  with the waking hours i thought of my king and queen  my elder brother died with lord shrewsbury in gascony and after me the next heir is a devoted yorkist who would turn my castle the key of cleveland against the queen  i knew the defeat would make faithful swords more than ever needful to her and that it was my bounden duty if it were possible to save my life my sword and my lands for her  mistress you are a good woman  did i act as a coward  you offered up yourself said grisell looking up  so it was  i gave my consent on condition that i should be free at once  we were wedded in the gloomere sunrisea thunderstorm coming up which so darkened the church that if she had been a peerless beauty fair as cressid herself i could not have seen her and even had she been beauty itself nought can to me be such as my eleanor  so i was free to gallop off through the storm for wearmouth when the rite was over and none pursued me for old whitburn was a man of his word  mine uncle held the marriage as nought but next i made for the queen at durham and if aught could comfort my spirit it was her thanks and assurances that it would cost nothing but the dispensation of the pope to set me free  so said dr morton her chaplain one of the most learned men in england  i told him all and he declared that no wedlock was valid without the heartfelt consent of each party  said he so poor grisell could not repress the inquiry  yea and that though no actual troth had passed between me and lord audleys daughter yet that the vows we had of our own free will exchanged would be quite enough to annul my forced marriage  you think it evil in me the more that it was i who had defaced that countenance  i thought of that  i would have endowed her with all i had if she would set me free  i trusted yet so to do when for my misfortune as well as hers the day of wakefield cut off her father and brother and a groom was taken who was on his way to sendal with tidings of the other brothers death  then what do the queen and sir pierre de breze but command me to ride off instantly to claim whitburn tower  in vain did i refuse in vain did i plead that if i were about to renounce the lady it were unknightly to seize on her inheritance  they would not hear me  they said it would serve as a door to england and that it must be secured for the king or the dacres would hold it for york  they bade me on my allegiance and commanded me to take it in king henrys name as though it were a mere strangers castle and gave me a crew of hired menatarms as i verily believe to watch over what i did  but ere i started i made a vow in dr mortons hands to take it only for the king and so soon as the troubles be ended to restore it to the lady when our marriage is dissolved  as it fell out i never saw the lady  her mother lay adying and there was no summoning her  i bade them show her all due honour hoisted my pennon rode on to my uncle at wearmouth and thence to mine own lands whence i joined the queen on her way to london  as you well know all was over with our cause at towton moor and it was on my way northward after the deadly fight that half a dozen of the menatarms brought me tidings not only that the gilsland dacres had as had been feared claimed the castle but that this same socalled lady of mine had been shown to deal in sorcery and magic  they sent for a wise man from shields but she found by her arts what they were doing fled and was slain by an arquebuss in the form of a hare  do you believe it was herself in sooth asked grisell  ah you are bred by master lambert who like his kind hath little faith in sorcery but verily old women do change into hares  all have known them  she was scarce old grisell trusted herself to say  that skills not  they said she made strange cures by no rules of art  ay and said her prayers backward and had unknown books  did your squire tell this or was it only the men  my squire  poor pierce i never saw him  he was made captive by a white rose party so far as i could hear and st peter knows where he may be  but look you the lady for all her foul looks had cast her spell over him and held him as bound and entranced as by a true love so that he was ready to defend her beautyher beauty look youagainst all the world in the lists  he was neither to have nor to hold if any man durst utter a word against her  and it was the same with her tirewoman and her own old squire  then sir you deem that in slaying the hare the arquebusier rid you of your witch wife  there was a little bitterness even scorn in the tone  i say not so mistress  i know menatarms too well to credit all they say and i was on my way to inquire into the matter and learn the truth when these same dacres fell on me and that i lie here is due to you and good master lambert  many a woman whose face is ill favoured has learnt to keep up her power by unhallowed arts and if it be so with her whom in my boyish prank i have marred heaven forgive her and me  if i can ever return i shall strive to trace her life or death without which mayhap i could scarce win my true bride  grisell could bear no more of this crushing of her hopes  she crept away murmuring something about the vesper bell at the convent chapel near for it was there that she could best kneel while thoughts and strength and resolution came to her  the one thing clear to her was that sir leonard did not view her or rather the creature at whitburn tower as his wife but as a hag mayhap a sorceress from whom he desired to be released and that his love to eleanor audley was as strong as ever  should she make herself known and set him free  nay but then what would become of him  he still needed her care which he accepted as that of a nurse and while he believed himself to be living on the means supplied by his uncle at wearmouth to the apothecary this had soon been exhausted and grisell had partly supplied what was wanting from ridleys bag partly from what the old squire had sent her as the fishermens dues and she was perceiving how to supplement this or replace it by her own skill by her assistance to lambert in his concoctions and likewise by her lacework which was of a device learnt at wilton and not known at bruges  there was something strangely delightful to her in thus supporting leonard even though he knew it not and she determined to persist in her present course till there was some change  suppose he heard of eleanors marriage to some one else  then  but ah the cracked apple face  she must find a glass or even a pail of water and judge  or the lancastrian fortunes might revive he might go home in triumph and then would she give him her ring and her renunciation and either earn enough to obtain entrance to a convent or perhaps be accepted for the sake of her handiwork  any way the prospect was dreary and the affection which grew upon her as leonard recovered only made it sadder  to reveal herself would only be misery to him and in his present state of mind would deprive him of all he needed since he would never be base enough to let her toil for him and then cast her off  she thought it best or rather she yearned so much for counsel that at night over the fire in the stove she told what leonard had said to which her host listened with the fatherly sympathy that had grown up towards her  he was quite determined against her making herself known  the accusation of sorcery really alarmed him  he said that to be known as the fugitive heiress of whitburn who had bewitched the young squire and many more might bring both her and himself into imminent danger and there were lancastrian exiles who might take up the report  her only safety was in being known to the few who did meet her as the conventbred maiden whose home had been destroyed and who was content to gain a livelihood as the assistant whom his wifes infirmity made needful  as to sir leonard the knights own grace and gratitude had endeared him as well as the professional pleasure of curing him and for the ladys sake he should still be made welcome  so matters subsided  no one knew grisells story except master lambert and her father confessor and whether he really knew it through the medium of her imperfect french might be doubted  even clemence though of course aware of her identity did not know all the details since no one who could communicate with her had thought it well to distress her with the witchcraft story  few came beyond the open booth which served as shop though sometimes there would be admitted to walk in the garden and converse with master groot a young englishman who wanted his counsel on giving permanence and clearness to the ink he was using in that new art of printing which he was trying to perfect but which there were some who averred to be a work of the evil one imparted to the magician dr faustus    chapter xxivgrisells patience    when silent were both voice and chords    the strain seemed doubly dear yet sad as sweetfor english words    had fallen upon the ear  wordsworth incident at bruges  meanwhile leonard was recovering and vexing himself as to his future course inclining chiefly to making his way back to wearmouth to ascertain how matters were going in england  one afternoon however as he sat close to thine window while grisell sang to him one of her sweet old ballads a face attracted by the english words and voice was turned up to him  he exclaimed by st mary philip scrope and starting up began to feel for the stick which he still needed  a voice was almost at the same moment heard from the outer shop inquiring in halting french did i see the face of the beau sire leonard copeland  by the time leonard had hobbled to the door into the booth a tall perfectlyequipped manatarms in velvet bonnet with the burgundian cross bright cuirass rich crimson surcoat and handsome sword belt had advanced and the two embraced as old friends did embrace in the middle ages especially when each had believed the other dead  i deemed thee dead at towton  methought you were slain in the north  you have not come off scot free  nay but i had a narrow escape  my honest fellows took me to my uncle at wearmouth and he shipped me off with the good folk here and cares for my maintenance  how didst thou scape  half a dozen of uswill percy and a few moremade off from the woful field under cover of night and got to the seashore to a villagei know not the nameand laid hands on a fishers smack which jock of hull was seaman enough to steer with the aid of the lad on board as far as friesland and thence we made our way as best we could to utrecht where we had the luck to fall in with one of the dukes captains who was glad enough to meet with a few stout fellows to make up his company of menatarms  oh  methought it was the cross of burgundy  how art thou so well attired phil  we have all been pranked out to guard our duke to the king of frances sacring at rheims  i promise thee the jewels and gold blazed as we never saw the likeand as to the rascaille scots archers every one of them was arrayed so as the sight was enough to drive an honest borderer crazy  half their own kingdoms worth was on their beggarly backs  but do what they might our duke surpassed them all with his largesses and splendour  your duke grumbled leonard  aye mine for the nonce and a right openhanded lord is he  better be under him than under the shrivelled skinflint of france who wore his fine robes as though they galled him  come and take service here when thou art whole of thine hurt leonard  i thought thy duke was disinclined to lancaster  he may be to the queen and the poor king whom the saints guard but he likes english hearts and thews in his pay well enough  thou knowst i am a knight worse luck  heed not for thy knighthood  the duke of exeter and my lord of oxford have put their honours in their pouch and are serving him thy lame leg is a worse hindrance than the gold spur on it but i trow that will pass  the comrades talked on over the fate of english friends and homes and the hopelessness of their cause  it was agreed in this and in many subsequent visits from scrope that so soon as leonard should have shaken off his lameness he should begin service under one of the dukes captains  a manatarms in the splendid suite of the burgundian dukes was generally of good birth and was attended by two grooms and a page when in the field his pay was fairly sufficient and his accoutrements and arms were required to be such as to do honour to his employer  it was the refuge sooner or later of many a lancastrian and leonard who doubted of the regularity of his uncles supplies decided that he could do no better for himself while waiting for better times for his queen though master lambert told him that he need not distress himself there were ample means for him still  grisell spun and sewed for his outfit with a strange sad pleasure in working for him and she was absolutely proud of him when he stood before her perfectly recovered with the glow of health on his cheek and a light in his eye his length of limb arrayed in his own armour furbished and mended his bright helmet alone new and of her own providing out of her mothers pearl necklace his surcoat and silken scarf all her own embroidering  as he truly said he made a much finer appearance than he had done on the morn of his melancholy knighthood in the povertystricken army of king henry at northampton  thanks he said with a courteous bow to his good friends and hosts who had a wonderful power over the purse  he added special thanks to mistress grisell for her deft stitchery and she responded with downcast face and a low courtesy while her heart throbbed high  such a cavalier was sure of enlistment and leonard came to take leave of his host and announced that he had been sent off with his friend to garrison neufchatel where the castle being a border one was always carefully watched over  his friends at bruges rejoiced in his absence since it prevented his knowledge of the arrival of his beloved queen margaret and her son at sluys with only seven attendants denuded of almost everything having lost her last castles and sometimes having had to exist on a single herring a day  perhaps leonard would have laid his single sword at her feet if he had known of her presence but tidings travelled slowly and before they ever reached neufchatel the duke had bestowed on her wherewithal to continue her journey to her fathers court at bar  however he did not move  indeed be did not hear of the queens journey to scotland and fresh attempt till all had been again lost at hedgeley moor and hexham  he was so good and efficient a manatarms that he rose in promotion and attracted the notice of the count of charolais the eldest son of the duke who made him one of his own bodyguard  his time was chiefly spent in escorting the count from one castle or city to another but whenever charles the bold was at bruges leonard came to the sign of the green serpent not only for lodging nor only to take up the money that lambert had in charge for him but as to a home where he was sure of a welcome and of kindly womans care of his wardrobe and where he grew more and more to look to the sympathy and understanding of his english and burgundian interests alike which he found in the maiden who sat by the hearth  from time to time old ridley came to see her  he was clad in a pilgrims gown and broad hat and looked much older  he had had free quarters at willimoteswick but the wild young borderers had not suited his old age well except one clerkly youth who reminded him of little bernard and who later was the patron of his nephew the famous nicolas  he had thus set out on pilgrimage as the best means of visiting his dear lady  the first time he came under his robe he carried a girdle where was sewn up a small supply from father copeland for his nephew and another sum very meagre but collected from the faithful retainers of whitburn for their lady  he meant to visit the three kings at cologne and then to go on to st gall and to the various nearer shrines in france but to return again to see grisell and from time to time he showed his honest face more and more weatherbeaten though a pilgrim was never in want but grisell delighted in preparing new gowns clean linen and fresh hats for him  public events passed while she still lived and worked in the apothecarys house at bruges  there were wars in which sir leonard copeland had his share not very perilous to a knight in full armour but falling very heavily on poor citizens  bruges however was at peace and exceedingly prosperous with its fiftytwo guilds of citizens and wonderful trade and wealth  the bells seemed to be always chiming from its many beautiful steeples and there was one convent lately founded which began to have a special interest for grisell  it was the house of the hospitalier grey sisters which if not actually founded had been much embellished by isabel of portugal the wife of the duke of burgundy  philip though called the good from his genial manners and bounteous liberality was a man of violent temper and terrible severity when offended  he had a fierce quarrel with his only son who was equally hot tempered  the duchess took part with her son and fell under such furious displeasure from her husband that she retired into the house of grey sisters  she was first cousin once removed to henry viher mother the admirable philippa having been a daughter of john of gauntand she was the sister of the noble princes king edward of portugal henry the great voyager and ferdinand the constant prince and she had never been thoroughly at home or happy in flanders where her husband was of a far coarser nature than her own family and in her own words after many years she always felt herself a stranger  some of grisells lace had found its way to the convent and was at once recognised by her as english such as her mother had always prized  she wished to give the chaplain a set of robes adorned with lace after a pattern of her own devising bringing in the five crosses of portugal with appropriate wreaths of flowers and emblems being told that the english maiden in master groots house could devise her own patterns she desired to see her and explain the design in person    chapter xxvthe old duchess    temples that rear their stately heads on high canals that intersect the fertile plain wide streets and squares with many a court and hall spacious and undefined but ancient all  southey pilgrimage to waterloo  the kind couple of groots were exceedingly solicitous about grisells appearance before the duchess and much concerned that she could not be induced to wear the headgear a foot or more in height with veils depending from the peak which was the fashion of the netherlands her black robe and hood permitted but not enjoined in the external or third order of st francis were as usual her dress and under it might be seen a face with something peculiar on one side but still full of sweetness and intelligence and the years of comfort and quiet had in spite of anxiety done much to obliterate the likeness to a cankered oak gall  lambert wanted to drench her with perfumes but she only submitted to have a little essence in the pouncet box given her long ago by lady margaret at their parting at amesbury  master groot himself chose to conduct her on this first great occasion and they made their way to the old gateway sculptured above with figures that still remain into the great cloistered court with its chapel chapterhouse and splendid great airy hall in which the hospital sisters received their patients  they were seen flitting about giving a general effect of gray whence they were known as soeurs grises though in fact their dress was white with a black hood and mantle  the duchess however lived in a set of chambers on one side of the court which she had built and fitted for herself  a lay sister became grisells guide and just then coming down from the duchesss apartments with a board with a chalk sketch in his hand appeared a young man whom groot greeted as master hans memling and who had been receiving orders and showing designs to the duchess for the ornamentation of the convent which in later years he so splendidly carried out  with him lambert remained  there was a broad stone stair leading to a large apartment hung with stamped spanish leather representing the history of king david and with a window glazed as usual below with circles and lozenges but the upper part glowing with coloured glass  at the farther end was a dais with a sort of throne like the tester and canopy of a fourpost bed with curtains looped up at each side  here the duchess sat surrounded by her ladies all in the sober dress suitable with monastic life  grisell knew her duty too well not to kneel down when admitted  a darkcomplexioned lady came to lead her forward and directed her to kneel twice on her way to the duchess  she obeyed and in that indescribable manner which betrayed something of her breeding so that after her second obeisance the manner of the lady altered visibly from what it had been at first as to a burgher maiden  the wealth and luxury of the citizen world of the low countries caused the proud and jealous nobility to treat them with the greater distance of manner  and as grisell afterwards learnt this was isabel de souza countess of poitiers a portuguese lady who had come over with her infanta and whose daughter produced les honneurs de la cour the most wonderful of all descriptions of the formalities of the court  grisell remained kneeling on the steps of the dais while the duchess addressed her in much more imperfect flemish than she could by this time speak herself  you are the lace weaver maiden  can you speak french  oui si madame son altese le veut replied grisell for her tongue had likewise become accustomed to french in this city of many tongues  this is english make said the duchess not with a very good french accent either looking at the specimens handed by her lady  are you english  so please your highness i am  an exile the princess added kindly  yes madame  all my family perished in our wars and i owe shelter to the good apothecary master lambert  purveyor of drugs to the sisters  yes i have heard of him and she then proceeded with her orders desiring to see the first piece grisell should produce in the pattern she wished which was to be of roses in honour of st elizabeth of hungary whom the peninsular isabels reckoned as their namesake and patroness  it was a pattern which would require fresh pricking out and much skill but grisell thought she could accomplish it and took her leave kissing the duchesss handa great favour to be granted to hercurtseying three times and walking backwards after the old training that seemed to come back to her with the atmosphere  master lambert was overjoyed when he heard all  now you will find your way back to your proper station and rank he said  it may do more than that said grisell  if i could plead his cause  lambert only sighed  i would fain your way was not won by a base mechanical art he said  out on you my master  the needle and the bobbin are unworthy of none and as to the honour of the matter what did sir leonard tell us but that the countess of oxford as now she is was maintaining her husband by her needle and grisell ended with a sigh at thought of the happy woman whose husband knew of and was grateful for her toils  the pattern needed much care and lambert induced hans memling himself who drew it so that it could be pricked out for the cushion in after times it might have been held a greater honour to work from his pattern than for the duchess who sent to inquire after it more than once and finally desired that mistress grisell should bring her cushion and show her progress  she was received with all the same ceremonies as before and even the small fragment that was finished delighted the princess who begged to see her at work  as it could not well be done kneeling a footstool covered in tapestry with the many burgundian quarterings was brought and here grisell was seated the duchess bending over her and asking questions as her fingers flew at first about the work but afterwards where did you learn this art maiden  at wilton so please your highness  the nunnery of st edith near to salisbury  st edith  i think my mother whom the saints rest spoke of her but i have not heard of her in portugal nor here  where did she suffer  she was not martyred madame but she has a fair legend  and on encouragement grisell related the legend of st edith and the christening  you speak well maiden said the duchess  it is easy to perceive that you are convent trained  have the wars in england hindered your being professed  nay madame it was the proctor of the italian abbess  therewith the inquiries of the duchess elicited all grisells early story with the exception of her name and whose was the iron that caused the explosion and likewise of her marriage and the accusation of sorcery  that male heirs of the opposite party should have expelled the orphan heiress was only too natural an occurrence nor did grisell conceal her home but whitburn was an impossible word to portuguese lips and dacre they pronounced after its crusading derivation de acor    chapter xxvithe dukes death    wither one rose and let the other flourish if you contend a thousand lives must wither  shakespeare king henry vi part iii  so time went on and the rule of the house of york in england seemed established while the exiles had settled down in burgundy grisell to her lace pillow leonard to the suite of the count de charolais indeed there was reason to think that he had come to acquiesce in the change of dynasty or at any rate to think it unwise and cruel to bring on another desperate civil war  in fact many of the red rose party were making their peace with edward iv  meanwhile the duchess isabel became extremely fond of grisell and often summoned her to come and work by her side and talk to her and thus came on the summer of 1467 when duke philip returned from the sack of unhappy dinant in a weakened state and soon after was taken fatally ill all the city of bruges watched in anxiety for tidings for the kindly duke was really loved where his hand did not press  one evening during the suspense when master lambert was gone out to gather tidings there was the step with clank of spurs which had grown familiar and leonard copeland strode in hot and dusty greeting vrow clemence as usual with a touch of the hand and inclination of the head and grisell with hand and courteous voice as he threw himself on the settle heated and weary and began with tired fingers to unfasten his heavy steel cap  grisell hastened to help him clemence to fetch a cup of cooling rhine wine  there thanks mistress  we have ridden all day from ghent in the heat and dust and after all the count got before us  to the duke  ay  he was like one demented at tidings of his fathers sickness say what they will of hot words and fierce passages between them that father and son have hearts loving one another truly  it is well they should agree at the last said grisell or the count will carry with him the sorest of memories  and indeed charles the bold was on his knees beside the bed of his speechless father in an agony of grief  presently all the bells in bruges began to clash out their warning that a soul was passing to the unseen land and grisell made signs to clemence while leonard lifted himself upright and all breathed the same for the mighty prince as for the poorest beggar the intercession for the dying  then the solemn note became a knell and their prayer changed to the de profundis out of the depths  presently lambert groot came in grave and saddened with the intelligence that philip the good had departed in peace with his wife and son on either side of him and his little granddaughter kneeling beside the duchess  there was bitter weeping all over bruges and soon all over flanders and the other domains united under the dukedom of burgundy for though philip had often deeply erred he had been a fair ruler balancing discordant interests justly and maintaining peace while all that was splendid or luxurious prospered and throve under him there was a certain dread of the future under his successor  a better man at heart said leonard who had learnt to love the count de charolais  he loathes the vices and revelry that have stained the court  that is true said lambert  yet he is a man of violence and with none of the skill and dexterity with which duke philip steered his course  a plague on such skill muttered leonard  caring solely for his own gain not for the right  yet your count has a heavy hand said lambert  witness dinant unhappy dinant  the rogues insulted his mother said leonard  he offered them terms which they would not have in their stubborn pride  but speak not of that  i never saw the like in england  there we strike at the great not at the small  ah well with all our wars and troubles england was the better place to live in  shall we ever see it more  there was something delightful to grisell in that we but she made answer so far as i hear there has been quiet there for the last two years under king edward  ay and after all he has the right of blood said leonard  our king henry is a saint and queen margaret a peerless dame of romance but since i have come to years of understanding i have seen that they neither had true claim of inheritance nor power to rule a realm  then would you make your peace with the white rose  the rose en soleil that wrought us so much evil at mortimers cross methinks i would  i never swore allegiance to king henry  my father was still living when last i saw that sweet and gracious countenance which i must defend for love and reverence sake  and he knighted you said grisell  true with a sharp glance as if he wondered how she was aware of the fact but only as my fathers heir  my poor old house and tenants  i would i knew how they fare but mine uncle sends me no letters though he does supply me  then you do not feel bound in honour to lancaster said grisell  nay i did not stir or strive to join the queen when last she called up the scotsthe scots indeedto aid her  i could not join them in a foray on england  i fear me she will move heaven and earth again when her son is of age to bear arms but my spirit rises against allies among scots or french and i cannot think it well to bring back bloodshed and slaughter  i shall pray for peace said grisell  all this was happiness to her as she felt that he was treating her with confidence  would she ever be nearer to him  he was a graver more thoughtful man at seven and twenty than he had been at the time of his hurried marriage and had conversed with men of real understanding of the welfare of their country  such talks as these made grisell feel that she could look up to him as most truly her lord and guide  but how was it with the fair eleanor and whither did his heart incline  an english merchant who came for spices had said that the lord audley had changed sides and it was thus probable that the damsel was bestowed in marriage to a yorkist but there was no knowing nor did grisell dare to feel her way to discovering whether leonard knew or felt himself still bound to constancy outwardly and in heart  every one was taken up with the funeral solemnities of duke philip he was to be finally interred with his father and grandfather in the grand tombs at dijon but for the present the body was to be placed in the church of st donatus at bruges at night  sir leonard rode at a foots pace in the troop of menatarms all in full armour which glanced in the light of the sixteen hundred torches which were borne before behind and in the midst of the procession which escorted the bier  outside the coffin arrayed in ducal coronet and robes with the golden fleece collar round the neck lay the exact likeness of the aged duke and on shields around the pall as well as on banners borne waving aloft were the armorial bearings of all his honours his four dukedoms seven counties lordships innumerable besides the banners of all the guilds carried to do him honour  more than twenty prelates were present and shared in the mass which began in the morning hour and in the requiem  the heralds of all the domains broke their white staves and threw them on the bier proclaiming that philip lord of all these lands was deceased then as in the case of royalty charles his son was proclaimed and the organ led an acclamation of jubilee from all the assembly which filled the church and a shout as of thunder arose vivat carolus  charles knelt meanwhile with hands clasped over his brow silent immovable  was he crushed at thought of the whirlwinds of passion that had raged between him and the father whom he had loved all the time or was there on him the weight of a foreboding that he though free from the grosser faults of his father would never win and keep hearts in the same manner and that a sad tumultuous troubled career and piteous untimely end lay before him  his mother grisells duchess according to the rule of the court lay in bed for six weeksat least she was bound to lie there whenever she was not in entire privacy  the room and bed were hung with black but a white covering was over her and she was fully dressed in the black and white weeds of royal widowhood  the light of day was excluded and hosts of wax candles burnt around  grisell did not see her during this first period of stately mourning but she heard that the good lady had spent her time in weeping and praying for her husband all the more earnestly that she had little cause personally to mourn him    chapter xxviiforget me not       and added of her wit a border fantasy of branch and flower and yellowthroated nestling in the nest  tennyson elaine  the duchess isabel sent for grisell as soon as the rules of etiquette permitted and her own mind was free to attend to the suite of lace hangings with which much progress had been made in the interval she was in the palace now greatly honoured for her son loved her with devoted affection and grisell had to pass through tapestryhung halls and chambers one after another with persons in mourning all filled with menatarms first then servants still in black dresses next pages and squires knights of the lady and lastly ladies in black velvet who sat at their work with a chaplain reading to them one of these the countess of poitiers whom grisell had known at the grey sisters convent rose graciously received her obeisance and conducted her into the great state bedroom likewise very sombre with black hangings worked and edged however with white and the window was permitted to let in the light of day  the bed was raised on steps in an alcove and was splendidly draped and covered with black embroidered with white but the duchess did not occupy it  a curtain was lifted and she came forward in her deepest robes of widowhood leading her little granddaughter mary a child of eight or nine years old  grisell knelt to kiss the hands of each and the duchess said   good griselda it is long since i have seen you  have you finished the border  yes your highness and i have begun the edging of the corporal  the duchess looked at the work with admiration and bade the little mary the damsel of burgundy look on and see how the dainty web was woven while she signed the maker to seat herself on a step of the alcove  when the childs questions and interest were exhausted and she began to be somewhat perilously curious about the carved weights of the bobbins her grandmother sent her to play with the ladies in the anteroom desiring grisell to continue the work  after a few kindly words the duchess said the poor child is to have a stepdame so soon as the year of mourning is passed  may she be good to her  hath the rumour thereof reached you in the city maid griselda that my son is in treaty with your english king though he loves not the house of york  but princely alliances must be looked for in marriage  madge exclaimed grisell then colouring i should say the lady margaret of york  you knew her  oh  i knew her  we loved each other well in the lord of salisburys house  there never was a maid whom i knew or loved like her  in the count of salisburys house repeated the duchess  were you there as the lady margarets fellowpupil she said as though perceiving that her lace maker must be of higher quality than she had supposed  it was while my father was alive madame and before her father had fixed his eyes on the throne your highness  and your father was you said the knight dededacor  so please you madame said grisell kneeling not to mention my poor name to the lady  we are a good way from speech of her said the duchess smiling our year of doole must pass and mayhap the treaty will not hold in the meantime  the king of france would fain hinder it  but if the demoiselle loved you of old would she not give you preferment in her train if she knew  oh madame i pray you name me not till she be here  there is much that hangs on it more than i can tell at present without doing harm but i have a petition to prefer to her  an affair of true love said the duchess smiling  i know not  oh ask me not madame  when grisell was dismissed she began designing a pattern in which in spray after spray of rich point she displayed in the pure frostworklike web the daisy of margaret the rose of york and moreover combined therewith the saltire of nevil and the three scallops of dacre and each connected with ramifications of the forgetmenot flower shaped like the turquoises of her pouncet box and with the letter g to be traced by ingenious eyes though the uninitiated might observe nothing  she had plenty of time though the treaty soon made it as much of a certainty as royal betrothals ever were but it was not till july came round again that bruges was in a crisis of the fever of preparation to receive the bride  sculptors painters carvers were desperately at work at the dukes palace  weavers tapestryworkers embroiderers sempstresses were toiling day and night armourers and jewellers had no rest and the bright july sunshine lay glittering on the canals graceful skiffs and gorgeous barges and bringing out in full detail the glories of the architecture above the tapestryhung windows in the midst the gailyclad vrows beneath while the bells rang out their merriest carillons from every steeple whence fluttered the banners of the guilds  the bride escorted by sir antony wydville was to land at sluys and duchess isabel with little mary went to receive her  will you go with me as one of my maids or as a tirewoman perchance asked the duchess kindly  grisell fell on her knee and thanked her but begged to be permitted to remain where she was until the bride should have some leisure and indeed her doubts and suspense grew more overwhelming  as she freshly trimmed and broidered leonards surcoat and swordbelt she heard one of the many gossips who delighted to recount the members of the english suite as picked up from the subordinates of the heralds and pursuivants who had to marshal the procession and order the banquet  fair ladies too he said from england  there is the lord audleys daughter with her father  they say she is the very pearl of beauties  we shall see whether our fair dames do not surpass her  the lord audleys daughter did you say asked grisell  his daughter yea but she is a widow bearing in her lozenge per pale with audley gules three herrings haurient argent for heringham  she is one of the duchess margarets damesofhonour  to grisell it sounded like her doom on one side the crisis of her selfsacrifice and the opening of leonards happiness on the other    chapter xxviiithe pageant    when i may read of tilts in days of old    and tourneys graced by chieftains of renown fair dames grave citoyens and warriors bold     if fancy would pourtray some stately town which for such pomp fit theatre would be fair bruges i shall then remember thee  southey pilgrimage to waterloo  leonard copeland was in close attendance on the duke and could not give a moment to visit his friends at the green serpent so that there was no knowing how the presence of the lady of heringham affected him  duke charles rode out to meet his bride at the little town of damme and here the more important portions of the betrothal ceremony took place after which he rode back alone to the cour des princes leaving to the bride all the splendour of the entrance  the monastic orders were to be represented in the procession  the grey sisters thought they had an especial claim and devised the presenting a crown of white roses at the gates and with great pleasure grisell contributed the best of master lamberts lovely white provence roses to complete the garland which was carried by the youngest novice a fair white rosebud herself  every one all along the line of the tall old houses was hanging from window to window rich tapestries of many dyes often with gold and silver thread  the trades and guilds had renewed their signs banners and pennons hung from every abode entitled to their use garlands of bright flowers stretched here and there and everywhere all had been in a frenzy of preparation for many days past and the final touches began with the first hours of light in the long summer morning  to grisells great delight cuthbert ridley plodded in at the hospitable door of the green serpent the night before  ah my ladybird said he in good health as ever  all the better for seeing you mine old friend she cried  i thought you were far away at compostella  so verily i was  heres st jamess cockle to witsantiago as they call him there and show the stone coffin he steered across the sea no small miracle that  and ive crossed france and looked at many a field of battle of the good old times and thought and said a prayer for the brave knights who broke lances there  but as i was making for st marthas cave in provence i met a friar who told me of the goodly gathering there was like to be here and i would fain see whether i could hap upon old friends or at any rate hear a smack of our kindly english tongue so i made the best of my way hither  in good time said lambert  you will take the lady and the housewife to the stoop at master caxtons house where he has promised them seats whence they may view the entrance  i myself am bound to walk with my fellows of the apothecaries society and it will be well for them to have another guard in the throng besides old anton  nay but my garb scarce befits the raree show said ridley looking at his russet gown  we will see to that anon said lambert and ere supper was over old anton had purveyed a loose blue gown from the neighbouring merchants with gold lace seams and girdle peaked boots and the hideous brimless hat which was then highly fashionable  ridleys trusty sword he had always worn under his pilgrims gown and with the dagger always used as a knife he made his appearance once more as a squire of degree still putting the scallop into his hat in honour of dacre as well as of st james  the party had to set forth very early in the morning slowly gliding along several streets in a barge watching the motley crowds thronging banks and bridgesa far more brilliant crowd than in these later centuries since both sexes were alike gay in plumage  from every house even those out of the line of the procession hung tapestry or coloured cloths and the garlands of flowers of all bright lines with their fresh greenery were still unfaded by the clear morning sun while joyous carillons echoed and reechoed from the belfry and all the steeples  ridley owned that he had never seen the like since king harry rode home from agincourtperhaps hardly even then for bruges was at the height of its splendour as were the burgundian dukes at the very climax of their magnificence  after landing from the barge ridley with grisell on his arm and anton with his mistress had a severe struggle with the crowd before they gained the ascent of the stoop where the upper steps had been railed in and seats arranged under the shelter of the projecting roof  master caxton was a grayeyed thincheeked neatlymade kentishman who had lived long abroad and was always ready to make an englishman welcome  he listened politely to grisells introduction of master ridley exchanged silent greetings with vrow clemence and insisted on their coming into the chamber within where a repast of cold pasty marchpane strawberries and wine awaited themto be eaten while as yet there was nothing to see save the expectant multitudes  moreover he wanted to show mistress grisell as one of the few who cared for it the manuscripts he had collected on the history of troy town and likewise the strange machine on which he was experimenting for multiplying copies of the translation he had in hand with blocks for the woodcuts which grisell could not in conscience say would be as beautiful as the gorgeous illuminations of his books  acclamations summoned them to the front of course at first to see only scattered bodies of the persons on the way to meet the bride at the gate of st croix  by and by however came the gang as ridley called it in earnest every body of ecclesiastics was there  monks and friars black white and gray nuns black white and blue the clergy in their richest robes with costly crucifixes of gold silver and ivory held aloft and reliquaries of the most exquisite workmanship sparkling with precious jewels diamond ruby emerald and sapphire flashing in the sun the fiftytwo guilds in gowns each headed by their master and their banner gorgeous in tint but with homely devices such as stockings saw and compasses weavers shuttles and the like  master lambert looked up and nodded a smile from beneath a banner with apollo and the python which ridley might be excused for taking for st michael and the dragon  the mayor in scarlet white fur and with gold collar surrounded by his burgomasters in almost equally radiant garments marched on  next followed the ducal household trumpets and all sorts of instruments before them making the most festive din through which came bursts of the joy bells  violet and black arrayed the inferiors setting off the crimson satin pourpoints of the higher officers on whose brimless hats each waved with a single ostrich plume in a shining brooch  then came more instruments and a body of gay green archers next heralds and pursuivants one for each of the dukes domains glittering back and front in the tabard of his countys armorial bearings and with its banner borne beside him  then a division of the dukes bodyguard all like himself in burnished armour with scarves across them  the nobles of burgundy flanders hainault holland and alsace the most splendid body then existing came in endless numbers their horses feathercrested as well as themselves with every bridle tinkling with silver bells and the animals invisible all but their heads and tails under their magnificent housings while the knights seemed to be pillars of radiance  yet even more gorgeous were the knights of the golden fleece who left between them a lane in which moved six white horses caparisoned in cloth of gold drawing an open litter in which sat as on a throne herself dazzling in cloth of silver the browneyed margaret of old her dark hair bride fashion flowing on her shoulders and around it a marvellouslyglancing diamond coronet above it however the wreath of white roses which her own hands had placed there when presented by the novice  clemence squeezed grisells hand with delight as she recognised her own white rose the finest of the garland  immediately after the car came margarets english attendants the stately handsome antony wydville riding nearest to her and then a bevy of dames and damsels on horseback but moving so slowly that grisell had full time to discover the silver herrings on the caparisons of one of the palfreys and then to raise her eyes to the face of the tall stately lady whose long veil flowing down from her towered headgear by no means concealed a beautiful complexion and fair perfect features such as her own could never have rivalled even if they had never been defaced  her heart sank within her everything swam before her eyes she scarcely saw the white doves let loose from the triumphant arch beyond to greet the royal lady and was first roused by ridleys exclamation as the knights with their attendants began to pass  ha the lad kens me  tis harry featherstone as i live  much more altered in these seven years than was cuthbert ridley there rode as a fullyequipped squire in the rear of a splendid knight harry featherstone the survivor of the dismal bridge of wakefield  he was lowering his lance in greeting but there was no knowing whether it was to ridley or to grisell or whether he recognised her as she wore her veil far over her face  this to grisell closed the whole  she did not see the figure which was more to her than all the rest for he was among the knights and guards waiting at the cour des princes to receive the bride when the final ceremonies of the marriage were to be performed  ridley declared his intention of seeking out young featherstone but grisell impressed on him that she wished to remain unknown for the present above all to sir leonard copeland and he had been quite sufficiently alarmed by the accusations of sorcery to believe in the danger of her becoming known among the english  more by token said he that the house of this master caxton as you call him seems to me no canny haunt  tell me what you will of making manifold good books or bad ill never believe but that dr faustus and the devil hatched the notion between them for the bewilderment of mens brains and the slackening of their hands  thus ridley made little more attempt to persuade his young lady to come forth to the spectacles of the next fortnight to which he rushed through crowds and jostling to behold with the ardour of an old warrior the various tilts and tourneys though he grumbled that they were nothing but childs play and vain show no earnest in them fit for a man  clemence however was all eyes and revelled in the sight of the wonders the view of the tree of gold and the champion thereof in the lists of the hotel de ville and again some days later of the banquet when the table decorations were mosaic gardens with silver trees laden with enamelled fruit and where as an interlude a whale sixty feet long made its entrance and emitted from its jaws a troop of moorish youths and maidens who danced a saraband to the sound of tambourines and cymbals  such scenes were bliss to the deaf housewife and would enliven the silent world of her memory all the rest of her life  the duchess isabel had retired to the grey sisters such scenes being inappropriate to her mourning and besides her apartments being needed for the influx of guests  there in early morning before the revels began grisell ventured to ask for an audience and was permitted to follow the duchess when she returned from mass to her own apartments  ah my lace weaver  have you had your share in the revels and pageantries  i saw the procession so please your grace  and your old playmate in her glory  yea madame  it almost forestalled the glories of heaven  ah child may the aping of such glory beforehand not unfit us for the veritable everlasting glories when all these things shall be no more  the duchess clasped her hands almost as a foreboding of the day when her sons corpse should lie forsaken gashed and stripped beside the marsh  but she turned to grisell asking if she had come with any petition  only madame that it would please your highness to put into the hands of the new duchess herself this offering without naming me  she produced her exquisite fabric which was tied with ribbons of blue and silver in an outer case worked with the white rose  the dowagerduchess exclaimed nay but this is more beauteous than all you have wrought before  ah here is your own device  i see there is purpose in these patterns of your web  and am i not to name you  i pray your highness to be silent unless the duchess should divine the worker  nay it is scarce to be thought that she will  yet you have put the flower that my english mother called forget menot  ah maiden has it a purpose  madame madame ask me no questions  only remember in your prayers to ask that i may do the right said grisell with clasped hands and weeping eyes    chapter xxixduchess margaret    i beheld the pageants splendid that adorned those days of old stately dames like queens attended knights who bore the fleece of gold  longfellow the belfry of bruges  in another week the festivities were over and she waited anxiously dreading each day more and more that her gift had been forgotten or misunderstood or that her old companion disdained or refused to take notice of her then trying to console herself by remembering the manifold engagements and distractions of the bride  happily grisell thought ridley was absent when leonard copeland came one evening to supper  he was lodged among the guards of the duke in the palace and had much less time at his disposal than formerly for duke charles insisted on the most strict order and discipline among all his attendants  moreover there were tokens of enmity on the part of the french on the border of the somme and leonard expected to be despatched to the camp which was being formed there  he was out of spirits  the sight and speech of so many of his countrymen had increased the longing for home  i loathe the mincing french and the fat flemish tongues he owned when master lambert was out of hearing  i should feel at home if i could but hear an honest carter shout woa to his horses  did you have any speech with the ladies asked grisell  i  no  what reck they of a poor knight adventurer  methought all the chivalry were peers and that a belted knight was a comrade for a king said grisell  ay in the days of the round table but when dukes and counts and great marquesses and barons swarm like mayflies by a trout stream what chance is there that a poor landless exile will have a word or a glance  did this mean that the fair eleanor had scorned him  grisell longed to know but for that very reason she faltered when about to ask and turned her query into one whether he had heard any news of his english relations  my good uncle at wearmouth hath been dead these four yearsso far as i can gather  amply must he have supplied master groot  i must account with him  for mine inheritance i can gather nothing clearly i fancy the truth is that george copeland who holds it is little better than a reiver on either side and that king edward might grant it back to me if i paid my homage save that he is sworn never to pardon any who had a share in the death of his brother of rutland  you had not  i know you had not  hurt ned  id as soon have hurt my own brother  nay i got this blow from clifford for coming between said he pushing back his hair so as to show a mark near his temple  but how did you know  harry featherstone told me  she had all but said my fathers squire  you knew featherstone  belike when he was at whitburn  he is here now a good man of his hands muttered leonard  anyway the king believes i had a hand in that cruel business of wakefield bridge and nought but his witness would save my neck if once i ventured into englandif that would  so i may resign myself to be the dukes captain of archers for the rest of my days  heigh ho  and a lonely man i fear me in debt to good master lambert or may be to mistress grisell to whom i owe more than coin will pay  ha was that interrupting himself for a trumpet blast was ringing out at intervals the signal of summons to the menatarms  leonard started up waved farewell and rushed off  the summons proved to be a call to the menatarms to attend the duke early the next morning on an expedition to visit his fortresses in picardy and as the household of the green serpent returned from mass they heard the tramp and clatter and saw the armour flash in the sun as the troop passed along the main street and became visible at the opening of that up which they walked  the next day came a summons from the convent of the grey sisters that mistress griselda was to attend the duchess isabel  she longed to fly through the air but her limbs trembled  indeed she shook so that she could not stand still nor walk slowly  she hurried on so that the lay sister who had been sent for her was quite out of breath and panted after her within gasps of stay stay mistress  no bear is after us  she runs as though a mad ox had got loose  her heart was wild enough for anything  she might have to hear from her kind duchess that all was vain and unnoticed  up the stair she went to the accustomed chamber where an additional chair was on the dais under the canopy the half circle of ladies as usual but before she had seen more with her dazzled swimming eyes even as she rose from her first genuflection she found herself in a pair of soft arms kisses rained on her cheeks and brow and there was a tender cry in her own tongue of my grisell my dear old grisell  i have found you at last  oh that was good in you  i knew the forgetmenots and all your little devices  ah as grisell unable to speak for tears of joy held up the pouncet box the childish gift  the soft pink velvet bodice girdled and clasped with diamonds was pressed to her the deep hanging silken sleeves were round her the white satin broidered skirt swept about her feet the pearledged matronly cap on the youthful head leant fondly against her as margaret led her up still in her embrace and cried it is she it is she  dear belle mere thanks indeed for bringing us together  the countess of poitiers looked on scandalised at english impulsiveness and the elder duchess herself looked for a moment stiff as her lacemaker slipped to her knees to kiss her hand and murmur her thanks  let me look at you cried margaret  ah have you recovered that terrible mishap  by my troth tis nearly gone  i should never have found it out had i not known  this was rather an exaggeration but joy did make a good deal of difference in grisells face and the duchess margaret was one of the most eager and warmhearted people living fervent alike in love and in hate ready both to act on slight evidence for those whose cause she took up and to nourish bitter hatred against the enemies of her house  now tell me all she continued in english  i heard that you had been driven out of wilton and my uncle of warwick had sped you northward  how is it that you are here weaving lace like any mechanical sempstress  nay nay  i cannot listen to you on your knees  we have hugged one another too often for that  grisell with the elder duchesss permission seated herself on the cushion at margarets feet  speak english continued the bride i am wearying already of french  ma belle mere you will not find fault  you know a little of our own honest tongue  duchess isabel smiled and grisell in answer to the questions of margaret told her story  when she came to the mention of her marriage to leonard copeland there was the vindictive exclamation bound to that bloodthirsty traitor  never  after the way he treated you no marvel that he fell on my sweet edmund  ah madame he did not  he tried to save him  he  a follower of king henry  never  truly madame  he had ever loved lord edmund  he strove to stay lord cliffords hand and threw himself between but clifford dashed him aside and he bears still the scar where he fell against the parapet of the bridge  harry featherstone told me when he fled from the piteous field where died my father and brother robin  your brother robin dacre  i remember him  i would have made him good cheer for your sake but my mother was ever strict and rapped our fingers nay treated us to the rod if we ever spake to any of my fathers meine  tell on grisell as her hand found its way under the hood and stroked the fair hair  poor lonely one  her indignation was great when she heard of copelands love and still more of his mission to seize whitburn saying truly enough that he should have taken both lady and tower or given both up and lending a most unwilling ear to the plea that he had never thought his relations to grisell binding  she had never loved lady heringham and it was plainly with good cause  then followed the rest of the story and when it appeared that grisell had been instrumental in saving copeland and close inquiries elicited that she had been maintaining him all this while actually for seven years all unknown to him the young duchess could not contain herself  grisell  grisell of patience indeed  belle mere belle mere do you understand and in rapid french she recounted all  he is my husband said grisell simply as the two duchesses showed their wonder and admiration  never did tale or ballad show a more saintly wife cried margaret and now what would you have me do for you my most patient of grisells  write to my brother the king to restore your lands and and i suppose you would have this recreant fellows given back since you say he has seen the error of following that makebate queen  but can you prove him free of edmunds blood  aught but that might be forgiven  master featherstone is gone back to england said grisell but he can bear witness but my fathers old squire cuthbert ridley is here who heard his story when he came to us from wakefield moreover i have seen the mark on sir leonards brow  let be  i will write to edward an you will  he has been more prone to lancaster folk since he was caught by the wiles of lady grey but i would that i could hear what would clear this knight of yours by other testimony than such as your loving heart may frame  but you must come and be one of mine my own ladies grisell and never go back to your poticaryfaugh  this however grisell would not hear of and margaret really reverenced her too much to press her  however ridley was sent for to the cour des princes and returned with a letter to be borne to king edward and likewise a mission to find featherstone and if possible red jock  tis working for that rogue copeland he growled  i would it were for you my sweet lady  it is working for me  think so with all your heart good cuthbert  well end as it may you will at least ken who and what you are wed or unwed fish flesh or good red herring and cease to live nameless like the poticarys servingwoman concluded ridley as his parting grumble    chapter xxxthe wedding chimes    low at times and loud at times changing like a poets rhymes rang the beautiful wild chimes from the belfry in the market of the ancient town of bruges  longfellow the carillon  no more was heard of the duchess for some weeks  leonard was absent with the duke who was engaged in that unhappy affair of peroune and liege the romantic version of which may be read in quentin durward and with which the present tale dares not to meddle though it seemed to blast the life of charles the bold all unknowing  the duchess margaret was youthful enough to have a strong taste for effect and it was after a long and vexatious delay that grisell was suddenly summoned to her presence to be escorted by master groot there she sat on her chair of state with the high tapestried back and the square canopy and in the throng of gentlemen around her grisell at a glance recognised sir leonard and likewise cuthbert ridley and harry featherstone though of course it was not etiquette to exchange any greetings  she knelt to kiss the duchesss hand and as she did so margaret raised her kissing her brow and saying with a clear full voice i greet you lady copeland baroness of whitburn  here is a letter from my brother king edward calling on the bishop of durham count palatine to put you in possession of thy castle and lands whoever may gainsay it  that leonard started with amazement and made a step forward grisell was conscious as she bent again to kiss the hand that gave the letter but there was more to come and margaret continued   also to you as to one who has the best right i give this parchment sealed and signed by my brother the king containing his full and free pardon to the good knight sir leonard copeland and his restoration to all his honours and his manors  take it lady of whitburn  it was you his true wife who won it for him  it is you who should give it to him  stand forth sir leonard  he did stand forth faltering a little as his first impulse had been to kneel to grisell then recollecting himself to fall at the duchesss feet in thanks  to her to her said the duchess but grisell as he turned spoke trying to clear her voice from a rising sob  sir leonard wait i pray  her highness hath not spoken all  i am well advised that the wedlock into which you were forced against your will was of no avail to bind us as you in mind and will were contracted to the lady eleanor audley  leonard opened his lips but she waved him to silence  true i know that she was likewise constrained to wed but she is a widow and free to choose for herself  therefore either by the bishop or it may be through our holy father the pope by mutual consent shall the marriage at whitburn be annulled and declared void and i pray you to accept seisin thereof while my lady her highness the duchess isabel with the lady prioress will accept me as a grey sister  there was a murmur  margaret utterly amazed would have sprung forward and exclaimed but leonard was beforehand with her  never never he cried throwing himself on his knees and mastering his wifes hand  grisell grisell dost think i could turn to the featherpated dullsouled ficklehearted thing i know now eleanor of audley to be instead of you  there was a murmur of applause led by the young duchess herself but grisell tried still to withdraw her hand and say in low broken tones nay nay she is fair i am loathly  what is her fair skin to me he cried to me who have learnt to know and love and trust to you with a very different love from the boys passion i felt for eleanor in youth and the cure whereof was the sight and words of the lady heringham  grisell grisell i was about to lay my very heart at your feet when the dukes trumpet called me away ere i guessed fool that i was that mine was the hand that left the scar that now i love but which once i treated with a brutes or a boys lightness  oh pardon me  still less did i know that it was my own forsaken wife who saved my life who tended my sickness nay as i verily believed toiled for me and my bread through these long seven years all in secret  yea and won my entire soul and deep devotion or ever i knew that it was to you alone that they were due  grisell grisell as she could not speak for tears  oh forgive  pardon me  turn not away to be a grey sister i cannot do without you  take me  let me strive throughout my life to merit a little better all that you have done and suffered for one so unworthy  grisell could not speak but she turned towards him and regardless of all spectators she was for the first time clasped in her husbands arms and the joyful tears of her friends high and low  what more shall be told of that victory  shall it be narrated how this wedlock was blest in the chapel while all the lovely bells of bruges rang out in rejoicing how mynheer groot and clemence rejoiced though they lost their guest how caxton gave them a choice specimen of his printing how ridley doffed his pilgrims garb and came out as a squire of dames how the farewells were sorrowfully exchanged with the duchess and how the duke growled that from
