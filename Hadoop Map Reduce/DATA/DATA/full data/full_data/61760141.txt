61760141	john knox and the reformation   john knox  from a posthumous portrait  bezas icones 1850 knox1jpg  to maurice hewlett     preface   in this brief life of knox i have tried as much as i may to get behind tradition which has so deeply affected even modern histories of the scottish reformation and even recent biographies of the reformer  the tradition is based to a great extent on knoxs own history which i am therefore obliged to criticise as carefully as i can  in his valuable john knox a biography professor hume brown says that in the history we have convincing proof alike of the writers good faith and of his perception of the conditions of historic truth  my reasons for dissenting from this favourable view will be found in the following pages  if i am right if knox both as a politician and an historian resembled charles i in sailing as near the wind as he could the circumstance as another of his biographers remarks only makes him more human and interesting  opinion about knox and the religious revolution in which he took so great a part has passed through several variations in the last century  in the edinburgh review of 1816 no liii pp 163180 is an article with which the present biographer can agree  several passages from knoxs works are cited and the reader is expected to be shocked at their principles  they are certainly shocking but they are not as a rule set before the public by biographers of the reformer  mr carlyle introduced a style of thinking about knox which may be called platonically puritan  sweet enthusiasts glide swiftly over all in the reformer that is specially distasteful to us  i find myself more in harmony with the outspoken hallam dr joseph robertson david hume and the edinburgh reviewer of 1816 than with several more recent students of knox  the reformers violent counsels and intemperate speech were remarkable writes dr robertson even in his own ruthless age and he gives fourteen examples 0a  lord hailes has shown he adds how little knoxs statements in his history are to be relied on even in matters which were within the reformers own knowledge  in scotland there has always been the party of cavalier and white rose sentimentalism  to this party queen mary is a saintly being and their admiration of claverhouse goes far beyond that entertained by sir walter scott  on the other side there is the party equally sentimental which musters under the banner of the covenant and sees scarcely a blemish in knox  a pretty sample of the sentiment of this party appears in a biography 1905 of the reformer by a minister of the gospel  knox summoned the organised brethren in 1563 to overawe justice when some men were to be tried on a charge of invading in arms the chapel of holyrood  no proceeding could be more anarchic than knoxs or more in accordance with the lovable customs of my dear country at that time  but the biographer of 1905 a placed minister writes that the doing of it knoxs summons was only an assertion of the liberty of the church and of the members of the commonwealth as a whole to assemble for purposes which were clearly lawfulthe purposes being to overawe justice in the course of a trial  on sentiment cavalier or puritan reason is thrown away  i have been surprised to find how completely a study of knoxs own works corroborates the views of dr robertson and lord hailes  that knox ran so very far ahead of the genevan pontiffs of his age in violence and that in his history he needs such careful watching was to me an unexpected discovery  he may have been an old hebrew prophet as mr carlyle says but he had also been a young scottish notary  a hebrew prophet is at best a dangerous anachronism in a delicate crisis of the church christian and the notarial element is too conspicuous in some passages of knoxs history  that knox was a great man a disinterested man in his regard for the poor a truly christian man as a shepherd of calvinistic souls a man fervent and considerate of pure life in friendship loyal by jealousy untainted in private character genial and amiable i am entirely convinced  in public and political life he was much less admirable and his history vivacious as it is must be studied as the work of an old fashioned advocate rather than as the summing up of a judge  his favourite adjectives are bloody beastly rotten and stinking  any inaccuracies of my own which may have escaped my correction will be dwelt on by enthusiasts for the prophet as if they are the main elements of this book and disqualify me as a critic of knoxs history at least any such errors on my part are involuntary and unconscious  in knoxs defence we must remember that he never saw his history in print but he kept it by him for many years obviously rereading for he certainly retouched it as late as 1571  in quoting knox and his contemporaries i have used modern spelling the letter from the state papers printed on pp 146 147 shows what the orthography of the period was really like  consultation of the original mss on doubtful points proves that the printed calendars though excellent guides cannot be relied on as authorities  the portrait of knox from bezas book of portraits of reformers is posthumous but is probably a good likeness drawn from memory after a description by peter young who knew him and a design presumably by adrianc vaensoun a fleming resident in edinburgh 0b  there is an interesting portrait possibly of knox in the national gallery of portraits but the work has no known authentic history  the portrait of queen mary at the age of thirtysix and a prisoner is from the earl of mortons original it is greatly superior to the sheffield type of likenesses of about 1578 and with janets and other drawings 15581561 the bridal medal of 1558 and in my opinion the earl of leven and melvilles portrait of about 15601565 is the best extant representation of the queen  the leven and melville portrait of mary young and charming and wearing jewels which are found recorded in her inventories has hitherto been overlooked  an admirable photogravure is given in mr j j fosters true portraiture of mary queen of scots 1905 and i understand that a photograph was done in 1866 for the south kensington museum  a lang  8 gibson place st andrews     chapter i ancestry birth education environment 15131546   november 24 1572  john knox minister deceased who had as was alleged the most part of the blame of all the sorrows of scotland since the slaughter of the late cardinal  it is thus that the decent burgess who in 1572 kept the diurnal of such daily events as he deemed important cautiously records the death of the great scottish reformer  the sorrows the cumber of which knox was alleged to bear the blame did not end with his death  they persisted in the conspiracies and rebellions of the earlier years of james vi they smouldered through the later part of his time they broke into far spreading flame at the touch of the covenant they blazed at dark worcester and bloody dunbar at preston fight and the sack of dundee by monk they included the cromwellian conquest of scotland and the shame and misery of the restoration to trace them down to our own age would be invidious  it is with the alleged author of the sorrows with his life works and ideas that we are concerned  john knox son of william knox and of  sinclair his wife 2a unlike most scotsmen unlike even mr carlyle had not an ell of pedigree  the common scoff was that each scot styled himself the kings poor cousin but john knox declared i am a man of base estate and condition 2b the genealogy of mr carlyle has been traced to a date behind the norman conquest but of knoxs ancestors nothing is known  he himself in 1562 when he ruled the roast in scotland told the ruffian earl of bothwell my grandfather my maternal grandfather and my father have served your lordships predecessors and some of them have died under their standards and this namely goodwill to the house of the feudal superior is a part of the obligation of our scottish kindness  knox indeed never writes very harshly of bothwell partly for the reason he gives partly perhaps because bothwell though an infamous character and a political opponent was not in 156267 an idolater that is a catholic if ever he had been one partly because his history ends before bothwells murder of darnley in 1567  knoxs ancestors were we may suppose peasant farmers like the ancestors of burns and hogg and knox though he married a maid of the queens kin bore traces of his descent  a man ungrateful and unpleasable northumberland styled him he was one who could not smiling put a question by if he had to remonstrate even with a person whom it was desirable to conciliate he stated his case in the plainest and least flattering terms  of nature i am churlish and in conditions different from many he wrote but this side of his character he kept mainly for people of high rank accustomed to deference and indifferent or hostile to his aims  to others especially to women whom he liked he was considerate and courteous but any assertion of social superiority aroused his wakeful independence  his countrymen of his own order had long displayed these peculiarities of humour  the small scottish cultivators from whose ranks knox rose appear even before his age in two strangely different lights  if they were not technically kindly tenants in which case their conditions of existence and of tenure were comparatively comfortable and secure they were liable to eviction at the will of the lord and to quote an account of their condition written in 1549 were in more servitude than the children of israel in egypt  henderson the writer of 1549 whom we have quoted hopes that the agricultural class may yet live as substantial commoners not miserable cottars charged daily to war and slay their neighbours at their own expense as under the standards of the unruly bothwell house this henderson was one of the political observers who before the scottish reformation hoped for a secure union between scotland and england in place of the old and romantic league with france  that alliance had indeed enabled both france and scotland to maintain their national independence  but with the great revolution in religion the interest of scotland was a permanent political league with england which knox did as much as any man to forward while by resisting a religious union he left the seeds of many sorrows  if the lowland peasantry from one point of view were terribly oppressed we know that they were of independent manners  in 1515 the chaplain of margaret tudor the queen mother writes to one adam williamson you know the use of this country  every man speaks what he will without blame  the man hath more words than the master and will not be content unless he knows the masters counsel  there is no order among us  thus two hundred and fifty years before burns the lowland scot was minded that a mans a man for a that  knox was the true flower of this vigorous lowland thistle  throughout life he not only spoke what he would but uttered the truth in such a tone as to make it unlikely that his message should be accepted by opponents  like carlyle however he had a heart rich in affection no breach in friendship he says ever began on his side while as a good hater dr johnson might have admired him  he carried into political and theological conflicts the stubborn temper of the border prickers his fathers who had ridden under the roses and the lion of the hepburns  so far knox was an example of the doctrine of heredity that we know however little we learn in detail about his ancestors  the birthplace of knox was probably a house in a suburb of haddington in a district on the path of english invasion  the year of his birth has long been dated on a late statement of little authority as 1505 4 seven years after his death however a man who knew him well namely peter young tutor and librarian of james vi told beza that knox died in his fiftyninth year  dr hay fleming has pointed out that his natal year was probably 151315 not 1505 and this reckoning we shall see appears to fit in better with the deeds of the reformer  if knox was born in 151315 he must have taken priests orders and adopted the profession of a notary at nearly the earliest moment which the canonical law permitted  no man ought to be in priests orders before he was twentyfive knox if born in 1515 was just twentyfive in 1540 when he is styled sir john knox one of the popes knights in legal documents and appears as a notary 5  he certainly continued in orders and in the notarial profession as late as march 1543  the law of the church did not in fact permit priests to be notaries but in an age when notaires were often professional forgers the additional security for character yielded by holy orders must have been welcome to clients and bishops permitted priests to practise this branch of the law  of knoxs near kin no more is known than of his ancestors  he had a brother william for whom in 1552 he procured a licence to trade in england as owner of a ship of 100 tons  even as late as 1656 there were not a dozen ships of this burden in scotland so william knox must have been relatively a prosperous man  in 154445 there was a william knox a fowler or gamekeeper to the earl of westmoreland who acted as a secret agent between the scots in english pay and their paymasters  we much later 1559 find the reformers brother william engaged with him in a secret political mission to the governor of berwick probably this william knew shy border paths and he may have learned them as the lord westmorelands fowler in earlier years  about john knoxs early years and education nothing is known  he certainly acquired such latin satis humilis says a german critic as scotland then had to teach probably at the burgh school of haddington  a certain john knox matriculated at the university of glasgow in 1522 but he cannot have been the reformer if the reformer was not born till 1513 15  beza on the other hand 1580 had learned probably from the reformer whom he knew well that knox was a st andrews man and though his name does not occur in the university register the register was very ill kept  supposing knox then to have been born in 151315 and to have been educated at st andrews we can see how he comes to know so much about the progress of the new religious ideas at that university between 1529 and 1535  the well of st leonards college was a notorious fountain of heresies under gawain logie the principal  knox very probably heard the sermons of the dominicans and franciscans against the pride and idle life of bishops and other abuses  he speaks of a private conversation between friar airth and major about 1534 and names some of the persons present at a sermon in the parish church of st andrews as if he had himself been in the congregation  he gives the text and heads of the discourse including merry tales told by the friar 6  if knox heard the sermons and stories of clerical scandals at st andrews they did not prevent him from taking orders  his greek and hebrew what there was of them knox must have acquired in later life at least we never learn that he was taught by the famous george wishart who about that time gave greek lectures at montrose  the catholic opponents of knox naturally told scandalous anecdotes concerning his youth  these are destitute of evidence about his youth we know nothing  it is a characteristic trait in him and a fact much to his credit that though he is fond of expatiating about himself he never makes confessions as to his earlier adventures  on his own years of the wild oat st augustine dilates in a style which still has charm but knox if he sowed wild oats is silent as the tomb  if he has anything to repent it is not to the world that he confesses  about the days when he was one of baals shaven sort in his own phrase when he was himself an idolater and a priest of the altar about the details of his conversion knox is mute  it is probable that as a priest he examined lutheran books which were brought in with other merchandise from holland read the bible for himself and failed to find purgatory the mass the intercession of saints pardons pilgrimages and other accessories of mediaeval religion in the scriptures 7  knox had only to keep his eyes and ears open to observe the clerical ignorance and corruption which resulted in great part from the scottish habit of securing wealthy church offices for ignorant brutal and licentious younger sons and bastards of noble families  this practice in scotland was as odious to good catholics like quentin kennedy ninian winzet and rather earlier to ferrerius as to knox himself  the prevalent anarchy caused by the long minorities of the stuart kings and by the interminable wars with england and the difficulty of communications with rome had enabled the nobles thus to rob and deprave the church and so to provide themselves with moral reasons good for robbing her again as a punishment for the iniquities which they had themselves introduced  the almost incredible ignorance and profligacy of the higher scottish clergy with notable exceptions in knoxs youth are not matter of controversy  they are as frankly recognised by contemporary catholic as by protestant authors  in the very year of the destruction of the monasteries 1559 the abuses are officially stated as will be told later by the last scottish provincial council  though three of the four scottish universities were founded by catholics and the fourth edinburgh had an endowment bequeathed by a catholic the clerical ignorance in knoxs time was such that many priests could hardly read  if more evidence is needed as to the debauched estate of the scottish clergy we obtain it from mary of guise widow of james v the regent then governing scotland for her child mary stuart  the queen in december 1555 begged pius iv to permit her to levy a tax on her clergy and to listen to what cardinal sermoneta would tell him about their need of reformation  the cardinal drew a terrible sketch of the nefarious lives of every kind of religious women in scotland  they go about with their illegal families and dower their daughters out of the revenues of the church  the monks too have bloated wealth while churches are allowed to fall into decay  the only hope is in the holy father who should appoint an episcopal commission of visitation  for about forty years prelates have been alienating church lands illegally and churches and monasteries by the avarice of those placed in charge are crumbling to decay  bishops are the chief dealers in cattle fish and hides though we have in fact good evidence that their dealings were very limited sma sums  not only the clergy but the nobles and people were lawless  they are more difficult to manage than ever writes mary of guise jan 13 1557  they are recalcitrant against law and order every attempt at introducing these is denounced as an attack on their old laws not that their laws are bad but that they are badly administered 9  scotland in brief had always been lawless and for centuries had never been godly  she was untouched by the first fervour of the franciscan and other religious revivals  knox could not fail to see what was so patent many books of the german reformers may have come in his way no more was wanted than the preaching of george wishart in 154345 to make him an irreconcilable foe of the doctrine as well as the discipline of his church  knox had a sincerely religious nature and a conviction that he was more than most men though a sinner in close touch with him in whom we live and move and have our being  we ask ourselves had knox as a priest of the altar never known the deep emotions which tongue may not utter that the ceremonies and services of his church so naturally awaken in the soul of the believer  these emotions if they were in his experience he never remembered tenderly he flung them from him without regret not regarding them even as dreams beautiful and dear but misleading that came through the ivory gate  to knoxs opponent in controversy quentin kennedy the mass was the blessed sacrament of the altar    which is one of the chief sacraments whereby our saviour for the salvation of mankind has appointed the fruit of his death and passion to be daily renewed and applied  in this traditional view there is nothing unedifying nothing injurious to the christian life  but to knox the wafer is an idol a god of water and meal but a feeble and miserable god that can be destroyed by a bold and puissant mouse  rats and mice will desire no better dinner than white round gods enough 10  the reformer and the catholic take up the question by different handles and the catholic grounds his defence on a text about melchizedek  to knox the mass is the symbol of all that he justly detested in the degraded church as she then was in scotland that horrible harlot with her filthiness  to kennedy it was what we have seen  knox speaks of having been in the puddle of papistry  he loathes what he has left behind him and it is natural to guess that in his first years of priesthood his religious nature slept that he became a priest and notary merely that he might eat a morsel of bread and that real conviction never was his till his studies of protestant controversialists and also of st augustine and the bible and the teaching of wishart raised him from a mundane life  then he awoke to a passionate horror and hatred of his old routine of mumbled masses of rites of human invention whereof he had never known the poetry and the mystic charm  had he known them he could not have so denied and detested them  on the other hand when once he had embraced the new ideas knoxs faith in them or in his own form of them was firm as the round world made so fast that it cannot be moved  he had now a pou sto whence he could and did move the world of human affairs  a faith not to be shaken and enormous energy were the essential attributes of the reformer  it is almost impossible to find an instance in which knox allows that he may have been mistaken davoir toujours raison was his claim  if he admits an error in details it is usually an error of insufficient severity  he did not attack northumberland or mary stuart with adequate violence he did not disapprove enough of our prayer book he did not hand a heretic over to the magistrates  while acting as a priest and notary between 1540 at latest and 1543 knox was engaged as private tutor to a boy named brounefield son of brounefield of greenlaw and to other lads spoken of as his bairns  in this profession of tutor he continued till 1547  knoxs personal aspect did not give signs of the uncommon strength which his unceasing labours demanded but like many men of energy he had a perpetual youth of character and vigour  after his death peter young described him as he appeared in his later years  he was somewhat below the just standard of height his limbs were well and elegantly shaped his shoulders broad his fingers rather long his head small his hair black his face somewhat swarthy and not unpleasant to behold  there was a certain geniality in a countenance serious and stern with a natural dignity and air of command his eyebrows when he was in anger were expressive  his forehead was rather narrow depressed above the eyebrows his cheeks were full and ruddy so that the eyes seemed to retreat into their hollows they were dark grey keen and lively  the face was long the nose also the mouth was large the upper lip being the thicker  the beard was long rather thick and black with a few grey hairs in his later years 12  the nearest approach to an authentic portrait of knox is a woodcut engraved after a sketch from memory by peter young and after another sketch of the same kind by an artist in edinburgh  compared with the peevish face of calvin also in bezas icones knox looks a broadminded and genial character  despite the uncommon length to which knox carried the contemporary approval of persecution then almost universal except among the anabaptists and any party out of power he was not personally rancorous where religion was not concerned  but concerned it usually was  he was the subject of many anonymous pasquils and libels we know but he entirely disregarded them  if he hated any mortal personally and beyond what true religion demands of a christian that mortal was the mother of mary stuart an amiable lady in an impossible position  of jealousy towards his brethren there is not a trace in knox and he told queen mary that he could ill bear to correct his own boys though the age was as cruel to schoolboys as that of st augustine  the faults of knox arose not in his heart but in his head they sprung from intellectual errors and from the belief that he was always right he applied to his fellowchristianscatholicsthe commands which early israel supposed to be divinely directed against foreign worshippers of chemosh and moloch  he endeavoured to force his own theory of what the discipline of the primitive apostolic church had been upon a modern nation following the example of the little city state of geneva under calvin  he claimed for preachers chosen by local congregations the privileges and powers of the apostolic companions of christ and in place of sweet reasonableness he applied the methods quite alien to the founder of christianity of the sons of thunder  all controversialists then relied on isolated and inappropriate scriptural texts and biblical analogies which were not analogous but knox employed these things with perhaps unusual inconsistency in varying circumstances  his history is not more scrupulous than that of other partisans in an exciting contest and examples of his taste for personal scandal are not scarce     chapter ii knox wishart and the murder of beaton 15451546   our earliest knowledge of knox apart from mention of him in notarial documents is derived from his own history of the reformation  the portion of that work in which he first mentions himself was written about 156166 some twenty years after the events recorded and in reading all this part of his memoirs and his account of the religious struggle allowance must be made for errors of memory or for erroneous information  we meet him first towards the end of the holy days of yulechristmas 1545  knox had then for some weeks been the constant companion and armed bodyguard of george wishart who was calling himself the messenger of the eternal god and preaching the new ideas in haddington to very small congregations  this wishart knoxs master in the faith was a forfarshire man he is said to have taught greek at montrose to have been driven thence in 1538 by the bishop of brechin and to have recanted certain heresies in 1539  he had denied the merits of christ as the redeemer but afterwards dropped that error when persistence meant death at the stake  it was in bristol that he burned his faggot in place of being burned himself  there was really nothing humiliating in this recantation for after his release he did not resume his heresy clearly he yielded not to fear but to conviction of theological error 15a  he next travelled in germany where a jew on a rhine boat inspired or increased his aversion to works of sacred art as being idolatrous about 154243 he was reading with pupils at cambridge and was remarked for the severity of his ascetic virtue and for his great charity  at some uncertain date he translated the helvetic confession of faith and he was more of a calvinist than a lutheran  in july 1543 he returned to scotland at least he returned with some commissioners to england who certainly came home in july 1543 as knox mentions though later he gives the date of wisharts return in 1544 probably by a slip of the pen  coming home in july 1543 wishart would expect a fair chance of preaching his novel ideas as peace between scotland and protestant england now seemed secure and arran the scottish regent the chief of the almost royal house of hamilton was for the moment himself a protestant  for five days august 28september 3 1543 the great cardinal beaton the head of the party of the church was outlawed and wisharts preaching at dundee about that date is supposed by some 15b to have stimulated an attack then made on the monasteries in the town  but arran suddenly recanted deserted the protestants and the faction attached to england and joined forces with cardinal beaton who in november 1543 visited dundee and imprisoned the ringleaders in the riots  they are called the honestest men in the town by the treble traitor and rascal crichton laird of brunston in lothian at this time a secret agent of sadleir the envoy of henry viii november 25 1543  by april 1544 henry was preparing to invade scotland and the earnest professors of protestant doctrines in scotland sent to him a scottish man called wysshert with a proposal for the kidnapping or murder of cardinal beaton  brunston and other scottish lairds of wisharts circle were agents of the plot and in 154546 our george wishart is found companioning with them  when cassilis took up the threads of the plot against beaton it was to cassiliss country in ayrshire that wishart went and there preached  thence he returned to dundee to fight the plague and comfort the citizens and towards the end of 1545 moved to lothian expecting to be joined there by his westland supporters led by cassilisbut entertaining dark forebodings of his doom  there were however other wisharts protestants in scotland  it is not possible to prove that this reformer though the associate was the agent of the murderers or was even conscious of their schemes  yet if he had been there was no matter for marvel  knox himself approved of and applauded the murders of cardinal beaton and of riccio and in that age too many men of all creeds and parties believed that to kill an opponent of their religious cause was to imitate phinehas jael jehu and other patriots of hebrew history  dr mcrie remarks that knox held the opinion that persons who according to the law of god and the just laws of society have forfeited their lives by the commission of flagrant crimes such as notorious murderers and tyrants may warrantably be put to death by private individuals provided all redress in the ordinary course of justice is rendered impossible in consequence of the offenders having usurped the executive authority or being systematically protected by oppressive rulers  the ideas of knox in fact varied in varying circumstances and moods and as we shall show at times he preached notions far more truculent than those attributed to him by his biographer at times was all for saintlike submission and mere passive resistance 17  the current ideas of both parties on killing no murder were little better than those of modern anarchists  it was a prevalent opinion that a king might have a subject assassinated if to try him publicly entailed political inconveniences  the inquisition in spain vigorously repudiated this theory but the inquisition was in advance of the age knox as to the doctrine of killing no murder was and wishart may have been a man of his time  but knox in telling the story of a murder which he approves unhappily displays a glee unbecoming a reformer of the church of him who blamed st peter for his recourse to the sword  the very essence of christianity is cast to the winds when knox utters his laughter over the murders or misfortunes of his opponents yielding as dr mcrie says to the strong propensity which he felt to indulge his vein of humour  other good men rejoiced in the murder of an enemy but knox chuckled  nothing has injured knox more in the eyes of posterity when they happen to be aware of the facts than this humour of his  knox might be pardoned had he merely excused the murder of the devils own son cardinal beaton who executed the law on his friend and master george wishart  to wishart knox bore a tender and enthusiastic affection crediting him not only with the virtues of charity and courage which he possessed but also with supernormal premonitions he was so clearly illuminated with the spirit of prophecy  these premonitions appear to have come to wishart by way of vision  knox asserted some prophetic gift for himself but never hints anything as to the method whether by dream vision or the hearing of voices  he often alludes to himself as the prophet and claims certain privileges in that capacity for example the prophet may blamelessly preach what men call treason as we shall see  as to his actual predictions of events he occasionally writes as if they were mere deductions from scripture  god will punish the idolater a or b is an idolater therefore it is safe to predict that god will punish him or her  what man then can cease to prophesy he asks and there is if we thus consider the matter no reason why anybody should ever leave off prophesying 18a  but if the art of prophecy is common to all biblereading mankind all mankind being prophets may promulgate treason which knox perhaps would not have admitted  he thought himself more specially a seer and in his prayer after the failure of his friends the murderers of riccio he congratulates himself on being favoured above the common sort of his brethren and privileged to forespeak things in an unique degree  i dare not deny    but that god hath revealed unto me secrets unknown to the world he writes 18b and these claims soar high above mere deductions from scripture  his biographer dr mcrie doubts whether we can dismiss as necessarily baseless all stories of extraordinary premonitions since the completion of the canon of inspiration 19 indeed there appears to be no reason why we should draw the line at a given date and limit the operations of divine providence  i would be the last to do so but then knoxs premonitions are sometimes or usually without documentary and contemporary corroboration once he certainly prophesied after the event as we shall see and he never troubles himself about his predictions which were unfulfilled as against queen elizabeth  he supplied the kirk with the tradition of supernormal premonitions in preacherssecondsight and clairvoyanceas in the case of mr peden and other saints of the covenant  but just as good cases of clairvoyance as any of mr pedens are attributed to catherine de medici who was not a saint by her daughter la reine margot and others  in knox at all events there is no trace of visual or auditory hallucinations so common in religious experiences whatever the creed of the percipient  he was not a visionary  more than this we cannot safely say about his prophetic vein  the enthusiasm which induced a priest notary and teacher like knox to carry a claymore in defence of a beloved teacher wishart seems more appropriate to a man of about thirty than a man of forty and so far supports the opinion that in 1545 knox was only thirty years of age  in that case his study of the debates between the church and the new opinions must have been relatively brief  yet in 1547 he already reckoned himself not incorrectly as a skilled disputant in favour of ideas with which he cannot have been very long familiar  wishart was taken was tried was condemned was strangled and his dead body was burned at st andrews on march 1 1546  it is highly improbable that knox could venture as a marked man to be present at the trial  he cites the account of it in his history from the contemporary scottish narrative used by foxe in his martyrs and laing knoxs editor thinks that foxe may possibly have been indebted for some of the scottish accounts to the scottish reformer  it seems if there be anything in evidence of tone and style that what knox quotes from foxe in 156166 is what knox himself actually wrote about 154748  mr hill burton observes in the tract the mark of knoxs vehement colouring and adds it is needless to seek in the account for precise accuracy  in precise accuracy many historians are as sadly to seek as knox himself but his peculiar colouring is all his own and is as marked in the pamphlet on wisharts trial which he cites as in the history which he acknowledged  there are said to be but few copies of the first edition of the black letter tract on wisharts trial published in london with lindsays tragedy of the cardinal by day and seres  i regard it as the earliest printed work of john knox 20  the author when he describes lauder wisharts official accuser as a fed sow    his face running down with sweat and frothing at the mouth like ane bear who spat at maister georges face     shows every mark of knoxs vehement and pictorial style  his editor laing bids us observe that all these opprobrious terms are copied from foxe or rather from the black letter tract  but the black letter tract i conceive must be knoxs own  its author like knox indulges his vein of humour by speaking of friars as fiends like knox he calls wishart maister george and that servand of god  the peculiarities of the tract good and bad the vivid familiar manner the vehemence the pictorial quality the violent invective are the notes of knoxs history  already by 1547 or not much later he was the perfect master of his style his tone no more resembles that of his contemporary and fellowhistorian lesley than the style of mr j r green resembles that of mr s r gardiner     chapter iii knox in st andrews castle the galleys 15471549   we now take up knox where we left him namely when wishart was arrested in january 1546  he was then tutor to the sons of the lairds of langniddrie and ormiston protestants and of the english party  of his adventures we know nothing till on beatons murder may 29 1546 the cardinals successor archbishop hamilton drove him from place to place and at easter 1547 he with his pupils entered the castle of st andrews then held with some english aid against the regent arran by the murderers of beaton and their adherents 22  knox was not present of course at beatons murder about which he writes so merrily in his manner of mirth nor at the events of arrans siege of the castle prior to april 1547  he probably as regards these matters writes from recollection of what kirkcaldy of grange james balfour balnaves and the other murderers or associates of the murderers of the cardinal told him in 1547 or later communicated to him as he wrote about 156566  with his unfortunate love of imputing personal motives he attributes the attacks by the rulers on the murderers mainly to the revengeful nature of mary of guise the cardinal having been the comfort to all gentlewomen and especially to wanton widows  his death must be revenged 23a  knox avers that the besiegers of st andrews castle despairing of their task near the end of january 1547 made a fraudulent truce with the assassins hoping for the betrayal of the castle or of some of the leaders 23b  in his narrative we find partisanship or very erroneous information  the conditions were he says that 1 the murderers should hold the castle till arran could obtain for them from the pope a sufficient absolution 2 that they should give hostages as soon as the absolution was delivered to them 3 that they and their friends should not be prosecuted nor undergo any legal penalties for the murder of the cardinal 4 that they should meanwhile keep the eldest son of arran as hostage so long as their own hostages were kept  the government however says knox never minded to keep word of them of these conditions as the issue did declare  there is no proof of this accusation of treachery on the part of arran or none known to me  the constant aim of knox his fixed idea as an historian is to accuse his adversaries of the treachery which often marked the negotiations of his friends  from this point the truce dated by knox late in january 1547 he devotes eighteen pages to his own call to the ministry by the castle people and to his controversies and sermons in st andrews  he then returns to history and avers that about june 21 1547 the papal absolution was presented to the garrison merely as a veil for a treasonable attack but was rejected as it included the dubious phrase remittimus irremissibilewe remit the crime that cannot be remitted nine days later june 29 he says by the treasonable mean of arran archbishop hamilton and mary of guise twentyone french galleys and such an army as the firth had never seen hove into view and on june 30 summoned the castle to surrender  the siege of st andrews castle from the sea by the french then began but the garrison and castle were unharmed and many of the galley slaves and some french soldiers were slain and a ship was driven out of action  the french shot two days only  on july 19 the siege was renewed by land guns were mounted on the spires of st salvators college chapel and on the cathedral and did much scathe though during the first three weeks of the siege the garrison had many prosperous chances  meanwhile knox prophesied the defeat of his associates because of their corrupt life  they had robbed and ravished and were probably demoralised by knoxs prophecies on the last day of july the castle surrendered 24  knox adds that his friends would deal with france alone as scottish men had all traitorously betrayed them  now much of this narrative is wrong wrong in detail in suggestion in omission  that a man of fifty or sixty could attribute the attacks on beatons murderers to mere revenge specially to that of a wanton widow mary of guise who had we are to believe so much of the cardinals attentions as his mistress mariotte ogilvy could spare is significant of the spirit in which knox wrote history  he had a strong taste for such scandals as this about the wanton widow  wherever he touches on mary of guise who once treated him in a spirit of banter he deals a stab at her name and fame  on all that concerns her personal character and political conduct he is unworthy of credit when uncorroborated by better authority  indeed knoxs spirit is so unworthy that for this among other reasons archbishop spottiswoode declined to believe in his authorship of the history  the actual facts were not those recorded by knox  as regards the appointment or arrangement of the scottish government with the castilians it was not made late in january 1547 but was at least begun by december 1719 1546 25a  on january 11 1547 a spy of england stewart of cardonald reports that the garrison have given pledges and await their absolution from rome 25b  with regard to knoxs other statements in this place it was not after this truce first but before it on november 26 that arran invited french assistance if england would not include scotland in a treaty of peace with france  an english invasion was expected in february 1547 and arrans object in the appointment with the garrison was to prevent the english from becoming possessed of the castle of st andrews  far from desiring a papal pardona mere pretext to gain time for english reliefthe garrison actually asked henry viii to request the emperor to implore the pope to stop and hinder their absolution 25c  knox very probably knew nothing of all this but his efforts to throw the blame of treachery on his opponents are obviously futile  as to the honesty of his associatesbefore the death of henry viii january 28 1547 the castilians had promised him not to surrender the place without his consent and to put arrans son in his hands promises which they also made on henrys death to the english government in february they repeated these promises quite incompatible with their vow to surrender if absolved  knox represents them as merely promising to henry that they would return arrans son and support the plan of marrying mary stuart to prince edward of wales 26a  in march 1547 english ships gathered at holy island to relieve the castle  not on june 21 1547 as knox alleges but before april 2 the papal absolution for the murderers arrived  they mocked at it and the spy who reports the facts is told that they would rather have a boll of wheat than all the popes remissions 26b  whatever the terms of the papal remission they had already before it arrived bound themselves to england not to accept it save with english concurrence and england then preparing to invade scotland could not possibly concur  such was the honesty of knoxs party and we already see how far his history deserves to be accepted as historical  next what is most surprising knoxs account of the month of ineffectual siege by the french while he was actually in the castle rests on a strange error of his memory  the contemporary diary diurnal of occurrences dates the sending the arrival must be meant of the french galleys not on june 29 as knox dates their arrival but on july 24 professor hume brown says that the diurnal gives the date as june 24 a slip of the pen but knox had surely the best opportunity of knowing both facts 27athat is the number of the galleys and the date of their coming  despite his unrivalled opportunities of knowledge knox did not know  it is not quite correct to say that knox in his history shows throughout a conscientious regard to accuracy of statement whatever the number of the galleys knox says twentyone the diurnal says sixteen on july 1314 they are reported by lord eure at berwick as passing or having just passed eyemouth 27b  they did not therefore suffer for three weeks at the garrisons hands or for three weeks desert the siege but probably reached the scene of action before the date in the diurnal july 24 as on july 23 the french ambassador in england heard that they were investing the castle 27c  allowing five or six days for transmission of news they probably began the attack from the sea about july 16 or 17 not as knox says on june 30  perhaps he is right in saying that the french galleys only fired for two days and retreated rather battered to dundee  land forces next attacked the hold which surrendered on july 29 as was known in london on august 5 that is on the first day that the land battery was erected  knox gives a much more full account of his own controversies in april june 1547 than of political events  he first on arrival at the castle drew up a catechism for his pupils and publicly catechised them on its tenets in the parish kirk in south street  it is unfortunate that we do not possess this catechism  at the time when he wrote knox was possibly more of martins mind as he familiarly terms luther both as to the sacrament and as to the order of bishops than he was after his residence in geneva  wishart however was well acquainted with helvetic doctrine he had as we saw translated a helvetic confession of faith perhaps with the view of introducing it into scotland and knox may already have imbibed calvinism from him  he was not yethe never wasa fullblown presbyterian and while thinking nothing of orders would not have rejected a bishop if the bishop preached and was of godly and frugal life  already sermons were the most important part of public worship in the mind of knox  in addition to public catechising he publicly expounded and lectured on the fourth gospel in the chapel of the castle  he doubted if he had a lawful vocation to preach  the castle pulpit was then occupied by an exfriar named rough  this divine later burned in england preached a sermon declaring a doctrine accepted by knox namely that any congregation could call on any man in whom they espied the gifts of god to be their preacher he offered knox the post and all present agreed knox wept and for days his gloom declared his sense of his responsibility such was his holy vocation  the garrison was confessedly brutal licentious and rapacious but they all partook of the holy communion 28  in controversy knox declared the church to be the synagogue of satan and in the pope he detected and denounced the man of sin  on the following sunday he proved from daniel that the roman church is that last beast  the church is also antichrist and the hoore of babylon and knox dilated on the personal misconduct of popes and all shavelings for the most part  he contrasted justification by faith with the customs of pardons and pilgrimages  after these remarks a controversy was held between knox and the subprior wynram the scottish vicar of bray knox being understood to maintain that no bishop who did not preach was really a bishop that the mass is abominable idolatry that purgatory does not exist and that the tithes are not necessarily the property of churchmena doctrine very welcome to the hungry nobles of scotland  knox of course easily overcame an ignorant opponent a friar who joined in the fray  his own arguments he later found time to write out fully in the french galleys in which he was a prisoner after the fall of the castle  if he wrate in the galleys as he says they cannot have been always such floating hells as they are usually reckoned  that knox and other captives from the castle were placed in the galleys after their surrender was an abominable stretch of french power  they were not subjects of france  the terms on which they surrendered are not exactly known  knox avers that they were to be free to live in france and that if they wished to leave they were to be conveyed at french expense to any country except scotland  buchanan declares that only the lives of the garrison and their friends were secured by the terms of surrender  lesley supports knox 30a who is probably accurate  to account for the french severity knox tells us that the pope insisted on it appealing to both the scottish and french governments and scotland sent an envoy to france to beg that those of the castle should be sharply handled  men of birth were imprisoned the rest went to the galleys  knoxs life cannot have been so bad as that of the huguenot galley slaves under louis xiv  he was allowed to receive letters he read and commented on a treatise written in prison by balnaves and he even wrote a theological work unless this work was his commentary on balnaves  these things can only have been possible when the galleys were not on active service  in a very manly spirit he never dilated on his sufferings and merely alludes to the torment i sustained in the galleys  he kept up his heart always prophesying deliverance and once june 1548 when in view of st andrews declared that he should preach again in the kirk where his career began  unluckily the person to whom he spoke at a moment when he himself was dangerously ill denied that he had ever been in the galleys at all 30b  he was sir james balfour a notorious scoundrel quite untrustworthy according to knox he had spoken of the prophecy in scotland long before its fulfilment  knoxs health was more or less undermined while his spiritual temper was not mollified by nineteen months of the galleys mitigated as they obviously were  it is doubtless to his torment in the galleys that knox refers when he writes i know how hard the battle is between the spirit and the flesh under the heavy cross of affliction where no worldly defence but present death does appear     rests only faith provoking us to call earnestly and pray for assistance of gods spirit wherein if we continue our most desperate calamities shall turn to gladness and to a prosperous end     with experience i write this  in february or march 1549 knox was released by april he was in england and while edward vi lived was in comparative safety     chapter iv knox in england the black rubric exile 15491554   knox at once appeared in england in a character revolting to the later presbyterian conscience which he helped to educate  the state permitted no cleric to preach without a royal license and knox was now a state licensed preacher at berwick one of many state officials with a specified mission  he was an agent of the english administration then engaged in forcing a detested religion on the majority of the english people  but he candidly took his own line indifferent to the compromises of the rulers in that chaos of shifting opinions  for example the prayer book of edward vi at that time took for granted kneeling as the appropriate attitude for communicants  knox at berwick on the other hand bade his congregation sit as he conceived that to have been the usage at the first institution of the rite  possibly the apostles in fact supped in a recumbent attitude as cranmer justly remarked later john xiii 25 but knox supposed them to have sat  in a letter to his berwick flock he reminds them of his practice on this point but he would not dissent from kneeling if magistrates make known as that they would have done if ministers were willing to do their duties that kneeling is not retained in the lords supper for maintenance of any superstition much less as adoration of the lords supper  this for a time would content him and this he obtained 33a  here knox appears to make the civil authoritythe magistratesgovernors of the church while at the same time he does not in practice obey them unless they accept his conditions  this letter to the berwick flock must be prior to the autumn of 1552 in which as we shall see knox obtained his terms as to kneeling  he went on in his epistle to the berwickians to speak in a tone of moderation and modesty for which says dr lorimer not many readers will be prepared 33b  in this modest passage knox says that as to the chief points of religion he with gods help will give place to neither man nor angel teaching the contrary of his preaching  yet an angel might be supposed to be well informed on points of doctrine  but as to ceremonies or rites things of smaller weight i was not minded to move contention     the one point whichbecause i am but one having in my contrary magistrates common order and judgments and many learnedhe is prepared to yield and that for a time is the practice of kneeling but only on three conditions  these being granted with patience will i bear that one thing daily thirsting and calling unto god for reformation of that and others 33c  but he did not bear that one thing he would not kneel even after his terms were granted  this is the sum of knoxs moderation and modesty  though he is not averse from talking about himself knox in his history spares but three lines to his five years residence in england 154954  his first charge was berwick 154951 where we have seen he celebrated holy communion by the swiss rite all meekly sitting  the second prayer book of 1552 when knox ministered in newcastle bears marks of his hand  he opposed as has been said the rubric bidding the communicants kneel the attitude savoured of idolatry  the circumstances in which knox carried his point on this question are most curious  just before october 12 1552 a foreign protestant johannes utenhovius wrote to the zurich protestant bullinger to the effect that a certain vir bonus scotus natione a good man and a scot a preacher concionator of the duke of northumberland had delivered a sermon before the king and council in which he freely inveighed against the anglican custom of kneeling at the lords supper  many listeners were greatly moved and utenhovius prayed that the sermon might be of blessed effect  knox was certainly in london at this date and was almost certainly the excellent scot referred to by utenhovius  the second prayer book of edward vi was then in such forwardness that parliament had appointed it to be used in churches beginning on november 1  the book included the command to kneel at the lords supper and any agitation against the practice might seem to be too late  cranmer the primate was in favour of the rubric as it stood and on october 7 1552 addressed the privy council in a letter which without naming knox clearly shows his opinion of our reformer  the book as it stood said cranmer had the assent of king and parliamentnow it was to be altered apparently without parliament  the council ought not to be thus influenced by glorious and unquiet spirits  cranmer calls knox as throckmorton later called queen marys bothwell glorious in the sense of the latin gloriosus swaggering or arrogant  cranmer goes on to denounce the glorious and unquiet spirits which can like nothing but that is after their own fancy and cease not to make trouble and disquietude when things be most quiet and in good order 35  their argument knoxs favourite that whatever is not commanded in scripture is unlawful and ungodly is a subversion of all order as well in religion as in common policy  cranmer ends with the amazing challenge i will set my foot by his to be tried in the fire that his doctrine is untrue and not only untrue but seditious and perilous to be heard of any subjects as a thing breaking the bridle of obedience and loosing them from the bond of all princes laws  cranmer had a premonition of the troubled years of james vi and of the covenant when this question of kneeling was the first cause of the bishops wars  but knox did not accept as far as we know the mediaeval ordeal by fire  other questions about practices enjoined in the articles arose  a confession in which knoxs style may be traced was drawn up and consequently that declaration on kneeling was intercalated into the prayer book wherein it is asserted that the attitude does not imply adoration of the elements or belief in the real presence for that were idolatry  elizabeth dropped and charles ii restored this black rubric which anglicanism owes to the scottish reformer 36a  he once had a good opinion he says of the liturgy as it now stood but he soon found that it was full of idolatries  the most important event in the private life of knox during his stay at berwick was his acquaintance with a devout lady of tormented conscience mrs bowes wife of the governor of norham castle on tweed  mrs bowess tendency to the new ideas in religion was not shared by her husband and his family the results will presently be conspicuous  in april 1550 knox preached at newcastle a sermon on his favourite doctrine that the mass is idolatry because it is of mans invention an opinion not shared by tunstall then bishop of durham  knox used idolatry in a constructive sense as when we talk of constructive treason  but in practice he regarded catholics as idolaters in the same sense as elijah regarded hebrew worshippers of alien deities chemosh or moloch and he later drew the inference that idolaters as in the old testament must be put to death  thus his was logically a persecuting religion  knox was made a kings chaplain and transferred to newcastle  he saw that the country was by preference catholic that the life of edward vi hung on a thread and that with the accession of his sister mary tudor protestant principles would be as unsafe as under umquhile the cardinal  knox therefore from the foresight of troubles to come so he writes to mrs bowes february 28 1554 36b declined any post a bishopric or a living which would in honour oblige him to face the fire of persecution  at the same time he was even then far at odds with the church of england that he had sound reasons for refusing benefices  on christmas day 1552 37a he preached at newcastle against papists as thirsting nothing more than the kings death which their iniquity would procure  in two brief years knox was himself publicly expressing his own thirst for the queens death and praying for a jehu or a phinehas slayers of idolaters such as mary tudor  if any fanatic had taken this hint and the life of mary tudor catholics would have said that knoxs iniquity procured the murder and they would have had fair excuse for the assertion  meanwhile charges were brought against the reformer on the ground of his christmas sermon of peace and goodwill  northumberland january 9 1552 53 sends to cecil a letter of poor knox by the which you may perceive what perplexity the poor soul remaineth in at this present  we have not knoxs interesting letter but northumberland pled his cause against a charge of treason  in fact however the court highly approved of his sermon  he was presently again in what he believed to be imminent danger of life i fear that i be not yet ripe nor able to glorify christ by my faith he wrote to mrs bowes but what lacketh now god shall perform in his own time 37b  we do not know what peril threatened the reformer now probably in march 1553 but he frequently later seems to have doubted his own ripeness for martyrdom  his reluctance to suffer did not prevent him from constant attendance to the tedious selftormentings of mrs bowes and of three honest poor women in london  knox at all events was not so perplexed that he feared to speak his mind in the pulpit  in lent 1553 preaching before the boy king he denounced his ministers in trenchant historical parallels between them and achitophel shebna and judas  later young mr mackail applying the same method to the ministers of charles ii was hanged  what wonder is it then said knox that a young and innocent king be deceived by crafty covetous wicked and ungodly councillors  i am greatly afraid that achitophel be councillor that judas bear the purse and that shebna be scribe comptroller and treasurer 38a  this appears the extreme of audacity  yet nothing worse came to knox than questions by the council as to his refusal of a benefice and his declining as he still did to kneel at the communion april 14 1553 his answers prove that he was out of harmony with the fluctuating anglicanism of the hour  northumberland could not then resent the audacities of pulpiteers because the protestants were the only party who might stand by him in his approaching effort to crown lady jane grey  now all the kings preachers obviously by concerted action thundered against edwards council in the lent or easter of 1553  manifestly in the old scots phrase the kirk had a back had some secular support namely that of their party which northumberland could not slight meanwhile knox was sent on a preaching tour in buckinghamshire and there he was when edward vi died in the first week of july 1553 38b  knoxs official attachment to england expired with his preaching license on the death of edward vi and the accession of mary tudor  he did not at once leave the country but preached both in london and on the english border while the new queen was settling herself on the throne  while within marys reach knox did not encourage resistance against that idolatress he did not do so till he was safe in france  indeed in his prayer used after the death of edward vi before the fires of oxford and smithfield were lit knox wrote illuminate the heart of our sovereign lady queen mary with pregnant gifts of the holy ghost     repress thou the pride of those that would rebel     mitigate the hearts of those that persecute us  in the autumn of 1553 knoxs health was very bad he had gravel and felt his bodily strength broken  moreover he was in the disagreeable position of being betrothed to a very young lady marjorie bowes with the approval of her devout mother the wife of richard bowes commander of norham castle near berwick but to the anger and disgust of the bowes family in general  they by no means shared knoxs ideas of religion rather regarding him as a penniless unfrocked scot runagate whose alliance was discreditable and distasteful and might be dangerous maist unpleasing words passed and it is no marvel that knox being persecuted in one city fled to another leaving england for dieppe early in march 1554 39  his conscience was not entirely at ease as to his flight  why did i flee  assuredly i cannot tell but of one thing i am sure the fear of death was not the chief cause of my fleeing he wrote to mrs bowes from dieppe  albeit that i have in the beginning of this battle appeared to play the fainthearted and feeble soldier the cause i remit to god yet my prayer is that i may be restored to the battle again 40a  knox was in fact most valiant when he had armed men at his back he had no enthusiasm for taking part in the battle when unaided by the arm of flesh  on later occasions this was very apparent and he has confessed as we saw that he did not choose to face the trouble to come without means of retreat  his valour was rather that of the general than of the lonely martyr  the popular idea of knoxs personal courage said to have been expressed by the regent morton in the words spoken at his funeral here lieth a man who in his life never feared the face of man is entirely erroneous  his learned and sympathetic editor david laing truly writes knox cannot be said to have possessed the impetuous and heroic boldness of a luther when surrounded with danger     on more than one occasion knox displayed a timidity or shrinking from danger scarcely to have been expected from one who boasted of his willingness to endure the utmost torture or suffer death in his masters cause  happily he was not put to the test    40b  dr laing puts the case more strongly than i feel justified in doing for knox far from boasting of his willingness to face the utmost torture more than once doubts his own readiness for martyrdom  we must remember that even blessed edmund campion who went gaily to torture and death had doubts as to the necessity of that journey 40c  nor was there any reason why knox should stay in england to be burned if he could escapewith less than ten groats in his pocketas he did  it is not for us moderns to throw the first stone at a reluctant martyr still less to applaud useless selfsacrifice but we do take leave to think that having fled early himself from the martyrs crown knox showed bad taste in his harsh invectives against protestants who staying in england conformed to the state religion under mary tudor  it is not impossible that his very difficult position as the lover of marjorie bowesa position of which while he remained in england the burden fell on the poor girlmay have been one reason for knoxs flight while the entreaties of his friends that he would seek safety must have had their influence  on the whole it seems more probable that when he committed himself to matrimony with a young girl the fifth daughter of mrs bowes he was approaching his fortieth rather than his fiftieth year  older than he are happy husbands made sometimes though marjorie bowess choice may have been directed by her pious mother whose soul could find no rest in the old faith and not much in the new  at thirtyeight the reformer we must remember must have been no uncomely wooer  his conversation must have been remarkably vivid he had adventures enough to tell by land and sea while such a voice as he raised withal in the pulpit like edward irving has always been potent with women as sir walter scott remarks in irvings own case  his expression says young had a certain geniality on the whole we need not doubt that knox could please when he chose especially when he was looked up to as a supreme authority  he despised women in politics but had many friends of the sex and his letters to them display a manly tenderness of affection without sentimentality  writing to mrs bowes from london in 1553 knox mentions as one of the sorrows of life that such as would most gladly remain together for mutual comfort cannot be suffered so to do  since the first day that it pleased the providence of god to bring you and me in familiarity i have always delighted in your company  he then wanders into religious reflections but we see that he liked mrs bowes and marjorie bowes too no doubt he is careful to style the elderly lady mother  knoxs letters to mrs bowes show the patience and courtesy with which the reformer could comfort and counsel a middleaged lady in trouble about her innocent soul  as she recited her infirmities he reminds her he started back and that is my common consuetude when anything pierces or touches my heart  call to your mind what i did standing at the cupboard at alnwick in very deed i thought that no creature had been tempted as i wasnot by the charms of mrs bowes of course he found that satan troubled the lady with the very same words that he troubles me with mrs bowes in truth with premature scepticism was tempted to think that the scriptures of god are but a tale and no credit to be given to them  the devil she is reminded by knox has induced some philosophers to affirm that the world never had a beginning which he refutes by showing that god predicted the pains of childbearing and mrs bowes as the mother of twelve knows how true this is  the circular argument may or may not have satisfied mrs bowes 43  the young object of knoxs passion marjorie bowes is only alluded to as she whom god hath offered unto me and commanded me to love as my own fleshafter her mrs bowes is the dearest of mankind to knox  no mortal was ever more longsuffering with a spiritual hypochondriac who avers that the sins that reigned in sodom and gomore reign in me and i have small power or none to resist  knox replies with common sense that mrs bowes is obviously ignorant of the nature of these offences  writing to his betrothed he says nothing personal merely reiterates his lessons of comfort to her mother  meanwhile the lovers were parted knox going abroad and it is to be confessed that he was not eager to come back     chapter v exile appeals for a phinehas and a jehu 1554   no change of circumstances could be much more bitter than that which exile brought to knox  he had been a decently endowed official of state engaged in bringing a reluctant country into the ecclesiastical fold which the state for the hour happened to prefer  his task had been grateful and his congregations at least at berwick and newcastle had as a rule been heartily with him  wherever he preached affectionate women had welcomed him and hung upon his words  the king and his ministers had hearkened unto himyoung edward with approval northumberland with such emotions as we may imaginewhile the primate of england had challenged him to a competitive ordeal by fire and had been defeated apparently without recourse to the firetest  but now all was changed knox was a lonely rover in a strange land supported probably by collections made among his english friends and by the hospitality of the learned  in his wanderings his heart burned within him many a time and he abruptly departed from his theory of passive resistance  now he eagerly desired to obtain from protestant doctors and pontiffs support for the utterly opposite doctrine of armed resistance  such support he did not get or not in a satisfactory measure so he commenced prophet on his own lines and on his own responsibility  when knoxs heart burned within him he sometimes seized the pen and dashed off fiery tracts which occasionally caused inconvenience to the brethren and trouble to himself in later years  in cooler moments and when dubious or prosperous he now and again displayed a calm opportunism much at odds with the inspirations of his grief and anger  after his flight to dieppe in march 1554 knox was engaged then with a problem of difficulty one of the central problems of his career and of the distracted age  in modern phrase he wished to know how far and in what fashion persons of one religion might resist another religion imposed upon them by the state of which they were subjects  on this point we have now no doubt but in the sixteenth century authority was held sacred and martyrdom according to calvin was to be preferred to civil war  if men were catholics and if the state was protestant they were liable later under knox to fines exile and death but power was not yet given to him  if they were protestants under a catholic ruler or puritans under anglican authority knox himself had laid down the rule of their conduct in his letter to his berwick congregation 45 remembering always beloved brethren that due obedience be given to magistrates rulers and princes without tumult grudge or sedition for howsoever wicked themselves be in life or howsoever ungodly their precepts or commandments be ye must obey them for conscience sake except in chief points of religion and then ye ought rather to obey god than man not to pretend to defend gods truth or religion ye being subjects by violence or sword but patiently suffering what god shall please be laid upon you for constant confession of your faith and belief  man or angel who teaches contrary doctrine is corrupt of judgment sent by god to blind the unworthy  and knox proceeded to teach contrary doctrine  his truly christian ideas are of date 1552 with occasional revivals as opportunity suggested  in exile he was now asking 1554 how was a protestant minority or majority to oppose the old faith backed by kings and princes fire and sword  he answered the question in direct contradiction of his berwick programme he was now all for active resistance  later in addressing mary of guise and on another occasion he recurred to his berwick theory and he always found biblical texts to support his contradictory messages  at this moment resistance seemed hopeless enough  in england the protestants of all shades were decidedly in a minority  they had no chance if they openly rose in arms their only hope was in the death of mary tudor and the succession of elizabethitself a poor hope in the eyes of knox who detested the idea of a female monarch  might they bow down in the house of rimmon by a feigned conformity  knox in a letter to the faithful printed in 1554 entirely rejected this compromise to which cecil stooped thereby deserving hell as the relentless knox who had fled later assured him  in the end of march 1554 probably knox left dieppe for geneva where he could consult calvin not yet secure in his despotism though he had recently burned servetus  next he went to zurich and laid certain questions before bullinger who gave answers in writing as to knoxs problems  could a woman rule a kingdom by divine right and transfer the same to her husbandmary tudor to philip of spain is of course to be understood  bullinger replied that it was a hazardous thing for the godly to resist the laws of a country  philip the eunuch though converted did not drive queen candace out of ethiopia  if a tyrannous and ungodly queen reign godly persons have example and consolation in the case of athaliah  the transfer of power to a husband is an affair of the laws of the country  again must a ruler who enforces idolatry be obeyed  may true believers in command of garrisons repel this ungodly violence bullinger answered in effect that it is very difficult to pronounce upon every particular case  he had not the details before him  in short nothing definite was to be drawn out of bullinger 47a  dr mcrie observes indeed that knox submitted to the learned of switzerland certain difficult questions which were suggested by the present condition of affairs in england and about which his mind had been greatly occupied  their views with respect to these coinciding with his own he was confirmed in the judgment which he had already formed for himself 47b  in fact knox himself merely says that he had reasoned with pastors and the learned he does not say that they agreed with him and they certainly did not  despite the reserve of bullinger and of calvin knox was of his new opinions still  these divines never backed his views  by may knox had returned to dieppe and published an epistle to the faithful  the rebellion of sir thomas wyatt had been put down a blow to true religion  we have no evidence that knox stimulated the rising but he alludes once to his exertions in favour of the princess elizabeth  the details are unknown  in july apparently knox printed his faithful admonition to the professors of gods truth in england and two editions of the tract were published in that country  the pamphlet is full of violent language about the bloody butcherly brood of persecutors and knox spoke of what might have occurred had the queen been sent to hell before these days  the piece presents nothing perhaps so plain spoken about the prophets right to preach treason as a passage in the manuscript of an earlier knoxian epistle of may 1554 to the faithful  the prophets of god sometimes may teach treason against kings and yet neither he nor such as obey the word spoken in the lords name by him offends god 48  that sentence contains doctrine not submitted to bullinger by knox he could not very well announce himself to bullinger as a prophet of god  but the sentence which occurs in manuscript copies of the letter of may 1554 does not appear in the black letter printed edition  either knox or the publisher thought it too risky  in the published admonition however of july 1554 we find knox exclaiming god for his great mercys sake stir up some phineas helias or jehu that the blood of abominable idolaters may pacify gods wrath that it consume not the whole multitude  amen 49a  this is a direct appeal to the assassin  if anybody will play the part of phinehas against idolatersthat is the queen of england and philip of spaingods anger will be pacified  delay not thy vengeance o lord but let death devour them in haste     for there is no hope of their amendment    he shall send jehu to execute his just judgments against idolaters  jezebel herself shall not escape the vengeance and plagues that are prepared for her portion 49b  these passages are essential professor hume brown expresses our own sentiments when he remarks in casting such a pamphlet into england at the time he did knox indulged his indignation in itself so natural under the circumstances at no personal risk while he seriously compromised those who had the strongest claims on his most generous consideration  this is plain truth and when some of knoxs english brethren later behaved to him in a manner which we must wholly condemn their conduct they said had for a motive the mischief done to protestants in england by his fiery admonition and their desire to separate themselves from the author of such a pamphlet  knox did not it will be observed here call all or any of the faithful to a general massacre of their catholic fellowsubjects  he went to that length later as we shall show  in an epistle of 1554 he only writes some shall demand what then shall we go and slay all idolaters that were the office dear brethren of every civil magistrate within his realm     the slaying of idolaters appertains not to every particular man 49c  this means that every protestant king should massacre all his inconvertible catholic subjects  this was indeed a counsel of perfection but it could never be executed owing to the carnal policy of worldly men  in writing about the office of the civil magistrate knox a border scot of the age of the blood feud seems to have forgotten first that the old testament prophets of the period were not unanimous in their applause of jehus massacre of the royal family next that between the sixteenth century ad and jehu had intervened the christian revelation our lord had given no word of warrant to murder or massacre  no persecuted apostle had dealt in appeals to the dagger  as for jehu a prophet had condemned his conduct  hosea writes that the lord said unto him yet a little while and i will avenge the blood of jezreel upon the house of jehu but doubtless knox would have argued that hosea was temporarily uninspired as he argued about st paul and st james later  however this delicate point may be settled the appeal for a phinehas is certainly unchristian  the idolaters the unreformed might rejoice with the nuncio of 1583 that the duc de guise had a plan for murdering elizabeth though it was not to be communicated to the vicar of god who should have no such dealings against that wicked woman  to some catholics elizabeth to knox mary was as jezebel and might laudably be assassinated  in idolaters nothing can surprise us when persecuted they in their unchristian fashion may retort with the dagger or the bowl  but that knox should have frequently maintained the doctrine of death to religious opponents is a strange and deplorable circumstance  in reforming the church of christ he omitted some elements of christianity  suppose for a moment that in deference to the teaching of the gospel knox had never called for a jehu but had ever denounced by voice and pen those murderous deeds of his own party which he celebrates as godly facts he would have raised protestantism to a moral preeminence  dark pages of scottish history might never have been written the consciences of men might have been touched and the cruelties of the religious conflict might have been abated  many of them sprang from the fear of assassination  but knox in some of his writings identified his cause with the palace revolutions of an ancient oriental people  not that he was a man of blood when in france he dissuaded kirkcaldy of grange and others from stabbing the gaolers in making their escape from prison  where idolaters in official position were concerned and with a pen in his hand he had no such scruples  he was a child of the old prechristian scriptures of the earlier not of the later prophets     chapter vi knox in the english puritan troubles at frankfort 15541555   the consequences of the admonition came home to knox when english refugees in frankfort impeded by him and others in the use of their liturgy accused him of high treason against philip and mary and the emperor whom he had compared to nero as an enemy of christ  the affair of the troubles at frankfort brought into view the great gulf for ever fixed between puritanism and the church of england  it was made plain that knox and the anglican community were of incompatible temperaments ideas and we may almost say instincts  to anglicans like cranmer knox from the first was as antipathetic as they were to him  we can assure you wrote some english exiles for religions sake to calvin that that outrageous pamphlet of knoxs his admonition added much oil to the flame of persecution in england  for before the publication of that book not one of our brethren had suffered death but as soon as it came forth we doubt not but you are well aware of the number of excellent men who have perished in the flames to say nothing of how many other godly men have been exposed to the risk of all their property and even life itself on the sole ground of either having had this book in their possession or having read it  such were the charges brought against knox by these english protestant exiles fleeing from the persecution that followed the admonition and they say took fresh ferocity from that tract  the quarrel between knox and them definitely marks the beginning of the rupture between the fathers of the church of england and the fathers of puritanism scottish presbyterianism and dissent  the representatives of puritans and of anglicans were now alike exiled poor homeless without any abiding city  that they should instantly quarrel with each other over their prayer book that which knox had helped to correct was as calvin told them extremely absurd  each faction probably foresawcertainly knoxs party foresawthat in the english congregation at frankfort a little flock barely tolerated was to be settled the character of protestantism in england if ever england returned to protestantism  this evil the acceptance of the english second book of prayer of edward vi shall in time be established    and never be redressed neither shall there for ever be an end of this controversy in england wrote knoxs party to the senate of frankfort the religious disruption in england was in fact incurable but so it would have been had the knoxians prevailed in frankfort  the difference between the churchman and the dissenter goes to the root of the english character no temporary triumph of either side could have brought peace and union  while the world stands they will not be peaceful and united  the trouble arose thus  at the end of june 1554 some english exiles of the puritan sort men who objected to surplices responses kneeling at the communion and other matters of equal moment came to frankfort  they obtained leave to use the french protestant chapel provided that they should not dissent from the frenchmen in doctrine or ceremonies lest they should thereby minister occasions of offence  they had then to settle what order of services they should use anything they pleased said the magistrates of frankfort as long as they and the french kept the peace  they decided to adopt the english order barring responses the litany the surplice and many other things 54  the litany was regarded by knox as rather of the nature of magic than of prayer the surplice was a romish rag and there was some other objection to the congregations taking part in the prayers by responses though they were not forbidden to mingle their voices in psalmody  dissidium valde absurduma very absurd quarrel among exiled fellowcountrymen said calvin was the dispute which arose on these points  the puritans however decided to alter the service to their taste and enjoyed the use of the chapel  they had obtained a service which they were not likely to have been allowed to enforce in england had edward vi lived but on this point they were of another opinion  this success was providential  they next invited english exiles abroad to join them at frankfort saying nothing about their mutilations of the service book  if these brethren came in when they were all restored to england if ever they were restored their example that of sufferers would carry the day and their service would for ever be that of the anglican church  the other exiled brethren on receiving this invitation had enough of the wisdom of the serpent to ask are we to be allowed to use our own prayer book  the answer of the godly of frankfort evaded the question  at last the frankfort puritans showed their hand they disapproved of various things in the prayer book  knox summoned from geneva a reluctant visitor was already one of their preachers  in november 1554 came grindal later archbishop of canterbury from zurich ready to omit some ceremonies so that he and his faction might have the substance of the prayer book  negotiations went on and it was proposed by the puritans to use the geneva service but knox declined to do that without the knowledge of the nonpuritan exiles at zurich and elsewhere or to use the english book and offered his resignation  nothing could be more fair and aboveboard  there was an inchoate plan for a new order  that failed and knox with others consulted calvin giving him a sketch of the nature of the english service  they drew his attention to the surplice the litany devised by pope gregory whereby we use a certain conjuring of god the kneeling at the communion the use of the cross in baptism and of the ring in marriage clearly a thing of human if not of diabolical invention and the imposition of hands in confirmation  the churching of women they said is both pagan and jewish  other things not so much shame itself as a certain kind of pity compelleth us to keep close  the tone of the letter throughout was expressly calculated to prejudice calvin on the point submitted to him says professor hume brown 56 calvin replied that the quarrel might be all very well if the exiles were happy and at ease in their circumstances though in the liturgy as described there were tolerable endurable follies  on the whole he sided with the knoxian party  the english liturgy is not pure enough and the english exiles not at frankfort merely like it because they are accustomed to it  some are partial to popish dregs  to the extreme reformers no break with the past could be too abrupt and precipitous the framers of the english liturgy had rather adopted the principle of evolution than of development by catastrophe and had wedded what was noblest in old latin forms and prayers to music of the choicest english speech  to this service for which their fellowreligionists in england were dying at the stake the nonfrankfortian exiles were attached  they were englishmen their service they said should bear an english face so knox avers who could as yet have no patriotic love of any religious form as exclusively and essentially scottish  a kind of truce was now proclaimed to last till may 1 1555 knox aiding in the confection of a service without responses some part taken out of the english book and other things put to while calvin bullinger and three others were appointed as referees  the frankfort congregation had now a brief interval of provisional peace till on march 13 1555 richard cox with a band of english refugees arrived  he had been tutor to edward vi the young marcellus of protestantism but for frankfort he was not puritanic enough  his company would give a large majority to the antiknoxian congregation  he and his at once uttered the responses and on sunday one of them read the litany  this was an unruly infraction of the provisional agreement  cox and his party april 5 represented to calvin that they had given up surplices crosses and other things not as impure and papistical but as indifferent and for the sake of peace this was after they had driven knox from the place as they presently did in the beginning it was distinctly their duty to give up the litany and responses while the truce lasted that is till the end of april  in the afternoon of the sunday knox preached denouncing the mornings proceedings the impurity of the prayer book of which i once had a good opinion and the absence in england of discipline that is interference by preachers with private life  pluralities also he denounced and some of the exiles had been pluralists  for all this knox was very sharply reproved as soon as he left the pulpit  two days later at a meeting he insisted that coxs people should have a vote in the congregation thus making the antipuritans a majority knoxs conduct was here certainly chivalrous i fear not your judgment he said  he had never wished to go to frankfort in going he merely obeyed calvin and probably he had no great desire to stay  he was forbidden to preach by cox and his majority and a later conference with cox led to no compromise  it seems probable that cox and the anti puritans already cherished a grudge against knox for his tract the admonition  he had a warning that they would use the pamphlet against him and he avers that some devised how to have me cast into prison the antipuritans admitting in a letter to calvin that they brought the admonition before the magistrates of frankfort as a book which would supply their enemies with just ground for overturning the whole church and one which had added much oil to the flame of persecution in england deny that they desired more than that knox might be ordered to quit the place  the passages selected as treasonable in the admonition do not include the prayer for a jehu  they were enough however to secure the dismissal of knox from frankfort  cox had accepted the order used by the french protestant congregation probably because it committed him and his party to nothing in england however knox had no sooner departed than the antipuritans obtained leave to use without surplice cross and some other matters the second prayer book of edward vi  in september the puritans seceded the anti puritans remained squabbling with the lutherans and among themselves  in the whole affair knox acted the most open and manly part in his history he declines to name the opponents who avenged themselves in a manner so dubious on his admonition  if they believed their own account of the mischief that it wrought in england their denunciation of him to magistrates who were not likely to do more than dismiss him is the less inexcusable  they did not try to betray him to a body like the inquisition as calvin did in the case of servetus  but their conduct was most unworthy and unchivalrous 58     chapter vii knox in scotland lethington mary of guise 15551556   meanwhile the reformer returned to geneva april 1555 where calvin was now supreme  from geneva the den of mine own ease the rest of quiet study knox was dragged maist contrarious to mine own judgement by a summons from mrs bowes  he did not like leaving his den to rejoin his betrothed the lover was not so fervent as the evangelist was cautious knox had at that time probably little correspondence with scotland  he knew that there was no refuge for him in england under mary tudor who nowise may abide the presence of gods prophets  in scotland at this moment the government was in the hands of mary of guise a sister of the duke of guise and of the cardinal  mary was now aged forty she was born in 1515 as knox probably was  she was a tall and stately woman her face was thin and refined henry viii as being himself a large man had sought her hand which was given to his nephew james v  on the death of that king mary with cardinal beaton kept scotland true to the french alliance and her daughter the fair queen of scots was at this moment a child in france betrothed to the dauphin  as a catholic of the house of lorraine mary could not but cleave to her faith and to the french alliance  in 1554 she had managed to oust from the regency the earl of arran the head of the all but royal hamiltons now gratified with the french title of duc de chatelherault  to crown her was as seemly a thing says knox if men had but eyes as a saddle upon the back of ane unrewly kow  she practically deposed huntly the most treacherous of men from the chancellorship substituting with more or less reserve a frenchman de rubay and doysel the commander of the french troops in scotland was her chief adviser  picture of king james v and mary of guise knox2jpg  writing after the death of mary of guise knox avers that she only waited her chance to cut the throats of all those in whom she suspected the knowledge of god to be within the realm of scotland 60  as a matter of fact the regent later refused a french suggestion that she should peacefully call protestants together and then order a massacre after the manner of the bartholomew itself still in the womb of the future  mary of guise says knoxs biographer professor hume brown had the instincts of a good rulerthe love of order and justice and the desire to stand well with the people  knox however believed or chose to say that she wanted to cut all protestant throats just as he believed that a protestant king should cut all catholic throats  he attributed to her quite erroneously and uncharitably his own unsparing fervour  as he held this view of her character and purposes it is not strange that a journey to scotland was contrairious to his judgement  he did not understand the situation  ferocious as had been the english invasion of scotland in 1547 the english party in scotland many of them paid traitors did not resent these rebukes of a friend so much as both the nobles and the people now began to detest their french allies and were jealous of the queen mothers promotion of frenchmen  there were not to be sure many scots whom she or any one could trust some were honestly protestant some held pensions from england others would sacrifice national interests to their personal revenges and clan feuds  the rev the lord james stewart marys bastard brother prior of st andrews and of pittenweem was still very young  he had no interest in his clerical profession beyond drawing his revenues as prior of two abbeys and his nearness to the crown caused him to be suspected of ambition moreover he tended towards the new ideas in religion  he had met knox in london apparently in 1552  morton was a mere wavering youth argyll was very old chatelherault was a rival of the regent a competitor for the crown and quite incompetent  the regent in short could scarcely have discovered a scottish adviser worthy of employment and when she did trust one he was the brilliant chamaeleon young maitland of lethington who would rather betray his master cleverly than run a straight course and did betray the regent  thus mary a frenchwoman and a catholic governing scotland for her catholic daughter the dauphiness with the aid of a few french troops who had just saved the independence of the country naturally employed french advisers  this made her unpopular her attempts to bring justice into scottish courts were odious and she would not increase the odium by persecuting the protestants  the dukes bastard brother again the archbishop sharing his family ambition was in no mood for burning heretics  the queen mother herself carried conciliation so far as to pardon and reinstate such trebly dyed traitors as the notorious crichton of brunston and she employed kirkcaldy of grange who intrigued against her while in her employment  an edinburgh tailor harlaw who seems to have been a deacon in english orders was allowed to return to scotland in 1554  he became a very notable preacher 62a  going from mrs bowess house to edinburgh knox found that the fervency of the godly did ravish him  at the house of one syme the trumpet blew the auld sound three days thegither he informed mrs bowes and knox himself was the trumpeter  he found another lady who by reason that she had a troubled conscience delighted much in the company of the said john  there were pleasant sisters in edinburgh who later consulted knox on the delicate subject of dress  he was more tolerant in answering them than when he denounced the stinking pride of women at mary stuarts court admitting that in clothes silks velvets gold and other such there is no uncleanness yet i cannot praise the common superfluity which women now use in their apparel  he was quite opposed however to what he pleasingly calls correcting natural beauty as by dyeing the hair and held that farthingales cannot be justified  on the whole he left the sisters fairly free to dress as they pleased his curious phrase 62b in a letter to a pair of sisters the prophets of god are often impeded to pray for such as carnally they love unfeignedly is difficult to understand  we leave it to the learned to explain this singular limitation of the prophet which knox says that he had not as yet experienced  he must have heard about it from other prophets  knox found at this time a patron remarkable says dr mcrie for great respectability of character erskine of dun  born in 1508 about 1530 he slew a priest named thomas froster in a curiously selected place the belfry tower of montrose  nobody seems to have thought anything of it nor should we know the fact if the record of the bloodprice paid by mr erskine to the priests father did not testify to the fervent act  six years later according to knox god had marvellously illuminated erskine and the mildness of his nature is frequently applauded  he was for scotland a man of learning and our first amateur of greek  why did he kill a priest in a bell tower  in the winter or autumn of 1555 erskine gave a supper where knox was to argue against cryptoprotestantism  when once the truth whether anglican or presbyterian was firmly established catholics were compelled under very heavy fines to attend services and sermons which they believed to be at least erroneous if not blasphemous  i am not aware that in 1555 the catholic church in scotland thus vigorously forced people of protestant opinions to present themselves at mass punishing nonconformity with ruin  i have not found any complaints to this effect at that time  but no doubt an appearance of conformity might save much trouble even in the lenient conditions produced by the character of the regent and by the political situation  knox then discovered that divers who had a zeal to godliness made small scruple to go to the mass or to communicate with the abused sacraments in the papistical manner  he himself therefore began to show the impiety of the mass and how dangerous a thing it was to communicate in any sort with idolatry  now to many of his hearers this essential article of his faiththat the catholic doctrine of the eucharist and form of celebration were idolatrymay have been quite a new idea  it was already however a commonplace with anglican protestants  nothing of the sort was to be found in the first prayer book of edward vi broken lights of various ways of regarding the sacrament probably played at this moment over the ideas of knoxs scottish disciples  indeed their consciences appear to have been at rest for it was after knoxs declaration about the idolatrous character of the mass that the matter began to be agitated from man to man the conscience of some being afraid  to us it may seem that the sudden denunciation of a christian ceremony even what may be deemed a perverted christian ceremony as sheer idolatry equivalent to the worship of serpents bulls or of a foreign baal in ancient israelwas a step calculated to confuse the real issues and to provoke a religious war of massacre  knox we know regarded extermination of idolaters as a counsel of perfection though in the christian scriptures not one word could be found to justify his position he relied on texts about massacring amalekites and about elijahs slaughter of the prophets of baal  the mass was idolatry was baal worship and baal worshippers if recalcitrant must die  these extreme unchristian ideas then were new in scotland even to divers who had a zeal to godliness  for their discussion at erskine of duns party were present among others willock a scots preacher returned from england and young maitland of lethington  we are not told what part willock took in the conversation  the arguments turned on biblical analogies never really coincident with the actual modern circumstances  the analogy produced in discussion by those who did not go to all extremes with knox did not however lack appropriateness christianity in fact as they seem to have argued did arise out of judaism retaining the same god and the same scriptures but in virtue of the sacrifice of its founder abstaining from the sacrifices and ceremonial of the law  in the same way protestantism arose out of mediaeval catholicism retaining the same god and the same scriptures but rejecting the mediaeval ceremonial and the mediaeval theory of the sacrifice of the mass  it did not follow that the mass was sheer idolatry at which no friend of the new ideas could be present  as a proof that such presence or participation was not unlawful was not idolatry in the existing state of affairs was adduced the conduct of st paul and the advice given to him by st james and the church in jerusalem acts xxi 1836  paul was informed that many thousands of jews believed yet remained zealous for the law the old order  they had learned that paul advised the jews in greece and elsewhere not to walk after the customs  paul should prove that he also kept the law for this purpose he with four christian jews under a vow was to purify himself and he went into the temple until that an offering should be offered for every one of them  offerings of course is the term in our version for sacrifices whether of animals or of unleavened wafers anointed with oil  the argument from analogy was i infer that the mass with its wafer was precisely such an offering such a survival in catholic ritual as in jewish ritual st paul consented to by the advice of the church of jerusalem consequently protestants in a catholic country under the existing circumstances might attend the mass  the mass was not idolatry  the analogy halts like all analogies but so of course and to fatal results does knoxs analogy between the foreign worships of israel and the mass  she thinks not that idolatry but good religion said lethington to knox once speaking of queen marys mass so thought they that offered their children unto moloch retorted the reformer  manifestly the mass is of the two much more on a level with the offering of st paul than with human sacrifices to moloch 66  in his reply knox as he states his own argument altogether overlooked the offering of st paul which as far as we understand was the essence of his opponents contention  he said that to pay vows was never idolatry but the mass from the original was and remained odious idolatry therefore the facts were most unlike  secondly i greatly doubt whether either jamess commandment or pauls obedience proceeded from the holy ghost about which knox was apparently better informed than these apostles and the church of jerusalem  next paul was presently in danger from a mob which had been falsely told that he took greeks into the temple  hence it was manifest that god approved not that means of reconciliation  obviously the danger of an apostle from a misinformed mob is no sort of evidence to divine approval or disapproval of his behaviour 67  we shall later find that when knox was urging on some english nonconformists the beauty of conformity 1568 he employed the very precedent of st pauls conduct at jerusalem which he rejected when it was urged at erskines supper party  we have dwelt on this example of knoxs logic because it is crucial  the reform of the church of christ could not be achieved without cruel persecution on both parts while knox was informing scotland that all members of the old faith were as much idolaters as israelites who sacrificed their children to a foreign god while to extirpate idolaters was the duty of a christian prince  lethington as he soon showed was as clearsighted in regard to knoxs logical methods as any man of to day but he concluded saying i see perfectly that our shifts will serve nothing before god seeing that they stand us in so small stead before man  but either lethington conformed and went to mass or mary of guise expected nothing of the sort from him for he remained high in her favour till he betrayed her in 1559  knoxs opinion being acceptedit obviously was a novelty to many of his hearersthe reformers must either convert or persecute the catholics even to extermination  circumstances of mere worldly policy forbade the execution of this counsel of perfection but persistent idolaters legally lay after 1560 under sentence of death  there was to come a moment we shall see when even knox shrank from the consequences of a theory a murderous syllogism writes one of his recent biographers mr taylor innes which divided his countrymen into the godly on one hand and idolaters doomed to death by divine law on the other  but he put his hesitation behind him as a suggestion of satan  knox now associated with lord erskine then governor of edinburgh castle the central strength of scotland with lord lorne soon to be earl of argyll a christian but not a remarkably consistent walker with lord james the natural brother of queen mary whose conscience as we saw permitted him to draw the benefices of the abbacy of st andrews of pittenweem and of an abbey in france without doing any duties and with many redoubtable lairds of the lothians ayrshire and forfarshire he also preached for ten days in the town house at edinburgh of the bishop of dunkeld  on may 15 1556 he was summoned to appear in the church of the black friars  as he was backed by erskine of dun and other gentlemen according to the scottish custom when legal proceedings were afoot no steps were taken against him the clergy probably dreading knoxs defenders as bothwell later in similar circumstances dreaded the assemblage under the earl of moray as lennox shrank from facing the supporters of bothwell and moray from encountering the spears of lethingtons allies  it was usual to overawe the administrators of justice by these gatherings of supporters perhaps a survival of the old compurgators  this in fact was part of the obligation of our scottish kyndness and the divided ecclesiastical and civil powers shrank from a conflict  glencairn and the earl marischal in the circumstances advised knox to write a letter to mary of guise something that might move her to hear the word of god that is to hear knox preach  this letter as it then stood was printed in a little blackletter volume probably of 1556 knox addresses the regent and queen mother as her humble subject  the document has an interest almost pathetic and throws light on the whole character of the great reformer  it appears that knox had been reported to the regent by some of the clergy or by rumour as a heretic and seducer of the people  but knox had learned that the dew of the heavenly grace had quenched her displeasure and he hoped that the regent would be as clement to others in his case as to him  therefore he returns to his attitude in the letter to his berwick congregation 1552 he calls for no jehu he advises no armed opposition to the sovereign but says of gods chosen children the protestants that their victory standeth not in resisting but in suffering in quietness silence and hope as the prophet isaiah recommends  the isaiahs however numerous modern criticism may reckon them were late prophets not of the school of elijah whom knox followed in 1554 and 155859 not in 1552 or 1555 or on one occasion in 155859  the elect of god do not shed blood and murder knox remarks though he approves of the elect of the brethren at all events when they do murder and shed blood  meanwhile knox is more than willing to run the risks of the preacher of the truth partly because i would with st paul wish myself accursed from christ as touching earthly pleasures whatever that may mean for the salvation of my brethren and illumination of your grace  he confesses that the regent is probably not so free as a public reformation perhaps would require for that required the downcasting of altars and images and prohibition to celebrate or attend catholic rites thus knox would apparently be satisfied for the moment with toleration and immunity for his fellowreligionists  nothing of the sort really contented him of course but at present he asked for no more  yet a few days later he writes the regent handed his letter to the archbishop of glasgow saying please you my lord to read a pasquil an offence which knox never forgave and bitterly avenged in his history  it is possible that the regent merely glanced at his letter  she would find herself alluded to in a biblical parallel with the egyptian midwives with nebuchadnezzar and rahab the harlot  her acquaintance with these amiable idolaters may have been slight but the comparison was odious and far from tactful  knox also reviled the creed in which she had been bred as a poisoned cup and threatened her if she did not act on his counsel with torment and pain everlasting  those who drink of the cup of her church drink therewith damnation and death  as for her clergy proud prelates do kings maintain to murder the souls for which the blood of christ jesus was shed  these statements were dogmatic and the reverse of conciliatory  one should not in attempting to convert any person begin by reviling his religion  knox adopted the same method with mary stuart the method is impossible  it is not to be marvelled at if the regent did style the letter a pasquil  knox took his revenge in his history by repeating a foolish report that mary of guise had designed to poison her late husband james v  many whisper that of old his part was in the pot and that the suspicion thereof caused him to be inhibited the queens company while the cardinal got his secret business sped of that gracious lady either by day or night 71a  he styled her as we saw a wanton widow he hinted that she was the mistress of cardinal beaton he made similar insinuations about her relations with doysel who was a secretis mulierum he said as we have seen that she only waited her chance to cut the throats of all suspected protestants he threw doubt on the legitimacy of her daughter mary stuart and he constantly accuses her of treachery as will appear when the charge is either doubtful or as far as i can ascertain absolutely false  these are unfortunately examples of knoxs christianity 71b  it is very easy for modern historians and biographers to speak with genial applause of the prophets manly bluffness  but if we put ourselves in the position of opponents whom he was trying to convert of the two marys for example we cannot but perceive that his method was hopelessly mistaken  in attempting to evangelise an euahlayi black fellow we should not begin by threats of damnation and by railing accusations against his god baiame     chapter viii knoxs writings from abroad beginning of the scottish revolution 15561558   knox was about this time summoned to be one of the preachers to the english at geneva  he sent in advance mrs bowes and his wife visited argyll and glenorchy now breadalbane wrote july 7 an epistle bidding the brethren be diligent in reading and discussing the bible and went abroad  his effigy was presently burned by the clergy as he had not appeared in answer to a second summons and he was outlawed in absence  it is not apparent that knox took any part in the english translation of the bible then being executed at geneva  greek and hebrew were not his forte though he had now some knowledge of both tongues but he preached to the men who did the work  the perfections of genevan church discipline delighted him  manners and religion so sincerely reformed i have not yet seen in any other place  the genius of calvin had made geneva a kind of protestant city state greek text a calvinistic utopiaeverywhere the vigilant eyes of the preachers and magistrates were upon every detail of daily life  monthly and weekly the magistrates and ministers met to point out each others little failings  knox felt as if he were indeed in the city of god and later he introduced into scotland and vehemently abjured england to adopt the genevan discipline  england would none of it and would not even in the days of the solemn league and covenant suffer the excommunication by preachers to pass without lay control  it is unfortunate that the ecclesiastical polity and discipline of a small city state like a greek greek word polis feasible in such a community as geneva at a moment of spiritual excitement was brought by knox and his brethren into a nation like scotland  the results were a hundred and twentynine years of unrest civil war and persecution  though happy in the affection of his wife and mrs bowes knox at this time needed more of feminine society  on november 19 1556 he wrote to his friend mrs locke wife of a cheapside merchant you write that your desire is earnest to see me  dear sister if i should express the thirst and languor which i have had for your presence i should appear to pass measure     your presence is so dear to me that if the charge of this little flock    did not impede me my presence should anticipate my letter  thus knox was ready to brave the fires of smithfield or perhaps forgot them for the moment in his affection for mrs locke  he writes to no other woman in this fervid strain  on may 8 1557 mrs locke with her son and daughter who died after her journey joined knox at geneva 73  he was soon to be involved in scottish affairs  after his departure from his country omens and prodigies had ensued  a comet appeared in novemberdecember 1556  next year some cornstacks were destroyed by lightning  worse a calf with two heads was born and was exhibited as a warning to mary of guise by robert ormistoun  the idolatress merely sneered and said it was but a common thing  such a woman was incorrigible  mary of guise is always blamed for endangering scotland in the interests of her family the guises of the house of lorraine  in fact so far as she tried to make scotland a province of france she was serving the ambition of henri ii  it could not be foreseen in 1555 that henri ii would be slain in 1559 leaving the two kingdoms in the hands of francis ii and mary stuart who were so young that they would inevitably be ruled by the queens uncles of the house of lorraine shortly before knox arrived in scotland in 1555 the duc de guise had advised the regent to use sweetness and moderation as better than extremity and rigour advice which she acted on gladly  unluckily the war between france and spain in 1557 brought english troops into collision with french forces in the low countries philip ii being king of england this led to complications between scotland as ally of france and the english on the borders  border raids began doysel fortified eyemouth as a counterpoise to berwick war was declared in november and the discontented scots such as chatelherault huntly cassilis and argyll mutinied and refused to cross tweed 74 thus arose a breach between the regent and some of her nobles who at last in 1559 rebelled against her on the ground of religion  while the weak war languished on in 155758 the evangel of jesus christ began wondrously to flourish says knox  other evangelists of his pattern harlaw douglas willock and a baker methuen later a victim of the intolerably cruel discipline of the kirk triumphant preached at dundee and methuen started a reformed kirk though not without being declared rebels at the horn  when these persons preached their hearers were apt to raise riots wreck churches and destroy works of sacred art no government could for ever wink at such lawless actions and it was because the pulpiteers methuen willock douglas and the rest were again put at after being often suffered to go free that the final crash came and the reformation began in the wrack and ruin of monasteries and churches  there was drawing on another thundercloud  the policy of mary of guise certainly tended to make scotland a mere province of france a province infested by french forces slender but illpaid and predacious  before marrying the dauphin in april 1558 mary stuart urged it is said by the guises signed away the independence of her country to which her husband by these deeds was to succeed if she died without issue  young as she was mary was perfectly able to understand the infamy of the transaction and probably was not so careless as to sign the deeds unread  even before this secret treaty was drafted on march 10 1557 glencairn lorne erskine and the prior of st andrewsbest known to us in after years as james stewart earl of morayinformed knox that no cruelty by way of persecution was being practised that his presence was desired and that they were ready to jeopard their lives and goods for the cause the rest would be told to knox by the bearer of the letter  knox received the letter in may 1557 with verbal reports by the bearers but was so far from hasty that he did not leave geneva till the end of september and did not reach dieppe on his way to scotland till october 24  three days later he wrote to the nobles who had summoned him seven months earlier  he had received he said at dieppe two private letters of a discouraging sort one correspondent said that the enterprise was to be reconsidered the other that the boldness and constancy required for such an enterprise were lacking among the nobles  meanwhile knox had spent his time or some of it in asking the most godly and the most learned of europe including calvin for opinions of such an adventure for the assurance of his own conscience and the consciences of the lord james erskine lorne and the rest 76a  this indicates that knox himself was not quite sure of the lawfulness of an armed rising and perhaps explains his long delay  knox assures us that calvin and other godly ministers insisted on his going to scotland  but it is quite certain that of an armed rising calvin absolutely disapproved  on april 16 1561 writing to coligny calvin says that he was consulted several months before the tumult of amboise march 1560 and absolutely discouraged the appeal to arms  better that we all perish a hundred times than that the name of christianity and the gospel should come under such disgrace 76b  if calvin bade knox go to scotland he must have supposed that no rebellion was intended  knox tells his correspondents that they have betrayed themselves and their posterity in conscience i can except none that bear the name of nobility they have made him and their own enterprise ridiculous and they have put him to great trouble what is he to say when he returns to geneva and is asked why he did not carry out his purpose  he then encourages them to be resolute  knox certainly made the most says professor hume brown of the two letters from correspondents unknown to us  he at once represented them as the cause of his failure to keep tryst but in april 1558 writing from geneva to the sisters he said the cause of my stop to this day i do not clearly understand  he did not know why he left england before the marian persecutions and he did not know why he had not crossed over to scotland in 1557  it may be that god justly permitted sathan to put in my mind such cogitations as these i heard such troubles as appeared in that realmtroubles presently to be described  hearing at dieppe then in october 1557 of the troubles and of the faint war with england and moved perhaps he suggests by satan 77a knox began to dispute with himself as followeth shall christ the author of peace concord and quietness be preached where war is proclaimed and tumults appear to rise  what comfort canst thou have to see the one part of the people rise up against the other and so forth these truly christian reflections as we may think them yet do trouble and move my wicked heart says knox  he adds hypothetically that perhaps the letters received at dieppe did somewhat discourage me 77b  he was only certain that the devil was at the bottom of the whole affair  the tumults that appear to arise are probably the dissensions between the regent and the mutinous nobles who refused to invade england at her command  doysel needed a bodyguard and he feared that the lords would seize and carry off the regent  arran in 1564 speaks of a plot to capture her in holyrood  here were promises of tumults  there were also signs of a renewed feud between the house of hamilton and the stewart earl of lennox the rival claimant of the crown  there seems moreover to have been some tumultuary imagebreaking 78  knox may have been merely timid he is not certain but his delay passed in consulting the learned for the satisfaction of his conscience and his confessed doubts as to whether christianity should be pushed by civil war seem to indicate that he was not always the prophet patron of modern jehus that he did occasionally consult the gospel as well as the records of prechristian israel  the general result was that from october 1557 to march 1558 knox stayed in dieppe preaching with great success raising up a protestant church and writing  his condition of mind was unenviable  he had been brought all the way across france leaving his wife and family he had it seems been met by no letters from his noble friends who may well have ceased to expect him so long was his delay  he was not at ease in his conscience for to be plain he was not sure that he was not afraid to risk himself in scotland and he was not certain that his new scruples about the justifiableness of a rising for religion were not the excuses suggested by his own timidity  perhaps they were just that not whisperings either of conscience or of satan  yet in this condition knox was extremely active  on december 1 and 17 he wrote from dieppe a letter to his brethren in scotland and another to the lords and others professing the truth in scotland  in the former he censures as well he might the dissolute life of some such as have professed christs holy evangel  that is no argument he says against protestantism  many turks are virtuous many orthodox hebrews saints and patriarchs occasionally slipped the corinthians though of a trew kirk were notoriously profligate  meanwhile union and virtue are especially desirable for satan fiercely stirreth his terrible tail  we do not know what backslidings of the brethren prompted this letter  the lords in the other letter are reminded that they had resolved to hazard life rank and fortune for the delivery of the brethren the first step must be to achieve a godly frame of mind  knox hears rumours that contradiction and rebellion is made by some to the authority in scotland  he advises that none do suddenly disobey or displease the established authority in things lawful nor rebel from private motives by things lawful does he mean the command of the regent to invade england which the nobles refused to do  they may lawfully attempt the extremity if authority will not cease to persecute and permit protestant preaching and administration of the sacraments which usually ended in riot and churchwrecking  above all they are not to back the hamiltons whose chief chatelherault had been a professor had fallen back and become a persecutor  flee all confederacy with that generation the hamiltons with whom after all knox was presently to be allied though by no means fully believing in the unfeigned and speedy repentance of their chief 80a  all the movements of that time are not very clear  apparently lorne lord james and the rest in their letter of march 10 1557 intended an armed rising they were ready to jeopardise lives and goods for the glory of god  if no more than an appeal to the authority for tolerance was meant why did knox consult the learned so long on the question of conscience  yet in december 1557 he bids his allies first of all seek the favour of the authority for bare toleration of protestantism  from the scheme of march 10 of which the details unknown to us were orally delivered by bearer he appears to have expected civil war  again just when knox was writing to scotland in december 1557 his allies there he says made a common band a confederacy and covenant such as the scots usually drew up before a murder as of riccio or darnley or for slaying argyll and the bonny earl o murray under james vi  these bands were illegal  a band says knox was now signed by argyll lorne glencairn morton and erskine of dun and many others unknown on december 3 1557  it is alleged that satan cruelly doth rage  now how was satan raging in december 1557  myln the last martyr was not pursued till april 1558 by knoxs account  the first godly band being of december 1557 80b and drawn up perhaps on the impulse of knoxs severe letter from dieppe of october 27 in that year just after they signed the band what were the demands of the banders  they asked apparently that the second prayer book of edward vi should be read in all parish churches with the lessons if the curates are able to read if not then by any qualified parishioner secondly preaching must be permitted in private houses without great conventions of the people 81a  whether the catholic service was to be concurrently permitted does not appear it is not very probable for that service is idolatrous and the band itself denounces the church as the congregation of satan  dr mcrie thinks that the banders or congregation of god did not ask for the universal adoption of the english prayer book but only requested that they themselves might bring it in in places to which their authority and influence extended  they took that liberty certainly without waiting for leave but their demand appears to apply to all parish churches  war in fact was denounced against satans congregation 81b if it troubles the lords congregation there could therefore be little idea of tolerating their nefarious creed and ritual  probably knox at dieppe in 1557 and early in 1558 did not know about the promising band made in scotland  he was composing his first blast of the trumpet against the monstrous regiment of women  in england and in scotland were a catholic queen a catholic queen mother and the queen of scotland was marrying the idolatrous dauphin  it is not worth while to study knoxs general denunciation of government by ladies he allowed that as calvin suggested miraculous exceptions to their inability might occur as in the case of deborah  as a rule a queen was an idol and that was enough  england deserved an idol and an idolatrous idol for englishmen rejected kirk discipline no man would have his life called in trial by presbyter or preacher  a queen regnant has ex officio committed treason against god the realm and estates may have conspired with her but her rule is unlawful  naturally this skirl on the trumpet made knox odious to elizabeth for to impeach her succession might cause a renewal of the wars of the roses  nothing less could have happened if a large portion of the english people had believed in the prophet of god john knox  he could predict vengeance on mary tudor but could not see that as elizabeth would succeed his blast would bring inconvenience to his cause or seeing it he stood to his guns  he presently reprinted and added to his letter to mary of guise arguing that civil magistrates have authority in religion but of course he must mean only as far as they carry out his ideas which are the truth in an appellation against the condemnation of himself in absence by the scottish clergy he labours the same idea  moreover no idolater can be exempted from punishment by gods law  now the queen of scotland happened to be an idolater and every true believer as a private individual has a right to punish idolaters  that right and duty are not limited to the king or to the chief nobility and estates whom knox addresses  i would your honours should note for the first that no idolater can be exempted from punishment by gods law  the second is that the punishment of such crimes as are idolatry blasphemy and others that touch the majesty of god doth not appertain to kings and chief rulers only as he had argued that they do in 1554 but also to the whole body of that people and to every member of the same according to the vocation of every man and according to that possibility and occasion which god doth minister to revenge the injury done against his glory what time that impiety is manifestly known     who dare be so impudent as to deny this to be most reasonable and just 83  knoxs method of argument for his doctrine is to take among other texts deuteronomy xiii 1218 and apply the sanguinary precepts of hebrew fanatics to the then existing state of affairs in the church christian thus in deuteronomy cities which serve other gods or welcome missionaries of other religions are to be burned and every living thing in them is to be destroyed  to the carnal man     says knox this may rather seem to be pronounced in a rage than in wisdom  god wills however that all creatures stoop cover their faces and desist from reasoning when commandment is given to execute his judgement  knox then desists from reasoning so far as to preach that every protestant with a call that way has a right to punish any catholic if he gets a good opportunity  this doctrine he publishes to his own countrymen  thus any fanatic who believed in the prophet knox and was conscious of a vocation might and should avenge gods wrongs on mary of guise or mary stuart he had a fair opportunity for both ladies were idolaters this is a plain inference from the passage just cited  appealing to the commonalty of scotland knox next asked that he might come and justify his doctrine and prove popery abominable before god now could any government admit a man who published the tidings that any member of a state might avenge god on an idolater the queen being according to him an idolater  this doctrine of the right of the protestant individual is merely monstrous  knox has wandered far from his counsel of passive resistance in his letter to his berwick congregation he has even passed beyond his admonition which merely prayed for a phinehas or jehu he has now proclaimed the right and duty of the private protestant assassin  the appellation containing these ideas was published at geneva in 1558 with the authors but without the printers name on the titlepage  the first blast had neither the authors nor printers name nor the name of the place of publication  calvin soon found that it had given grave offence to queen elizabeth  he therefore wrote to cecil that though the work came from a press in his town he had not been aware of its existence till a year after its publication  he now took no public steps against the book not wishing to draw attention to its origin in geneva lest by reason of the reckless arrogance of one man the ravings of others the miserable crowd of exiles should have been driven away not only from this city but even from almost the whole world 84  as far as i am aware no one approached calvin with remonstrance about the monstrosities of the appellation nor are the passages which i have cited alluded to by more than one biographer of knox to my knowledge  professor hume brown however justly remarks that what the kirk immediately after knoxs death called erastianism in ordinary parlance the doctrine that the civil power may interfere in religion could hardly be approved in more set terms than by knox  he avers that the ordering and reformation of religion    doth especially appertain to the civil magistrate      the king taketh upon him to command the priests 85  the opposite doctrine that it appertains to the church is an invention of satan  to that diabolical invention andrew melville and the kirk returned in the generation following while james vi held to knoxs theory as stated in the appellation  the truth is that knox contemplates a state in which the civil power shall be entirely and absolutely of his own opinions the king as christs silly vassal to quote andrew melville being obedient to such prophets as himself  the theories of knox regarding the duty to revenge gods feud by the private citizen and regarding religious massacre by the civil power ideas which would justify the bartholomew horrors appear to be forgotten in modern times  his address to the commonalty as citizens with a voice in the state represents the progressive and permanent element in his politics  we have shown however that before knoxs time the individual scot was a thoroughly independent character the man hath more words than the master and will not be content unless he knows the masters counsel  by march 1558 knox had returned from dieppe to geneva  in scotland since the godly band of december 1557 events were moving in two directions  the church was continuing in a belated and futile attempt at reformation of manners and wonderfully bad manners they confessedly were and of education from within  the congregation the protestants on the other hand were preparing openly to defend themselves and their adherents from persecution an honest manly and laudable endeavour so long as they did not persecute other christians  their preacherssuch as harlaw methuen and douglaswere publicly active  a moment of attempted suppression must arrive greatly against the personal wishes of archbishop hamilton who dreaded the conflict  in march 1558 hamilton courteously remonstrated with argyll for harbouring douglas  he himself was heavily murmured against for his slackness in the case of argyll by churchmen and other well given people and by mary of guise whose daughter by april 24 1558 was married to the dauphin of france  argyll replied that he knew how the archbishop was urged on but declined to abandon douglas  it is a far cry to loch awe argyll who died soon after was too powerful to be attacked  but sometime in april 1558 apparently a poor priest of forfarshire walter myln who had married and got into trouble under cardinal beaton was tried for heresy and without sentence of a secular judge it is said was burned at st andrews displaying serene courage and hoping to be the last martyr in scotland  naturally there was much indignation if the lords and others were to keep their band they must bestir themselves  they did bestir themselves in defence of their favourite preacherswillock harlaw methuen a cidevant friar christison and douglas  some of these men were summoned several times throughout 1558 and methuen and harlaw at least were at the horn outlawed but were protectedharlaw at dumfries methuen at dundeeby powerful laymen  at dundee as we saw by 1558 methuen had erected a church of reformed aspect and reformed means that the kirk had already been purged of altars and images  attempts to bring the ringleaders of protestant riots to law were made in 1558 but the precise order of events and of the protests of the reformers appears to be dislocated in knoxs narrative  he himself was not present and he seems never to have mastered the sequence of occurrences  fortunately there exists a fragment by a wellinformed writer apparently a contemporary the historie of the estate of scotland covering the events from july 1558 to 1560 87a   there are also imperfect records of the parliament of novemberdecember 1558 and of the last provincial council of the church in march 1559  for july 28 87b four or five of the brethren were summoned to a day of law in edinburgh their allies assembled to back them and they were released on bail to appear if called on within eight days  at this time the idol of st giles patron of the city was stolen and a great riot occurred at the saints fete september 3 87c  knox describes the discomfiture of his foes in one of his merriest passages frequently cited by admirers of his vein of humour  the event we know was at once reported to him in geneva by letter  some time after october if we rightly construe knox 88a a petition was delivered to the regent from the reformers by sandilands of calder 88b  they asserted that they should have defended the preachers or testified with them  the wisdom of the regent herself sees the need of reform spiritual and temporal and has exhorted the clergy and nobles to employ care and diligence thereon a fact corroborated by mary of guise herself in a paper soon to be quoted of july 1559 88c  they ask as they have the reading of the scriptures in the vernacular for common prayers in the same  they wish for freedom to interpret and discuss the bible in our conventions and that baptism and the communion may be done in scots and they demand the reform of the detestable lives of the prelates 88d  knoxs account in places appears really to refer to the period of the provincial council of march 1559 though it does not quite fit that date either  the regent is said on the occasion of calders petition and after the unsatisfactory replies of the clergy apparently at the provincial council march 1559 to have made certain concessions till parliament established uniform order  but the parliament was of novemberdecember 1558 89a  before that parliament at all events which was mainly concerned with procuring the crown matrimonial for the dauphin husband of mary stuart the brethren offered a petition in the first place shown to the regent asking for 1 the suspension of persecuting laws till after a general council has decided all controversies in religionthat is till the greek calends  2 that prelates shall not be judges in cases of heresy but only accusers before secular tribunals 3 that all lawful defences be granted to persons accused  4 that the accused be permitted to explain his own mind and meaning  5 that none be condemned for heretics unless by the manifest word of god they be convicted to have erred from the faith which the holy spirit witnesses to be necessary to salvation  according to knox this petition the regent put in her pocket saying that the churchmen would oppose it and thwart her plan for getting the crown matrimonial given to her sonin law francis ii and in short gave good words and drove time 89b  the reformers then drew up a long protestation which was read in the house but not enrolled in its records  they say that they have had to postpone a formal demand for reformation but protest that it be lawful to us to use ourselves in matters of religion and conscience as we must answer to god and they are ready to prove their case  they shall not be liable meanwhile to any penalties for breach of the existing acts against heresy nor for violating such rites as man without gods commandment or word hath commanded  they disclaim all responsibility for the ensuing tumults 90a  in fact they aver that they will not only worship in their own way but prevent other people from worshipping in the legal way and that the responsibility for the riots will lie on the side of those who worship legally  and this was the chief occasion of the ensuing troubles  the regent promised to put good order in controverted matters and was praised by the brethren in a letter to calvin not now to be found  another threat had been made by the brethren in circumstances not very obscure  as far as they are known they suggest that in january 1559 the zealots deliberately intended to provoke a conflict and to enlist the rascal multitude on their side at easter 1559  the obscurity is caused by a bookbinder  he has with the fatal ingenuity of his trade cut off the two top lines from a page in one manuscript copy of knoxs history 90b  the text now runs thus in its mutilated condition     zealous brether    upon the gates and posts of all the friars places within this realm in the month of january 1558 1559 preceding that whitsunday that they dislodged which is this      then follows the proclamation  probably we may supply the words     zealous brethren caused a paper to be affixed upon the gates and posts and so on  the paper so promulgated purported to be a warning from the poor of scotland that before whitsunday we the lawful proprietors will eject the friars and residents on the property unlawfully withheld by the religiousour patrimony  this feat will be performed with the help of god and assistance of his saints on earth of whose ready support we doubt not  as the saints in fact were the zealous brether    who affixed the written menace on all the friars places they knew what they were talking about and could prophesy safely  to make so many copies of the document and fix them on all the friars places implies organisation and a deliberate planriots and revolutionbefore whitsunday  the poor of course only exchanged better for worse landlords as they soon discovered  the zealous brethrenas a rule small lairds probably and burgesseswere the nucleus of the revolution  when townsfolk and yeomen in sufficient number had joined them in arms then nobles like argyll lord james glencairn ruthven and the rest put themselves at the head of the movement and won the prizes which had been offered to the blind crooked widows orphans and all other poor  after parliament was over at the end of december 1558 the archbishop of st andrews again summoned the preachers willock douglas harlaw methuen and friar john christison to a day of law at st andrews on february 2 1559  this is the statement of the historie 91  the brethren then caused inform the queen mother that the said preachers would appear with such multitude of men professing their doctrine as was never seen before in such like cases in this country and kept their promise  the system of overawing justice by such gatherings was usual as we have already seen knox bothwell lethington and the lord james stewart all profited by the practice on various occasions  mary of guise fearing some uproar or sedition bade the bishops put off the summons and in fact the preachers never were summoned finally for any offences prior to this date  on february 9 1559 the regent issued proclamations against eating flesh in lent this rule survived the reformation by at least seventy years and against such disturbances of religious services as the protest just described declared to be imminent all such deeds being denounced under pain of deathas pain of death was used to be threatened against poachers of deer and wild fowl 92a  mary however had promised as we saw that she would summon the nobles and estates to advise for some reformation in religion march 7 1559 and the archbishop called a provincial council to edinburgh for march  at this or some other juncture for knoxs narrative is bewildering 92b the clergy offered free discussion but refused to allow exiles like himself to be present and insisted on the acceptance of the mass purgatory the invocation of saints with security for their ecclesiastical possessions  in return they would grant prayers and baptism in english if done privately and not in open assembly  the terms he says were rejected appeal was made to mary of guise and she gave toleration except for public assemblies in edinburgh and leith pending the meeting of parliament  to the clergy who some say bribed her she promised to put order to these matters  the reformers were deceived and forbade douglas to preach in leith  so writes knox  now the historie dates all this bribe and all after the end of december 1558  knox however by some confusion places the facts bribe and all before april 28 1558 mylns martyrdom 93a  yet he had before him as he wrote the chronicle of bruce of earlshall who states the bribe knox says at 40000 pounds the historie says within 15000 pounds 93b  in any case knox who never saw his book in print has clearly dislocated the sequence of events  at this date namely march 1559 the preaching agitators were at liberty nor were they again put at for any of their previous proceedings  but defiances had been exchanged  the reformers in their protestation december 1558 had claimed it as lawful we know that they should enjoy their own services and put down those of the religion by law established until such time as the catholic clergy be able to prove themselves the true ministers of christs church and guiltless of all the crimes charged against them by their adversaries 93c  that was the challenge of the reformers backed by the menace affixed to the doors of all the monasteries  the regent in turn had thrown down her glove by the proclamation of february 9 1559 against disturbing services and bosting bullying priests  how could she possibly do less in the circumstances  if her proclamation was disobeyed could she do less than summon the disobedient to trial  her hand was forced  it appears to myself under correction that all this part of the history of the reformation has been misunderstood by our older historians  almost without exception they represent the regent as dissembling with the reformers till on conclusion of the peace of cateau cambresis which left france free to aid her efforts in scotland april 2 1559 and on the receipt of a message from the guises she threw off the mask and initiated an organised persecution  but there is no evidence that any such message commanding her to persecute at this time came from the guises before the regent had issued her proclamations of february 9 and march 23 94a denouncing attacks on priests disturbance of services administering of sacraments by lay preachers and tumults at large  now sir james melville of halhill the diplomatist writing in old age and often erroneously makes the cardinal of lorraine send de bettencourt or bethencourt to the regent with news of the peace of cateau cambresis and an order to punish heretics with fire and sword and says that though she was reluctant she consequently published her proclamation of march 23  dates prove part of this to be impossible 94b  obviously the regent had issued her proclamations of februarymarch 1559 in anticipation of the tumults threatened by the reformers in their beggars warning and in their protestation of december and arranged to occur with violence at easter as they did  the three or four preachers two of them apparently at the horn in 1558 were to preach publicly and riots were certain to ensue as the reformers had threatened  riots were part of the evangelical programme  of paul methuen who first reformed the church in dundee pitscottie writes that he ministered the sacraments of the communion at dundee and cupar and caused the images thereof to be cast down and abolished the popes religion so far as he passed or preached  for this sort of action he was now summoned 95a  the regent therefore warned in her proclamations men often challenged previously and as often allowed under fear of armed resistance to escape  all that followed was but a repetition of the feeble policy of outlawing these four or five men  finally in may 1559 these preachers had a strong armed backing and seized a central strategic point so the revolution blazed out on a question which had long been smouldering and on an occasion that had been again and again deferred  the regent far from having foreseen and hardened her heart to carry out an organised persecution and cut the throats of all protestants in scotland was in fact intending to go to france being in the earlier stages of her fatal malady  this appears from a letter of sir henry percy from norham castle to cecil and parry april 12 1559 95b  percy says that the news in his latest letters now lost was erroneous  the regent in fact is not as yet departed  she is very ill and her life is despaired of  she is at stirling where the nobles had assembled to discuss religious matters  only her french advisers were on the side of the regent  the matter is pacified for the time and in case of the regents death chatelherault doysel and de rubay are to be a provisional committee of government till the wishes of the king and queen francis and mary are known  again in her letter of may 16 to henri ii of france she stated that she was in very bad health 96a and at about the same date may 18 the english ambassador in france mentions her intention to visit that country at once 96b  but the revolution of may 11 breaking out in perth condemned her to suffer and die in scotland  this however does not amount to proof that no plan of persecution in scotland was intended  throckmorton writes on may 18 that the marquis delboeuf is to go thither  he takes with him both men of conduct and some of war it is thought his stay will not be long  again may 23 24 throckmorton reports that henri ii means to persecute extremely in poitou guienne and scotland  cecil may take occasion to use the matter in scotland as may seem best to serve the turn 96c  this was before the perth riot had been reported may 26 by cecil to throckmorton  was delboeuf intended to direct the persecution  the theory has its attractions but henri just emerged with maimed forces from a ruinous war knew that a persecution which served cecils turn did not serve his  to persecute in scotland would mean renewed war with england and could not be contemplated  if sir james melville can be trusted for once the constable about june 1 told him in the presence of the french king that if the perth revolt were only about religion we mon commit scottismens saules unto god 97  melville was then despatched with promise of aid to the regentif the rising was political not religious  it is quite certain that the regent issued her proclamations without any commands from france and her health was inconsistent with an intention to put protestants to fire and sword  in the records of the provincial council of march 1559 the foremost place is given to articles presented to the regent by some temporal lords and barons and by her handed to the clergy  they are the proposals of conservative reformers  they ask for moral reformation of the lives of the clergy for sermons on sundays and holy days for due examination of the doctrine life and learning of all who are permitted to preach  they demand that no vicar or curate shall be appointed unless he can read the catechism of 1552 plainly and distinctly that expositions of the sacraments should be clearly pronounced in the vernacular that common prayer should be read in the vernacular that certain exactions of gifts and dues should be abolished  again no one should be allowed to dishonour the sacraments or the service of the mass no unqualified person should administer the sacraments kirk rapine destruction of religious buildings and works of art should not be permitted  the council passed thirtyfour statutes on these points  the clergy were to live cleanly and not to keep their bastards at home  they were implored in the bowels of christ to do their duty in the services of the church  no one in future was to be admitted to a living without examination by the ordinary  ruined churches were to be rebuilt or repaired  breakers of ornaments and violators or burners of churches were to be pursued  there was to be preaching as often as the ordinary thought fit if the rector could not preach he must find a substitute who could  plain expositions of the sacraments were made out were to be read aloud to the congregations and were published at twopence the twopenny faith  administration of the eucharist except by priests was to be punished by excommunication 98a  knox himself desired death for others than true ministers who celebrated the sacrament 98b  his true ministers about halfadozen of them at this time of course came under the penalty of the last statute  he says with the usual error that after peace was made between france and england on april 2 1559 the treaty of cateau cambresis the regent began to spew forth and disclose the latent venom of her double heart  she looked frowardly on protestants commanded her household to use all abominations at easter she herself communicated and it is supposed that after that day the devil took more violent and strong possession in her than he had before     for incontinent she caused our preachers to be summoned  but why did she summon the same set of preachers as before for no old offence  the regent says the historie made proclamation during the council as the moderate reformers had asked her to do that no manner of person should    preach or minister the sacraments except they were admitted by the ordinary or a bishop on no less pain than death the council in fact made excommunication the penalty  now it was for ministering the sacrament after the proclamation of march 13 for preaching heresy and stirring up seditions and tumults that methuen brother john christison william harlaw and john willock were summoned to appear at stirling on may 10 1559 99a  how could any governor of scotland abstain from summoning them in the circumstances  there seems to be no new suggestion of the devil no outbreak of guisian fury  the regent was in a situation whence there was no outgait she must submit to the seditions and tumults threatened in the protestation of the brethren the disturbances of services the probable wrecking of churches or she must use the powers legally entrusted to her  she gave insolent answers to remonstrances from the brethren says knox  she would banish the preachers not execute them albeit they preached as truly as ever did st paul  being threatened as before with the consequent inconvenients she said she would advise  however summon the preachers she did for breach of her proclamations tumults and seditions 99b  knox himself was present at the revolution which ensued but we must now return to his own doings in the autumn and winter of 155859 100     chapter ix knox on the anabaptists his appeal to england 15581559   while the inevitable revolution was impending in scotland knox was living at geneva  he may have been engaged on his answer to the blasphemous cavillations of an anabaptist his treatise on predestination  laing thought that this work was chiefly written at dieppe in februaryapril 1559 but as it contains more than 450 pages it is probably a work of longer time than two months  in november 1559 the english at geneva asked leave to print the book which was granted provided that the name of geneva did not appear as the place of printing the authorities knowing of what knox was capable from the specimen given in his first blast  there seem to be several examples of the genevan edition published by crispin in 1560 the next edition less rare is of 1591 london 101  the anabaptist whom knox is discussing had been personally known to him and had lucid intervals  your chief apollos he had said addressing the calvinists be persecutors on whom the blood of servetus crieth a vengeance     they have set forth books affirming it to be lawful to persecute and put to death such as dissent from them in controversies of religion     notwithstanding they before they came to authority were of another judgment and did both say and write that no man ought to be persecuted for his conscience sake    102a  knox replied that servetus was a blasphemer and that moses had been a more wholesale persecutor than the edwardian burners of joan of kent and the genevan church which roasted servetus 102b october 1553  he incidentally proves that he was better than his doctrine  in england an anabaptist after asking for secrecy showed him a manuscript of his own full of blasphemies  in me i confess there was great negligence that neither did retain his book nor present him to the magistrate to burn  knox could not have done that for the author earnestly required of me closeness and fidelity which probably knox promised  indeed one fancies that his opinions and character would have been in conflict if a chance of handing an idolater over to death had been offered to him 102c  the death of mary tudor on november 17 1558 does not appear to have been anticipated by him  the tidings reached him before january 12 1559 when he wrote from geneva a singular brief exhortation to england for the spedie embrasing of christs gospel heretofore by the tyrannie of marie suppressed and banished  the gospel to be embraced by england is of course not nearly so much christs as john knoxs in its most acute form and with its most absolute intolerant and intolerable pretensions  he begins by vehemently rebuking england for her shameful defection and by threatening gods horrible vengeances which thy monstrous unthankfulness hath long deserved if the country does not become much more puritan than it had ever been or is ever likely to be  knox wraps you all in idolatry all in murder all in one and the same iniquity except the actual marian martyrs those who abstained from idolatry and those who avoided the realm or ran away  he had set one of the earliest examples of running away to do so was easier for him than for family men and others who had a stake in the country for which knox had no relish  he is hardly generous in blaming all the persons who felt no more ripe for martyrdom than he did yet stayed in england where the majority were and continued to be catholics  having asserted his very contestable superiority and uttered pages of biblical threatenings knox says that the repentance of england requireth two things first the expulsion of all dregs of popery and the treading under foot of all glistering beauty of vain ceremonies religious services must be reduced in short to his own bare standard next the genevan and knoxian kirk discipline must be introduced  no power or liberty must be permitted to any of what estate degree or authority they be either to live without the yoke of discipline by gods word commanded or to alter    one jot in religion which from gods mouth thou hast received    if prince king or emperor would enterprise to change or disannul the same that he be of thee reputed enemy to god while a prince who erects idolatry    must be adjudged to death  each bishopric is to be divided into ten  the founder of the church and the apostles all command us to preach to preach  a brief sketch of what the book of discipline later set forth for the edification of scotland is recommended to england and is followed by more threatenings in the familiar style  england did not follow the advice of knox her whole population was not puritan many of her martyrs had died for the prayer book which knox would have destroyed  his tract cannot have added to the affection which elizabeth bore to the author of the first blast  in after years as we shall see knox spoke in a tone much more moderate in addressing the early english nonconformist secessionists 1568  indeed it is as easy almost to prove by isolated passages in knoxs writings that he was a sensible moderate man loathing and condemning active resistance in religion as to prove him to be a senselessly violent man  all depends on the occasion and opportunity  he speaks with two voices  he was very impetuous in the death of mary tudor he suddenly saw the chance of bringing english religion up or down to the genevan level and so he wrote this letter of vehement rebuke and inopportune advice  knox must have given his biographers medicines to make them love him the learned dr lorimer finds in this epistle one of the most fierce of his writings a programme of what this reformation reformed should bea programme which was honourable alike to knoxs zeal and his moderation the moderation apparently consists in not abolishing bishoprics but substituting ten bishops of moderate income for one lordly prelate despite this moderation of the epistle its intolerance is extreme says dr lorimer and knoxs advice cannot but excite astonishment 104  the party which agreed with him in england was the minority of a minority the catholics it is usually supposed though we have no statistics were the majority of the english nation  yet the only chance according to knox that england has of escaping the vengeance of an irritable deity is for the smaller minority to alter the prayer book resist the queen if she wishes to retain it unaltered and force the english people into the discipline of a swiss protestant town  dr lorimer a most industrious and judicious writer adds that in these matters of discipline and of intolerance knox went to a tragical extreme of opinion of which none of the other leading reformers had set an example also that what he demanded was substantially demanded by the puritans all through the reign of elizabeth  but knox averred publicly and in his history that for everything he affirmed in scotland he had heard the judgments of the most godly and learned that be known in europe    and for my assurance i have the handwritings of many  now he had affirmed frequently in scotland the very doctrines of discipline and persecution of which none of the other leading reformers had set an example according to dr lorimer  therefore either they agreed with knox or what knox told the lords in june 1564 was not strictly accurate 105  in any case knox gave to his country the most extreme of reformations  the death of mary tudor and the course of events at home were now to afford our reformer the opportunity of promulgating in scotland those ideas which we and his learned presbyterian student alike regret and condemn  these persecuting ideas were only a mistaken theory of christian duty and nothing worse says dr lorimer  nothing could possibly be worse than a doctrine contrary in the highest degree to the teaching of our lord whether the doctrine was proclaimed by pope prelate or calvinist  here it must be observed that a most important fact in knoxs career a most important element in his methods has been little remarked upon by his biographers  ever since he failed in 1554 to obtain the adhesion of bullinger and calvin to his more extreme ideas he had been his own prophet and had launched his decrees of the right of the people of part of the people and of the individual to avenge the insulted majesty of god upon idolaters not only without warrant from the heads of the calvinistic church but to their great annoyance and disgust  of this an example will now be given     chapter x knox and the scottish revolution 1559   knox had learned from letters out of scotland that protestants there now ran no risks that without a shadow of fear they might hear prayers in the vernacular and receive the sacraments in the right way the impure ceremonies of antichrist being set aside  the image of st giles had been broken by a mob and thrown into a sewer the impure crowd of priests and monks had fled throwing away the shafts of the crosses they bore and hiding the golden heads in their robes  now the regent thinks of reforming religion on a given day at a convention of the whole realm  so william cole wrote to bishop bale then at basle without date  the riot was of the beginning of september 1558 and is humorously described by knox 107  this news though regarded as very certain was quite erroneous except as to the riot  one may guess that it was given to knox in letters from the nobles penned in october 1558 which he received in november 1558 there was also a letter to calvin from the nobles asking for knoxs presence  it seemed that a visit to scotland was perfectly safe knox left geneva in january he arrived in dieppe in february where he learned that elizabeth would not allow him to travel through england  he had much that was private to say to cecil and was already desirous of procuring english aid to scottish reformers  the tidings of the queens refusal to admit him to england came through cecil and knox told him that he was worthy of hell for conformity with mary tudor and that turks actually granted such safe conducts as were now refused to him 108a  perhaps he exaggerated the amenity of the turks  his first blast if acted on disturbed the succession in england and might beget new wars a matter which did not trouble the prophet  he also asked leave to visit his flock at berwick  this too was refused  doubtless knox with his unparalleled activity employed the period of delay in preaching the word at dieppe  after his arrival in scotland he wrote to his dieppe congregation upbraiding them for their laodicean laxity in permitting idolatry to coexist with true religion in their town  why did they not drive out the idolatrous worship  these epistles were intercepted by the governor of dieppe and their contents appear to have escaped the notice of the reformers biographers  a revolt followed in dieppe 108b  meanwhile knoxs doings at dieppe had greatly exasperated francois morel the chief pastor of the genevan congregation in paris and president of the first protestant synod held in that town the affairs of the french protestants were in a most precarious condition persecution broke into fury early in june 1559  a week earlier morel wrote to calvin knox was for some time in dieppe waiting on a wind for scotland  he dared publicly to profess the worst and most infamous of doctrines women are unworthy to reign christians may protect themselves by arms against tyrants  the latter excellent doctrine was not then accepted by the genevan learned  i fear that knox may fill scotland with his madness  he is said to have a boon companion at geneva whom we hear that the people of dieppe have called to be their minister  if he be infected with such opinions for christs sake pray that he be not sent or if he has already departed warn the dieppe people to beware of him 109a  a french excapuchin jacques trouille was appointed as knoxs successor at dieppe 109b  knoxs ideas even the idea that christians may bear the sword against tyrants were all his own were antigenevan and though calvin 155960 knew all about the conspiracy of amboise to kill the guises he ever maintained that he had discouraged and preached against it  we must therefore credit knox with originality both in his ideas and in his way of giving it to be understood that they had the approval of the learned of switzerland  the reverse was true  by may 3 knox was in edinburgh come in the brunt of the battle as the preachers summons to trial was for may 10  he was at once outlawed blown loud to the horn but was not dismayed  on this occasion the battle would be a fair fight the gentry under their band stood by the preachers and given a chance in open field with the arm of the flesh to back him knoxs courage was tenacious and indomitable  it was only for lonely martyrdom that he never thought himself ready and few historians have a right to throw the first stone at him for his backwardness  as for armed conflict at this moment mary of guise could only reckon surely on the small french garrison of scotland perhaps 1500 or 2000 men  she could place no confidence in the feudal levies that gathered when the royal standard was raised  the hamiltons merely looked to their own advancement lord james stewart was bound to the congregation huntly was a double dealer and was remote the minor noblesse and the armed burghers with glencairn representing the southwest lollard from of old were attached to knoxs doctrines while the mob would flock in to destroy and plunder  bridal medal of mary stuart and the dauphin 1558 knox3jpg  meanwhile mary of guise was at stirling and a multitude of protestants were at perth where the reformation had just made its entry and had secured a walled city a thing unique in scotland  the gentry of angus and the people of dundee at perth were now anxious to make a demonstration unarmed says knox at stirling if the preachers obeyed the summons to go thither on may 10  their strategy was excellent whether carefully premeditated or not  the regent according to knox amused erskine of dun with promises of taking some better order till the day of may 10 arrived when the preachers and their backers having been deluded into remaining at perth instead of demonstrating at stirling she outlawed the preachers and fined their sureties assisters  she did not outlaw the sureties  her treachery alleged only by knox and others who follow him is examined in appendix a  meanwhile it is certain that the preachers were put to the horn in absence and that the brethren believing themselves according to knox to have been disgracefully betrayed proceeded to revolutionary extremes such as calvin energetically denounced  if we ask who executed the task of wrecking the monasteries at perth knox provides two different answers  in the history knox says that after the news came of the regents perfidy and after a sermon vehement against idolatry a priest began to celebrate and opened a glorious tabernacle on the high altar certain godly men and a young boy were standing near they all or the boy alone the sentence may be read either way cried that this was intolerable  the priest struck the boy who took up a stone and hit the tabernacle and the whole multitude wrecked the monuments of idolatry  neither the exhortation of the preacher nor the command of the magistrate could stay them in their work of destruction 111  presently the rascal multitude convened without the gentry and earnest professors and broke into the franciscan and dominican monasteries they wrecked as usual and the common people robbed but the godly allowed forman prior of the charter house to bear away about as much gold and silver as he was able to carry  we learn from mary of guise and lesleys history that the very orchards were cut down  if thanks to the preachers no honest man was enriched the value of a groat apparently dishonest men must have sacked the gold and silver plate of the monasteries nothing is said by knox on this head except as to the charter house  writing to mrs locke on the other hand on june 23 knox tells her that the brethren after complaint and appeal made against the regent levelled with the ground the three monasteries burned all monuments of idolatry accessible and priests were commanded under pain of death to desist from their blasphemous mass  112  nothing is said about a spontaneous and uncontrollable popular movement  the professional brethren earnest professors of course reap the glory  which is the true version  if the version given to mrs locke be accurate knox had sufficient reasons for producing a different account in that portion of his history book ii which is a tract written in autumn 1559 and in purpose meant for contemporary foreign as well as domestic readers  the performances attributed to the brethren in the letter to the london merchants wife were of a kind which calvin severely rebuked  similar or worse violences were perpetrated by french brethren at lyons on april 30 1562  the booty of the church of st jean had been sold at auction there must be no more robbery and pillage says calvin writing on may 13 to the lyons preachers  the ruffians who rob ought rather to be abandoned than associated with to the scandal of the gospel  already reckless zeal was shown in the ravages committed in the churches altars and images had been overthrown but those who fear god will not rigorously judge what was done in hot blood from devout emotion but what can be said in defence of looting  calvin spoke even more distinctly to the consistory of nimes who suspended a preacher named tartas for overthrowing crosses altars and images in churches julyaugust 1561  the zealot was even threatened with excommunication by his fellow religionists 113a  calvin heard that this fanatic had not only consented to the outrages but had incited them and had the insupportable obstinacy to say that such conduct was with him a matter of conscience  but we says calvin know that the reverse is the case for god never commanded any one to overthrow idols except every man in his own house and in public those whom he has armed with authority  let that firebrand the preacher show us by what title he is lord of the land where he has been burning things  knox must have been aware of calvins opinion about such outrages as those of perth which in a private letter he attributes to the brethren in his public history to the mob  at st andrews when similar acts were committed he says that the provost and bailies    did agree to remove all monuments of idolatry whether this would or would not have satisfied calvin  opponents of my view urge that knox though he knew that the brethren had nothing to do with the ruin at perth yet in the enthusiasm of six weeks later claimed this honour for them when writing to mrs locke  still later when cool he told in his history the frozen truth the mob alone was guilty despite his exhortations and the commandment of the magistrate  neither alternative is very creditable to the prophet  in the historie of the estate of scotland it is the brethren who break burn and destroy 113b  in knoxs history no mention is made of the threat of death against the priests  in the letter to mrs locke he says apparently of the threat perhaps of the whole affair which thing did so enrage the venom of the serpents seed that she decreed death against man woman and child in perth after the fashion of knoxs favourite texts in deuteronomy and chronicles  this was beastlie crueltie  the history gives the same account of the regents threatening words which might escape her in choler of course we have no authority for her speaking them at all but in the history knox omits the threat by the brethren of death against the priestsa threat which none of his biographers mentions  if the menace against the priests and the ruin of monasteries were not seditious what is sedition  but knoxs business in book ii of his history much of it written in septemberoctober 1559 is to prove that the movement was not rebellious was purely religious and all for liberty of consciencefor protestants  therefore in the history he disclaims the destruction by the brethren of the monasteriesthe mob did that and he burkes the threat of death to priests though he told the truth privately to mrs locke  mary did not move at once  the hamiltons joined her and she had her french soldiers perhaps 1500 men  on may 22 the faithful congregation of christ jesus in scotland but a few gentlemen being concerned wrote from perth which they were fortifying to the regent  if she proceeds in her cruelty they will take up the sword and inform all christian princes and their queen in france that they have revolted solely because of this cruel unjust and most tyrannical murder intended against towns and multitudes  as if they had not revolted already their pretext seems to mean that they do not want to alter the sovereign authority a quibble which they issued for several months long after it was obviously false  they also wrote to the nobles to the french officers in the regents service and to the clergy  what really occurred was that many of the brethren left perth after they had made a day of it as they had threatened earlier that the regent called her nobles to council concentrated her french forces and summoned the levies of clydesdale and stirlingshire  meanwhile the brethren flocked again into perth at that time it is said the only wallgirt town in scotland they strengthened the works wrote everywhere for succour and loudly maintained that they were not rebellious or seditious  of these operations knox was the life and soul  there is no mistaking his hand in the letter to mary of guise or in the epistle to the catholic clergy  that letter is courteously addressed to the generation of antichrist the pestilent prelates and their shavelings within scotland the congregation of jesus within the same saith  the gentle congregation saith that if the clergy proceed in their cruelty they shall be apprehended as murderers  we shall begin that same war which god commanded israel to execute against the canaanites     this they promise in the names of god christ and the gospel  any one can recognise the style of knox in this composition  david hume remarks with these outrageous symptoms commenced in scotland that hypocrisy and fanaticism which long infested that kingdom and which though now mollified by the lenity of the civil power is still ready to break out on all occasions  hume was wrong there was no touch of hypocrisy in knox he believed as firmly in the message which he delivered as in the reality of the sensible universe  a passage in the message to the nobility displays the intense ardour of the convictions that were to be potent in the later history of the kirk that priests by the prescription of fifteen centuries should have persuaded themselves of their own power to damn mens souls to hell cut them off from the christian community and hand them over to the devil is a painful circumstance  but knox from perth asserts that the same awful privilege is vested in the six or seven preachers of the nascent kirk with the firenew doctrine  addressing the signers of the godly band and other sympathisers who have not yet come in he if he wrote these fiery appeals observes that if they do not come in ye shall be excommunicated from our society and from all participation with us in the administration of the sacraments     doubt we nothing but that our church and the true ministers of the same have the power which our master jesus christ granted to his apostles in these words whose sins ye shall forgive shall be forgiven and whose sins ye shall retain shall be retained      men were to be finally judged by omnipotence on the faith of what willock knox harlaw poor paul methuen and the apostate friar christison trew ministeris thought good to decide with such bugbears did guthrie and his companions think a century later to daunt the clear spirit of montrose  while reading the passages just cited we are enabled to understand the true cause of the sorrows of scotland for a hundred and thirty years  the situation is that analysed by thomas luber a professor of medicine at heidelberg well or ill known in scottish ecclesiastical disputes by his graecised name erastus  he argued about 1568 that excommunication has no certain warrant in holy writ under a christian prince  erastus writes  some men were seized on by a certain excommunicatory fever which they did adorn with the name of ecclesiastical discipline     they affirmed the manner of it to be this that certain presbyters should sit in the name of the whole church and should judge who were worthy or unworthy to come to the lords supper  i wonder that then they consulted about these matters when we neither had men to be excommunicated nor fit excommunicators for scarcely a thirtieth part of the people did understand or approve of the reformed religion 117  there was adds erastus another fruit of the same tree that almost every one thought men had the power of opening and shutting heaven to whomsoever they would  what men have this power in scotland in 1559  why some five or six persons who being fluent preachers have persuaded local sets of protestants to accept them as ministers  these preachers having a callit might be from a set of perfidious and profligate murderersare somehow gifted with the apostolic grace of binding on earth what shall be bound in heaven  their successors down to mr cargill who of his own fantasy excommunicated charles ii were an intolerable danger to civilised society  for their edicts of boycotting they claimed the sanction of the civil magistrate and while these almost incredibly fantastic pretentions lasted there was not and could not be peace in scotland  the seed of this upas tree was sown by knox and his allies in may 1559 an act of 1690 repealed civil penalties for the excommunicated  to face the supernaturally gifted preachers the regent had but a slender force composed in great part of sympathisers with knox  croft the english commander at berwick writing to the english privy council on may 22 anticipated that there would be no war  the hamiltons numerically powerful and strong in martial gentlemen of the name were with the regent  but of the hamiltons it might always be said as charles i was to remark of their chief that they were very active for their own preservation and for no other cause  for centuries but one or two lives stood between them and the throne the haven where they would be  they never produced a great statesman but their wealth numbers and almost royal rank made them powerful  at this moment the eldest son of the house the earl of arran was in france  as a boy he had been seized by the murderers of cardinal beaton and held as a hostage in the castle of st andrews  was he there converted to the reformers ideas by the eloquence of knox  we know not but as heir to his fathers french duchy of chatelherault he had been some years in france commanding the scottish archer guard  in france too perhaps he was more or less a pledge for his fathers loyalty in scotland  he was now a protestant in earnest had retired from the french court had refused to return thither when summoned and fled from the troops who were sent to bring him lurking in woods and living on strawberries  cecil despatched thomas randolph to steer him across the frontier to zurich  he was a piece in the game much more valuable than his father whose portrait shows us a weak feebly cunning goodnatured and puzzledlooking old nobleman  till arran returned to scotland the hamiltons it was certain would be trusty allies of neither faith and of neither party  when the perth tumult broke out lord james rode with the regent as did argyll  but both had signed the godly band of december 3 1557 and could no more be trusted by the regent than the hamiltons  meanwhile the gentry of fife and forfarshire with the town of dundee joined knox in the walled town of perth though lord ruthven provost of perth deserted for the moment to the regent  on the other hand the courageous glencairn with a strong body of the zealots of renfrewshire and ayrshire was moving by forced marches to join the brethren  on may 24 the regent instead of attacking halted at auchterarder fourteen miles away and sent argyll and lord james to parley  they were told that the brethren meant no rebellion as the regent said and doubtless thought that they did but only desired security for their religion and were ready to be tried by whom in lawful judgment  argyll and lord james were satisfied  on may 25 knox harangued the two lords in his wonted way but the regent bade the brethren leave perth on pain of treason  by may 28 however she heard of glencairns approach with lord ochiltree a stewart later knoxs fatherinlaw glencairn by cross roads had arrived within six miles of perth with 1200 horse and 1300 foot  the western reformers were thus nearer perth than her own untrustworthy levies at auchterarder  not being aware of this the brethren proposed obedience if the regent would amnesty the perth men let their faith go forward and leave no garrison of french soldiers to mrs locke knox adds that no idolatry should be erected or alteration made within the town 120  the regent was now sending lord james argyll and mr gawain hamilton to treat when glencairn and his men marched into perth  argyll and lord james then promised to join the brethren if the regent broke her agreement knox and willock assured their hearers that break it she wouldand so the agreement was accepted may 28  it was thus necessary for the brethren to allege that the covenant was broken and it was not easy for mary to secure order in perth without taking some step that could be seized on as a breach of her promise argyll and lord james could then desert her for the party of knox  the very band which argyll and lord james signed with the congregation provided that the godly should go on committing the disorders which it was the duty of the regent to suppress and they proceeded in that holy course breaking down the altars and idols in all places where they came 121a  at their whole powers the congregations are to destroy and put away all that does dishonour to gods name that is monasteries and works of sacred art  they are all to defend each other against any power whatsoever that shall trouble them in their pious work  argyll and lord james signed this new band with glencairn lord boyd and ochiltree  the queens emissaries thus deserted her cause on the last day of may 1559 or earlier for the chronology is perplexing 121b  as to the terms of truce with the regent knox gives no document but says that no perth people should be troubled for their recent destruction of idolatry and for down casting the places of the same that she would suffer the religion begun to go forward and leave the town at her departing free from the garrisons of french soldiers  the historie mentions no terms except that she should leave no men of war behind her  thus as it seems the brethren by their band were to go on wrecking the homes of the regents religion while she was not to enjoy her religious privileges in the desecrated churches of perth for to do that was to prevent the religion begun from going forward  on the regents entry her men discharged their volley of hackbuts probably to clear their pieces a method of unloading which prevailed as late as waterloo  but some aimed says knox at the house of patrick murray and hit a son of his a boy of ten or twelve who being slain was had to the queens presence  she mocked and wished it had been his father but seeing that it so chanced we cannot be against fortune  it is not very probable that mary of guise was merry in knoxs manner of mirth over the death of a child to mrs locke knox says children who for all we know may have been the victim of accident like the jacobite lady who was wounded at a window as prince charless men discharged their pieces when entering edinburgh after the victory of prestonpans  this brave lady said that it was fortunate she was not a whig or the accident would have been ascribed to design  this event at perth was called a breach of terms so was the attendance at mass celebrated on any chance table as the altars were not so easy to be repaired again  the soldiers were billeted on citizens whose houses were oppressed by the frenchmen and the provost ruthven who had anew deserted to the congregation and the bailies were deposed  these magistrates probably had been charged with the execution of priests who dared to do their duty at least in the following year on june 10 1560 we find the provost bailies and town council of edinburgh decreeing death for the third offence against idolaters who do not instantly profess their conversion 122  the edinburgh municipality did this before the abolition of catholicism by the convention of estates in august 1560  it does not appear that any authority in perth except that of the provost and bailies could sentence priests to death was their removal then a breach of truce  at all events it seemed necessary in the circumstances and mary of guise when she departed left no french soldiers to protect the threatened priests but four companies of scots who had been in french service under stewart of cardonell and captain cullen the captain of queen marys guard after the murder of riccio  the regent is said by knox to have remarked that she was not bound to keep faith with heretics and that with as fair an excuse she would make little scruple to take the lives and goods of all that sort  we do not know knoxs authority for these observations of the regent  the scots soldiers left by mary of guise may have been protestants they certainly were not frenchmen and in a town where death had just been threatened to all priests who celebrated the mass mary could not abandon her clerics unprotected  taking advantage of what they called breach of treaty as regards the soldiers left in perth lord james and argyll with ruthven had joined the brethren accompanied by the earl of menteith and murray of tullibardine ancestor of the ducal house of atholl  argyll and lord james went to st andrews summoning their allies thither for june 3 knox meanwhile preached in crail and anstruther with the usual results on sunday june 11 123a and for three days more despising the threats of the archbishop backed by a hundred spears and referring to his own prophecy made when he was in the galleys he thundered at st andrews the poor ruins of some sacred buildings are alive to testify to the consequences and a head of the redeemer found in the latrines of the abbey is another mute witness to the destruction of that day 123b  it is not my purpose to dilate on the universal destruction of so much that was beautiful and that to scots however godly should have been sacred  the tomb of the bruce in dunfermline for example was wrecked by the mob as the statue of jeanne darc on the bridge of orleans was battered to pieces by the huguenots  nor need we ask what became of church treasures perhaps of great value and antiquity  in some known cases the magistrates held and sold those of the town churches  some of the plate and vestments at aberdeen were committed to the charge of huntly but about 1900 ounces of plate were divided among the prebendaries who seem to have appropriated them 124  the church treasures of glasgow were apparently carried abroad by archbishop beaton if lord james as prior took possession of the gold and silver of st andrews he probably used the bullion he spent some 13000 crowns in his defence of the approaches to the town against the french in december 1559  a silver mace of st salvators college escaped the robbers  head of christ  st andrews  excavated from the ruins of the abbey by the late marquis of bute knox4jpg  there is no sign of the possession of much specie by the congregation in the months that followed the sack of so many treasuries of pious offerings  lesley says that they wanted to coin the plate in edinburgh and for that purpose seized as they certainly did the dies of the mint in france when the brethren sacked tours they took twelve hundred thousand livres dor the country was enriched for the moment  not so scotland  in fact the plate of aberdeen cathedral as inventoried in the register is no great treasure  monasteries and cathedrals were certain to perish sooner or later for the lead of every such roof except coldingham had been stripped and sold by 1585 while tombs had been desecrated for their poor spoils and the fanes were afterwards used as quarries of hewn stone  lord james had a peculiar aversion to idolatrous books and is known to have ordered the burning of many manuscriptsthe loss to art was probably greater than the injury to history or literature  the fragments of things beautiful that the reformers overlooked were destroyed by the covenanters  an attempt has been made to prove that the border abbeys were not wrecked by reformers but by english troops in the reign of henry viii who certainly ravaged them lesley however says that the abbeys of kelso and melrose were by them the reformers broken down and wasted 125a  if there was nothing left to destroy on the border why did the brethren march against kelso as cecil reports on july 9 1559 125b  after the devastation the regent meant to attack the destroyers intending to occupy cupar six miles by knoxs reckoning from st andrews  but by june 13 the brethren had anticipated her with a large force rapidly recruited including three thousand men under the lothian professors ruthvens horse the levies of the earl of rothes leslie and many burgesses  next day the regents french horse found the brethren occupying a very strong post their numbers were dissembled their guns commanded the plains and the eden was in their front  a fog hung over the field when it lifted the french commander doysel saw that he was outnumbered and outmanoeuvred  he sent on an envoy to parley which gladly of us being granted the queen offered a free remission for all crimes past so that they would no further proceed against friars and abbeys and that no more preaching should be used publicly for that always meant kirkwrecking  when wishart preached at mauchline long before in 1545 it was deemed necessary to guard the church where there was a tempting tabernacle beutyfull to the eie  the lords and the whole brethren refused such appointment    says knox to mrs locke they would not suffer idolatrie to be maintained in the bounds committed to their charge 126a  to them liberty of conscience from the first meant liberty to control the consciences and destroy the religion of all who differed from them  an eight days truce was made for negotiations during the truce neither party was to enterprize anything  knox in his history does not mention an attack on the monastery of lindores during the truce  he says that his party expected envoys from the regent as in the terms of truce but perceived her craft and deceit 126b  in fact the brethren were the trucebreakers  knox gives only the assurances signed by the regents envoys the duke of chatelherault and doysel  they include a promise not to invade trouble or disquiet the lords the reforming party  but though knox omits the fact the reformers made a corresponding and equivalent promise that the congregation should enterprise nothing nor make no invasion for the space of six days following for the lords and principals of the congregation read the rest on another piece of paper 126c  the situation is clear  the two parties exchanged assurances  knox prints that of the regents party not that on another piece of paper of the congregation  they broke their word they made invasion at lindores during truce as knox tells mrs locke but does not tell the readers of his history 127a  it is true that knox was probably preaching at st andrews on june 13 and was not present at cupar muir but he could easily have ascertained what assurances the lords of the congregation read from another piece of paper on that historic waste 127b     chapter xi knoxs intrigues and his account of them 1559   the reformers and knox as their secretary and historian had now reached a very difficult and delicate point in their labours  their purpose was not by any means to secure toleration and freedom of conscience but to extirpate the religion to which they were opposed  it was the religion by law existing the creed of authority of the regent and of the king and queen whom she represented  the position of the congregation was therefore essentially that of rebels and in the state of opinion at the period to be rebels was to be selfcondemned  in the eyes of calvin and the learned of the genevan church kings were the lords appointed and the gospel must not be supported by the sword  better that we all perish a hundred times calvin wrote to coligny in 1561  protestants therefore if they would resist in arms had to put themselves in order and though knox had no doubt that to exterminate idolaters was thoroughly in order the leaders of his party were obliged to pay deference to european opinion  by a singular coincidence they adopted precisely the same device as the more militant french protestants laid before calvin in august 1559march 1560  the scots and the protestant french represented that they were illegally repressed by foreigners in scotland by mary of guise with her french troops in france by the cardinal and duc de guise foreigners who had possession of the persons and authority of the native prince of scotland mary and the native prince of france francis ii both being minors  the french idea was that if they secured the aid of a native protestant prince conde they were in order as against the foreign guises and might kill these tyrants seize the king and call an assembly of the estates  calvin was consulted by the chief of the conspiracy la renaudie he disapproved the legality lent by one native prince was insufficient the details of the plot were puerile and calvin waited to see how the country would take it  the plot failed at amboise in march 1560  in scotland as in france devices about a prince of the native blood suggested themselves  the regent being of the house of guise was a foreigner like her brothers in france  the native princes were chatelherault and his eldest son arran  the leaders soon after lord james and argyll formally joined the zealous brethren saw that without foreign aid their enterprise was desperate  their levies must break up and go home to work the regents nucleus of french troops could not be ousted from the sea fortress of dunbar and would in all probability be joined by the army promised by henri ii  his death the huguenot risings the consequent impotence of the guises to aid the regent could not be foreseen  scotland it seemed would be reduced to a french province the religion would be overthrown  there was thus no hope except in aid from england  but by the recent treaty of cateau cambresis april 2 1559 elizabeth was bound not to help the rebels of the french dauphin the husband of the queen of scots moreover elizabeth had no stronger passion than a hatred of rebels  if she was to be persuaded to help the reformers they must produce some show of a legitimate authority with whom she could treat  this was as easy to find as it was to the huguenots in the case of conde chatelherault and arran native princes next heirs to the crown while mary was childless could be produced as legitimate authority  but to do this implied a change of authority an upsetting of authority which was plain rebellion in the opinion of the genevan doctors  knox was thus obliged in sermons and in the pamphlet book ii of his history to maintain that nothing more than freedom of conscience and religion was contemplated while as a matter of fact he was foremost in the intrigue for changing the authority and even for depriving mary stuart of entrance and title to her rights  he therefore in book ii much of which was written in augustoctober or septemberoctober 1559 as an apologetic contemporary tract conceals the actual facts of the case and while perpetually accusing the regent of falsehood and perfidy displays an extreme economy of truth and cannot hide the pettifogging prevarications of his party  his wiser plan would have been to cancel this book or much of it when he set forth later to write a history of the reformation  his party being then triumphant he could have afforded to tell most of the truth as in great part he does in his book iii  but he could not bring himself to throw over the narrative of his party pamphlet book ii and it remains much as it was originally written though new touches were added  the point to be made in public and in the apologetic tract was that the reformers contemplated no alteration of authority  this was untrue  writing later probably in 156566 in his third book knox boasts of his own initiation of the appeal to england which included a scheme for the marriage of the earl of arran son of the hamilton chief chatelherault to queen elizabeth  failing issue of queen mary arran was heir to the scottish throne and if he married the queen of england the rightful queen of scotland would not be likely to wear her crown  the contemplated match was apt to involve a change of dynasty  the lure of the crown for his descendants was likely to bring chatelherault and perhaps even his brother the archbishop over to the side of the congregation in short it was an excellent plot  probably the idea occurred to the leaders of the congregation at or shortly after the time when argyll and lord james threw in their lot definitely with the brethren on may 31  on june 14 croft from berwick writes to cecil that the leaders from what i hear will likely seek her majestys elizabeths assistance and mean to bring arran home  some think that he is already at geneva and he appears to have made the acquaintance of calvin with whom later he corresponded  they are likely to motion a marriage you know where of arran that is with elizabeth 131  moreover one whitlaw was at this date in france and by june 28 communicated the plan to throckmorton the english ambassador  thus the scheme was of an even earlier date than knox claims for his own suggestion  he tells us that at st andrews after the truce of cupar muir june 13 he burstit forth in conversation with kirkcaldy of grange on the necessity of seeking support from england  kirkcaldy long ago had watched the secret exit from st andrews castle while his friends butchered the cardinal  he was taken in the castle when knox was taken he was a prisoner in france then he entered the french service acting while so engaged as an english spy  before and during the destruction of monasteries he was in the regents service but she justly suspected him of intending to desert her at this juncture  kirkcaldy now wrote to cecil without date but probably on june 21 and with the signature zours as ye knaw  being in the regents party openly he was secretly betraying her he therefore accuses her of treachery  he left her publicly after a pension from england had been procured for him  he says that the regent averred that favourers of gods word should have liberty to live after their consciences yet in the conclusion of the peace the eight days truce she has uttered her deceitful mind having now declared that she will be enemy to all them that shall not live after her religion  consequently the protestants are wrecking all the friaries within their bounds  but knox has told us that they declared their intention of thus enjoying liberty of conscience before the conclusion of the peace and wrecked lindores abbey during the peace  kirkcaldy adds that the regent already suspects him  kirkcaldy having made the orthodox charge of treachery against the woman whom he was betraying then asks cecil whether elizabeth will accept their friendship and adds with an eye to arran i wish likewise her majesty were not too hasty in her marriage 133a  on june 23 writing from his house grange and signing his name kirkcaldy renews his proposals  in both letters he anticipates the march of the reformers to turn the regents garrison out of perth  on june 25 he announces that the lords are marching thither  they had already the secret aid of lethington who remained like the traitor that he was in the regents service till the end of october 133b  knox also writes at this time to cecil from st andrews  on june 1 henri ii of france had written to the regent promising to send her strong reinforcements 133c but he was presently killed in a tourney by the broken lance shaft of montgomery  the reformers now made tryst at perth for june 25 to restore religion and expel the scots in french service  the little garrison surrendered their opponents are reckoned by kirkcaldy at 10000 men idolatry was again suppressed and perth restored to her municipal constitution  the ancient shrines of scone were treated in the usual way despite the remonstrances of knox lord james and argyll  they had threatened hepburn bishop of moray that if he did not join them they neither could spare nor save his place  this was on june 20 on the same day he promised to aid them and vote with them in parliament 133d  knox did his best but the dundee people began the work of wrecking and the bishop in anger demanded and received the return of his written promise of joining the reformers  on the following day irritated by some show of resistance the people of dundee and perth burned the palace of scone and the abbey whereat no small number of us was offended  an old woman said that filthy beasts dwelt in that den to her private knowledge at whose words many were pacified  the old woman is an excellent authority 134  the pretext of perfect loyalty was still maintained by the reformers their honesty we can appreciate  they did not wish they said to overthrow authority merely to be allowed to worship in their own way and to prevent other people from worshipping in theirs which was the order appointed by the state  that any set of men may rebel and take their chances is now recognised but the reformers wanted to combine the advantages of rebellion with the reputation of loyal subjects  persons who not only band against the sovereign but invoke foreign aid and seek a foreign alliance are however noble their motives rebels  there is no other word for them  but that they were not rebels knox urged in a sermon at edinburgh which the reformers after devastating stirling reached by june 2829  and the second book of his history labours mainly to prove this point no change of authority is intended  what knox wanted is very obvious  he wanted to prevent mary stuart from enjoying her hereditary crown  she was a woman as such under the curse of the first blast of the trumpet and she was an idolatress presently as we shall see he shows his hand to cecil  before the reformers entered edinburgh mary of guise retired to the castle of dunbar where she had safe access to the sea  in edinburgh knox says that the poor sacked the monasteries before our coming  the contemporary diurnal of occurrents attributes the feat to glencairn ruthven argyll and the lord james 135a  knox was chosen minister of edinburgh and as soon as they arrived the lords according to the historie of the estate of scotland sent envoys to the regent offering obedience if she would relax the preachers summoned on may 10 from the horn and allow them to preach  the regent complied but of course peace did not ensue for according to knox in addition to a request that we might enjoy liberty of conscience a demand for the withdrawal of all french forces out of scotland was made 135b  this could not be granted  presently mary of guise issued before july 2 in the name of the king and queen francis ii and mary stuart certain charges against the reformers which knox in his history publishes 135c  a remark that mary stuart lies like her mother seems to be written later than the period septemberoctober 1559 when this book ii was composed  the regent says that the rising was only under pretence of religion and that she has offered a parliament for january 1560  a manifest lie says knox for she never thought of it till we demanded it  he does not give a date to the regents paper but on june 25 kirkcaldy wrote to percy that the regent is like to grant the other party the reformers all they desire which in part she has offered already 136a  knox seizes on the word offered as if it necessarily meant offered though unasked and so styles the regents remark a manifest lie  but kirkcaldy we see uses the words has in part offered already when he means that the regent has offered to grant some of the wishes of his allies  meanwhile the regent will allow freedom of conscience in the country and especially in edinburgh  but the reformers her paper goes on desire to subvert the crown  to prove this she says that they daily receive messengers from england and send their own and they have seized the stamps in the mint a capital point as regards the crown and the palace of holyrood which lesley says that they sacked  knox replies there is never a sentence in the narrative true except that his party seized the stamps merely to prevent the issue of base coin not to coin the stolen plate of the churches and monasteries for themselves as lesley says they did  but knoxs own letters and those of kirkcaldy of grange and sir henry percy prove that they were intriguing with england as early as june 2325  their conduct with the complicity of percy was perfectly well known to the regents party and was denounced by doysel to the french ambassador in london in letters of july 136b  elizabeth on august 7 answered the remonstrances of the regent promising to punish her officials if guilty  nobody lied more frankly than that imperial votaress  when knox says there is never a sentence in the narrative true he is very bold  it was not true that the rising was merely under pretext of religion  it may have been untrue that messengers went daily to england but five letters were written between june 21 and june 28  to stand on the words of the regentevery daywould be a babyish quibble  all the rest of her narrative was absolutely true  knox on june 28 asked leave to enter england for secret discourse he had already written to the same effect from st andrews 137a  if henri sends french reinforcement knox is uncertain what will follow we may guess that authority would be in an ill way  cecil temporised he wanted a better name than kirkcaldysa man in the regents serviceto the negotiations july 4  anywise kindle the fire he writes to croft july 8  croft is to let the reformers know that arran has escaped out of france  such a chance will not again come in our lives  we see what the chance is  on july 19 knox writes again to cecil enclosing what he means to be an apology for his blast of the trumpet to be given to elizabeth  he says while admitting elizabeths right to reign as judged godly though a woman that they must be careful not to make entrance and title to many by whom not only shall the truth be impugned but also shall the country be brought to bondage and slavery  god give you eyes to foresee and wisdom to avoid the apparent danger 137b  the many to whom entrance and title are not to be given manifestly are mary stuart queen of france and scotland  it is not very clear whether knox while thus working against a womans entrance and title to the crown on the ground of her sex is thinking of mary stuarts prospects of succession to the throne of england or of her scottish rights or of both  his phrase is cast in a vague way many are spoken of but it is not hard to understand what particular female claimant is in his mind  thus knox himself was intriguing with england against his queen at the very moment when in his history he denies that communications were frequent between his party and england or that any of the regents charges are true  as for opposing authority and being rebellious the manifest fundamental idea of the plot is to marry elizabeth to arran and deny entrance and title to the rightful queen  it was an admirable scheme and had arran not become a lunatic had elizabeth not been that imperial votaress vowed to eternal maidenhood their bridal with the consequent loss of the scottish throne by mary would have been the most fortunate of all possible events  the brethren had in short a perfect right to defend their creed in arms a perfect right to change the dynasty a perfect right to intrigue with england and to resist a french landing if they could  but for a reformer of the church to give a dead lady the lie in his history when the economy of truth lay rather on his own side as he knew is not so well  we shall see that knox possibly had the facts in his mind during the first interview with mary stuart 138  the lords july 2 replied to the proclamation of mary of guise saying that she accused them of a purpose to invade her person 139a  there is not a word of the kind in the regents proclamation as given by knox himself  they denied what the regent in her proclamation had not asserted and what she had asserted about their dealings with england they did not venture to deny whereby says spottiswoode in his history it seemed there was some dealing that way for expelling the frenchmen which they would not deny and thought not convenient as then openly to profess 139b  the task of giving the lie to the regent when she spoke truth was left to the pen of knox  meanwhile at dunbar mary of guise was in evil case  she had sounded erskine the commander of the castle who she hoped would stand by her but she had no money to pay her french troops who were becoming mutinous and doysel knew not to what saint to vow himself  the earl of huntly before he would serve the crown 139c insisted on a promise of the earldom of moray this desire was to be his ruin  huntly was a double dealer the gay gordons were ever brave loyal and bewildered by their chiefs  by july 22 the scots heard of the fatal wound of henri ii to their encouragement  both parties were in lack of money and the forces of the congregation were slipping home by hundreds  mary according to knox was exciting the duke against argyll and lord james by the charge that lord james was aiming at the crown in which if he succeeded he would deprive not only her daughter of the sovereignty but the hamiltons of the succession  young and ambitious as lord james then was and heavily as he was suspected even in england it is most improbable that he ever thought of being king  the congregation refused to let argyll and lord james hold conference with the regent  other discussions led to no result except waste of time to the regents advantage and on july 22 mary in council with lord erskine huntly and the duke resolved to march against the reformers at edinburgh who had no time to call in their scattered levies in the west angus and fife  logan of restalrig lately an ally of the godly surrendered leith over which he was the superior to doysel and the congregation decided to accept a truce july 2324  at this point knoxs narrative becomes so embroiled that it reminds one of nothing so much as of claude naus attempts to glide past an awkward point in the history of his employer mary stuart  i have puzzled over knoxs narrative again and again and hope that i have disentangled the knotted and slippery thread  it is not wonderful that the brethren made terms for the historie states that their force numbered but 1500 men whereas doysel and the duke led twice that number horse and foot  they also heard from erskine in the castle that if they did not accept such appointment as they might have he would declare himself their enemy as he had promised the regent  it seems that she did not want war for doysels french alone should have been able to rout the depleted ranks of the congregation  the question is what were the terms of treaty for it is knoxs endeavour to prove that the regent broke them and so justified the later proceedings of the reformers  the terms in french are printed by teulet 141  they run thus  1  the protestants not being inhabitants of edinburgh shall depart next day  2  they shall deliver the stamps for coining to persons appointed by the regent hand over holyrood and ruthven and pitarro shall be pledges for performance  3  they shall be dutiful subjects except in matters of religion  4  they shall not disturb the clergy in their persons or by withholding their rents c before january 10 1560  5  they shall not attack churches or monasteries before that date  6  the town of edinburgh shall enjoy liberty of conscience and shall choose its form of religion as it pleases till that date  7  the regent shall not molest the preachers nor suffer the clergy to molest them for cause of religion till that date  8  keith knox and spottiswoode add that no garrisons french or scots shall occupy edinburgh but soldiers may repair thither from their garrisons for lawful business  the french soldiers are said to have swaggered in st giless but no complaint is made that they were garrisoned in edinburgh  in fact they abode in the canongate and leith  now these were the terms accepted by the congregation  this is certain not only because historians knox excepted are unanimous but because the terms were either actually observed or were evaded on a stated point of construction  1  the congregation left edinburgh  2  they handed over the stamps of the mint holyrood and the two pledges  3 4 5  we do not hear that they attacked any clerics or monastery before they broke off publicly from the treaty and knox i 381 admits that article 4 was accepted  6  they would not permit the town of edinburgh to choose its religion by voting of men  on july 29 when huntly chatelherault and erskine the neutral commander of the castle asked for a plebiscite as provided in the treaty of july 24 the truth said the brethren was not a matter of human votes and as the brethren held st giless church before the treaty under article 7 they could not be dispossessed 142a  the regent to avoid shadow of offence yielded the point as to article 6 and was accused of breach of treaty because occupying holyrood she had her mass there  had edinburgh been polled the brethren knew that they would have been outvoted 142b  now knoxs object in that part of book ii of his history which was written in septemberoctober 1559 as a tract for contemporary reading is to prove that the regent was the breaker of treaty  his method is first to give the heads drawn by us which we desired to be granted  the heads are  1  no member of the congregation shall be troubled in any respect by any authority for the recent innovation before the parliament of january 10 1560 decides the controversies  2  idolatry shall not be restored where on the day of treaty it has been suppressed  3  preachers may preach wherever they have preached and wherever they may chance to come  4  no soldiers shall be in garrison in edinburgh  5  the french shall be sent away on a reasonable day and no more brought in without assent of the whole nobility and parliament 143a  these articles make no provision for the safety of catholic priests and churches and insist on suppression of idolatry where it has been put down and the entire withdrawal of french forces  knoxs party could not possibly denounce these terms which they demanded as things unreasonable and ungodly for they were the very terms which they had been asking for ever since the regent went to dunbar  yet when the treaty was made the preachers did say our case is not yet so desperate that we need to grant to things unreasonable and ungodly 143b  manifestly therefore the terms actually obtained as being unreasonable and ungodly were not those for which the reformers asked and which they publicly proclaimed had been conceded  knox writes these our articles were altered and another form disposeth  and here he translates the terms as given in the french terms which provide for the safety of catholics the surrender of holyrood and the mint but say nothing about the withdrawal of the french troops or the nonrestoration of idolatry where it has been suppressed  he adds this alteration in words and order was made so it actually was made without the knowledge and consent of those whose counsel we had used in all cases beforeclearly meaning the preachers and also implying that the consent of the noble negotiators for the congregation was obtained to the french articles  next day the congregation left edinburgh after making solemn proclamation of the conditions of truce in which they omitted all the terms of the french version except those in their own favour and stated in knoxs version that all of their own terms except the most important namely the removal of the french and the promise to bring in no more had been granted  it may be by accident however that the proclamation of the lords as given by knox omits the article securing the departure of the french 144a  there exist two ms copies of the proclamation in which the lords dare to assert that the frenchmen should be sent away at a reasonable date and no more brought in except by assent of the whole nobility and parliament 144b  of the terms really settled except as regards the immunity of their own party the lords told the public not one word they suppressed what was true and added what was false  against this formal public and impudent piece of mendacity we might expect knox to protest in his history to denounce it as a cause of gods wrath  on the other hand he states with no disapproval the childish quibbles by which his party defended their action  on reading or hearing the lords proclamation the catholics who knew the real terms of treaty said that the lords in their proclamation had made no mention of anything promised to them and had proclaimed more than was contained in the appointment among other things doubtless the promise to dismiss the french 145a  the brethren replied to these calumnies of papists as calderwood styles them that they proclaimed nothing that was not finally agreed upon in word and promise betwixt us and those with whom the appointment was made whatsoever their scribes had after written 145b who in very deed had altered both in words and sentences our articles as they were first conceived and yet if their own writings were diligently examined the self same thing shall be found in substance  this is most complicated quibbling  knox uses his ink like the cuttle fish to conceal the facts  the own writings of the regents party are before us and do not contain the terms proclaimed by the congregation next in drawing up the terms which the congregation was compelled to accept the scribes of the regents party necessarily and with the consent of the protestant negotiators altered the terms proposed by the brethren but not granted by the regents negotiators  thirdly the congregation now asserted that finally an arrangement in conformity with their proclamation was agreed upon in word and promise that is verbally which we never find them again alleging  the game was to foist false terms on public belief and then to accuse the regent of perfidy in not keeping them  these false terms were not only publicly proclaimed by the congregation with sound of trumpets but they were actually sent by knox or kirkcaldy or both to croft at berwick for english reading on july 24 in a note i print the letter signed by kirkcaldy but in the holograph of knox according to father stevenson 146  it will be remarked that the genuine articles forbidding attacks on monasteries and ensuring priests in their revenues are here omitted while the false articles on suppression of idolatry and expulsion of the french forces are inserted and nothing is said about edinburghs special liberty to choose her religion  the sending of this false intelligence was not the result of a misunderstanding  i have shown that the french terms were perfectly well understood and were observed except article 6 on which the regent made a concession  how then could men professionally godly venture to misreport the terms and so make them at once seem more favourable to themselves and less discouraging to cecil than they really were while at the same time as the regent could not keep terms which she had never granted they were used as a ground of accusation against her  this is the point that has perplexed me for knox no less than the congregation seems to have deliberately said goodbye to truth and honour unless the lords elaborately deceived their secretary and diplomatic agent  the only way in which i can suppose that knox and his friends reconciled their consciences to their conduct is this  knox tells us that when all points were communed and agreed upon by mid persons chatelherault and huntly had a private interview with argyll glencairn and others of his party  they promised that they would be enemies to the regent if she broke any one jot of the treaty  as much promised the duke that he would do if in case that she would not remove her french at a reasonable day     the duke being especially interested in their removal  but huntly is not said to have made this promisethe removal of the french obviously not being part of the appointment 148a  next the brethren in arguing with the catholics about their own mendacious proclamation of the terms said that we proclaimed nothing which was not finally agreed upon in word and promise betwixt us and those with whom the appointment was made     148b  i can see no explanation of knoxs conduct except that he and his friends pacified their consciences by persuading themselves that nonofficial words of huntly and chatelherault whatever these words may have been spoken after all was agreed upon cancelled the treaty with the regent became the real treaty and were binding on the regent  thus knox or kirkcaldy or both by letter and knox later orally in conversation with croft could announce false terms of treaty  so great if i am right is a good mans power of selfpersuasion  i shall welcome any more creditable theory of the reformers behaviour but i can see no alternative unless the lords lied to knox  that the french should be driven out was a great point with cecil for he was always afraid that the scots might slip back from the english to the old french alliance  on july 28 after the treaty of july 24 but before he heard of it he insisted on the necessity of expelling the french in a letter to the reformers 149a  he marvels that they omit such an opportunity to help themselves  he sent a letter of vague generalities in answer to their petitions for aid  when he received as he did a copy of the terms of the treaty of july 24 in french he would understand  as further proof that cecil was told what knox and kirkcaldy should have known to be untrue we note that on august 28 the regent weary of the perpetual charges of perfidy anew brought against her ashamed not writes knox to put forth a proclamation in which she asserted that nothing in the terms of july 2324 forbade her to bring in more french troops as may clearly appear by inspection of the said appointment which the bearer has presently to show 149b  why should the regent have been ashamed to tell the truth  if the bearer showed a false and forged treaty the congregation must have denounced it and produced the genuine document with the signatures  far from that in a reply from internal evidence written by knox they admit neither do we here 149c allege the breaking of the appointment made at leith which nevertheless has manifestly been done butand here the writer wanders into quite other questions moreover knox gives another reply to the regent by some men in which they write we dispute not so much whether the bringing in of more frenchmen be violating of the appointment which the queen and her faction cannot deny to be manifestly broken by them in more cases than one in no way connected with the french  one of these cases will presently be statedit is comic enough to deserve recordbut beyond denial the brethren could not and did not even attempt to make out their charge as to the regents breach of truce by bringing in new or retaining old french forces  our historians and the biographers of knox have not taken the trouble to unravel this question of the treaty of july 24  but the behaviour of the lords and of knox seems characteristic and worthy of examination  it is not argued that mary of guise was or became incapable of worse than dissimulation a case of forgery by her in the following year is investigated in appendix b  but her practices at this time were such as knox could not throw the first stone at  her french advisers were in fact perplexed as throckmorton wrote to elizabeth august 8  they made preparations for sending large reinforcements they advised concession in religion they waited on events and the regent could only provide at leith which was jealous of edinburgh and anxious to be made a free burgh a place whither she could fly in peril  meantime she would vainly exert her womans wit among many dangers  knox too was exerting his wit in his own way  busied in preaching and in acting as secretary and diplomatic agent to the congregation as he was he must also have begun in or not much later than august 1559 the part of his history first written by him namely book ii  that book as he wrote to a friend named railton 150 on october 23 1559 when much of it was already penned is meant as a defence of his party against the charge of sedition and was clearly intended we reiterate for contemporary reading at home and abroad while the strife was still unsettled  this being so knox continues his policy of blaming the regent for breach of the misreported treaty of july 24 for treachery which would justify the brethrens attack on her before the period of truce january 10 1559 ran out  one clause we know secured the reformers from molestation before that date  despite this knox records a case of oppressing a brother which had been sufficient to prove the appointment to be plainly violated  lord seton of the catholic party 151a broke a chair on alexander whitelaw as he came from preston pans accompanied by william knox    and this he did supposing that alexander whitelaw had been john knox  so much knox states in his book ii writing probably in september or october 1559  but he does not here say what alexander whitelaw and william knox had been doing or inform us how he himself was concerned in the matter  he could not reveal the facts when writing in the early autumn of 1559 because the brethren were then still taking the line that they were loyal and were suffering from the regents breaches of treaty as in the matter of the broken chair  the sole allusion here made by knox to the english intrigues before they were manifest to all mankind in september is this because england was of the same religion and lay next to us it was judged expedient first to prove them which we did by one or two messengers as hereafter in its own place more amply shall be declared 151b  he later inserted in book iii some account of the intrigues of julyaugust 1559 in its own place namely in a part of his work occupied with the occurrences of january 1560 152a  cecil prior to the compact of july 24 had wished to meet knox at stamford  on july 30 knox received his instructions as negotiator with england 152b  his employers say that they hear that huntly and chatelherault have promised to join the reformers if the regent breaks a jot of the treaty of july 24 the terms of which knox can declare  they ask money to enable them to take stirling castle and strength by sea for the capture of broughty castle on tay  yet they later complained of the regent when she fortified leith  they actually did take broughty castle and then had the hardihood to aver that they only set about this when they heard in midseptember of the fortification of leith by the regent  they aimed at it six days after their treaty of july 24  they asked for soldiers to lie in garrison for men ships and money for their lords  bearing these instructions knox sailed from fife to holy island near berwick and there met croft the governor of that town  croft kept him not with sufficient secrecy in berwick where he was well known while whitelaw was coming from cecil with his answers to the petitions of the brethren  meanwhile croft held converse with knox who as he reports says that as to the change of authority that is of sovereignty temporary at least the choice of the brethren would be subject to elizabeths wishes  yet the brethren contemplated no change of authority  arran ought to be kept secretly in england till wise men considered what was in him if misliked he put lord james second  as to what knox told croft about the terms of treaty of july 24 it is best to state the case in crofts own words  he knox excusys the protestantes for that the french as commyng apon them at edynbrogh when theyr popoll were departed to make new provysyon of vytaylles forcyd them to make composycyon wyth the quene  whereyn sayeth he the frenchmen ar apoynted to departe out of scotland by the xth of thys monthe and they truste verely by thys caus to be stronger for that the duke apon breche of promys on the quenes part wyll take playne parte withe the protestantes 153  this is quite explicit  knox as envoy of the lords declares that in the treaty it is appointed that the french force shall leave scotland on august 10  the printed calendars are not accurate  no such matter occurred in the treaty wyth the quene  knox added next day that he himself was unfit to treat of so great matters and croft appears to have agreed with him for by the reformers lack of caution his doings in holy island were well known and published  consequently when whitelaw returned to knox with cecils reply to the requests of the brethren the performances of knox and whitelaw were no secrets in outline at least to the regents party  for this reason lord seton mistaking whitelaw for knox who had set out on august 3 to join the brethren at stirling pursued and broke a chair on the harmless brother whitelaw  such was the regents treacherous breach of treaty  during this episode in his curious adventures as a diplomatist knox recommended balnaves author of a treatise on justification by faith as a better agent in these courses and with balnaves the new envoy of elizabeth sadleir a veteran diplomatist wheedled in 1543 by mary of guise transacted business henceforth  sadleir was ordered to berwick on august 6  elizabeth infringed the treaty of cateau cambresis then only four months old by giving sadleir 3000 pounds in gold or some such sum for the brethren  they were tempting the duke by all means possible 154a but he will only promise neutrality if it comes to the push and they argyll and lord james say glasgow august 13 are not yet ready to discharge this authority that is to depose the regent chatelheraults promise was less vigorous than it had been reported  knox who now acted as secretary for the congregation was not sir henry wottons ideal ambassador an honest man sent to lie abroad for his country  when he stooped to statements which seem scarcely candid to put it mildly he did violence to his nature  he forced himself to proclaim the loyalty of his party from the pulpit when he could not do so without some economy of truth 154b  he inserted things in his history and spoke things to croft which he should have known to be false  but he carried his point  he did advance the union of hearts with england if in a blundering fashion and we owe him eternal gratitude for his interest in the match though we like not the manner of the wooing  the reluctant hand of elizabeth was now inextricably caught in the gear of that great machine which broke the ancient league of france and scotland and saved scotland from some of the sorrows of france  the papers of sadleir elizabeths secret agent with the scots show the godly pursuing their old plan of campaign  to make treaty with the regent to predict from the pulpit that she would break it to make false statements about the terms of the treaty to accuse her of their infringement to profess loyalty to aim at setting up a new sovereign power to tell the populace that mary of guises scanty french reinforcementssome 1500 mencame by virtue of a broken treaty to tell sadleir that they were very glad that the french had come as they would excite popular hatred to make out that the fortification of leith was breach of treatysuch in brief were the methods of the reformers 155  they now took a new method of proving the regents breach of treaty that she had set up the mass in holyrood which they had before suppressed they were allowed to have their sermons in st giless but she was not to have her rites in her own abbey  balnaves still harped on the non dismissal of the french as a breach of treaty  arran returning from switzerland had an interview with elizabeth in england in midseptember was smuggled across the border with the astute and unscrupulous thomas randolph in his train  with arran among them chatelherault might waver as he would  meanwhile knox and willock preached up and down the country doubtless repeating to the people their old charges against the regent  lethington the secretary of that lady still betrayed her telling sadleir that he attended upon the regent no longer than he might have a good occasion to revolt unto the protestants september 16  balnaves got some two to three thousand pounds in gold the sum is variously stated from sadleir  he saith whatever pretence they make the principal mark they shoot at is to make an alteration of the state and authority  this at least is explicit enough  the reformers were actually renewing the civil war on charges so stale and so false  the duke had possibly promised to desert her if she broke the truce and now he seized on the flimsy pretence because the congregation as the leaders said had tempted him sufficiently  they had come up to his price  arran the hopedfor hamilton king the hopedfor husband of the queen of england had arrived and with arran the duke joined the reformers  about september 20 they forbade the regent to fortify leith  the brethren say that they have given no provocation  six weeks earlier they had requested england to help them to seize and hold broughty castle though the regent may not have known that detail  the regent replied as became her and glencairn with erskine of dun wrecked the rich abbey of paisley  the brethren now broke the truce with a vengeance     chapter xii knox in the war of the congregation the regent attacked her death catholicism abolished 15591560   though the regent was now to be deposed and attacked by armed force knox tells us that there were dissensions among her enemies  some held that the queen was heavily done to and that the leaders sought another end than religion  consequently when the lords with their forces arrived at edinburgh on october 16 the local brethren showed a want of enthusiasm  the congregation nevertheless summoned the regent to depart from leith and on october 21 met at the tolbooth to discuss her formal deposition from office  willock moved that this might lawfully be done knox added with more reserve than usual that their hearts must not be withdrawn from their king and queen mary and francis  the regent too ought to be restored when she openly repented and submitted  willock dragged jehu into his sermon but knox does not appear to have remarked that francis and mary were ahab and jezebel idolaters  he was now in a position of less freedom and more responsibility than while he was a wandering prophet at large  on october 24 the congregation summoned leith having deposed the regent in the name of the king and queen francis and mary and of themselves as privy council  they did more  they caused one james cocky a gold worker to forge the great seal of francis and mary wherewith they sealed their pretended laws and ordinances tending to constrain the subjects of the kingdom to rebel and favour their usurpations  their proclamations with the forged seal they issued at st andrews glasgow linlithgow perth and elsewhere using this seal in their letters to noblemen who were ordered to obey arran  the gold worker whose name is variously spelled in the french record says that the device for the coins which the congregation meant to issue and ordered him to execute was on one side a cross with a crown of thorns on the other the words verbum dei  the artist cocky was dilatory and when the brethren were driven out of edinburgh he gave the dies unfinished to john achison the chief official of the mint who often executed coins of queen mary 158a  as professor hume brown says of the audacious statement of the brethren that they acted in the name of their king and queen their use of the forged royal seal as covering their action with an appearance of law served its purpose in their appeals to the people  cocky and kirkcaldy were hanged by morton in 1573  the idea of forging the great seal may have arisen in the fertile brain of lethington who about october 25 had at last deserted the regent and now took knoxs place as secretary of the congregation  henceforth their manifestoes say little about religion and a great deal about the french design to conquer scotland 158b  to the wit of lethington we may plausibly attribute a proposal which on october 25 knox submitted to croft 159  it was that england should lend 1000 men for the attack on the regent in leith  peace with france need not be broken for the men may come as private adventurers and england may denounce them as rebels  croft declined this proposal as dishonourable and as too clearly a breach of treaty  knox replied that he had communicated crofts letter to such as partly induced me before to write october 29  very probably lethington suggested the idea leaving the burden of its proposal on knox  dr mcrie says that it is a solitary case of the reformers recommending dissimulation but the proceeding was in keeping with knoxs previous statements about the nature of the terms made in july with the protestations of loyalty with the lie given to mary of guise when she spoke on the whole the plain truth and generally with the entire conduct of the prophet and of the congregation  dr mcrie justly remarks that knox found it difficult to preserve integrity and christian simplicity amidst the crooked wiles of political intrigue  on the behaviour of the godly heaven did not smilefor the moment scalingladders had been constructed in st giless church so that preaching was neglected  the preachers spared not openly to say that they feared the success of that enterprise should not be prosperous for this reason god could not suffer such contempt of his word    long to be unpunished  the duke lost heart the waged soldiers mutinied for lack of pay morton deserted the cause bothwell wounded ormiston as he carried money from croft and seized the cash 160abehaving treacherously if it be true that he was under promise not to act against the brethren  the french garrison of leith made successful sorties and despite the valour of arran and lord james and the counsel of lethington the godly fled from edinburgh on november 5 under taunts and stones cast by the people of the town  the fugitives never stopped till they reached stirling when knox preached to them  he lectured at great length on discomfitures of the godly in the old testament and about the benjamites and the levite and his wife  coming to practical politics he reminded his audience that after the accession of the hamiltons to their party there was nothing heard but this lord will bring these many hundred spears    if this earl be ours no man in such a district will trouble us  the duke ought to be ashamed of himself  before knox came to scotland we know he had warned the brethren against alliance with the hamiltons  the duke had been on the regents side yet without his assistance they could not have compelled us to appoint with the queen upon such unequal conditions in the treaty of july  so the terms were in favour of the regent after all is said and done 160b  god had let the brethren fall knox said into their present condition because they put their trust in manin the dukea noble whose repentance was very dubious  then knox rose to the height of the occasion  yea whatsoever becomes of us and our mortal carcases i doubt not but that this cause in despite of satan shall prevail in the realm of scotland  for as it is the eternal truth of the eternal god so shall it once prevail    here we have the actual genius of knox his tenacity his courage in an uphill game his faith which might move mountains  he adjured all to amendment of life prayer and charity  the minds of men began to be wonderfully erected  in arran and lord james too manifestly not jealous rivals randolph found more honour stoutness and courage than in all the rest november 3  already before the flight lethington was preparing to visit england the conduct of diplomacy with england was thus in capable hands and lethington was a persona grata to the english queen  meanwhile the victorious regent behaved with her wonted moderation  she pursueth no man that hath showed himself against her at this time  she pardoned all burgesses of edinburgh and was ready to receive the congregation to her grace if they would put away the traitor lethington balnaves and some others 161a  knox however says that she gave the houses of the most honest men to the french  the regent was now very ill graviter aegrotat say francis and mary dec 4 1559 161b  the truth is that the cause of knox far from being desperate as for an hour it seemed to the fainthearted had never looked so well  cecil and the english council saw that they were committed their gift of money was known they must bestir themselves  while they had nourished the garboil in scotland fanned the flame they professed to believe that france was aiming through scotland at england  they arranged for a large levy of forces at berwick they promised money without stint and cecil drew up the paper adopted as i conceive by the brethren in their latin appeal to all christian princes  the scots were to say that they originally took arms in defence of their native dynasty the hamiltons mary stuart having no heirs of her body and france intending to annex scotlandwhich was true enough but was not the cause of the rising at perth  that england is also aimed at is proved by the fact that mary and francis on the seal of scotland quarter the arms of england  knox himself had seen and had imparted the fact to cecil a jewel on which these fatal heraldic pretensions were made  the queen is governed by the new authority of the house of guise  in short elizabeth must be asked to intervene for these political reasons not in defence of the gospel and large preparations for armed action in scotland were instantly made  meanwhile cecils sketch of the proper manifesto for the congregation to make was embodied in lethingtons instructions november 24 from the congregation as well as adapted in their latin appeal to christian princes  we may suppose that a man of knoxs unbending honesty was glad to have thrown off his functions as secretary to the brethren  far from disclaiming their idolatrous king and queen the ideal policy they were issuing proclamations headed francis and mary and bearing the forged signet  examples with the seal were as late as 1652 in the possession of the erskine of dun of that day  in them francis and mary denounce the pope as antichrist  keith who wrote much later styles these proclamations pretty singular and knox must have been of the same opinion  after lethington took the office of secretary to the congregation knox had for some time no great public part in affairs  fife was invaded by these bloody worms as he calls the french and he preached what he tells us was a comfortable sermon to the brethren at cupar  but lethington had secured the english alliance lord grey was to lead 4000 foot and 2000 horse to the border lord winter with fourteen ship set sail and was incommoded by a storm in which vessels of delboeuf with french reinforcements for the regent were some lost some driven back to harbour  as in jacobite times french aid to the loyal party was always unfortunate and the arrival of winters english fleet in the forth caused doysel to retreat out of fife back to leith  he had nearly reached st andrews where knox dwelt in great agony of spirit  he had great need of a good horse probably because as in october 1559 money was offered for his head  but private assassination had no terrors for the reformer 163  knox as he wrote to a friend on january 29 1560 had forsaken all public assemblies and retired to a life of study because i am judged among ourselves too extreme  when the duke of norfolk with the english army was moving towards berwick where he was to make a league with the protestant nobles of scotland knox summoned chatelherault and the gentlemen of his party then in glasgow  they wished norfolk to come to them by carlisle a thing inconvenient to lord james  knox chid them sharply for sloth and want of wisdom and discretion praising highly the conduct of lord james  they had unreasonable minds  wise men do wonder what my lord dukes friends do mean that are so slack and backward in this cause  the duke did not however write to france with an offer of submission  that story ben trovato but not vero rests on a forgery by the regent 164  the fact is that the duke was not a true protestant his advisers including his brother the archbishop were catholics and the successes of doysel in winter had terrified him but seeing an english army at hand he assented to the league with england at berwick as second person of the realm of scotland february 27 1560 elizabeth accepted the realm of scotlandchatelherault being recognised as heirapparent to the throne thereoffor so long as the marriage of queen mary and francis i endured and a year later  the scots however remain dutiful subjects of queen mary they say except so far as lawless attempts to make scotland a province of france are concerned  chatelherault did not sign the league till may 10 with arran huntly morton at last committed to the cause and the usual leaders of the congregation  with the details of the siege of leith and with the attempts at negotiation we are not here concerned  france in fact was powerless to aid the regent  since the arrival of throckmorton in france as ambassador of england in the previous summer 1559 the huguenots had been conspiring  they were in touch with geneva in the east on the north in brittany they appear to have been stirred up by tremaine a cornish gentleman and emissary of cecil who joined throckmorton at blois in march 1560  stories were put about that the young french king was a leper and was kidnapping fairhaired children in whose blood he meant to bathe  the huguenots had been conspiring ever since september 1559 when they seem to have sent to elizabeth for aid in money 165a more recently they had held a kind of secret convention at nantes and summoned bands who were to lurk in the woods concentrate at amboise attack the chateau slay the guises and probably put the king and queen mary under the prince de conde who was by the plotters expected to take the part which arran played in scotland  it is far from certain that conde had accepted the position  in all this we may detect english intrigue and the gold of elizabeth  calvin had been consulted he disapproved of the method of the plot still more of the plot itself  but he knew all about it  all turns on killing antonius he wrote antonius being either the cardinal or the duc de guise 165b  the conspiracy failed at amboise on march 1719 1560  throckmorton was present and describes the panic and perplexity of the court while he eagerly asks to be promptly and secretly recalled as suspicion has fallen on himself  he sent tremaine home through brittany where he gathered proposals for betraying french towns to elizabeth rather prematurely  surrounded by treachery and destitute of funds the guises could not aid the regent and throckmorton kept advising cecil to strike while the iron was hot and paralyse french designs  the dying regent of scotland never lost heart in circumstances so desperate  even before the outbreak at perth mary of guise had been in very bad health  when the english crossed the border to beleaguer leith lord erskine who had maintained neutrality in edinburgh castle allowed her to come there to die april 1 1560  on april 29 from the castle of edinburgh she wrote a letter to doysel commanding in leith  she told him that she was suffering from dropsy one of her legs begins to swell     you know there are but three days for the dropsy in this country  the letter was intercepted by her enemies and deciphered 166a  on may 7 the english and scots made an assault and were beaten back with loss of 1000 men  according to knox the french stripped the fallen and allowed the white carcases to lie under the wall as also happened in 1746 after the english defeat at falkirk  the regent saw them knox says from the castle and said they were a fair tapestry  her words were heard of some and carried to knox who from the pulpit predicted that god should revenge that contumely done to his image    even in such as rejoiced thereat  and the very experience declared that he was not deceived for within few days thereafter yea some say that same day began her belly and loathsome legs to swell and so continued till that god did execute his judgments upon her 166b  knox wrote thus on may 16 1566 167a  he was a little irritated at that time by queen marys triumph over his friends the murderers of riccio and his own hasty flight from edinburgh to kyle  this may excuse the somewhat unusual and even unbecoming nature of his language concerning the dying lady but his memory was quite wrong about his prophecy  the symptoms of the regents malady had begun more than a week before the angloscottish defeat at leith and the nature of her complaint ought to have been known to the prophets party as her letter describing her condition had been intercepted and deciphered  but the deciphering may have been done in england which would cause delay  we cannot of course prove that knox was informed as to the regents malady before he prophesied if so he had forgotten the fact before he wrote as he did in 1566  but the circumstances fail to demonstrate that he had a supernormal premonition or drew a correct deduction from scripture and make it certain that the regent did not fall ill after his prophecy  the regent died on june 11 halfanhour after the midnight of june 10  a report was written on june 13 from edinburgh castle to the cardinal of lorraine by captain james cullen who some twelve years later was hanged by the regent morton  he says that since june 7 lord james and argyll marischal and glencairn had assiduously attended on the dying lady  two hours before her death she spoke apart for a whole hour with lord james chatelherault had seen her twice and arran once 167b  knox mentions the visits of these lords and says that doysel was forbidden to speak with her belike she would have bidden him farewell for auld familiarity was great  according to knox the regent admitted the errors of her policy attributing it to huntly who had deserted her and to the wicked counsel of her friends that is her brothers  at the request of the lords she saw willock and said as she naturally would that there was no salvation but in and by the death of jesus christ  she was compelled    to approve the chief head of our religion wherein we dissent from all papists and popery  knox had strange ideas about the creed which he opposed  of any virtue that ever was espied in king james v whose daughter she mary stuart is called to this hour 1566 we have seen no sparkle to appear 168  with this final fling at the chastity of mary of guise the reformer takes leave of the woman whom he so bitterly hated  yet knox was not given to the practice so common in his day of assassinating reputations by vile insinuations  posterity has not accepted contemporary english historians did not accept knoxs picture of mary of guise as the wanton widow the spawn of the serpent who desired to cut the throat of every protestant in scotland  she was placed by circumstances in a position from which there was no issue  the fatal french marriage of her daughter was a natural step at a moment when scottish independence could only be maintained by help of france  had she left the regency in the hands of chatelherault that is of archbishop hamilton the prelate was not the man to put down protestantism by persecution and so save the situation if he had been mary of guise was not the woman to abet him in drastic violence  the nobles would have revolted against the feeble duke 169  on july 6 the treaty of edinburgh was concluded by representatives of england cecil was one and of france  the reformers carried a point of essential importance the very point which knox told croft had been secured by the appointment of july 1559  all french forces were to be dismissed the country except one hundred and twenty men occupying dunbar and inchkeith in the firth of forth  a clause by which cecil thought he had secured the kernel for england and left the shell to france a clause recognising the rightfulness of elizabeths alliance with the rebels afforded mary stuart ground or excuse for never ratifying the treaty  it is needless here to discuss the questionwas the convention of estates held after the treaty in august a lawful parliament  there was doubt enough at least to make protestants feel uneasy about the security of the religious settlement achieved by the convention randolph the english resident foresaw that the acts might be rescinded  before the convention of estates met a thanksgiving day was held by the brethren in st giless and knox if he was the author of the address to the deity said with scientific precision neither in us nor yet in our confederates was there any cause why thou shouldst have given unto us so joyful and sudden a deliverance for neither of us both ceased to do wickedly even in the midst of our greatest troubles  elizabeth had lied throughout with all her natural and cultivated gift of falsehood of the veracity of the brethren several instances have been furnished  ministers were next appointed to churches knox taking edinburgh while superintendents who were by no means bishops were appointed one to each province  erskine of dun a layman was superintendent of angus  a new anticatholic kirk was thus set up on july 20 before the convention met and swept away catholicism 170  knox preached vigorously on the prophet haggeus meanwhile and some namely lethington speaker in the convention said in mockage we must now forget ourselves and bear the barrow to build the houses of god  the unawakened lethington and the gentry at large merely dilapidated the houses of god so that they became unsafe as well as odiously squalid  that such fervent piety should grudge repairs of church buildings many of them in a wretched state already is a fact creditable rather to the thrift than to the state of grace of the reformers  after all their protestations full of texts the lords and lairds starved their preachers but provided by roofless aisles and unglazed windows for the ventilation of the kirks these men so bubbling over with gospel fervour were in short when it came to practice traitors and hypocrites nor did knox spare their unseemly avarice  the cause of the poor and of the preachers lay near his heart and no man was more insensible of the temptations of wealth  lethington did not address the parliament as speaker till august 9  never had such a parliament met in scotland  one hundred and six barons not of the higher order assembled in 1567 when mary was a prisoner and the regent moray held the assembly not nearly so many came together nor on any later occasion at this period  the newcomers claimed to sit as of old custom it was a custom long disused and not now restored to vitality  a supplication was presented by the barons gentlemen burgesses and others to the nobility and estates of whom they do not seem to reckon themselves part contrasting themselves with yourselves  they reminded the estates how they had asked the regent for freedom and liberty of conscience with a godly reformation of abuses  they now by way of freedom of conscience ask that catholic doctrine be abolished by act of this parliament and punishment appointed for the transgressors the man of sin has been distributing the whole patrimony of the church so that the trew ministers the schools and the poor are kept out of their own  the actual clergy are all thieves and murderers and rebels to the lawful authority of emperors kings and princes  against these charges murder rebellion profligacy they must answer now or be so reputed  in fact it was the nobles rather than the pope who had been robbing the kirk education and the poor which they continued to do as knox attests  but as to doctrine the barons and ministers were asked to lay a confession before the house 172  it will be observed that in the petition emperors kings and princes have lawful authority over the clergy  but that doctrine assumes tacitly that such rulers are of knoxs own opinions the kirk later resolutely stood up against kings like james vi charles i and charles ii  the confession was drawn up presented and ratified in a very few days it was compiled in four  the huguenots in paris in 1559 established a record by drawing up a confession containing eighty articles in three days  knox and his coadjutors were relatively deliberate  they aver that all points of belief necessary for salvation are contained in the canonical books of the bible  their interpretation pertains to no man or church but solely to the spreit of god  that spreit must have illuminated the kirk as it then existed in scotland for we dare not receive and admit any interpretation which directly repugns to any principal point of our faith to any other plain text of scripture or yet unto the rule of charity  as we the preachers of the kirk then extant were apostate monks or priests or artisans about a dozen of us in scotland mankind could not be expected to regard our interpretation our faith as infallible the framers of the confession did not pretend that it was infallible they request that if any man will note in this our confession any article or sentence repugning to gods holy word he will favour them with his criticism in writing  as knox had announced six years earlier that as touching the chief points of religion i neither will give place to man or angel    teaching the contrair to that which ye have heard a controversialist who thought it worth while to criticise the confession must have deemed himself at least an archangel  two years later written criticism was offered as we shall see with a demand for a written reply  the critic escaped arrest by a lucky accident  the confession with practically no criticism or opposition was passed en bloc on august 17  the evangel is candidly stated to be death to the sons of perdition but the confession is offered hopefully to weak and infirm brethren  not to enter into the higher theology we learn that the sacraments can only be administered by lawful ministers  we learn that they are such as are appointed to the preaching of the word or into whose mouth god has put some sermon of exhortation and who are lawfully chosen thereto by some kirk  later we find that rather more than this and rather more than some of the trew ministeris then had is required  as the document reaches us it appears to have been mitigated by lethington and wynram the vicar of bray of the reformation  they altered according to the english resident randolph many words and sentences which sounded to proceed rather of some evil conceived opinion than of any sound judgment  as lethington certainly was not a lawful minister it is surprising if knox yielded to his criticism  lethington and wynram also advised that the chapter on obedience to the sovereign power should be omitted as an unfit matter to be treated at this time when it was not very obvious who the magistrate or authority might be  in this sense randolph arrans english friend wrote to cecil 174a  the chapter however was left standing  the sovereign whether in empire kingdom duke prince or in free cities was accepted as of gods holy ordinance  to him chiefly pertains the reformation of the religion which includes the suppression of idolatry and superstition and catholicism we know is idolatry  superstition is less easily defined but we cannot doubt that in knoxs mind the english liturgy was superstitious 174b  to resist the supreme power doing that which pertains to his charge that is suppressing catholicism and superstition among other things is to resist god  it thus appears that the sovereign is not so supreme but that he must be disobeyed when his mandates clash with the doctrine of the kirk  thus the magistrate or authoritythe state in factis limited by the conscience of the kirk which may if it pleases detect idolatry or superstition in some act of secular policy  from this theory of the kirk arose more than a century of unrest  on august 24 the practical consequences of the confession were set forth in an act by which all hearers or celebrants of the mass are doomed for the first offence to mere confiscation of all their goods and to corporal punishment exile rewards a repetition of the offence the third is punished by death  freedom from a persecuting spirit is one of the noblest features of knoxs character says laing neither led away by enthusiasm nor party feelings nor success to retaliate the oppressions and atrocities that disgraced the adherents of popery 174c  this is an amazing remark  though we do not know that knox was ever accessory to the death of a single individual for his religious opinions we do know that he had not the chance the government at most and years later put one priest to death  but knox always insisted vainly that idolaters must die the death  to the carnal mind these rules appear to savour of harshness  the carnal mind would not gather exactly what the new penal laws were if it confined its study to the learned dr mcries life of knox  this erudite man a pillar of the early free kirk mildly remarks the parliament    prohibited under certain penalties the celebration of the mass  he leaves his readers to discover in the acts of parliament and in knox what the certain penalties were 175  the act seems as knox says about the decrees of massacre in deuteronomy rather to be written in a rage than in a spirit of wisdom  the majority of the human beings then in scotland probably never had the dispute between the old and new faiths placed before them lucidly and impartially  very many of them had never heard the ideas of geneva stated at all  so late as 1596 writes dr hay fleming there were above four hundred parishes not reckoning argyll and the isles which still lacked ministers  the rarity of learned and godly men of his own persuasion is regretted by knox in the book of discipline  yet catholics thus destitute of opportunity to know and recognise the truth are threatened with confiscation exile and death if they cling to the only creed which they have been taughtafter august 17 1560  the death penalty was threatened often by scots acts for trifles  in this case the graduated scale of punishment shows that the threat is serious  this act sounds insane but the convention was wise in its generation had it merely abolished the persecuting laws of the church scotland might never have been protestant  the old faith is infinitely more attractive to mankind than the new presbyterian verity  a thing of slow and long evolution the church had assimilated and hallowed the worldold festivals of the years changing seasons  she provided for the human love of recreation  her sundays were holidays not composed of gloomy hours in stuffy or draughty kirks under the current voice of the preacher  her confessional enabled the burdened soul to lay down its weight in sacred privacy her music her ceremonies the dim religious light of her fanes naturally awaken religious emotion  while these things with the native tendency to resist authority of any kind appealed to the multitude the position of the church in later years recommended itself to many educated men in scotland as more logical than that of knox and convert after convert in the noble class slipped over to rome  the missionaries of the counterreformation but for the persecuting act would have arrived in a scotland which did not persecute and the work of the convention of 1560 might all have been undone had not the stringent act been passed  that act apparently did not go so far as the preachers desired  thus archbishop hamilton writing to archbishop beaton in paris the day after the passing of the act says all these new preachers openly persuade the nobility in the pulpit to put violent hands and slay all churchmen that will not concur and adopt their opinion  they only reproach my lord duke the archbishops brother that he will not begin first and either cause me to do as they do or else to use rigour on me by slaughter sword or at least perpetual prison 177a  it is probable that the archbishop was well informed as to what the bigots were saying though he is not likely to have sat under them moreover he would hear of their advice from his brother the duke with whom he had just held a long conference 177b  lesley bishop of ross in his history praises the humanity of the nobles for at this time few catholics were banished fewer were imprisoned and none were executed  the nobles interfering the threatened capital punishment was not carried out  mob violence oppression by protestant landlords kirk censure imprisonment fine and exile did their work in suppressing idolatry and promoting hypocrisy  no doubt this grinding ceaseless daily process of enforcing truth did not go far enough for the great body of the brethren especially the godly burgesses of the towns indeed as early as june 10 1560 the provost bailies and town council of edinburgh proclaimed that idolaters must instantly and publicly profess their conversion before the ministers and elders on the penalty of the pillory for the first offence banishment from the town for the second and death for the third 177c  it must always be remembered that the threat of the death penalty often meant in practice very little  it was denounced under mary of guise february 9 1559 against men who bullied priests disturbed services and ate meat in lent  it was denounced against shooters of wild fowl and against those of either religious party who broke the proclamation of october 1561  yet nobody seemed one penny the worse as regards their lives though the punishments of fining and banishing were on occasions enforced against catholics  we may marvel that in the beginning catholic martyrs did not present themselves in crowds to the executioner  but even under the rule of rome it would not be easy to find thirty cases of martyrs burned at the stake by the bloudie bishops between the fifteenth century and the martyrdom of myln  by 1560 the old church was in such a hideous declinewith ruffianly men of quality in high spiritual places with priests who did not attend mass and in many cases could not read with churches left to go to ruin with license so notable that in one foundation the priest is only forbidden to keep a constant concubinethat faith had waxed cold and no catholic felt ripe for martyrdom  the elements of a league as in france did not exist  there was no fervently catholic town population like that of paris no popular noble warriors like the ducs de guise to act as leaders  thus scotland in this age ran little risk of a religious civil war  no organised and armed faction existed to face the congregation  when the counterreformation set in many catholics endured fines and exile with constancy  the theology of the confession of faith is of course calvinistic  no works are technically good which are not the work of the spirit of our lord dwelling in our hearts by faith  idolaters and wicked people not having that spirit can do no good works  the blasphemy that men who live according to equity and justice shall be saved what religion soever they have professed is to be abhorred  the kirk is invisible consisting of the elect who are known only to god  this gave much cause of controversy to knoxs catholic opponents  the notes of the true church are those of calvins  as to the sacrament though the elements be not the natural body of christ yet the faithful in the right use of the lords table so do eat the body and drink the blood of the lord jesus that he remains in them and they in him    in such conjunction with christ jesus as the natural man cannot comprehend  this is a highly sacramental and confessedly mystical doctrine not less unintelligible to the natural man than the catholic theory which knox so strongly reprobated  alas that men called christian have shed seas of blood over the precise sense of that touching command of our lord which though admitted to be incomprehensible they have yet endeavoured to comprehend and define  a serious task for knox was to draw up with others a book of the policy and discipline of the kirk a task entrusted to them in april 1560  in politics till january 1561 the lords hoped that they might induce elizabeth then entangled with leicester as knox knew to marry arran but whether glycerium as bishop jewel calls her had already detected in the saucy youth a half crazy fool as mr froude says or not she firmly refused  she much preferred lord robert dudley whose wife had just then broken her neck  the unfortunate arran had fought resolutely knox tells us by the side of lord james in the winter of 1559 but he already in 1560 showed strange moods and later fell into sheer lunacy  in december died the young king of france husband to our jezebelunhappy francis    he suddenly perished of a rotten ear    in that deaf ear that never would hear the truth of god december 5 1560  we have little of knoxs poetry but he probably composed a translation in verse of a latin poem indited by one of the godly in france whence he borrowed his phrase a rotten ear aure putrefacta corruit     last francis that unhappy child       his fathers footsteps following plain    to christs crying deaf ears did yield       a rotten ear was then his bane  the version is wonderfully close to the original latin  meanwhile francis was hardly cold before arran wooed his idolatrous widow queen mary with a gay gold ring  she did not respond favourably and the earl bare it heavily in his heart and more heavily than many would have wissed says knox with whom arran was on very confidential terms  knox does not rebuke his passion for jezebel  he himself was in no small heaviness by reason of the late death of his dear bedfellow marjorie bowes of whom we know very little except that she worked hard to lighten the labours of knoxs vast correspondence  he had as he says great intelligence both with the churches and some of the court of france and was the first to receive news of the perilous illness of the young king  he carried the tidings to the duke and lord james at the hamilton house near kirk o field but would not name his informant  then came the news of the kings death from lord grey de wilton at berwick and a convention of the nobles was proclaimed for january 15 1561 to peruse newly over again the book of discipline     chapter xiii knox and the book of discipline   this book of discipline containing the model of the kirk had been seen by randolph in august 1560 and he observed that its framers would not come into ecclesiastical conformity with england  they were severe in that they profess and loth to remit anything of that they have received  as the difference between the genevan and anglican models contributed so greatly to the civil war under charles i the results may be regretted anglicans by 1643 were looked on as baal worshippers by the precise scots  in february 1561 randolph still thought that the book of discipline was rather in advance of what fallen human nature could endure  idolatry of course was to be removed universally thus the queen when she arrived was constantly insulted about her religion  the lawful calling of ministers was explained we have already seen that a lawful minister is a preacher who can get a local set of men to recognise him as such  knox however before his return to scotland had advised the brethren to be very careful in examining preachers before accepting them  the people and every several congregation have a right to elect their minister and if they do not do so in six weeks the superintendent a migratory official in some ways superior to the clergy but subject to periodical trial by the assembly who very soon became extinct with his council presents a man who is to be examined by persons of sound judgment and next by the ministers and elders of the kirk  nobody is to be violently intrused on any congregation  nothing is said about an university training moral character is closely scrutinised  on the admission of a new minister some other ministers should preach touching the obedience which the kirk owe to their ministers     the people should be exhorted to reverence and honour their chosen ministers as the servants and ambassadors of the lord jesus obeying the commandments which they speak from gods mouth and book even as they would obey god himself     182  the practical result of this claim on the part of the preachers to implicit obedience was more than a century of turmoil civil war revolution and reaction  the ministers constantly preached political sermons and the statethe king and his adviserswas perpetually arraigned by them  to reject them and despise their ministry and exhortation as when catholics were not put to death on their instance was to reject and despise our lord  if accused of libel or treasonous libel or leasing making in their sermons they demanded to be judged by their brethren  their brethren acquitting them where was there any other judicature  these pretensions with the right to inflict excommunication in later practice to be followed by actual outlawry were made we saw when there were not a dozen true ministers in the nascent kirk and of course the claims became more exorbitant when true ministers were reckoned by hundreds  no state could submit to such a clerical tyranny  people who only know modern presbyterianism have no idea of the despotism which the fathers of the kirk tried for more than a century to enforce the preachers sat in the seats of the apostles they had the gift of the keys the power to bind and loose  yet the book of discipline permits no other ceremony at the induction of these mystically gifted men than the public approbation of the people and declaration of the chief ministerlater there was no chief minister there was parity of ministers  any other ceremony we cannot approve for albeit the apostles used the imposition of hands yet seeing the miracle is ceased the using of the ceremony we judge it not necessary  the miracle had not ceased if it was true that the commandments issued in sermonspolitical sermons oftenreally deserved to be obeyed as men would obey god himself  cest la le miracle  there could be no more amazing miracle than the infallibility of preachers  the imposition of hands was twelve years later restored but as far as infallible sermons were concerned the state agreed with knox that the miracle had ceased  the political sermons are sometimes justified by the analogy of modern discussion in the press  but leading articles do not pretend to be infallible and editors do not assert a right to be obeyed by men even as they would obey god himself  the preachers were often right often wrong their sermons were good or were silly but what no state could endure was the claim of preachers to implicit obedience  the difficulty in finding really qualified ministers must be met by fervent prayer and by compulsion on the part of the estates of parliament  failing ministers readers capable of reading the common prayers presently it was knoxs book of these and the bible must be found they may later be promoted to the ministry  stationary ministers are to receive less sustenance than the migratory superintendents the sons of the preachers must be educated the daughters honestly dowered  the payment is mainly in bolls of meal and malt  the state of the poor fearful and horrible to say is one of universal contempt  provision must be made for the aged and weak superintendents after election are to be examined by all the ministers of the province and by three or more superintendents  other ceremonies we cannot allow  in 1581 a scottish catholic burne averred that willock objected to ceremonies of ordination because people would say if these are necessary what minister ordained you  the query was hard to answer so ceremonies of ordination could not be allowed  the story was told to burne he says by an eyewitness who heard willock  every church must have a schoolmaster who ought to be able to teach grammar and latin  education should be universal poor children of ability must be enabled to pass on to the universities through secondary schools  at st andrews the three colleges were to have separate functions not clashing and culminating in divinity  whence are the funds to be obtained  here the authors bid your honours have respect to your poor brethren the labourers of the ground who by these cruel beasts the papists have been so oppressed      they ought only to pay reasonable teinds that they may feel some benefit of christ jesus now preached unto them  with grief of heart we hear that some gentlemen are now as cruel over their tenants as ever were the papists requiring of them whatsoever they paid to the church so that the papistical tyranny shall only be changed into the tyranny of the landlord or laird  every man should have his own teinds or tithes whereas in fact the great lay holders of tithes took them off other mens lands a practice leading to many bloodfeuds  the attempt of charles i to let every man have his own tithes and to provide the preachers with a living wage was one of the causes of the distrust of the king which culminated in the great civil war  but knox could not recover for the church her liberty and freedom and that only for relief of the poor  we speak not for ourselves the book says but in favour of the poor and the labourers defrauded     the church is only bound to sustain and nourish her charges    to wit the ministers of the kirk the poor and the teachers of youth  the funds must be taken out of the tithes the chantries colleges chaplainries and the temporalities of bishops deans and cathedrals generally  the ministers are to have their manses and glebes of six acres to this many of the lords assented except oddly enough those redoubtable leaders of the congregation glencairn and morton with marischal  all the part of the book which most commands our sympathy the most christian part of the book regulating the disposition of the revenues of the fallen church for the good of the poor of education and of the kirk remained a dead letter  the duke arran lord james and a few barons including the ruffian andrew ker of faldonside with glencairn and ochiltree signed it in token of approval but little came of it all lethington probably was the scoffer who styled these provisions devout imaginations  the nobles and lairds many of them were converted in matter of doctrine in conduct they were the most avaricious bloody and treacherous of all the generations which had banded revelled robbed and betrayed in scotland  there is a point in this matter of the kirks claim to the patrimony of the old church which perhaps is generally misunderstood  that point is luminous as regards the absolute disinterestedness of knox and his companions both in respect to themselves and their fellowpreachers  the book of discipline contains a sentence already quoted conceived in what we may justly style a chivalrous contempt of wealth  your honours may easily understand that we speak not now for ourselves but in favour of the poor and the labourers defrauded      not having observed a point which their honours were not the men to understand easily father pollen writes the new preachers were loudly claiming for themselves the property of the rivals whom they had displaced 186 for themselves they were claiming a few merks and a few bolls of meal a decent subsistence  mr taylor innes points out that when just before darnleys murder mary offered a considerable sum for the maintenance of the ministers knox and others said that for their sustentation they craved of the auditors the things that were necessary as of duty the pastors might justly crave of their flock  the general assembly accepted the queens gift but only of necessity it was by their flock that they ought to be sustained  to take from others contrary to their will whom they serve not they judge it not their duty nor yet reasonable  among other things the preachers who were left with a hard struggle for bare existence introduced a rule of honour scarcely known to the barons and nobles except to the bold buccleuch who rejected an english pension from henry viii with a sympathetic explosion of strong language  the preachers would not take gifts from england even when offered by the supporters of their own line of policy  knoxs failure in his admirable attempt to secure the wealth of the old church for national purposes was as it happened the secular salvation of the kirk  neither catholicism nor anglicanism could be fully introduced while the barons and nobles held the tithes and lands of the ancient church  possessing the wealth necessary to a catholic or anglican establishment they were resolutely determined to cling to it and oppose any church except that which they starved  the bishops of james i charles i and charles ii were detested by the nobles  rarely from them came any lordly gifts to learning and the universities while from the honourably poor ministers such gifts could not come  the universities were founded by prelates of the old church doing their duty with their wealth  the arrangements for discipline were of the drastic nature which lingered into the days of burns and later  the results may be studied in the records of kirk sessions we have no reason to suppose that sexual morality was at all improved on the whole by discipline though it was easier to enforce sabbath observance  a graduated scale of admonitions led up to excommunication if the subject was refractory and to boycotting with civil penalties  the processes had no effect or none that is visible in checking lawlessness robbery feuds and manslayings and after the reformation witchcraft increased to monstrous proportions at least executions of people accused of witchcraft became very numerous in spite of provision for sermons thrice a week and for weekly discussions of the word  the book of discipline modelled on the genevan scheme and on that of alasco for his london congregation rather reminds us of the laws of plato  it was a well meant but impracticable ideal set before the country and was least successful where it best deserved success  it certainly secured a thoroughly moral clergy till some twelve years later the nobles again thrust licentious and murderous cadets into the best livings and the bastard bishoprics before and during the regency of morton  their example did not affect the genuine ministers frugal god fearing men     chapter xiv knox and queen mary 1561   in discussing the book of discipline that great constructive effort towards the remaking of scotland we left knox at the time of the death of his first wife  on december 20 1560 he was one of some six ministers who with more numerous lay representatives of districts sat in the first general assembly  they selected some new preachers and decided that the church of restalrig should be destroyed as a monument of idolatry  a fragment of it is standing yet enclosing tombs of the wild logans of restalrig  the assembly passed an act against lawless love and invited the estates and privy council to use sharp punishment against some idolaters including eglintoun cassilis and quentin kennedy abbot of crosraguel who disputed later against knox the laird of gala a scott and others  in january 1561 a convention of nobles and lairds at edinburgh perused the book of discipline and some signed it platonically while there was a dispute between the preachers and certain catholics including lesley later bishop of ross an historian but no better than a shifty and dangerous partisan of mary stuart  the lord james was selected as an envoy to mary in france  he was bidden to refuse her even the private performance of the rites of her faith but declined to go to that extremity the question smouldered through five years  randolph expected a mad world on marys return he was not disappointed  meanwhile the catholic earls of the north of whom huntly was the fickle leader with bothwell come to work what mischief he can are accused by knox of a design to seize edinburgh before the parliament in may 1561  nothing was done but there was a very violent robin hood riot the magistrates were besieged and bullied knox declined to ask for the pardon of the brawlers and after excursions and alarms the whole multitude was excommunicate until they appeased the kirk  they may have borne the spiritual censure very unconcernedly  the catholic earls now sent lesley to get marys ear before the lord james could reach her  lesley arrived on april 14 with the offer to raise 20000 men if mary would land in huntlys region  they would restore the mass in their bounds and mary would be convoyed by captain cullen a kinsman of huntly and already mentioned as the captain of the guards after riccios murder  it is said by lesley that mary had received from the regent her mother a description of the nobles of scotland  if so she knew huntly for the ambitious traitor he was a man peculiarly perfidious and selfseeking with a son who might be thrust on her as a husband if once she were in huntlys hands  the queen knew that he had forsaken her mothers cause knew perhaps of his old attempt to betray scotland to england and she was aware that no northern earl had raised his banner to defend the church  she therefore came to no agreement with lesley but confided more in the lord james who arrived on the following day  mary knew her brothers character fairly well and if lesley says with truth that he now asked for and was promised the earldom of moray the omen was evil for huntly who practically held the lands 191a  a bargain on this showing was initiated  lord james was to have the earldom and he got it mary was to have his support  much has been said about lord jamess betrayal to throckmorton of marys intentions as revealed by her to himself  but what lord james said to throckmorton amounts to very little  i am not certain that both in paris with throckmorton and in london with elizabeth and cecil he did not moot his plan for friendship between mary and elizabeth and elizabeths recognition of marys rights as her heir 191b  lord james proposed all this to elizabeth in a letter of august 6 1561 191c  he had certainly discussed this admirable scheme with lord robert dudley at court in may 1561 on his return from france 191d  nothing could be more statesmanlike and less treacherous  meanwhile may 27 1561 the brethren presented a supplication to the parliament with clauses which if conceded would have secured the stipends of the preachers  the prayers were granted in promise and a great deal of church wrecking was conscientiously done the lord james on his return paid particular attention to idolatry in his hoped for earldom but the preachers were not better paid  meanwhile the protestants looked forward to the queens arrival with great searchings of heart  she had not ratified the treaty of leith but already cardinal guise hoped that she and elizabeth would live in concord and heard that mary ceded all claims to the english throne in return for elizabeths promise to declare her the heir if she herself died childless august 21 192  knox who had not loved mary of guise was not likely to think well of her daughter  mary again knew knox as the chief agitator in the tumults that embittered her mothers last year and shortened her life in france she had threatened to deal with him severely ignorant of his power and her own weakness  she could not be aware that knox had suggested to cecil opposition to her succession to the throne on the ground of her sex  knox uttered his forebodings of the queens future they were as veracious as if he had really been a prophet  but he was to an extent which can only be guessed one of the causes of the fulfilment of his own predictions  to attack publicly from the pulpit the creed and conduct of a girl of spirit to provoke cruel insults to her priests whom she could not defend was apt to cause at last in great measure that wild revolt of temper which drove mary to her doom her health suffered frequently from the attempt to bear with a smiling face such insults as no european princess least of all elizabeth would have endured for an hour  there is a limit to patience and before mary passed that limit randolph and lethington saw and feebly deplored the amenities of the preacher whom men permitted to rule the roast  ten thousand swords do not leap from their scabbards to protect either the girl mary stuart or the woman marie antoinette  not that natural indignation was dead but it ended in words  people said the queens mass and her priests will we maintain this hand and this rapier will fight in their defence  so men bragged as knox reports 193a but when after marys arrival priests were beaten or pilloried not a hand stirred to defend them not a rapier was drawn  the queen might be as safely as she was deeply insulted through her faith she was not at this time devoutly ardent in her creed though she often professed her resolution to abide in it  gentleness might conceivably have led her even to adopt the anglican faith or so it was deemed by some observers but insolence and outrage had another effect on her temper  mary landed at leith in a thick fog on august 19 1561  she was now in a country where she lay under sentence of death as an idolater  her continued existence was illegal  with her came mary seton mary beaton mary livingstone and mary fleming the comrades of her childhood and her uncles the duc daumale francis de lorraine and the noisy marquis delboeuf  she was not very welcome  as late as august 9 randolph reports that her brother lord james lethington and morton wish as you do she might be stayed yet for a space and if it were not for their obedience sake some of them care not though they never see her face 193b  none the less on june 8 lord james tells mary that he had given orders for her palace to be prepared by the end of july  he informs her that many hope that she will never come home  nothing is so necessary    as your majestys own presence and he hopes she will arrive punctually  if she cannot come she should send her commission to some of her protestant advisers by no means including the archbishop of st andrews hamilton with whom he will never work  it is not easy to see why lord james should have wished that mary might be stayed unless he merely dreaded her arrival while elizabeth was in a bad temper  his letter to elizabeth of august 6 is incompatible with treachery on his part  mr knox is determined to abide the uttermost and others will not leave him till god have taken his life and theirs together  of what were these heroes afraid  a familiar a witch of lady huntlys predicted that the queen would never arrive  if false i would she were burned for a witch adds honest randolph  lethington deemed his own danger not least  two galleys full of ladies are not so alarming did these men practically hinting that english ships should stop their queen think that the catholics in scotland were too strong for them  not a noble was present to meet mary when in the fog and filth of leith she touched scottish soil except her natural brother lord robert 194 the rest soon gathered with faces of welcome  she met some robin hood rioters who lay under the law and pardoned these roisterers with their excommunication could she interfere because says knox she was instructed that they had acted in despite of the religion  their festival had been forbidden under the older religion as it happens in 1555 and was again forbidden later by mary herself  all was mirth till sunday when the queens french priest celebrated mass in her own chapel before herself her three uncles and montrose  the godly called for the priests blood but lord james kept the door and his brothers protected the priest  disappointed of blood the godly departed with great grief of heart collecting in crowds round holyrood in the afternoon  next day the council proclaimed that till the estates assembled and deliberated no innovation should be made in the religion publicly and universally standing  the queens servants and others from france must not be molestedon pain of death the usual empty threat  they were assaulted and nobody was punished for the offence arran alone made a protest probably written by knox  who but knox could have written that the mass is much more abominable and odious in the sight of god than murder  many an honest brother was conspicuously of the opinion which arrans protest assigned to omnipotence  next sunday knox thundered and later regretted that i did not that i might have done caused an armed struggle    for god had given unto me credit with many who would have put into execution gods judgments if i would only have consented thereto  mary might have gone the way of jezebel and athaliah but for the mistaken lenity of knox who later asked gods mercy for not being more vehement  in fact he rather worked to slokin that fervency 195  let us hope that he is forgiven especially as randolph reports him extremely vehement in the pulpit  his repentance was publicly expressed shortly before the murder of riccio in december 1565 probably when the kirk ordered the weeks fast that as it chanced heralded riccios doom  privately to cecil on october 7 1561 he uttered his regret that he had been so deficient in zeal cecil had been recommending moderation 196  on august 26 randolph after describing the intimidation of the priest says john knox thundereth out of the pulpit so that i fear nothing so much as that one day he will mar all  he ruleth the roast and of him all men stand in fear  in public at least he did not allay the wrath of the brethren  on august 26 or on september 2 knox had an interview with the queen and made her weep  randolph doubted whether this was from anger or from grief  knox gives marys observations in the briefest summary his own at great length so that it is not easy to know how their reasoning really sped  her charges were his authorship of the monstrous regiment of women that he caused great sedition and slaughter in england and that he was accused of doing what he did by necromancy  the rest is summed up in c  he stood to his guns about the monstrous regiment and generally took the line that he merely preached against the vanity of the papistical religion and the deceit pride and tyranny of that roman antichrist if one wishes to convert a young princess bred in the catholic faith it is not judicious to begin by abusing the pope  this too much resembles the arbitrary and violent method of peter in the tale of a tub by dr jonathan swift such however was the method of knox  mary asking if he denied her just authority knox said that he was as well content to live under her as paul under nero  this again can hardly be called an agreeable historical parallel  knox hoped that he would not hurt her or her authority so long as ye defile not your hands with the blood of the saints of god as if mary was panting to distinguish herself in that way  his hope was unfulfilled  no saints suffered but he ceased not to trouble  knox also said that if he had wanted to trouble your estate because you are a woman i might have chosen a time more convenient for that purpose than i can do now when your own presence is in the realm  he had in fact chosen the convenient time in his letter to cecil already quoted july 19 1559 but he had not succeeded in his plan  he said that nobody could prove that the question of discarding mary on the ground of her sex was at any time moved in public or in secret  nobody could prove it for nobody could publish his letter to cecil  probably he had this in his mind  he did not say that the thing had not happened only that he was assured that neither protestant nor papist shall be able to prove that any such question was at any time moved either in public or in secret 197  he denied that he had caused sedition in england nor do we know what mary meant by this charge  his appeals from abroad to a phinehas or jehu had not been answered  as to magic he always preached against the practice  mary then said that knox persuaded the people to use religion not allowed by their princes  he justified himself by biblical precedents to which she replied that daniel and abraham did not resort to the sword  they had not the chance he answered adding that subjects might resist a prince who exceeded his bounds as sons may confine a maniac father  the queen was long silent and then said i perceive my subjects shall obey you and not me  knox said that all should be subject unto god and his church and mary frankly replied i will defend the church of rome for i think that it is the true church of god  she could not defend it knox answered with his wonted urbanity that the church of rome was a harlot addicted to all kinds of fornication  he was so accustomed to this sort of rhetoric that he did not deem it out of place on this occasion  his admirers familiar with his style forget its necessary effect on a young princess unpersuaded as lethington put it  mary said that her conscience was otherwise minded but knox knew that all consciences of man or angel were wrong which did not agree with his own  the queen had to confess that in argument as to the unscriptural character of the mass he was owre sair for her  he said that he wished she would hear the matter reasoned to the end  she may have desired that very thing ye may get that sooner than ye believe she said but knox expressed his disbelief that he would ever get it papists would never argue except when they were both judge and party knox himself never answered ninian winzet who while printing his polemic was sought for by the police of the period and just managed to escape  there was however a champion who on november 19 challenged knox and the other preachers to a discussion either orally or by interchange of letters  this was marys own chaplain rene benoit  mary probably knew that he was about to offer to meet the most learned john knox and other most erudite men called ministers it is thus that rene addresses them in his epistle of november 19  he implores them not to be led into heresy by love of popularity or of wealth neither of which advantages the preachers enjoyed for they were detested by loose livers and were nearly starved  benoits little challenge or rather request for discussion is a model of courtesy  knox did not meet him in argument as far as we are aware but in 1562 fergusson minister of dunfermline replied in a tract full of scurrility  one quite unmentionable word occurs and impudent lie impudent and shameless shavelings baals chaplains that eat at jezebels table pestilent papistry abominable mass idol bishops we christians and you papists and parallels between benoit and an idolatrous priest of bethel between mary and jezebel are among the amenities of this meek servant of christ in dunfermline  benoit presently returned to france and later was confessor to henri iv the discussion which mary anticipated never occurred though her champion was ready  knox does not refer to this affair in his history as far as i am aware 199  was rene the priest whom the brethren menaced and occasionally assaulted  considering her chaplains offer it seems not unlikely that mary was ready to listen to reasoning but to call the pope antichrist and the church a harlot is not argument  knox ended his discourse by wishing the queen as blessed in scotland as deborah was in israel  the mere fact that mary spoke with him makes the papists doubt what shall come of the world 200a says randolph and indeed nobody knows what possibly might have come had knox been sweetly reasonable  but he told his friends that if he was not mistaken she had a proud mind a crafty wit and an indurate heart against god and his truth  she showed none of these qualities in the conversation as described by himself but her part in it is mainly that of a listener who returns not railing with railing  knox was going about to destroy the scheme of les politiques randolph lethington and the lord james  they desired peace and amity with england and the two scots at least hoped to secure these as the cardinal guise did by marys renouncing all present claim to the english throne in return for recognition as heir if elizabeth died without issue  elizabeth as we know her would never have granted these terms but marys ministers lethington then in england lord james at home tried to hope 200b  lord james had heard marys outburst to knox about defending her own insulted church but he was not nervously afraid that she would take to dipping her hands in the blood of the saints  neither he nor lethington could revert to the old faith they had pecuniary reasons as well as convictions which made that impossible  lethington returned to edinburgh october 25 spoke his mind to cecil the queen behaves herself    as reasonably as we can require if anything be amiss the fault is rather in ourselves  you know the vehemency of mr knoxs spirit which cannot be bridled and yet doth utter sometimes such sentences as cannot easily be digested by a weak stomach  i would wish he should deal with her more gently being a young princess unpersuaded     surely in her comporting with him she declares a wisdom far exceeding her age 201a  vituperation is not argument and gentleness is not unchristian  st paul did not revile the gods of felix and festus  but prior to these utterances of october the brethren had been baiting mary  on her public entry which knox misdates by a month her idolatry was rebuked by a pageant of korah dathan and abiram  huntly managed to stop a burning in effigy of a priest at the mass  they never could cease from insulting the queen in the tenderest point  the magistrates next coupled messmongers with notorious drunkards and adulterers and such filthy persons in a proclamation so the provost and bailies were warded knox says in the tolbooth  knox blamed lethington and lord james in a letter to cecil 201b in his history he says god be merciful to some of our own 201c  the queen herself as a papist was clearly insulted in the proclamation moray and lethington the latter touched by her readiness to hear and her gentleness in the face of protestant brutalities the former perhaps lured by the hope of obtaining as the price of his alliance the earldom of moray were by the end of october still attempting to secure amity between her and elizabeth and to hope for the best rather than drive the queen wild by eternal taunts and menaces  the preachers denounced her rites at hallowmass all saints and a servant of her brother lord robert beat a priest but men actually doubted whether subjects might interfere between the queen and her religion  there was a discussion on this point between the preachers and the nobles and the church in geneva calvin was to be consulted  knox offered to write but lethington said that he would write as much stood on the information that is on the manner of stating the question  lethington did not know and knox does not tell us in his history that he had himself a week earlier put the matter before calvin in his own way even lord james he says to calvin though the abdiel of godliness is afraid to overthrow that idol by violenceidolum illud missalicum 202  knoxs letter to calvin represents the queen as alleging that he has already answered the question declaring that knoxs party has no right to interfere with the royal mass  this rumour knox disbelieves  he adds that arran would have written but was absent  apparently arran did write to calvin anonymously and dating from london november 18 1561  the letter really from scotland is in french  the writer acknowledges the receipt about august 20 of an encouraging epistle from calvin  he repeats knoxs statements in the main and presses for a speedy reply  he says that he goes seldom to court both on account of that idol and because sobriety and virtue have been exiled 203a  as arran himself is known to have had company of a good handsome wench a merchants daughter which led to a riot with bothwell described by randolph december 27 1561 his own virtue and sobriety are not conspicuous 203b  he was in edinburgh on november 1519 and the london date of his anonymous letter is a blind 203c  it does not appear that calvin replied to knox and to the anonymous correspondent in whom i venture to detect arran or if he answered his letter was probably unfavourable to knox as we shall argue when the subject later presents itself  finallythe votes of the lords prevailed against the ministers the queen was allowed her mass but lethington a minister of the queen did not consult a foreigner as to the rights of her subjects against her creed  the lenity of lord james was of sudden growth  at stirling he and argyll had gallantly caused the priests to leave the choir with broken heads and bloody ears the queen weeping  so randolph reported to cecil september 24  why her brother foremost to insult mary and her faith unless randolph errs in september took her part in a few weeks we do not know  at perth mary was again offended and suffered in health by reason of the pageants they did too plainly condemn the errors of the world     i hear she is troubled with such sudden passions after any great unkindness or grief of mind says randolph  she was seldom free from such godly chastisements  at perth however some one gave her a cross of five diamonds with pendant pearls  meanwhile the statesmen did not obey the ministers as men ought to obey god a claim not easily granted by carnal politicians     chapter xv knox and queen mary continued 15611564   had mary been a mere hightempered and highspirited girl easily harmed in health by insults to herself and her creed she might now have turned for support to huntly cassilis montrose and the other earls who were catholic or unpersuaded  her greatgrandson charles ii when as young as she now was did make the startthe schoolboy attempt to run away from the presbyterians to the loyalists of the north  but mary had more selfcontrol  the artful randolph found himself as hardly put to it now in diplomacy as the cardinals murderers had done in war when they met the scientific soldier strozzi  the trade is now clean cut off from me wrote randolph october 27 i have to traffic now with other merchants than before  they know the value of their wares and in all places how the market goeth     whatsoever policy is in all the chief and best practised heads of france whatsoever craft falsehood or deceit is in all the subtle brains of scotland said the unscrupulous agent is either fresh in this womans memory or she can bring it out with a wet finger 205  mary in fact was in the hands of lethington a pensioner of elizabeth and of lord james subtle brains enough  she was the merchandise and lethington and lord james wished to make elizabeth acknowledge the scottish queen as her successor the alternative being to seek her price as a wife for an european prince  an union of hearts with england might conceivably mean marys acceptance of the anglican faith  it is not a kind thing to say about mary but i suspect that if assured of the english succession she might have gone over to the prayer book  in the first months of her english captivity july 1568 mary again dallied with the idea of conversion for the sake of freedom  she told the spanish ambassador that she would sooner be murdered but if she could have struck her bargain with elizabeth i doubt that she would have chosen the prayer book rather than the dagger or the bowl 206a  her conversion would have been bitterness as of wormwood to knox  in his eyes anglicanism was a bastard religion a minglemangle now commanded in your kirks  peculiar services appointed for saints days diverse collects as they falsely call them in remembrance of this or that saint    are in my conscience no small portion of papistical superstition 206b  crossing in baptism is a diabolical invention kneeling at the lords table mummelling uttering the responses apparently or singing of the litany  all these practices are diabolical inventions in knoxs candid opinion with mr parsons pattering of his constrained prayers and with the massmunging of mr vicar and of his wicked companions     a blank in the ms  your ministers before for the most part were none of christs ministers but massmumming priests  he appears to speak of the anglican church as it was under edward vi  to mrs locke dieppe april 6 1559 207a  as elizabeth brought in cross and candle her church must have been odious to our reformer calvin had regarded the silly things in our prayer book as endurable not so knox  before he came back to scotland the reformers were content with the english prayer book  by rejecting it knox and his allies disunited scotland and england  knoxs friend arran was threatening to stir up the congregation for the purpose of securing him in the revenues of three abbeys including st andrews of which lord james was prior  the extremists raised the question whether the queen being an idolater may be obeyed in all civil and political actions 207b  knox later made chatelherault promise this obedience what his views were in november 1561 we know not  lord james was already distrusted by his old godly friends it was thought he would receive what he had long desired the earldom of moray november 11 1561 and the precise professors meditated a fresh revolution  it must yet come to a new day they said 207c  those about arran were discontented and nobody was more in his confidence than knox but at this time arran was absent from edinburgh was at st andrews  meanwhile at court the ladies are merry dancing lusty and fair wrote randolph who flirted with mary beaton november 18 and long afterwards in 1578 when she was lady boyne spoke of her as a very dear friend  knox complains that the girls danced when they got the house alone not a public offence  he had his intelligencers in the palace  there was on november 16 a panic in the unguarded palace 208a the poor damsels were left alone while men hid in fear of nobody knew what except a rumour that arran was coming with his congregational friends to take away the queen  the story was perhaps a fable but arran had been uttering threats  mary however expected to be secured by an alliance with elizabeth  the accord between the two queens will quite overthrow them the bishops and they say plainly that she cannot return a true christian woman writes randolph 208b  lethington and randolph both suspected that if mary abandoned idolatry it would be after conference with elizabeth and rather as being converted by that fair theologian than as compelled by her subjects unhappily elizabeth never would meet mary who for all that we know might at this hour have adopted the anglican via media despite her protests to knox and to the pope of her fidelity to rome  like henri iv she may at this time have been capable of preferring a crownthat of englandto a dogma  her mass randolph wrote is rather for despite than devotion for those that use it care not a straw for it and jest sometimes against it 208c  randolph at this juncture reminded mary that advisers of the catholic party had prevented james v from meeting henry viii  she answered something is reserved for us that was not then possibly hinting at her conversion  lord james shared the hopes of lethington and randolph  the papists storm thinking the meeting of the queens will overthrow mass and all  the ministers of mary les politiques indulged in dreams equally distasteful to the catholics and to the more precise of the godly dreams that came through the ivory gate with pictures of the island united and free from the despotism of giant pope and giant presbyter 209  a schism between the brethren and their old leaders and advisers lord james and lethington was the result  at the general assembly of december 1561 the split was manifest  the parties exchanged recriminations and there was even question of the legality of such conventions as the general assembly  lethington asked whether the queen allowed the gathering  knox apparently replied take from us the freedom of assemblies and take from us the evangel     he defended them as necessary for order among the preachers but the objection of course was to their political interferences  the question was to be settled for cromwell in his usual way with a handful of hussars  it was now determined that the queen might send commissioners to the assembly to represent her interests  the plea of the godly that mary should ratify the book of discipline was countered by the scoffs of lethington  he and his brothers ever tormented knox by persiflage  still the preachers must be supported and to that end by a singular compromise the crown assumed dominion over the property of the old church a proceeding which mary if a good catholic could not have sanctioned  the higher clergy retained twothirds of their benefices and the other third was to be divided between the preachers and the queen  vested rights those of the prelates and the interests of the nobles to whom in the troubles they had feued parts of their property were thus secured while the preachers were put off with a humble portion  among the abbeys that of st andrews held by the good lord james was one of the richest  he appears to have retained all the wealth for as bishop keith says the grand gulf that swallowed up the whole extent of the thirds were pensions given gratis by the queen to those about the court    of which last the earl of moray was always sure to obtain the thirds of his priories of st andrews and pittenweem  in all the whole reformed clergy received annually but not in 156566 24231 pounds 17s 7d scots while knox and four superintendents got a few chalders of wheat and bear  in 1568 when mary had fallen a gift of 333 pounds 6s 8d was made to knox from the fund about a seventh of the money revenue of the abbey of st andrews 210  nobody can accuse knox of enriching himself by the revolution  in the stool of edinburgh he declared that two parts were being given to the devil and the third must be divided between god and the devil between the preachers and the queen and the earl of moray among others  the eminently godly laird of pitarro had the office of paying the preachers in which he was so niggardly that the proverb ran the good laird of pitarro was an earnest professor of christ but the great devil receive the comptroller  it was argued that many lords have not so much to spend as the preachers and this was not denied if the preachers were paid but it was said the lords had other industries whereby they might eke out their revenues  many preachers then or later were driven also to other industries such as keeping publichouses 211a  knox at this period gracefully writes of mary we call her not a hoore  when she scattered his party after riccios murder he went the full length of the expression in his history  simplicity says thucydides is no small part of a noble nature and knox was now to show simplicity in conduct and in his narrative of a very curious adventure  the hamiltons had taken little but loss by joining the congregation arran could not recover his claims on whatever they were founded over the wealth of st andrews and dunfermline  chatelherault feared that mary would deprive him of his place of refuge the castle of dumbarton to which he confessed that his right was none beyond a verbal promise of a nineteen years farm when given we know not from mary of guise 211b  randolph began to believe that arran really had contemplated a raid on mary at holyrood where she had no guards 211c  why asked arran was it not as easy to take her out of the abbey as once it had been intended to do with her mother  here were elements of trouble and knox adds that according to the servants of chatelherault huntly and the hamiltons devised to slay lord james who in january received the earldom of moray but bore the title of earl of mar which earldom he held for a brief space 212a  huntly had claims on moray and hence hated lord james  arran was openly sending messengers to france his councils are too patent  randolph at the same time found knox and the preachers as wilfull as learned which heartily i lament january 30  the rumour that mary had been persuaded by the cardinal to turn anglican makes them run almost wild february 12 212b  if the queen were an anglican the new kirk would be in an ill way  arran still sent retainers to france and was reported to speak ill of mary february 21 but the duke tried to win randolph to a marriage between arran and the queen  the intended bridegroom lay abed for a week tormented by imaginations but was contented not to be reconciled with bothwell but to pass his misdeeds in oblivion 212c as he declared to the privy council february 20  in these threatening circumstances bothwell made knoxs friend barron a rich burgess who financed the earl introduce him to our reformer  the earl explained that his feud with arran was very expensive he had for his safety to keep a number of wicked and unprofitable men about himhis lambs the ormistouns 213 young hay of tala probably and the rest  he therefore repented and wished to be reconciled to arran knox pleased at being a reconciler where nobler men had failed and moved after long refusal by the entreaties of the godly as he tells mrs locke advised bothwell first to be reconciled to god  so bothwell presently was going to sermon for that very purpose  knox promised to approach arran and bothwell with his usual impudence chose that moment to seize an old pupil of knoxs the young laird of ormiston cockburn the young laird to be sure had fired a pistol at his enemy  however bothwell repented of this lapse and at the hamiltons great house of kirkoffield knox made him and arran friends  next day they went to sermon together on the following day they visited chatelherault at kinneil some twelve miles from edinburgh  but on the ensuing day march 26 came the wild end of the reconciliation  knox had delivered his daily sermon and was engaged with his vast correspondence when arran was announced with an advocate and the town clerk  arran began a conference with tears said that he was betrayed and told his tale  bothwell had informed him that he would seize the queen put her in dumbarton kill her misguiders the earl of moray mar lord james lethington and others and so shall he and i rule all  but arran believed bothwell really intended to accuse him of treason or knowledge of treason so he meant to write to mary and mar  knox asked whether he had assented to the plot and advised him to be silent probably he saw that arran was distraught and did not credit his story but arran said that bothwell as he had once done before in 1559 would challenge him to a judicial combatsuch challenges were still common but never led to a fight  he then walked off with his legal advisers and wrote to mary at falkland 214a  if arran went mad he went mad with advice of counsel  there had come the chance of a new day which the extremists desired but its dawn was inauspicious  arran rode to his fathers house of kinneil where either because he was insane or because there really was a bothwellhamilton plot he was locked up in a room high above the ground  he let himself down from the window reached halyards a place of kirkcaldy of grange and was thence taken by mar whom knox appears to have warned to the queen at falkland bothwell and gawain hamilton were also put in ward there  randolph gives march 31 a similar account but believed that there really was a plot which arran denied even before he arrived at falkland  bothwell came to purge himself but was found guilty on his own confession on some points 214b  the queen now went to st andrews where the suspects were placed in the castle  arran wavered accusing mars mother of witchcraft  mary was not a little offended with bothwell to whom she has been so good randolph april 7 continued to think that arran should be decapitated he and bothwell were kept in ward and his father the duke was advised to give up dumbarton to the crown which he did 215a  this was about april 23  knox makes a grievance of the surrender the castle he says was by treaty to be in the dukes hands till the queen had lawful issue 215b  chatelherault himself as we said told randolph that he had no right in the place beyond a verbal and undated promise of the late regent  knox now again illustrates his own historical methods  mary riding between falkland and lochleven fell was hurt and when randolph wrote from edinburgh on may 11 was not expected there for two or three days but knox reports that on her return from fife to edinburgh she danced excessively till after midnight because she had received letters that persecution was begun again in france by the guises 215c  now as according to knox elsewhere satan stirreth his terrible tail so did one of marys uncles the duc de guise stir his tail against one of the towns appointed to pay marys jointure namely vassy in champagne here on march 1 1562 a massacre of huguenots by the guises retainers began the war of religion afresh 215d  now in the first place this could not be joyful news to set mary dancing as it was apt to prevent what she had most at heart her personal interview with elizabeth  she understood this perfectly well and in conversation with randolph after her return to edinburgh lamented the deeds of her uncles as calculated to bring them in hate and disdain of many princes and also to chill elizabeths amity for herselfon which her whole policy now depended may 29 216a  she wept when randolph said that in the state of france elizabeth was not likely to move far from london for their interview  in this mood how could mary give a dance to celebrate an event which threatened ruin to her hopes  moreover if knox when he speaks of persecution begun again refers to the slaughter of huguenots by guises retinue at vassy that untoward event occurred on march 1 and mary cannot have been celebrating it by a ball at holyrood as late as may 14 at earliest 216b  knox however preached against her dancing if she danced for pleasure at the displeasure of gods people so he states the case  her reward in that case would he drink in hell  in his history he declares that mary did dance for the evil reason attributed to her a reason which must have been mere matter of inference on his part and that inference wrong judging by dates if the reference is to the affair of vassy  in april both french parties were committing brutalities but these were all contrary to marys policy and hopes  if knox heard a rumour against any one his business according to the book of discipline was not to go and preach against that person even by way of insinuation 216c  marys offence if any existed was not public and was based on mere suspicion or on tattle  dr mcrie indeed says that on hearing of the affair of vassy the queen immediately after gave a splendid ball to her foreign servants  ten weeks after the vassy affair is not immediately and knox mentions neither foreign servants nor vassy 216d  the queen sent for knox and made a long harangue of which he does not report one word  he gives his own oration  mary then said that she could not expect him to like her uncles as they differed in religion but if he heard anything of herself that he disapproved of come to myself and tell me and i shall hear you  he answered that he was not bound to come to every man in particular but she could come to his sermons  if she would name a day and hour he would give her a doctrinal lecture  at this very moment he was absent from his book his studies were interrupted  you will not always be at your book she said and turned her back  to some papists in the antechamber he remarked why should the pleasing face of a gentlewoman affray me  i have looked in the faces of many angry men and yet have not been afraid above measure  he was later to flee before that pleasing face  mary can hardly be said to have had the worse as far as manners and logic went of this encounter at which morton mar and lethington were present and seem to have been silent 217a  meanwhile randolph dates this affair the dancing the sermon the interview not in may but about december 1315 1562 217b and connects the dancing with no event in france 217c nor can i find any such event in late november which might make mary glad at heart  knox randolph writes mistrusts all that the queen does or says as if he were of gods privy council that knew how he had determined of her in the beginning or that he knew the secrets of her heart so well that she neither did nor could have one good thought of god or of his true religion  his doings could not increase her respect for his religion  the affair of arran had been a sensible sorrow to knox  god hath further humbled me since that day which men call good friday he wrote to mrs locke may 6 than ever i have been in my life     he had rejoiced in his task of peacemaking in which the privy council had practically failed and had shown great naivete in trusting bothwell  the best he could say to mrs locke was that he felt no certainty about the fact that bothwell had tempted arran to conspire 218  the probability is that the reckless and impoverished bothwell did intend to bring in the desirable new day and to make the hamiltons his tools meanwhile he was kept out of mischief and behind stone walls for a season  knox had another source of annoyance which was put down with a high hand  the dominie of the school at linlithgow ninian winzet by name had lost his place for being an idolater  in february he had brought to the notice of our reformer and of the queen the question is john knox a lawful minister  if he was called by god where were his miracles  if by men by what manner of men  on march 3 winzet asked knox for your answer in writing  he kept launching letters at knox in march on march 24 he addressed the general public and on march 31 issued an appeal to the magistrates who appear to have been molesting people who kept easter  the practice was forbidden in a proclamation by the queen on may 31 219a  the pain is death writes randolph 219b  if mary was ready to die for her faith as she informed a nuncio who now secretly visited her she seems to have been equally resolved that her subjects should not live in it  receiving no satisfactory written answer from knox winzet began to print his tract and then he got his reply from soldiers and the magistrates for the book was seized and he himself narrowly escaped to the continent 219c  knox was not to be brought to a written reply save so far as he likened his calling to that of amos and john the baptist  in september he referred to his answer to winzets questions as forthcoming but it never appeared 219d  winzet was marys chaplain in her sheffield prison in 157072 she had him made abbot of ratisbon and he is said by lethingtons son to have helped lesley in writing his history  on june 29 the general assembly through knox probably drew up the address to the queen threatening her and the country with the wrath of god on her mass which she is assured is peculiarly distasteful to the deity  the brethren are deeply disappointed that she does not attend their sermons and ventures to prefer your ain preconceived vain opinion  they insist that adulterers must be punished with death and they return to their demands for the poor and the preachers  a new rising is threatened if wicked men trouble the ministers and disobey the superintendents  lethington and knox had one of their usual disputes over this manifesto the secretary drew up another  here be many fair words said the queen on reading it i cannot tell what the hearts are 220a  she later found out the nature of lethingtons heart a pretty black one  the excesses of the guises in france were now the excuse or cause of the postponement of elizabeths meeting with mary  the queen therefore now undertook a northern progress which had been arranged for in january about the time when lord james was made earl of moray 220b  he could not brook the earldom of moray before the earl of huntly was put down huntly being a kind of petty king in the east and north  there is every reason to suppose that mary understood and utterly distrusted huntly who though the chief catholic in the country had been a traitor whenever occasion served for many a year  one of his sons john in july wounded an ogilvy in edinburgh in a quarrel over property  this affair was so managed as to drive huntly into open rebellion neither mary nor her brother being sorry to take the opportunity  the business of the ruin of huntly has seemed more of a mystery to historians than it was though an attack by a catholic princess on her most powerful catholic subject does need explanation  but randolph was with mary during the whole expedition and his despatches are better evidence than the fables of buchanan and the surmises of knox and mr froude  huntly had been out of favour ever since lord james obtained the coveted earldom of moray in january and he was thought to be opposed to marys visit to elizabeth  since january the queen had been bent on a northern progress  probably the archbishop of st andrews as reported by knox rightly guessed the motives  at table he said the queen has gone into the north belike to seek disobedience she may perhaps find the thing that she seeks 221a  she wanted a quarrel with huntly and a quarrel she found  her northward expedition says randolph is rather devised by herself than greatly approved by her council  she would not visit huntly at strathbogie contrary to the advice of her council his son who wounded ogilvy had broken prison and refused to enter himself at stirling castle  huntly then supported his sons in rebellion while bothwell broke prison and fortified himself in hermitage castle  lord jamess earldom of moray was now publicly announced september 18 and huntly was accused of a desire to murder him and lethington while his son john was to seize the queen 221b  mary was utterly determined to bring him to utter confusion  huntly was put to the horn on october 18 his sons took up arms  huntly old and corpulent died during a defeat at corrichie without stroke of sword his mischievous son john was taken and executed mary being pleased with her success and declaring that huntly thought to have married her where he would 221c and to have slain her brother  john gordon confessed to the murder plot 221d  his eldest brother lord gordon who had tried to enlist bothwell and the hamiltons lay long in prison his sister married bothwell just before riccios murder  the queen had punished the disobedience which she went to seek and moray was safe in his rich earldom while a heavy blow was dealt at the catholicism which huntly had protected 222a cardinal guise reports her success to de rennes in austria with triumph and refers to an autograph letter of hers of which lethingtons draft has lately perished by fire unread by historians  as the cardinal reports that she says she is trying to win her subjects back to the church in which she wishes to live and die january 30 156263 lethington cannot be the author of that part of her lost letter 222b  knox meanwhile much puzzled by the news from the north was in the western counties  he induced the lairds of ayrshire to sign a protestant band and he had a controversy with the abbot of crosraguel  in misapplication of texts the abbot was even more eccentric than knox though he only followed st jerome  in his history knox cannot certainly say whether there was any secret paction and confederacy between the queen herself and huntly 222c  knox decides that though mary executed john gordon and other rebels yet it was the destruction of others that she sought namely of her brother whom she hated for his godliness and upright plainness 222d  his upright simplicity had won him an earldom and the destruction of his rival  he and lethington may have exaggerated huntlys iniquities in council with mary but the rumours reported against her by knox could only be inspired by the credulity of extreme illwill  he flattered himself that he kept the hamiltons quiet and at a supper with randolph in november made chatelherault promise to be a good subject in civil matters and a good protestant in religion  knox says that preaching was done with even unusual vehemence in winter when his sermon against the queens dancing for joy over some unknown protestant misfortune was actually delivered and the good seed fell on ground not wholly barren  the queens french and scots musicians would not play or sing at the queens christmasday mass whether pricked in heart by conscience or afraid for their lives  her poor soul is so troubled for the preservation of her silly mass that she knoweth not where to turn for defence of it says randolph 223a  these persecutions may have gone far to embitter the character of the victim  mr froude is certainly not an advocate of mary stuart rather he is conspicuously the reverse  but he remarks that when she determined to marry darnley divide scotland and trust to her catholic party she did so because she was weary of the mask which she had so long worn and unable to endure any longer these wild insults to her creed and herself 223b  she had in fact given the policy of submission to wild insults rather more than a fair chance she had for a spirited girl been almost incredibly longsuffering when barbarously baited as charles i described his own treatment by the preachers and the covenanters     chapter xvi knox and queen mary continued 15631564   the new year 1563 found knox purging the kirk from that fallen brother paul methuen  this preacher had borne the burden and heat of the day in 155758 erecting as we have seen the first reformed kirk that of the holy virgin in dundee and suffering some inconvenience if no great danger from the clergy of the religion whose sacred things he overthrew he does not appear to have been one of the more furious of the new apostles  contrasted with john brabner a vehement man inculcating the law and pain thereof paul is described as a milder man preaching the evangel of grace and remission of sins in the blood of christ 224a  paul was at this time minister of jedburgh  he had an ancient matron to wife recommended perhaps by her property and she left him for two months with a servant maid  paul fell but behaved not ill to the mother of his child sending her money and clothes at various times  knox tried the case at jedburgh paul was excommunicated and fled the realm sinking so low it seems as to take orders in the church of england later he returnedprobably he was now pennilessand prostrated himself before the whole brethren with weeping and howling  he was put to such shameful and continued acts of public penance up and down the country that any spirit which he had left awoke in him and the kirk knew him no more  thus the world might see what difference there is between darkness and light 225a  knox presently had to record a scandal in a higher place the capture and execution of the french minor poet chastelard who armed with sword and dagger hid under the queens bed in holyrood and invaded her room with great insolence at burntisland as she was on her way to st andrews there he was tried condemned and executed in the marketplace  it seems fairly certain that chastelard who had joined the queen with despatches during the expedition against huntly was a huguenot  the catholic version and lethingtons version of his adventure was that some intriguing huguenot lady had set him on to sully queen marys character other tales ran that he was to assassinate her as part of a great protestant conspiracy 225b  randolph who knew as much as any one thought the queen far too familiar with the poet but did not deem that her virtue was in fault 225c  knox dilates on marys familiarities kisses given in a vulgar dance dear to the french society of the period and concludes that the fatuous poet lacked his head that his tongue should not utter the secrets of our queen 225d  there had been a bad harvest and a dearth because the queens luxury provoked god who is represented as very irritable to strike the staff of bread and to give his malediction upon the fruits of the earth  but oh alas who looked or yet looks to the very cause of all our calamities 226a  some savage peoples are said to sacrifice their kings when the weather is unpropitious  knoxs theology was of the same kind  the preachers says randolph february 28 pray daily    that god will either turn the queens heart or grant her short life  of what charity or spirit this proceeds i leave to be discussed by great divines 226b  the prayers sound like encouragement to jehus  at this date ruthven was placed by lethingtons means only on the privy council  moray especially hated ruthven for his sorcery the superstitious moray affected the queen with this ill opinion of one of the electin the affair of riccios murder so useful to the cause of knox  there is not an unworthier in scotland than ruthven writes randolph 226c  meanwhile lethington was in england to negotiate for peace in france if he could to keep an eye on marys chances for the succession and says knox to obtain leave for lennox the chief of the stuarts and the deadly foe of the hamiltons to visit scotland whence in the time of henry viii he had been driven as a traitor  but lethington was at that time confuting lennoxs argument that the hamilton chief chatelherault was illegitimate  knox is not positive he only reports rumours 226d  lethingtons serious business was to negotiate a marriage for the queen  despite the recent threats of death against priests who celebrated mass the archbishop hamilton and knoxs opponent the abbot of crossraguel with many others did so at easter  the ayrshire brethren determined to put to their own hands captured some priests and threatened others with the punishment that god has appointed to idolaters by his law 227a  the queen commanded knox to meet her at lochleven in midaprillochleven where she was later to be a prisoner  in that state lay the priests of her religion who had been ministering to the people some in secret houses some in barns some in woods and hills writes randolph all are in prison 227b  mary for two hours before supper implored knox to mediate with the western fanatics  he replied that if princes would not use the sword against idolaters there was the leading case of samuels slaughter of agag and he adduced another biblical instance of a nature not usually cited before young ladies  he was on safer ground in quoting the scots law as it stood  judges within their bounds were to seek out and punish massmongersthat was his courteous term  the queen rather hurt went off to supper but next morning did her best to make friends with knox over other matters  she complained of ruthven who had given her a ring for some magical purpose later explained by ruthven who seems to have despised the superstition of his age  the queen says ruthven was afraid of poison he gave her the ring saying that it acted as an antidote  moray was at lochleven with the queen and moray believed or pretended to believe in ruthvens sossery as randolph spells sorcery  she rather putting herself at our reformers mercy complained that lethington alone placed ruthven in the privy council  that man is absent said knox and therefore i will speak nothing on that behalf  mary then warned him against the man who was at time most familiar with the said john in his house and at table the despicable bishop of galloway and knox later found out that the warning was wise lastly she asked him to reconcile the earl and countess of argylldo this much for my sake and she promised to summon the offending priests who had done their duty 228a  knox with his usual tact wrote to argyll thus your behaviour toward your wife is very offensive unto many godly  he added that if all that was said of argyll was true and if he did not look out he would be damned  this bill was not well accepted of the said earl but like the rest of them he went on truckling to knox most familiar with the said john 228b  nearly fifty priests were tried but no one was hanged  they were put in ward the like of this was never heard within the realm said pleased protestants not smelling the craft  neither the queen nor her council had the slightest desire to put priests to death  six other priests as wicked as the archbishop were imprisoned and the abbot of crossraguel was put to the horn in his absence just as the preachers had been  the catholic clergy know not where to hide their heads says randolph  many fled to the more tender mercies of england it will be the common refuge of papists that cannot live here    228c  the tassels on the trains of the ladies it was declared by the preachers would provoke gods vengeance    against the whole realm    229a  the state of things led to a breach between knox and moray which lasted till the earl found him likely to be useful some eighteen months later  the reformer relieved his mind in the pulpit at the end of may or early in june rebuking backsliders and denouncing the queens rumoured marriage with any infidel and all papists are infidels  papists and protestants were both offended  there was a scene with mary in which she wept profusely an infirmity of hers we constantly hear of her weeping in public  she wished the lords of the articles to see whether knoxs manner of speaking was not punishable but nothing could be done  elizabeth would have found out a way 229b  the fact that while knox was conducting himself thus nobody ventured to put a dirk or a bullet into himdespite the obvious strength of the temptation in many quartersproves that he was by far the most potent human being in scotland  darnley moray lennox were all assassinated when their day came though the feeblest of the three darnley had a powerful clan to take up his feud  we cannot suppose that any moral considerations prevented the many people whom knox had offended from doing unto him as the elect did to riccio  manifestly nobody had the courage  no clan was so strong as the warlike brethren who would have avenged the reformer and who probably would have been backed by elizabeth  again though he was estranged from moray that leader was also in some degree estranged from lethington who did not allow him to know the details of his intrigues in france and england for the queens marriage  the marriage question was certain to reunite moray and knox when knox told mary that as a subject of this realm he had a right to oppose her marriage with any infidel he spoke the modern constitutional truth  for mary to wed a royal catholic would certainly have meant peril for protestantism war with england and a tragic end  but what protestant could she marry  if a scot he would not long have escaped the daggers of the hamiltons indeed all the nobles would have borne the fiercest jealousy against such an one as say glencairn who we learn could say anything to mary without offence  she admired a strong brave man and glencairn though an opponent was gallant and resolute  england chose only to offer the infamous and treacherous leicester whose character was ruined by the mysterious death of his wife amy robsart and who had offered to sell england and himself to idolatrous spain marys only faint chance of safety lay in perpetual widowhood or in marrying knox by far the most powerful of her subjects and the best able to protect her and himself  this idea does not seem to have been entertained by the subtle brain of lethington  between february and may 1563 the cardinal of lorraine had reopened an old negotiation for wedding the queen to the archduke and mary had given an evasive reply she must consult parliament  in march with the spanish ambassador in london lethington had proposed for don carlos  philip ii as usual wavered consented in august considered and reconsidered  lethington in france had told the queen mother that the spanish plan was only intended to wring concessions from elizabeth and on his return to england had persuaded the spanish ambassador that charles ix was anxious to succeed to his brothers widow  this moved philip to be favourable to the don carlos marriage but he waited there was no sign from france and philip withdrew wavering so much that both the austrian and spanish matches became impossible  on october 6 knox who suspected more than he knew told cecil that out of twelve privy councillors nine would consent to a catholic marriage  the only hope was in moray and knox daily thirsted for death 231a  he appealed to leicester about whose relations with elizabeth he was of course informed as to a man who may greatly advance the purity of religion 231b  these letters to cecil and leicester are deeply pious in tone and reveal a cruel anxiety  on june 20 three weeks after knoxs famous sermon lethington told de quadra the spanish ambassador that elizabeth threatened to be marys enemy if she married don carlos or any of the house of austria 231c  on august 26 1563 randolph received instructions from elizabeth in which the tone of menace was unconcealed elizabeth would offer an english noble we and our country cannot think any mighty prince a meet husband for her 231d  knox was now engaged in a contest wherein he was triumphant an affair which in later years was to have sequels of high importance  during the summer vacation of 1563 while mary was moving about the country catholics in edinburgh habitually attended at mass in her chapel  this was contrary to the arrangement which permitted no mass in the whole realm except that of the queen when her priests were not terrorised the godly brawled in the chapel royal and two of them were arrested two very dear brethren named cranstoun and armstrong they were to be tried on october 24  knox had a kind of dictators commission from the congregation to see that the kirk took no harm and to the congregation he appealed by letter  the accused brethren had only noted what persons repaired to the mass but they were charged with divers crimes especially invading her majestys palace  knox therefore convoked the congregation to meet in edinburgh on the day of trial in the good old way of overawing justice 232a  of course we do not know to what lengths the dear brethren went in their pious indignation  the legal record mentions that they were armed with pistols in the town and court suburb and it was no very unusual thing later for people to practise pistol shooting at each other even in their own kirk of st giless 232b  still pistols if worn in the palace chapel have not a pacific air  the brethren are also charged with assaulting some of the queens domestic servants 232c  archbishop spottiswoode son of one of the knoxian superintendents says that the brethren forced the gates and that some of the worshippers were taken and carried to prison     232d  knox admits in his history that some of the brethren burst in to the chapel  in his letter to stir up the godly he says that the brethren passed in and that in most quiet manner  on receiving knoxs summons the congregation prepared its levies in every town and province 233a  the privy council received a copy of knoxs circular and concluded that it imported treason  to ourselves it does seem that for a preacher to call levies out of every town and province to meet in the capital on a day when a trial was to be held is a thing that no government can tolerate  the administration of justice is impossible in the circumstances  but it was the usual course in scotland and any member of the privy council might at any time find it desirable to call a similar convocation of his allies  mary herself fretted by the perfidies of elizabeth had just been consoled by that symbolic jewel a diamond shaped like a rock and by promises in which she fondly trusted when she at last sought an asylum in england and found a prison  for two months she had often been in deep melancholy weeping for no known cause and she was afflicted by the pain in her side which ever haunted her december 1321 233b  accused by the master of maxwell of unbecoming conduct knox said that such things had been done before and he had the warrant of god speaking plainly in his word  the master later lord herries not taking this view of the case was never friendly with knox again the reformer added this comment as late as december 1571 233c  lethington and moray like maxwell remonstrated vainly with our reformer  randolph december 21 reports that the lords assembled to take order with knox and his faction who intended by a mutinous assembly made by his letter before to have rescued two of their brethren from course of law     234a  knox was accompanied to holyrood by a force of brethren who crowded the inner close and all the stairs even to the chamber door where the queen and council sat 234b  probably these slashing communicants had their effect on the minds of the councillors  not till after riccios murder was mary permitted to have a strong guard  according to knox mary laughed a horse laugh when he entered saying yon man gart me greit and grat never tear himself  i will see gif i can gar him greit  her scots textually reported was certainly idiomatic  knox acknowledged his letter to the congregation and lethington suggested that he might apologise  ruthven said that knox made convocation of people daily to hear him preach what harm was there in his letter merely calling people to convocation  this was characteristic pettifogging  knox said that he convened the people to meet on the day of trial according to the order that the brethren has appointed    at the commandment of the general kirk of the realm  mary seems strangely enough to have thought that this was a valid reply  perhaps it was and the kirks action in that sense directed against the state finally enabled cromwell to conquer the kirkridden country  mary appears to have admitted the kirks imperium in imperio for she diverted the discussion from the momentous point really at issuethe right of the kirk to call up an armed multitude to thwart justice  she now fell on knoxs employment of the word cruelty  he instantly started on a harangue about pestilent papists when the queen once more introduced a personal question he had caused her to weep and he recounted all their interview after he attacked her marriage from the pulpit  he was allowed to go homeit might not have been safe to arrest him and the lords unanimously voted that he had done no offence  they repeated their votes in the queens presence and thus a precedent for mutinous convocation by kirkmen was established till james vi took order in 1596  we have no full narrative of this affair except that of knox  it is to be guessed that the nobles wished to maintain the old habit of mutinous convocation which probably saved the life of lethington and helped to secure bothwells acquittal from the guilt of darnleys murder perhaps too the brethren who filled the whole inner court and overflowed up the stairs of the palace may have had their influence  this was a notable triumph of our reformer and of the kirk to which on his showing the queen contributed by feebly wandering from the real point at issue  she was no dialectician  knoxs conduct was of course approved of and sanctioned by the general assembly 235  he had in his circular averred that cranstoun and armstrong were summoned that a door may be opened to execute cruelty upon a greater multitude  to put it mildly the general assembly sanctioned contempt of court  unluckily for scotland contempt of court was and long remained universal the country being desperately lawless and reeking with blood shed in public and private quarrels  when a prophet followed the secular example of summoning crowds to overawe justice the secular sinners had warrant for thwarting the course of law  as to the brethren and the idolaters who caused these troubles we know not what befell them  the penalty both for the attendants at mass and for the disturbers thereof should have been death  the dear brethren if they attacked the queens servants came under the proclamation of october 1561 so did the catholics for they openly made alteration and innovation of the state of religion      they ought to be punished to the death with all rigour  three were outlawed and their sureties unlawed  twentyone others were probably not hanged the records are lost  for the same reason we know not what became of the brethren armstrong cranstoun and george rynd summoned with the other malefactors for november 13 236     chapter xvii knox and queen mary continued 15641567   during the session of the general assembly in december 1563 knox was compelled to chronicle domestic enormities  the lord treasurer richardson having like captain booth offended the law of dian had to do penance before the whole congregation and the sermon unfortunately it is lost probably it never was written out was preached by knox  a french apothecary of the queens and his mistress were hanged on a charge of murdering their child 237a  on january 9 156465 randolph noted that one of the queens maries mary livingstone is to marry john sempill son of robert third lord sempill by an english wife  knox assures us that it is well known that shame hastened marriage between john sempill called the dancer and mary livingstone surnamed the lusty  the young people appear however to have been in no pressing hurry as randolph on january 9 did not expect their marriage till the very end of february they wished the earl of bedford who was coming on a diplomatic mission to be present 237b  mary on march 9 1565 made them a grant of lands since it has pleased god to move their hearts to join together in the state of matrimony 237c  she had ever since january been making the bride presents of feminine finery  these proceedings indicating no precipitate haste we may think that mary livingstone like mary of guise is only a victim of the reformers taste for society journalism  randolph though an egregious gossip says of the four maries they are all good but knox writes that the ballads of that age did witness to the bruit or reputation of these maidens as is well known the old ballad of mary hamilton which exists in more than a dozen very diverse variants in some specimens confuses one of the maries an imaginary mary hamilton with the french maid who was hanged at the end of 1563  the balladist is thus responsible for a scandal against the fair sisterhood there was no mary hamilton and no mary carmichael in their numberbeaton seton fleming and livingstone  an offended deity now sent frost in january 1564 and an aurora borealis in february knox tells us and the threatenings of the preachers were fearful in face of these unusual meteorological phenomena 238  vice rose to such a pitch that men doubted if the mass really was idolatry  knox said from the pulpit that if the sceptics were right he was miserably deceived  believe me brethren in the bowels of christ it is possible that you may be mistaken cromwell was to tell the commissioners of the general assembly on a day that still was in the womb of the future the dawn of common sense rose in the south  on march 20 much to the indignation of the queen the banns were read twice between knox and a lady of the royal blood and name margaret stewart daughter of lord ochiltree a girl not above sixteen in january 1563 when randolph first speaks of the wooing 239  the good dr mcrie does not mention the age of the bride  the lady was a very near kinswoman of chatelherault  she had plenty of time for reflection and as nobody says that she was coerced into the marriage while nicol burne attributes her passion to sorcery we may suppose that she was in love with our reformer  she bore him several daughters and it is to be presumed that the marriage though in every way bizarre was happy burne says that knox wished to marry a lady fleming akin to chatelherault but was declined if so he soon consoled himself  at this time riccioa valet de chambre of the queen in 156162began to grow great in court becoming french secretary at the end of the year  by june 3 1565 randolph is found styling riccio only governor to darnley  his career might have rivalled that of the equally lowborn cardinal alberoni but for the daggers of morays party  in the general assembly of june 1564 moray morton glencairn pitarro lethington and other lords of the congregation held aloof from the brethren but met the superintendents and others to discuss the recent conduct of our reformer who was present  he was invited by lethington to moderate himself in his references to the queen as others might imitate him albeit not with the same modesty and foresight for lethington could not help bantering knox  knox of course rushed to his doctrine of idolatry as provocative of the wrath of godwe have heard of the bad harvest and the frost in january  it is not worth while to pursue in detail the discourses in which knox said that the queen rebelled against god in all the actions of her life  ahab and jezebel were again brought on the scene  it profited not lethington to say that all these old biblical vengeances were singular motions of the spirit of god and appertain nothing to our age  if knox could have understood that he would not have been knox  the point was intelligible lethington perceived it but knox never chose to do so  he went on with his isolated texts lethington vainly replying the cases are nothing alike  knox came to his old stand the idolater must die the death and the executioners must be the people of god  lethington quoted many opinions against knoxs to no purpose opinions of luther melanchthon bucer musculus and calvin but our reformer brought out the case of amasiath king of judah and the apology of magdeburg  as to the opinion of calvin and the rest he drew a distinction  they had only spoken of the godly who were suffering under oppression not of the godly triumphant in a commonwealth  he forgot or did not choose to remember a previous decision of his own as we shall see  when the rest of the party were discussing the question makgill clerk register reminded them of their previous debate in november 1561 when 240 knox after secretly writing to calvin had proposed to write to him for his opinion about the queens mass and lethington had promised to do so himself  but lethington now said that on later reflection as secretary of the queen he had scrupled without her consent to ask a foreigner whether her subjects might prevent her from enjoying the rites of her own religionfor that was what the controversies between her highness and her subjects really and confessedly meant 241a  knox was now requested to consult calvin and the learned in other kirks to know their judgment in that question  the question judging from makgills interpellation was whether subjects might lawfully take her mass from the queen 241b  as we know knox had already put the question to calvin by a letter of october 24 1561 and so had the anonymous writer of november 18 1561 whom i identify with arran  knox now refused to write to mr calvin and the learned of other kirks saying i must quote him textually or be accused of misrepresentation i myself am not only fully resolved in conscience but also i have heard the judgments in this and all other things that i have affirmed in this realm of the most godly and most learned that be known in europe  i come not to this realm without their resolution and for my assurance i have the handwritings of many and therefore if i should move the same question again what else should i do but either show my own ignorance and forgetfulness or else inconstancy 241c  he therefore said that his opponents might themselves write and complain upon him and so learn the plain minds of the learnedbut nobody took the trouble knoxs defence was worded with the skill of a notary  he said that he had heard the judgments of the learned and godly he did not say what these judgments were  calvin morel bullinger and such men we know entirely differed from his extreme ideas  he came not without their resolution or approval to scotland but that was not the question at issue  if knox had received from calvin favourable replies to his own letter and arrans of october 24 november 18 1561 can any one doubt that he would now have produced them unless he did not wish the brethren to find out that he himself had written without their knowledge  we know what manner of answers he received in 1554 orally from calvin in writing from bullinger to his questions about resistance to the civil power 242a  i am sceptical enough to suppose that if knox had now possessed letters from calvin justifying the propositions which he was maintaining such as that the people yea or ane pairt of the people may execute gods jugementis against their king being ane offender 242b he would have exhibited them  i do not believe that he had any such letters from such men as bullinger and calvin  indeed we may ask whether the question of the queens mass had arisen in any realm of europe except scotland  where was there a catholic prince ruling over a calvinistic state  if nowhere then the question would not be raised except by knox in his letter to calvin of october 24 1561  and where was calvins answer and to what effect  knox may have forgotten and lethington did not know that about 1558 59 in a tract already noticed pp 101103 supra of 450 pages against the anabaptists knox had expressed the reverse of his present opinion about religious regicide  he is addressing the persecuting catholic princes of europe     ye shall perish both temporally and for ever and by whom doth it most appear that temporally ye shall be punished  by us whom ye banish whom ye spoil and rob whom cruelly ye persecute and whose blood ye daily shed 243a  there is no doubt but as the victory which overcometh the world is our faith so it behoveth us to possess our souls in our patience  we neither privily nor openly deny the power of the civil magistrate      the chosen saints and people of god even when under oppression lift not the hand but possess their souls in patience says knox in 155859  but the idolatrous shall be temporally punishedby other hands  and what instruments can god find in this life more apt to punish you than those the anabaptists that hate and detest all lawful powers     god will not use his saints and chosen people to punish you  for with them there is always mercy yea even although god have pronounced a curse and malediction as in the history of joshua is plain 243b  in this passage knox is speaking for the english exiles in geneva  he asserts that we neither publicly nor privately deny the power of the civil magistrate in face of his own published tracts of appeal to a jehu or a phinehas and of his own claim that the prophet may preach treason and that his instruments may commit treason  to be sure all the english in geneva were not necessarily of knoxs mind  it is altogether a curious passage  gods people are more merciful than god  israel was bidden to exterminate all idolaters in the promised land but as the book of joshua shows they did not always do it for with them is always mercy despite the massacres such as that of agag which knox was wont to cite as examples to the backward brethren  yet relying on another set of texts not in joshua knox now informed lethington that the executors of death on idolatrous princes were the people of godthe people or a part of the people 244a  mercy  happily the policy of carnal men never allowed knoxs people of god to show whether given a chance to destroy idolaters they would display the mercy on which he insists in his reply to the anabaptist  it was always useless to argue with knox for whatever opinion happened to suit him at the moment and at different moments contradictory opinions happened to suit him he had ever a bible text to back him  on this occasion if lethington had been able to quote knoxs own statement that with the people of god there is always mercy as in the case of cardinal beaton he could hardly have escaped by saying that there was always mercy when the people of god had not the upper hand in the state 244b when unto them god has not given sufficient force  for in the chosen people of god there is always mercy yea even although god have pronounced a curse and malediction  in writing against anabaptists 155859 knox wanted to make them not merciful calvinists the objects of the fear and revenge of catholic rulers  he even hazarded one of his unfulfilled prophecies anabaptists wicked men will execute those divine judgments for which protestants of his species are too tenderhearted though somehow they make exceptions in the cases of beaton and riccio and ought to do so in the case of mary stuart  lethington did not use this passage of our reformers works against him though it was published in 1560  probably the secretary had not worked his way through the long essay on predestination  but we have in the book against the anabaptists and in the controversy with lethington an example of knoxs fatal intellectual faults  as an individual man he would not have hurt a fly  as a prophet he deliberately tried to restore by a pestilent anachronism in a christian age and country the ferocities attributed to ancient israel  this he did not even do consistently and when he is inconsistent with his prevailing mood his biographers applaud his moderation  if he saw a chance against an anabaptist or if he wanted to conciliate mary of guise he took up a christian line backing it by texts appropriate to the occasion  his influence lasted and the massacre of dunavertie 1647 and the slaying of women in cold blood months after the battle of philiphaugh and the rouping of covenanted ravens for the blood of cavaliers taken under quarter are the direct result of knoxs intellectual error of his appeals to jehu phinehas and so forth  at this point the fourth book of knoxs history ends with a remark on the total estrangement between himself and moray  the reformer continued to revise and interpolate his work up to 1571 the year before his death and made collections of materials and notes for the continuation an uncertain hand has put these together in book v  but we now miss the frequent references to john knox and his doings which must have been vigorous during the troubles of 1565 after the arrival in scotland of darnley february 1565 and his courtship and marriage of the queen these events brought together moray chatelherault and many of the lords in the armed party of the congregation  they rebelled they were driven by mary into england by october 1565 and bothwell came at her call from france  the queen had new advisersriccio balfour bothwell the eldest son of the late huntly and lennox till the wretched darnley in a few weeks proved his incapacity  lethington rather neglected hung about the court as he remained with mary of guise long after he had intended to desert her  mary whose only chance lay in outstaying elizabeth in the policy of celibacy had been driven or led by her rival queen into a marriage which would have been the best possible had darnley been a man of character and a protestant  he was the typical young fool indolent incapable fierce cowardly and profligate  his religion was dubious after his arrival on february 26 1565 he went with moray to hear knox preach but he had been bred by a catholic mother and on occasion posed as an ardent catholic 246  it is unfortunate that randolph is silent about knox during all the period of the broils which preceded and followed marys marriage  on august 19 1565 darnley now marys husband went to hear knox preach in st giless on the text o lord our god other lords than thou have ruled over us  god he said sets in that room for the offences and ingratitude of the people boys and women  ahab also appeared as usual  ahab had not taken order with that harlot jezebel  so book v says and harlot would be a hit at marys alleged misconduct with riccio  a hint in a letter of randolphs of august 24 may point to nascent scandal about the pair  but the printed sermon from knoxs written copy reads not harlot but idolatrous wife  at all events darnley was so moved by this sermon that he would not dine 247a  knox was called from his bed to the council chamber where were atholl ruthven lethington the justice clerk and the queens advocate  he was attended by a great crowd of notable citizens but lethington forbade him to preach for a fortnight or three weeks  he said that if the church would command him to preach or abstain he would obey so far as the word of god would permit him  it seems that he would only obey even the church as far as he chose  the town council protested against the deprivation and we do not know how long knox desisted from preaching  laing thinks that till mary fell he preached only at occasional intervals 247b  but we shall see that he did presently go on preaching with lethington for a listener  he published his sermon without name of place or printer  the preacher informs his audience that in the hebrew there is no conjunction copulative in a certain sentence probably he knew more hebrew than most of our pastors  the sermon is very long and wanting the voice and gesture of the preacher is no great proof of eloquence in fact is tedious  probably darnley was mainly vexed by the length though he may have had intelligence enough to see that he and mary were subjects of allusions knox wrote the piece from memory on the last of august in the terrible roaring of guns and the noise of armour  the banded lords moray and the rest had entered edinburgh looking for supporters and finding none  erskine commanding the castle fired six or seven shots as a protest and the noise of these disturbed the prophet at his task  as a marginal note says the castle of edinburgh was shooting against the exiled for christ jesus sake 248anamely at moray and his company knox prayed for them in public and was accused of so doing but lethington testified that he had heard the sermons and found in them no ground of offence 248b  mary stuart  from the portrait in the collection of the earl of morton knox5jpg  moray ochiltree pitarro and many others being now exiles in england whose queen had subsidised and repudiated them and their revolution things went hard with the preachers  for a whole year at least december 156566 their stipends were not paid the treasury being exhausted by military and other expenses and pitarro being absent  at the end of december knox and his colleague craig were ordered by the general assembly to draw up and print a service for a general fast to endure from the last sunday in february to the first in march 1566  one cause alleged is that the queens conversion had been hoped for but now she said that she would maintain and defend 248c her own faith  she had said no less to knox at their first interview but now she had really written when invited to abolish her mass that her subjects may worship as they will but that she will not desert her religion 249a  it was also alleged that the godly were to be destroyed all over europe in accordance with decrees of the council of trent  moreover vice manslaughter and oppression of the poor continued prices of commodities rose and work was scamped  the date of the fast was fixed not to coincide with lent but because it preceded an intended meeting of parliament 249b a parliament interrupted by the murder of riccio and the capture of the queen  no games were to be played during the two sundays of the fast which looks as if they were still permitted on other sundays  the appointed lessons were from judges esther chronicles isaiah and esdras the new testament apparently supplied nothing appropriate  it seldom did  the lay attendants of the assembly of christmas day which decreed the fast were morton mar lindsay lethington with some lairds  the protestants must have been alarmed in february 1566 by a report to which randolph gave circulation that mary had joined a catholic league with the pope the emperor the king of spain the duke of savoy and others  lethington may have believed this at all events he saw no hope of pardon for moray and his abettorsno certain way unless we chop at the very root you know where it lieth february 9 249c  probably he means the murder of riccio not of the queen  bedford said that mary had not yet signed the league 249d  we are aware of no proof that there was any league to sign and though mary was begging money both from spain and the pope she probably did not expect to procure more than tolerance for her own religion 250a  the rumours however must have had their effect in causing apprehension  moreover darnley from personal jealousy morton from fear of losing the seals the douglases kinsmen of morton and darnley and the friends of the exiled nobles seeing that they were likely to be forfeited conspired with moray in england to be darnleys men to slay riccio and to make the queen subordinate to darnley and to fortify and maintain the protestant faith  mary indeed had meant to reintroduce the spiritual estate into parliament as a means of assisting her church so she writes to archbishop beaton in paris 250b  twelve wooden altars to be erected in st giless are said by knoxs continuator to have been found in holyrood 250c  marys schemes whatever they extended to were broken by the murder of riccio in the evening of march 9  he was seized in her presence and dirked by fifty daggers outside of her room  ruthven who in june 1564 had come into marys good graces and morton were with darnley the leaders of the douglas feud and of the brethren  the nobles might easily have taken tried and hanged riccio but they yielded to darnley and to their own excited passions when once they had torn him from the queen  the personal pleasure of dirking the wretch could not be resisted and the danger of causing the queens miscarriage and death may have entered into the plans of darnley  knox does not tell the story himself his history ends in june 1564  but in plain terms he lets the world understand what we mean namely that riccio was justly punished and that the act of the murderers was most just and most worthy of all praise 251a  this knox wrote just after the event while the murderers were still in exile in england where ruthven diedseeing a vision of angels  knox makes no drawback to the entirely and absolutely laudable character of the deed  he goes out of his way to tell us in plain terms what we mean in a digression from his account of affairs sixteen years earlier  thus one fails to understand the remark that of the manner in which the deed was done we may be certain that knox would disapprove as vehemently as any of his contemporaries 251b  the words may be ironical for vehement disapproval was not conspicuous among protestant contemporaries  knox himself after mary scattered the party of the murderers and recovered power prayed that heaven would put it into the heart of a multitude to treat mary like athaliah  mary made her escape from holyrood to dunbar to safety in the night of march 11  march 12 found knox on his knees the game was up the blood had been shed in vain  the queen had not died but was well and surrounded by friends and the country was rather for her than against her  the reformer composed a prayer repenting that in quiet i am negligent in trouble impatient tending to desperation which shows insight  he speaks of his pride and ambition also of his covetousness and malice  that he was really covetous we cannot believe nor does he show malice except against idolaters  he does not doubt himself to be elected to eternal salvation of which he has assured signs  he has knowledge above the common sort of my brethren pride has crept in again and has been compelled to forespeak or prophesy  he implores mercy for his desolate bedfellow for her children and for his sons by his first wife  now lord put end to my misery edinburgh march 12 1566  knox fled from edinburgh with a great mourning of the godly of religion says a diarist on the same day as the chief murderers took flight march 17 his place of refuge was kyle in ayrshire march 21 1566 252a  in randolphs letter recording the flight of these nobles he mentions eight of their accomplices and another list is pinned to the letter giving names of men all at the death of davy and privy thereunto  this applies to about a dozen men being a marginal note opposite their names a line lower is added john knox john craig preachers 252b  there is no other evidence that knox who fled or craig who stood to his pulpit were made privy to the plot  when idolaters thought it best not to let the pope into a scheme for slaying elizabeth it is hardly probable that protestants would apprise their leading preachers  on the other hand calvin was consulted by the wouldbe assassins of the duc de guise in 155960 and he prevented the deed as he assures the duchesse de ferrare the motherinlaw of the duc after that noble was murdered in good earnest 252c  calvin we have shown knew beforehand of the conspiracy of amboise which aimed at the death of antonius obviously guise  he disapproved of but did not reveal the plot  knox whether privy to the murder or not did not when he ran away take the best means of disarming suspicion  neither his name nor that of craig occurs in two lists containing those of between seventy and eighty persons delated and it is to be presumed that he fled because he did not feel sure of protection against marys frequently expressed dislike  in earlier days with a strong backing he had not feared the pleasing face of a gentlewoman as he said but now he did fear it  kyle suited him well because the earl of cassilis who had been an idolater was converted by a faithful bride in august  dr mcrie 253a says that mary wrote to a nobleman in the west country with whom knox resided to banish him from his house  the evidence for this is a letter of parkhurst to bullinger in december 1567  parkhurst tells bullinger among other novelties that riccio was a necromancer who happened to be dirked by whom he does not say  he adds that mary commanded a certain pious earl not to keep knox in his house 253b  in kyle knox worked at his history  on september 4 he signed a letter sent from the general assembly at st andrews to beza approving of a swiss confession of faith except so far as the keeping of christmas easter and other christian festivals is concerned  knox himself wrote to beza about this time an account of the condition of scotland  it would be invaluable as the career of mary was rushing to the falls but it is lost 253c  on december 24 mary pardoned all the murderers of riccio and knox appears to have been present though it is not certain at the christmas general assembly in edinburgh  he received permission to visit his sons in england and he wrote two letters one to the protestant nobles on marys attempt to revive the consistorial jurisdiction of the primate the other to the brethren  to england he carried a remonstrance from the kirk against the treatment of puritans who had conscientious objections to the apparelromish ragsof the church anglican  men ought to oppose themselves boldly to authority that is to queen elizabeth if urged further than their consciences can bear 254a  being in england knox of course did not witness the events associated with the catholic baptism of the baby prince james vi the murder of darnley in february 1567 the abduction of mary by bothwell and her disgraceful marriage to her husbands murderer in may 1567  if knox excommunicated the queen it was probably about this date  long afterwards on april 25 1584 mary was discussing the various churches with waad an envoy of cecil  waad said that the pope stirred up peoples not to obey their sovereigns  yet said the queen a pope shall excommunicate you but i was excommunicated by a pore minister knokes  in fayth i feare nothinge else but that they will use my sonne as they have done the mother 254b     chapter xviii the last years of knox 15671572   the royal quarry so long in the toils of fate was dragged down at last and the doom forespoken by the prophet was fulfilled  a multitude had their opportunity with this fair athaliah and mary had ridden from carberry hill a draggled prisoner into her own town among the yells of burn the harlot  but one out of all her friends was faithful to her mary seton to her immortal honour rode close by the side of her fallen mistress and friend  for six years insulted and thwarted her smiles and her tears alike wasted on greedy faithless courtiers and iron fanatics perplexed and driven desperate by the wiles of cecil and elizabeth in bodily pain and constant sorrowthe sorrow wrought by the miscreant whom she had married without one honest friend mary had wildly turned to the man who it is to be supposed she thought could protect her and her passion had dragged her into unplumbed deeps of crime and shame  the fall of mary the triumph of protestantism appear to have in some degree rather diminished the prominence of knox  he would never make mary weep again  he had lost the protagonist against whom for a while he had stood almost alone and soon we find him complaining of neglect he appeared at the general assembly of june 25 1567a scanty gathering george buchanan a layman was moderator the assembly was adjourned to july 21 and the brethren met in arms wherefore argyll who had signed the band for darnleys murder declined to come 256a  the few nobles the barons and others present vowed to punish the murder of darnley and to defend the child prince and it was decided that henceforth all scottish princes should swear to set forward the true religion of jesus christ as at present professed and established in this realmas they are bound to doby deuteronomy and the second chapter of the book of kings which in fact do not speak of establishing calvinism  among those who sign are morton who had guilty foreknowledge of the murder while his kinsman archibald douglas was present at the doing sir james balfour who was equally involved lethington who signed the murder covenant and douglas of whittingham and ker of faldonside two of riccios assassins  most of the nobles stood aloof  presently throckmorton arrived sent by elizabeth with the pretence at least of desiring to save marys life which but for his exertions he thought would have been taken  he feared knoxs austerity as much as any mans july 14 256b  on july 17 knox arrived from the west where he had been trying to unite the protestants 256c  throckmorton found craig and knox very austere well provided with arguments from the bible history the laws of scotland and the coronation oath 257a  knox in his sermons threatened the great plague of god to this whole nation and country if the queen be spared from her condign punishment 257b  murderers were in the habit of being lightly let off in scotland and as to mary she could easily have been burned for husbandmurder but not so easily convicted thereof with any show of justice  the only direct evidence of her complicity lay in the casket letters and several of her lordly accusers were if she were guilty her accomplices  her prayer to be heard in selfdefence at the ensuing parliament of december was refused for excellent reasons and her opponents had the same good reasons for not bringing her to trial  knox was perfectly justified if he desired her to be tried but several lay members of the general assembly could not have faced that ordeal and randolph later accused lethington in a letter to him of advising her assassination 257c  on july 29 knox preached at the coronation of james vi at stirling protesting against the rite of anointing  true it was jewish but it had passed through the impure hands of rome as by the way had baptism knox also preached at the opening of parliament on december 15  we know little of him at this time  he had sent his sons to cambridge into danger of acquiring anglican opinions which they did but now he seems to have taken a less truculent view of anglicanism than in 155960  he had been drawing a prophetic historical parallel between chatelherault more or less of the queens party and judas iscariot and was not loved by the hamiltons  the duke was returning from france to restore satan to his kingdom with the assistance of the guises  knox mentions an attempt to assassinate moray now regent which is obscure  i live as a man already dead from all civil things  thus he wrote to wood morays agent then in england on the affair of the casket letters september 10 1568  he had already february 14 declined to gratify wood by publishing his history  he would not permit it to appear during his life as it will rather hurt me than profit them his readers  he was very naturally grieved that the conduct of men was not conformable to the truth of god now of some years manifest  he was not concerned to revenge his own injuries by word or writ and he foresaw schism in england over questions of dress and rites 258a  he was neglected  have not thine oldest and stoutest acquaintance moray or kirkcaldy of grange buried thee in present oblivion and art thou not in that estate by age 258b that nature itself calleth thee from the pleasure of things temporal august 19 1569  in trouble impatient tending to desperation knox had said of himself  he was still unhappy  foolish scotland had disobeyed god by sparing the queens life and now the proposed norfolk marriage of mary and her intended restoration were needlessly dreaded  a month later lethington thrown back on mary by his own peril for his share in darnleys murder writes to the queen that some ministers are reconcilable but nox i think be inflexible 259a  a year before knox wrote his melancholy letter just cited he had some curious dealings with the english puritans  in 1566 many of them had been ejected from their livings and like the scottish catholics they assembled in woods and private houses to worship god 259b  the edifying controversies between these precisians and grindal the bishop of london are recorded by strype  the bishop was no zealot for surplices and the other momentous trifles which agitate the human conscience but elizabeth insisted on them and her majestys government must be carried on  the precisians had deserted the english liturgy for the genevan book of common order both sides were appealing to beza in geneva and were wrangling about the interpretation of that pontiffs words 259c  calvin had died in 1564 but the genevan church and beza were still umpires whose decision was eagerly sought quibbled over and disputed the french puritans in fact extremely detested the anglican book of common prayer  thus in 1562 de la vigne a preacher at st lo consulted calvin about the excesses of certain flemish brethren who adhered to a certain bobulary bobulaire of prayers compiled or brewed in the days of edward vi  the calvinists of st lo decided that these flemings must not approach their holy table and called our communion service a disguised mass  the synod calvinistic of poictiers decided that our liturgy contains impieties and that satan was the real author of the work  there are saints days with epistles lessons or gospels as under the papacy  they have heard that the prayer book has been condemned by geneva 260a  the english sufferers from our satanic prayer book appealed to geneva and were answered by beza october 24 1567  he observed who are we to give any judgment of these things which as it seems to us can be healed only by prayers and patience  geneva has not heard both sides and does not pretend to judge  the english brethren complain that ministers are appointed without any lawful consent of the presbytery the english church not being presbyterian and not intending to be  beza hopes that it will become presbyterian  he most dreads that any should execute their ministry contrary to the will of her majesty and the bishops which is exactly what the seceders did  beza then speaks out about the question of costume which ought not to be forced on the ministers  but he does not think that the vestments justify schism  in other points the brethren should in the long run give way to manifest violence and live as private men  other defilements kneeling c  beza hopes that the queen and bishops will remove  men must patiently bear with one another and heartily obey the queens majesty and all their bishops 260b  as far as this epistle goes beza and his colleagues certainly do not advise the puritan seceders to secede  bullinger and gualterus in particular were outworn by the pertinacious english puritans who visited them  one sampson had when in exile made the life of peter martyr a burden to him by his clamours doubts and restless dissatisfaction  england wrote bullinger to beza march 15 1567 has many characters of this sort who cannot be at rest who can never be satisfied and who have always something or other to complain about  bullinger and gualterus were unwilling to contend with these men like fencingmasters tired of their argufying unable to withdraw our entire confidence from the bishops  if any others think of coming hither let them know that they will come to no purpose 261a  knox may have been less unsympathetic but his advice agreed with the advice of the genevans  some of the seceders were imprisoned cecil and the queens commissioners encouraged others to go and preach the gospel in scotland sending with them as it seems letters commendatory to the ruling men there  they went but they were not long away  they liked not that northern climate but in may returned again and fell to their old practices  one of them reported that at dunbar he saw men going to the church on good friday barefooted and barekneed and creeping to the cross  if this be so said grindal the church of scotland will not be pure enough for our men 261b  these english brethren when in scotland consulted knox on the dispute which they made a ground of schism  one brother who was uncertain in his mind visited knox in scotland at this time  the result appears in a letter to knox from a seceder written just after queen mary escaped from lochleven in may 1568  the dubiously seceding brother told the bishop grindal that you are flat against and condemn all our doings    whereupon the church the seceders did excommunicate him  he had reviled the church and they at once caught the excommunicatory fever  meanwhile the earnestly seceding brother thought that he had won knox to his side  but a letter from our reformer proved his error and the letter as the brother writes is not in all points liked  they would not go back again to the wafercake and kneelings the knoxian black rubric had been deleted from elizabeths prayer book and to other knackles of popery  in fact they obeyed knoxs epistle to england of january 1559  mingle mangle ministry popish order and popish apparel they will not bear knoxs arguments in favour of their conforming for the time at all events are quoted and refuted and also concerning paul his purifying at jerusalem  the analogy of pauls conformity had been rejected by knox at the supper party with lethington in 1556  he had doubted whether either jamess commandment or pauls obedience proceeded from the holy ghost 262a  yet now knox had used the very same argument from pauls conformity which in 1556 he had scouted  the mass was not in question in 1568 still if paul was wrong and he did get into peril from a mob how could knox now bid the english brethren follow his example 262b  see pp 6567 supra  to be sure mary was probably at large when knox wrote with 4000 spears at her back  the reformer may have rightly thought it an ill moment to irritate elizabeth or he may have grown milder than he was in 1559 and come into harmony with bullinger  in february of the year of this correspondence he had written god comfort that dispersed little flock apparently the puritans of his old genevan congregation now in england and in trouble amongst whom i would be content to end my days     263a  in january 1570 knox with his one foot in the grave as he says did not despair of seeing his desire upon his enemy  moray was asking elizabeth to hand over to him queen mary giving hostages for the safety of her life  moray sent his messenger to cecil on january 2 1570 and knox added a brief note  if ye strike not at the root he said the branches that appear to be broken will bud again     more days than one would not suffice to express what i think 263b  what he thought is obvious stone dead hath no fellow  but marys day of doom had not yet come moray was not to receive her as a prisoner for the regent was shot dead in linlithgow on january 23 by hamilton of bothwellhaugh to the unconcealed delight of his sister for whom his death was opportune  the assassin bothwellhaugh in may 1568 had been pardoned for his partisanship of mary at knoxs intercession  thy image o lord did so clearly shine on that personage morayhe said in his public prayer at the regents funeral 263cthat the devil and the people to whom he is prince could not abide it  we know too much of moray to acquiesce without reserve in this eulogium  knox was sorely disturbed at this time by the publication of a jeu desprit in which the author professed to have been hidden in a bed in the cabinet of a room while the late regent held a council of his friends 264a  the tone and manner of lindsay wood knox and others were admirably imitated in their various ways and with appropriate arguments some of them urged moray to take the crown for his life  by no people but the scots perhaps could this jape have been taken seriously but with a gravity that would have delighted charles lamb knox denounced the skit from the pulpit as a fabrication by the father of lies  the author the human penman he said according to calderwood was fated to die friendless in a strange land  the galling shaft came out of the lethington quiver it may have been composed by several of the family but thomas maitland who later died in italy was regarded as the author 264b perhaps because he did die alone in a strange country  at this time the castle of edinburgh was held in the queens interest by kirkcaldy of grange who seems to have been won over by the guile of lethington  that politician needed a shelter from the danger of the lennox feud and the charge of having been guilty of darnleys murder  to take the place was beyond the power of the protestant party and it did not fall under the guns of their english allies during the life of the reformer  he had a tedious quarrel with kirkcaldy in december 1570january 1571  a retainer of kirkcaldys had helped to kill a man whom his master only wanted to be beaten  the retainer was put into the tolbooth kirkcaldy set him free and knox preached against kirkcaldy  hearing that knox had styled him a murderer kirkcaldy bade craig read from the pulpit a note in which he denied the charge  he prayed god to decide whether he or knox has been most desirous of innocent blood  craig would not read the note kirkcaldy appealed in a letter to the kirksession  he explained the origin of the trouble the slain man had beaten his brother he bade his agents beat the insulter who drew his sword and got a stab  on this knox preached against him he was told as a cut throat  next sunday knox reminded his hearers that he had not called kirkcaldy a murderer though in the case of the cardinal he was but had said that the lawless proceedings shocked him more than if they had been done by common cutthroats  knox then wrote a letter to the kirksession saying that kirkcaldys defence proved him to be a murderer at heart for st john says that whoso loveth not his brother is a manslayer and kirkcaldy did not love the man who was killed  all this was apart from the question had knox called kirkcaldy a common cutthroat  kirkcaldy then asked that knoxs explanation of what he said in the pulpit might be given in writing as his words had been misreported and knox creeping upon his club went personally to the kirksession and requested the superintendent to admonish kirkcaldy of his offences  next sunday he preached about his eternal ahab and kirkcaldy was offended by the historical parallel  when he next was in church knox went at him again it was believed that kirkcaldy would avenge himself but the western brethren wrote to remind him of their great care for knoxs person  so the quarrel which made sermons lively died out 266  there was little goodwill to knox in the queens party and as the conflict was plainly to be decided by the sword robert melville from the castle advised that the prophet should leave the town in may 1571 the castilian chiefs wished him no harm they would even shelter him in their hold but they could not be responsible for his safety from the multitude and rascal in the town for the craftsmen preferred the party of kirkcaldy  knox had a curious interview in the castle with lethington now stricken by a mortal malady  the two old foes met courteously and parted even in merriment lethington did not mock and knox did not threaten  they were never again to see each others faces though the dying knox was still to threaten and the dying lethington was still to mock  july found knox and his family at st andrews in the new hospice a pre reformation ecclesiastical building west of the cathedral and adjoining the gardens of st leonards college  at this time james melville brother of the more celebrated scholar and divine andrew melville was a golfplaying young student of st leonards college  he tells us how knox would walk about the college gardens exhorting the st leonards lads to be staunch protestants for st salvators and st marys were not devoted to the reformer and his party  the smitten preacher he had suffered a touch of apoplexy walked slowly a fur tippet round his neck in summer leaning on his staff and on the shoulder of his secretary bannatyne  he returned at st andrews in his sermons to the book of daniel with which nearly a quarter of a century ago he began his pulpit career  in preaching he was moderatefor halfanhour and then warming to his work he made young melville shudder and tremble till he could not hold his pen to write  no doubt the prophet was denouncing that last beast the pope and his allies in scotland as he had done these many years ago  ere he had finished his sermon he was like to ding the pulpit to blads and fly out of it  he attended a play written by davidson later a famous preacher on the siege and fall of the castle exhibiting the hanging of his old ally kirkcaldy according to mr knoxs doctrine says melville  this cheerful entertainment was presented at the marriage of john colville destined to be a traitor a double spy and a renegade from the kirk to the synagogue of satan 267a  knox now collected historical materials from alexander hay clerk of the privy council and heard of the publication of buchanans scurrilous detection of queen mary in december 1571 267b  knox had denounced the hamiltons as murderers so one of that name accused our reformer of having signed a band for the murder of darnleynot the murder at kirk o field but a sketch for an attempt at perth  he had an interview with knox not of the most satisfactory and there was a quarrel with another hamilton who later became a catholic and published scurrilous falsehoods about knox in latin  in fact our reformer had quarrels enough on his hands at st andrews and to one adversary he writes about what he would do if he had his old strength of body  not in the regency but mainly under the influence of morton bishops were reintroduced at a meeting of the kirk held at leith in january 1572  the idea was that each bishop should hand over most of his revenues to morton or some other person in power  knox of course objected he preached at st andrews before morton inducted a primate of his clan but he refused to inaugurate the new prelate  the superintendent of fife did what was to be done and a bishop he of caithness was among the men who imposed their hands on the head of the new archbishop of st andrews  thus the imposition of hands which knox had abolished in the book of discipline crept back again and remains in presbyterian usage 268a  had knox been in vigour he might have summoned the brethren in arms to resist but he was weak of body and morton was an ill man to deal with knox did draw up articles intended to minimise the mischief of these bastard and simoniacal bishoprics and abused patronages august 1572 268b  on may 26 1572 he describes himself as lying in st andrews half dead 268c  he was able however to preach at a witch who was probably none the better for his distinguished attentions  on august 17 during a truce between the hostile parties knox left st andrews for edinburgh not without dolour and displeasure of the few godly that were in the town but to the great joy and pleasure of the rest for half dead as he was knox had preached a political sermon every sunday and he was in the pulpit at st giless on the last sunday of august 269a  as his colleague craig had disgusted the brethren by his moderation and pacific temper a minister named lawson was appointed as knoxs coadjutor  late in august came the news of the st bartholomew massacre august 24 knox rose to the occasion and preaching in the presence of du croc the french ambassador bade him tell his king that he was a murderer and that gods vengeance should never depart from him or his house 269b the prophecy was amply fulfilled  du croc remonstrated but the lords answered they could not stop the mouths of ministers to speak against themselves  there was a convention of protestants in edinburgh on october 20 but lords did not attend and few lairds were present  the preachers and other brethren in the assembly proposed that all catholics in the realm should be compelled to recant publicly to lose their whole property and be banished if they were recalcitrant and if they remained in the country that all subjects should be permitted lawfully to put them to death  to invade them and every one of them to the death 269c this was the ideal embodied in law of the brethren in 1560  happily they were not permitted to disgrace scotland by a bartholomew massacre of her own  mr hume brown thinks that these detestable proposals if not actually penned by knox must have been directly inspired by him  he does not however mention the demand for massacre except as pains and penalties for those who preached the old religion 269d  without exception of persons great or small all were to be obliged to recant or to be ruined and exiled or to be massacred  dr mcrie does not hint at the existence of these articles to be given to the regent and council they included a very proper demand for the reformation of vice at home certainly knox did not pen or dictate the articles for none of his favourite adjectives occurs in the document  at this time elizabeth leicester and cecil desired to hand over queen mary to mar the regent to proceed with her by way of justice a performance not to be deferred either for parliament or a great session  very petty sessions indeed if any were to suffice for the trial of the queen 270  there are to be no temporising solemnities all are to be stout and resolute in execution leicester thus writes to an unknown correspondent on october 10  killigrew who was to arrange the business with mar was in scotland by september 19  on october 6 killigrew writes that knox is very feeble but still preaching and that he says if he is not a bishop it is by no fault of cecils  i trust to satisfy morton says killigrew and as for john knox that thing as you may see by my letter to mr secretary is done and doing daily the people in general well bent to england abhorring the fact in france and fearing their tyranny  that thing is not the plan for murdering mary without trial if killigrew meant that he had obtained knoxs assent to that he would not write that thing is doing daily  even morton more scrupulous than elizabeth and cecil said that there must be some kind of process trial proces attended secretly by the nobles and the ministers  the trial would be in marys absence or would be brief indeed for the prisoner was not to live three hours after crossing the border  others unnamed insisted on a trial the queen had never been found guilty killigrew speaks of two ministers as eager for the action but nothing proves that knox was one of them  while morton and mar were haggling for the price of marys blood mar died on october 28 and the whole plot fell through 271  anxious as knox had declared himself to be to strike at the root he could not surely be less scrupulous about a trial than morton though the decision of the court was foredoomed sandys the bishop of london advised that marys head should be chopped off  on november 9 1572 knox inducted mr lawson into his place as minister at st giless  on the 13th he could not read the bible aloud he paid his servants and gave his man a present the last in addition to his wages  on the 15th two friends came to see knox at noon dinner time  he made an effort and for the last time sat at meat with them ordering a fresh hogshead of wine to be drawn  he willed archibald stewart to send for the wine so long as it lasted for he would never tarry until it were drunken  on the 16th the kirk came to him by his desire and he protested that he had never hated any man personally but only their errors nor had he made merchandise of the word  he sent a message to kirkcaldy bidding him repent or the threatenings should fall on him and the castle  his exertions increased his illness  there had been a final quarrel with the dying lethington who complained that knox in sermons and otherwise charged him with saying there is neither heaven nor hell an atheistic position of which see his eloquent prayer before corrichie fight wherein huntly died 272a he was incapable  on the 16th he told the kirk that lethingtons conduct proved that he really did disbelieve in god and a future of rewards and punishments  that was not the question  the question wasdid knox publicly and privately as lethington complained attribute to him words which he denied having spoken asking that the witnesses should be produced  we wish that knox had either produced good evidences or explained why he could not produce them or had apologised or had denied that he spoke in the terms reported to lethington  james melville says that the rev mr lindsay of leith told him that knox bade him carry a message to kirkcaldy in the castle  after compliments it ran he shall be disgracefully dragged from his nest to punishment and hung on a gallows before the face of the sun unless he speedily amend his life and flee to the mercy of god  knox added that mans soul is dear to me and i would not have it perish if i could save it  kirkcaldy consulted maitland and returned with a reply which contained lethingtons last scoff at the prophet  however morton when he had the chance did hang kirkcaldy as in the play acted before knox at st andrews according to mr knoxs doctrine  the preachers clamoured for blood to cleanse blood 272b  as to a secret conference with morton on the 17th the earl before his execution confessed that the dying man asked him if he knew anything of the kings darnleys murder  i answered indeed i knew nothing of itperhaps a pardonable falsehood in the circumstances  morton said that the people who had suffered from kirkcaldy and the preachers daily demanded the soldiers death  other sayings of the reformer are reported  he repressed a lady who he thought wished to flatter him lady lady the black ox has never trodden yet upon your foot  i have been in heaven and have possession and i have tasted of these heavenly joys where presently i am he said after long meditation beholding as in bunyans allegory the hills of beulah  he said the creed which soon vanished from scottish services and in saying our father broke off to murmur who can pronounce so holy words  on november 24 he rose and dressed but soon returned to bed  his wife read to him the text where i cast my first anchor st johns gospel chapter xvii  about halfpast ten he said now it is come and being asked for a sign of his steadfast faith he lifted up one hand and so slept away without any pain 273  knox was buried on november 26 in the churchyard south of st giles  a flat stone inscribed j k beside the equestrian statue of charles ii is reported to mark his earthly restingplace  he died as he had lived a poor man a little money was owed to him all his debts were paid  his widow two years later married andrew ker of faldonside so notorious for levelling a pistol at the queen on the occasion of riccios murder ker appears to have been intimate with the reformer  bannatyne speaks of a story of lady atholls witchcraft told by a mr lundie to knox at dinner at falsyde  this was a way of spelling faldonside 274 the name of kers place hard by the

to join the ettrick     appendix a alleged perfidy of mary of guise   the regent has usually been accused of precipitating or causing the revolution of 1559 by breaking a pledge given to the protestants assembled at perth may 1011 1559  knoxs history and a letter of his are the sources of this charge and it is difficult to determine the amount of truth which it may contain  our earliest evidence on the matter is found in a letter to the english privy council from sir james croft commanding at berwick  the letter of may 19 is eight days later than the riots at perth  it is not always accurately informed croft corrects one or two statements in later despatches but the points corrected are not those with which we are here concerned 275a  neither in this nor in other english advices do i note any charge of ill faith brought against the regent on this occasion croft says that on knoxs arrival many nobles and a multitude of others repaired to dundee to hear him and others preach  the regent then summoned these preachers before her to stirling 275b but as they had a train of 5000 or 6000 she dismissed the appearance putting the preachers to the horn and commanding the nobility to appear before her in edinburgh  the companies then retired and wrecked monasteries at perth  the lords and they had previously sent erskine of dun to the regent offering to appear before her with only their household servants to hear the preachers dispute with the clergy if she would permit  the regent taking displeasure with erskine of dun bade him begone out of her sight  he rode off to perth and she had him put to the horn as a fact he was only fined in his recognisances as bail for one of the preachers  the riots followed his arrival in perth  such is our earliest account there is no mention of a promise broken by the regent  knox himself wrote two separate and not always reconcilable accounts of the first revolutionary explosion one in a letter of june 23 to mrs locke the other in a part of book ii of his history composed at some date before october 23 1559  that portion of his history is an apologia for the proceedings of his party and was apparently intended for contemporary publication 276a  this part of the history therefore as the work of an advocate needs to be checked when possible by other authorities  we first examine knoxs letter of june 23 1559 to mrs locke  he says that he arrived in edinburgh on may 2 and after resting for a day went on may 4 to the brethren assembled at dundee  they all marched to perth meaning thence to accompany the preachers to their day of law at stirling may 10  but lest the proceeding should seem rebellious they sent a baron erskine of dun in fact to the regent with declaration of our minds the regent and council in reply bade the multitude stay and not come to stirling    and so should no extremity be used but the summons should be continued deferred till further advisement  which being gladly granted of us some of the brethren returned to their dwelling places  but the queen and her council nothing mindful of her and their promise incontinent did call summon the preachers and for lack of their appearance did exile and put them and their assistants to the horn     276b  it would be interesting to know who the regents council were on this occasion  the reformer errs when he tells mrs locke that the regent outlawed the assisters of the preachers  dr mcrie publishes an extract from the justiciary records of may 10 in which methuen christison harlaw and willock and no others are put to the horn or outlawed in absence for breach of the regents proclamations and for causing tumults and seditions  no one else is put to the horn but the sureties for the preachers appearance are fined 276c  in his history knox says that the regent when erskine of dun arrived at stirling as an emissary of the brethren began to craft with him soliciting him to stay the multitude and the preachers also with promise that she would take some better order  erskine wrote to the brethren to stay and not to come forward showing what promise and hope he had of the queens graces favours  some urged that they should go forward till the summons was actually discharged otherwise the preachers and their companions would be put to the horn  others said that the regents promises were not to be suspected    and so did the whole multitude with their preachers stay     the queen perceiving that the preachers did not appear began to utter her malice and notwithstanding any request made on the contrary gave command to put them to the horn     erskine then prudently withdrew rode to perth and did conceal nothing of the queens craft and falsehood 277a  in this version the regent bears all the blame nothing is said of the council  the whole multitude stayat perth or it may perhaps be meant that they do not come forward towards stirling  the regents promise is merely that she would take some better order  she does not here promise to postpone the summons and refuses any request made to abstain from putting them to the horn  the account therefore is somewhat more vague than that in the letter to mrs locke  prof hume brown puts it that the regent in her understanding with erskine of dun had publicly cancelled the summons of the preachers for the 10th of may which rather overstates the case perhaps  that she should publicly cancel or discharge the summons was what a part of the brethren desired and did not get 277b  we now turn to a fragmentary and anonymous historie of the estate of scotland concerning which prof hume brown says whoever the author may have been he writes as a contemporary or from information supplied by a contemporary    what inspires confidence in him is that certain of his facts not recorded by other contemporary scottish historians are corroborated by the despatches of doysel and others in teulet 277c  i elsewhere 277d give reasons for thinking that this historie is perhaps the chronicle of bruce of earls hall a contemporary gentleman of fife  i also try to show that he writes on one occasion as an eye witness  this author who is a strong partisan of the reformers says nothing of the broken promise of the regent and council  he mentions the intention to march to stirling and then writes and although the queen regent was most earnestly requested and persuaded to continuethat is to defer the summonsnevertheless she remained wilful and obstinate so that the counsel of god must needs take effect  shortly the day being come because they appeared not their sureties were outlawed and the preachers ordered to be put to the horn  the laird of dun who was sent from perth by the brethren perceiving her obstinacy they who turned from stirling and coming to perth declared to the brethren the obstinacy they found in the queen      this sturdy protestants version which does not accuse the regent of breaking troth is corroborated by a catholic contemporary lesley bishop of ross  he says that erskine of dun was sent to beg the regent not to impose a penalty on the preachers in their absence  but as soon as dun returned and knox learned from him that the regent would not grant their request he preached the sermon which provoked the devastation of the monasteries 278a  buchanan and spottiswoode follow knox but they both use knoxs book and are not independent witnesses  the biographers of knox do not quote the historie of the estate of scotland where it touches on the beginning of the revolution without disparaging the regents honour  we have another dubious witness sir james melville who arrived on a mission from france to the regent on june 13 he left paris about june 1  this is the date of a letter 278b in which henri ii offers the regent every assistance in the warmest terms  melville writes however that in his verbal orders delivered by the constable in the royal presence the constable said i have intelligence that the queen regent has not kept all things promised to them  but melville goes on to say that the constable quoted delboeufs failure to reach scotland with his fleet as a reason for not sending the troops which were promised by henri  as delboeufs failure occurred long after the date of the alleged conversation the evidence of melville is here incorrect  he wrote his memoirs much later in old age but henri may have written to the regent in one sense and given melville orders in another 279a  we find that knoxs charge against the regent is not made in our earliest information crofts letter of may 19 is not made by the protestant and we think contemporary author of the historie and of course is not hinted at by lesley a catholic  we have seen throughout that knox vilifies mary of guise in cases where she is blameless  on the other hand knox is our only witness who was at perth at the time of the events and it cannot be doubted that what he told mrs locke was what he believed whether correctly or erroneously  he could believe anything against mary of guise  archbishop spottiswoode says the author of the story history ascribed to john knox in his whole discourse showeth a bitter and hateful spite against the regent forging dishonest things which were never so much as suspected by any setting down his own conjectures as certain truths yea the least syllable that did escape her in passion he maketh it an argument of her cruel and inhuman disposition     279b  in the ms used by bishop keith 279c spottiswoode added after praising the regent these things i have heard my father often affirm he had the like testimony from an honourable and religious lady who had the honour to wait near her person spottiswoode was therefore persuaded that the history was none of mr knox his writings  in spite of this opinion spottiswoode writing about 162035 accepts most of the hard things that knox says of the regents conduct in 1559 and indeed exaggerates one or two of them that is as relates to her political behaviour for example in the affair of the broken promise of may 10  it may be urged that here spottiswoode had the support of the reminiscences of his father a superintendent in the knoxian church     appendix b forgery procured by mary of guise   in the writers opinion several of knoxs accusations of perfidy against the regent in 1559 are not proved and the attempts to prove them are of a nature which need not be qualified  but it is necessary to state the following facts as tending to show that the regent was capable of procuring a forgery against the duke of chatelherault  a letter attributed to him exists in the french archives 280a dated glasgow january 25 1560 in which the duke curries favour with francis ii and encloses his blank bond un blanc scelle offering to send his children to france 280b  on january 28 the regent writes from scotland to de noailles then the french ambassador to england bidding him to mention this submission to elizabeth and even show the dukes letter and blank bond that elizabeth may see how little he is to be trusted  now how could the regent on january 28 have a letter sent by the duke to france on january 25  she must have intercepted it in scotland 280c  next on march 15 1560 the duke writing to norfolk denies the letter attributed to him by the french 280d  he said that any one of a hundred hamiltons would fight m de seurre the french ambassador who in february succeeded de noailles on this quarrel 280e  there exists a document in the cipher of throckmorton english ambassador in france purporting to be a copy of a letter from the regent to the duc and cardinal de guise dated edinburgh march 27 1560 280f the regent at that date was in leith not in edinburgh castle where she went on april 1  in that letter she is made to say that de seurre has very evil misunderstood the affair of the letter attributed to chatelherault  she had procured blanks of his by one of her servants here at leith to the late bishop of ross the dukes alleged letter and submission of january 25 had been filled up on a blank the duke knowing nothing of the matter  this letter of the regent then must also if authentic have been somehow intercepted or procured by throckmorton in france  it is certain that throckmorton sometimes by bribery did obtain copies of secret french papers but i have not found him reporting to cecil or queen elizabeth this letter of the regents  the reader must estimate for himself the value of that document  i have stated the case as fairly as i can and though the evidence against the regent as it stands would scarcely satisfy a jury i believe that corrupted by the evil example of the congregation the regent in january 1560 did procure a forgery intended to bring suspicion on chatelherault  but how could she be surprised that de seurre did not understand the real state of the case the regent may have explained the true nature of the affair to de noailles but it may have been unknown to de seurre who succeeded that ambassador  yet how could she ask any ambassador to produce a confessed forgery as genuine     footnotes   0a  inventories of mary queen of scots p cxxii

establishment of the new religion  this was refused and the provincial council of march 1559 was called for reform of the clergy  nothing resulted but scandal and popular agitation public preachers

169  it is an inexplicable fact that less than a month before glencairn and lord james signed the first godly band december 3 1557 these two with kirkcaldy of grange were acting with the queendowager against huntly chatelherault and argyll who in december signed with them the godly band  the case is thus stated by mr tytler perhaps too vigorously  it appears that after the refusal of the lords to cross tweed and attack england in the autumn of 1557 the regent with the concurrence of glencairn lord james and kirkcaldy of grange proposed to recall from exile in england the earl of lennox father of darnley he like the chief of the hamiltons had a claim to the crown of scotland failing heirs born of mary stuart  lennox therefore would be a counterpoise to hamilton and his ally in mutiny argyll  thus lord james and glencairn in november 1557 support the regent against the hamiltons and argyll but in december glencairn reconciled to argyll signs with him the godly band  we descry the old
