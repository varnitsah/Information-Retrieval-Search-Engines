                    the daughter of the storage                                     i  they were getting some of their things out to send into the country and forsyth had left his work to help his wife look them over and decide which to take and which to leave the things were mostly trunks that they had stored the fall before there were some tables and colonial bureaus inherited from his mother and some mirrors and decorative odds and ends which they would not want in the furnished house they had taken for the summer there were some canvases which forsyth said he would paint out and use for other subjects but which when he came to look at again he found really not so bad the rest literally was nothing but trunks there were of course two or three boxes of books when they had been packed closely into the fivedollar room with the tables and bureaus and mirrors and canvases and decorative odds and ends put carefully on top the forsyths thought the effect very neat and laughed at themselves for being proud of it  they spent the winter in paris planning for the summer in america and now it had come may a month which in new york is at its best and in the constitutional storage safedeposit warehouse is by no means at its worst the constitutional storage is no longer new but when the forsyths were among the first to store there it was up to the latest moment in the modern perfections of a safedeposit warehouse it was strictly fireproof and its long white brickwalled irondoored corridors with their clean concrete floors branching from a central avenue to the tall windows north and south offered perspectives sculpturesquely bare or picturesquely heaped with arriving or departing household stuff  when the forsyths went to look at it a nice young fellow from the office had gone with them running ahead and switching on rows of electrics down the corridors and then with a wirebasketed electric lamp which he twirled about and held aloft and alow showing the dustless sweetsmelling spaciousness of a perfect fivedollar room he said it would more than hold their things and it really held them  now when the same young fellow unlocked the iron door and set it wide he said he would get them a man and he got mrs forsyth a gilt armchair from some furniture going into an adjoining twentydollar room she sat down in it and of course she said the pieces i want will be at the very back and the very bottom why dont you get yourself a chair too ambrose what are you looking at  with his eyes on the neighboring furniture he answered seems to be the wreck of a millionaires happy home parlor and kitchen utensils and office furniture all in white and gold  horrors yes mrs forsyth said without turning her head from studying her trunks as if she might divine their contents from their outside  tata and i her husband said are more interested in the millionaires things tata it appeared was not a dog but a child the name was not the diminutive of her own name which was charlotte but a generic name for a doll which tata had learned from her italian nurse to apply to all little girls and had got applied to herself by her father she was now at a distance down the corridor playing a drama with the pieces of millionaire furniture as they stretched away in variety and splendor they naturally suggested personages of princely quality and being touched with her little forefinger tip were capable of entering warmly into tatas plans for them  her mother looked over her shoulder toward the child come here tata she called and when tata having enjoined some tall mirrors to secrecy with a frown and a shake of the head ran to her mrs forsyth had forgotten why she had called her oh she said recollecting do you know which your trunk is tata can you show mamma can you put your hand on it  the child promptly put her hand on the end of a small box just within her tiptoe reach and her mother said i do believe she knows everything thats in it ambrose that trunk has got to be opened the very first one  the man that the young fellow said he would send showed at the far end of the corridor smaller than human but enlarging himself to the average irish bulk as he drew near he was given instructions and obeyed with caressing irony mrs forsyths order to pull out tatas trunk first and she found the key in a large tangle of keys and opened it and had the joy of seeing everything recognized by the owner doll by doll cookstove tin dishes small brooms wooden animals on feet and wheels birds of various plumage a toy piano a dustpan alphabet blocks dogseared linen mother goose books and the rest tata had been allowed to put the things away herself and she took them out with no apparent sense of the time passed since she saw them last in the changing life of her parents all times and places were alike to her she began to play with the things in the storage corridor as if it were yesterday when she saw them last in the flat her mother and father left her to them in the distraction of their own trunks mrs forsyth had these spread over the space toward the window and their lids lifted and tried to decide about them in the end she had changed the things in them back and forth till she candidly owned that she no longer knew where anything at all was  as she raised herself for a moments respite from the problem she saw at the far end of the corridor a lady with two men who increased in size like her own man as they approached the lady herself seemed to decrease though she remained of a magnificence to match the furniture and looked like it as to her dress of white picked out in gold when she arrived at the twentydollar room next the forsyths in her advance she had been vividly played round by a little boy who ran forward and back and easily doubled the length of the corridor before he came to a stand and remained with his brown eyes fixed on tata tata herself had blue eyes which now hovered dreamily above the things in her trunk  the two mothers began politely to ignore each other she of the twentydollar room directed the men who had come with her and in a voice of authority and appeal at once commanded and consulted them in the disposition of her belongings at the sound of the mixed tones mrs forsyth signaled to her husband and when he came within whispering murmured pittsburg or chicago did you ever hear such a midwestern accent she pretended to be asking him about repacking the trunk before her but the other woman was not deceived she was at least aware of criticism in the air of her neighbors and she put on greater severity with the workmen the boy came up and caught her skirt what she said bending over no certainly not i havent time to attend to you go off and play dont i tell you no well there then will you get that trunk out where i can open it that small one there she said to one of the men while the other rested for both she stooped to unlock the trunk and flung up the lid now if you bother me any more i will surely but she lost herself short of the threat and began again to seek counsel and issue orders  the boy fell upon the things in the trunk which were the things of a boy as those in tatas trunk were the things of a girl and to run with them one after another to tata and to pile them in gift on the floor beside her trunk he did not stop running back and forth as fast as his short fat legs could carry him till he had reached the bottom of his box chattering constantly and taking no note of the effect with tata then as she made no response whatever to his munificence he began to be abashed and to look pathetically from her to her father  oh really young man forsyth said we cant let you impoverish yourself at this rate what have you said to your benefactor tata what are you going to give him  the children did not understand his large words but they knew he was affectionately mocking them  ambrose mrs forsyth said you mustnt let him  im trying to think how to hinder him but its rather late forsyth answered and then the boys mother joined in  indeed indeed if you can its more than i can youre just worrying the little girl she said to the boy  oh no he isnt dear little soul mrs forsyth said leaving her chair and going up to the two children she took the boys hand in hers what a kind boy but you know my little girl mustnt take all your playthings if youll give her one shell give you one and that will be enough you can both play with them all for the present she referred her suggestion to the boys mother and the two ladies met at the invisible line dividing the fivedollar room from the twentydollar room  oh yes indeed the midwesterner said willing to meet the newyorker halfway youre taking things out i see i hardly know which is the worst taking out or putting in  well we are just completing the experience mrs forsyth said i shall be able to say better how i feel in half an hour  you dont mean this is the first time youve stored i suppose weve been in and out of storage twenty times not in this warehouse exactly weve never been here before  it seems very nice mrs forsyth suggested  they all do at the beginning i suppose if we ever came to the end they would seem nicer still mr breams business is always taking him away it appeared almost instantly that he was the international inspector of a great insurance companys agencies in europe and south america and when i dont go with him it seems easier to break up and go into a hotel than to go on housekeeping i dont know that it is though she questioned its so hard to know what to do with the child in a hotel  yes but he seems the sort that you could manage with anywhere mrs forsyth agreed and disagreed  his mother looked at him where he stood beaming upon tata and again joyfully awaiting some effect with her but the child sat back upon her small heels with her eyes fixed on the things in her trunk and made no sign of having seen the heaps of his gifts  the forsyths had said to each other before this that their little girl was a queer child and now they were not so much ashamed of her apparent selfishness or rude indifference as they thought they were they made a joke of it with the boys mother who said she did not believe tata was anything but shy she said she often told mr bream that she did wish peteryes that was his name she didnt like it much but it was his grandfathers was tata a christian name oh just a pet name well it was prettycould be broken of his ridiculous habit most childrenlittle boys that washeld onto their things so  forsyth would have taken something from tata and given it to peter but his wife would not let him and he had to content himself with giving peter a pencil of his own that drew red at one end and blue at the other and that at once drew a blue boy that looked like peter on the pavement he told peter not to draw a boy now but wait till he got home and then be careful not to draw a blue boy with the red end he helped him put his things back into his trunk and peter seemed to enjoy that too  tata without rising from her seat on her heels watched the restitution with her dreamy eyes she paid no attention to the blue boy on the pavement pictures from her father were nothing new to her the mothers parted with expressions of mutual esteem in spite of their difference of accent and fortune mrs forsyth asked if she might not kiss peter and did so he ran to his mother and whispered to her then he ran back and gave tata so great a hug that she fell over from it  tata did not cry but continued as if lost in thought which she could not break from and that night after she had said her prayers with her mother her mother thought it was time to ask her tata dear why did you act so to that boy today why didnt you give him something of yours when he brought you all his things why did you act so oddly  tata said something in a voice so low that her mother could not make it out  what did you say  i couldnt tell which the child still whispered but now her mothers ear was at her lips  how which  to give him the more i looked and the whisper became a quivering breath the more i couldnt tell which and i wanted to give them all to him but i couldnt tell whether it would be right because you and papa gave them to me for birthday and christmas and the quivering breath broke into a sobbing grief so that the mother had to catch the child up to her heart  dear little tender conscience she said still wiping her eyes when she told the childs father and they fell into a sweet serious talk about her before they slept and i was ashamed of her before that woman i know she misjudged her but we ought to have remembered how fine and precious she is and known how she must have suffered trying to decide  yes conscience the father said and temperament the temperament to which decision is martyrdom  and she will always have to be deciding shell have to decide for you some day as i do now you are very undecided ambroseshe gets it from you                                     ii  the forsyths were afraid that tata might want to offer peter some gift in reparation the next morning and her father was quite ready if she said so to put off their leaving town and go with her to the constitutional storage which was the only address of mrs bream that he knew but the child had either forgotten or she was contented with her mothers comforting and no longer felt remorse  one does not store the least of ones personal or household gear without giving a hostage to storage a pledge of allegiance impossible to break no matter how few things one puts in one never takes everything out one puts more things in mrs forsyth went to the warehouse with tata in the fall before they sailed for another winter in paris and added some old bits she had picked up at farmhouses in their country drives and they filled the room quite to the top she told her husband how tata had entered into the spirit of putting back her trunk of playthings with the hope of seeing it again in the spring and she added that she had now had to take a sevenfifty room without consulting him or else throw away the things they had brought home  during the ten or twelve years that followed the forsyths sometimes spent a whole winter in a hotel sometimes they had a flat sometimes they had a separate dwelling if their housing was ample they took almost everything out of storage once they got down to a twodollar bin and it seemed as if they really were leaving the storage altogether then if they went into a flat that was nearly all studio their furniture went back in a cataclysmal wave to the warehouse where a tendollar room a twelvedollar room would not dam the overflow  tata who had now outgrown her pet name and was called charlotte because her mother felt she ought to be always went with her to the storage to help look the things over to see the rooms emptied down to a few boxes or replenished to bursting in the first years she played about close to her mother as she grew older she ventured further and began to make friends with other little girls who had come with their mothers it was quite safe socially to be in the constitutional storage it gave standing and mrs forsyth fearlessly chanced acquaintance with these mothers who would sometimes be there whole long mornings or afternoons taking trunks out or putting them in with the trunks set into the corridors and opened for them they would spend the hours looking the contents over talking to their neighbors or rapt in long silences when they hesitated with things held off or up and after gazing absently at them putting them back again sometimes they varied the process by laying things aside for sending home and receipting for them at the office as goods selected  they were mostly hotel people or apartment people as mrs forsyth oftenest was herself but sometimes they were separatehouse people among these there was one family not of great rank or wealth but distinguished as lifelong newyorkers in a world of comers and goers of every origin mrs forsyth especially liked them for a certain quality but what this quality was she could not very well say they were a mother with two daughters not quite old maids but on the way to it and there was very intermittently the apparently bachelor brother of the girls at the office mrs forsyth verified her conjecture that he was some sort of minister one could see they were all gentlefolks though the girls were not of the last cry of fashion they were very nice to their mother and you could tell that they must have been coming with her for years  at this point in her study of them for her husbands amusement she realized that charlotte had been coming to the storage with her nearly all her life and that more and more the child had taken charge of the uneventual inspection of the things she was shocked to think that she had let this happen and now she commanded her husband to say whether charlotte would grow into a storage old maid like those good girls  forsyth said probably not before her time but he allowed it was a point to be considered  very well then mrs forsyth said the child should never go again that was all she had strongly confirmed herself in this resolution when one day she not only let the child go again but she let her go alone the child was now between seventeen and eighteen rather tall grave pretty with the dull brown hair that goes so well with dreaming blue eyes and of a stiff grace she had not come out yet because she had always been out handing cakes at her fathers studio teas long before she could remember not doing it and later pouring for her mother with rather a quelling air as she got toward fifteen during these years the family had been going and coming between europe and america they did not know perfectly why except that it was easier than not  more and more there was a peculiarity in the goods selected by charlotte for sending home which her mother one day noted how is it charlotte that you always send exactly the things i want and when you get your own things here you dont know whether they are what you wanted or not  because i dont know when i send them i dont choose them i cant  but you choose the right things for me  no i dont mother i just take what comes first and you always like it  now that is nonsense charlotte i cant have you telling me such a thing as that its an insult to my intelligence do you think i dont know my own mind  i dont know my mind the girl said so persistently obstinately stubbornly that her mother did not pursue the subject for fear of worse  she referred it to her husband who said perhaps its like poets never being able to remember their own poetry ive heard its because they have several versions in their minds when they write and cant remember which theyve written charlotte has several choices in her mind and cant choose between her choices  well we ought to have broken her of her indecision some day it will make her very unhappy  pretty hard to break a person of her temperament forsyth suggested  i know it his wife admitted with a certain pleasure in realizing the fact i dont know what we shall do                                    iii  storage society was almost wholly feminine in rare instances there was a man who must have been sent in dearth of women or in an hour of their disability then the man came hastily with a porter and either pulled all the things out of the rooms so that he could honestly say he had seen them and that the thing wanted was not there or else merely had the doors opened and after a glance inside resolved to wait till his wife or mother or daughter could come he agreed in guilty eagerness with the workmen that this was the only way  the exception to the general rule was a young man who came one bright spring morning when all nature suggested getting ones stuff out and going into the country and had the room next the forsyths original fivedollar room opened as it happened charlotte was at the moment visiting this room upon her mothers charge to see whether certain old scrim sashcurtains which they had not needed for ages but at last simply must have were not lurking there in a chest of general curtainings the forsyths now had rooms on other floors but their main room was at the end of the corridor branching northward from that where the fivedollar room was near this main room that nice new york family had their rooms and charlotte had begun the morning in their friendly neighborhood going through some chests that might perhaps have the general curtainings in them and the scrim curtains among the rest it had not and she had gone to what the forsyths called their old ancestral fivedollar room where that new york family continued to project a sort of wireless chaperonage over her but the young man had come with a porter and with her own porter charlotte could not feel that even a wireless chaperonage was needed though the young man approached with the most beaming face she thought she had ever seen and said he hoped he should not be in her way she answered with a sort of helpless reverberation of his glow not at all she should only be a moment she wanted to say she hoped she would not be in his way but she saved herself in time while with her own eyes intent upon the façade of her room and her mind trying to lose itself in the question which curtaintrunk the scrims might be in she kept the sense of his sweet eyes the merriest eyes she had ever seen effulgent with goodwill and apology and reverent admiration she blushed to think it admiration though she liked to think it so and she did not snub him when the young man jumped about neglecting his own storage and divining the right moments for his offers of help she saw that he was a little shorter than herself that he was very light and quick on his feet and had a round brown face cleanshaven and a round brown head close shorn from which in the zeal of his attentions to her he had shed his straw hat onto the windowsill he formed a strong contrast to the contents of his storeroom which was full mainly of massive white furniture picked out in gold and very blond he said casually that it had been there off and on since long before he could remember and at these words an impression vague inexplicable deepened in charlottes mind  mother she said for she had now disused the earlier mamma in deference to modern usage how old was i when we first took that fivedollar room  she asked this question after she had shown the scrim curtains she had found and brought home with her  why i dont know two or three three or four i should have to count up what makes you ask  can a person recollect what happened when they were three or four  i should say not decidedly  or recollect a face  certainly not  then of course it wasnt mother do you remember ever telling me what the little boy was like who gave me all his playthings and i couldnt decide what to give him back  what a question of course not he was very brown and funny with the beamingest little face in the world rather short for his age i should say though i havent the least idea what his age was  then it was the very same little boy charlotte said  who was the very same little boy her mother demanded  the one that was there today the young man i mean charlotte explained and then she told what had happened with a want of fullness which her mothers imagination supplied  did he say who he was is he coming back tomorrow or this afternoon did you inquire who he was or where  what an idea mother charlotte said grouping the several impossibilities under one head in her answer  you had a perfect right to know if you thought he was the one  but i didnt think he was the one and i dont know that he is now and if he was what could i do about it  that is true mrs forsyth owned but its very disappointing ive always felt as if they ought to know it was your undecidedness and not ungenerousness  charlotte laughed a little forlornly but she only said really mother  mrs forsyth was still looking at the curtains well these are not the scrims i wanted you must go back i believe i will go with you the sooner we have it over the better she added and she left the undecided charlotte to decide whether she meant the scrim curtains or the young mans identity  it was very well for one reason that she decided to go with charlotte that afternoon the newyorkers must have completed the inspection of their trunks for they had not come back their failure to do so was the more important because the young man had come back and was actively superintending the unpacking of his room the palatial furniture had all been ranged up and down the corridor and as fast as a trunk was got out and unlocked he went through it with the help of the storagemen listed its contents in a notebook with a number and then transferred the number and a synopsis of the record to a tag and fastened it to the trunk which he had put back into the room  when the forsyths arrived with the mistaken scrim curtains he interrupted himself with apologies for possibly being in their way and when mrs forsyth said he was not at all in their way he got whiteandgold armchairs for her and charlotte and put them so conveniently near the old ancestral room that mrs forsyth scarcely needed to move hand or foot in letting charlotte restore the wrong curtains and search the chests for the right ones his politeness made way for conversation and for the almost instant exchange of confidences between himself and mrs forsyth so that charlotte was free to enjoy the silence to which they left her in her labors  before i say a word mrs forsyth said after saying some hundreds in their mutual inculpation and exculpation i want to ask something and i hope you will excuse it to an old womans curiosity and not think it rude  at the words old womans the young man gave a protesting oh and at the word rude he said not at all  it is simply this how long have your things been here i ask because weve had this room thirteen or fourteen years and ive never seen your room opened in that whole time  the young man laughed joyously because it hasnt been opened in that whole time i was a little chap of three or four bothering round here when my mother put the things in i believe it was a great frolic for me but im afraid it wasnt for her ive been told that my activities contributed to the confusion of the things and the things in them that shes been in ever since and im here now to make what reparation i can by listing them  shell find it a great blessing mrs forsyth said i wish we had ours listed i suppose you remember it all very vividly it must have been a great occasion for you seeing the things stored at that age  the young man beamed upon her not so great as now im afraid the fact is i dont remember anything about it but ive been told that i embarrassed with my personal riches a little girl who was looking over her dolls things  oh indeed mrs forsyth said stiffly and she turned rather snubbingly from him and said coldly to charlotte i think they are in that green trunk have you the key and stooping as her daughter stooped she whispered really in condemnation and contempt  charlotte showed no signs of sharing either and mrs forsyth could not very well manage them alone so when charlotte said no i havent the key mother and the young man burst in with oh do let me try my masterkey it will unlock anything that isnt a yale mrs forsyth sank back enthroned and the trunk was thrown open  she then forgot what she had wanted it opened for charlotte said theyre not here mother and her mother said no i didnt suppose they were and began to ask the young man about his mother it appeared that his father had died twelve years before and since then his mother and he had been nearly everywhere except at home though mostly in england now they had come home to see where they should go next or whether they should stay  that would never suit my daughter mrs forsyth lugged in partly because the talk had gone on away from her family as long as she could endure and partly because charlottes indecision always amused her she cant bear to choose  really the young man said i dont know whether i like it or not but i have had to do a lot of it you mustnt think though that i chose this magnificent furniture my father bought an italian palace once and as we couldnt live in it or move it we brought the furniture here  it is magnificent mrs forsyth said looking down the long stretches of it and eying and fingering her specific throne i wish my husband could see iti dont believe he remembers it from fourteen years ago it looksexcuse mevery studio  is he a painter not mr forsyth the painter  yes mrs forsyth eagerly admitted but wondering how he should know her name without reflecting that a score of trunktags proclaimed it and that she had acquired his by like means  i like his things so much he said i thought his three portraits were the best things in the salon last year  oh you saw them mrs forsyth laughed with pleasure and pride then as if it necessarily followed you must come to us some sunday afternoon youll find a number of his new portraits and some of the subjects they like to see themselves framed she tried for a card in her handbag but she had none and she said have you one of my cards my dear charlotte had and rendered it up with a severity lost upon her for the moment she held it toward him its mr peter bream she smiled upon him and he beamed back  did you remember it from our first meeting  in their cab mrs forsyth said i dont know whether hes what you call rather fresh or not charlotte and im not sure that ive been very wise but he is so nice and he looked so glad to be asked  charlotte did not reply at once and her silent severity came to the surface of her mothers consciousness so painfully that it was rather a relief to have her explode mother i will thank you not to discuss my temperament with people  she gave mrs forsyth her chance and her mother was so happy in being able to say i wontyour temper my dear that she could add with sincere apology im sorry i vexed you and i wont do it again                                     iv  the next day was sunday peter bream took it for some sunday and came to the tea on mrs forsyths generalized invitation she pulled her mouth down and her eyebrows up when his card was brought in but as he followed hard she made a lightning change to a smile and gave him a hand of cordial welcome charlotte had no choice but to welcome him too and so the matter was simple for her she was pouring as usual for her mother who liked to eliminate herself from set duties and walk round among the actual portraits in fact and in frame and talk about them to the potential portraits peter qualified by long sojourn in england at once pressed himself into the service of handing about the curates assistant mrs forsyth electrically explained that it was one of the first brought to new york and that she had got it at the stores in london fifteen years before and it had often been in the old ancestral room and was there on top of the trunks that first day she did not recur to the famous instance of charlottes infant indecision and peter was safe from a snub when he sat down by the girls side and began to make her laugh at the end when her mother asked charlotte what they had been laughing about she could not tell she said she did not know they were laughing  the next morning mrs forsyth was paying for her sunday tea with a monday headache and more things must be got out for the country charlotte had again no choice but to go alone to the storage and yet again no choice but to be pleasant to peter when she found him next door listing the contents of his mothers trunks and tagging them as before he dropped his work and wanted to help her suddenly they seemed strangely well acquainted and he pretended to be asked which pieces she should put aside as goods selected and chose them for her she hinted that he was shirking his own work he said it was an allsummers job but he knew her mother was in a hurry he found the little old trunk of her playthings and got it down and opened it and took out some toys as goods selected she made him put them back but first he catalogued everything in it and synopsized the list on a tag and tagged the trunk he begged for a broken doll which he had not listed and charlotte had so much of her original childish difficulty in parting with that instead of something else that she refused it  it came lunchtime and he invited her to go out to lunch with him and when she declined with dignity he argued that if they went to the womans exchange she would be properly chaperoned by the genius of the place besides it was the only place in town where you got real strawberry shortcake she was ashamed of liking it all he besought her to let him carry her handbag for her and as he already had it she could not prevent him she did not know really how far she might successfully forbid him in anything at the street door of the apartmenthouse they found her mother getting out of a cab and she asked peter in to lunch so that charlotte might as well have lunched with him at the womans exchange  at all storage warehouses there is a season in autumn when the corridors are heaped with the incoming furniture of people who have decided that they cannot pass another winter in new york and are breaking up housekeeping to go abroad indefinitely but in the spring when the constitutional safedeposit offered ample space for thoughtful research the meetings of charlotte and peter could recur without more consciousness of the advance they were making toward the fated issue than in so many encounters at tea or luncheon or dinner mrs forsyth was insisting on rather a drastic overhauling of her storage that year some of the things by her command were shifted to and fro between the more modern rooms and the old ancestral room and charlotte had to verify the removals in deciding upon goods selected for the country she had the help of peter and she helped him by interposing some useful hesitations in the case of things he had put aside from his mothers possessions to be sold for her by the warehouse people  one day he came late and told charlotte that his mother had suddenly taken her passage for england and they were sailing the next morning he said as if it logically followed that he had been in love with her from that earliest time when she would not give him the least of her possessions and now he asked her if she would not promise him the greatest she did not like what she felt rehearsed in his proposal it was not her idea of a proposal which ought to be spontaneous and unpremeditated in terms at the same time she resented his precipitation which she could not deny was inevitable  she perceived that they were sitting side by side on two of those whiteandgold thrones and she summoned an indignation with the absurdity in refusing him she rose and said that she must go that she must be going that it was quite time for her to go and she would not let him follow her to the elevator as he made some offer of doing but left him standing among his palatial furniture like a prince in exile  by the time she reached home she had been able to decide that she must tell her mother at once her mother received the fact of peters proposal with such transport that she did not realize the fact of charlottes refusal when this was connoted to her she could scarcely keep her temper within the bounds of maternal tenderness she said she would have nothing more to do with such a girl that there was but one such pearl as peter in the universe and for charlotte to throw him away like that was it because she could not decide well it appeared that she could decide wrong quickly enough when it came to the point would she leave it now to her mother  that charlotte would not do but what she did do was to write a letter to peter taking him back as much as rested with her but delaying so long in posting it when it was written that it reached him among the letters sent on board and supplementarily delivered by his room steward after all the others when the ship had sailed the best peter could do in response was a jubilant marconigram of unequaled cost and comprehensiveness  his mother had meant to return in the fall after her custom to find out whether she wished to spend the winter in new york or not before the date for her sailing she fell sick and peter came sadly home alone in the spring mrs breams death brought mrs forsyth a vain regret she was sorry now that she had seen so little of mrs bream peters affection for her was beautiful and spoke worlds for both of them and they the forsyths must do what they could to comfort him  charlotte felt the pathos of his case peculiarly when she went to make provision for goods selected for the summer from the old ancestral room and found him forlorn among his whiteandgold furniture next door he complained that he had no association with it except the touching fact of his mothers helplessness with it which he had now inherited the contents of the trunks were even less intimately of his experience he had performed a filial duty in listing their contents which long antedated him and consisted mostly of palatial bricàbrac and the varied spoils of travel  he cheered up however in proposing to her that they should buy a castle in spain and put them into it the fancy pleased her but visibly she shrank from a step which it involved so that he was as it were forced to say half jokingly half ruefully i can imagine your not caring for this rubbish or what became of it charlotte but what about the owner  the owner she asked as it were somnambulantly  yes marrying him say sometime soon  oh peter i couldnt  couldnt you know thats not playing the game exactly  yes but notnot right away  well i dont know much about it in my own case but isnt it usual to fix some approximate date when should you think  oh peter i cant think  will you let me fix it i must go west and sell out and pull up you know preparatory to never going again we can fix the day now or we can fix it when i come back  oh when you come back she entreated so eagerly that peter said  charlotte let me ask you one thing were you ever sorry you wrote me that takingback letter  why peter you know how i am when i have decided something i have undecided it thats all  from gay he turned to grave i ought to have thought i havent been fair i havent played the game i ought to have given you another chance and i havent have i  why i suppose a girl can always change charlotte said suggestively  yes but you wont always be a girl ive never asked you if you wanted to change i ask you now do you  how can i tell hadnt we better let it go as it is only not hurry aboutaboutmarrying  certainly not hurry about marrying ive wondered that a girl could make up her mind to marry any given man havent you ever wished that you had not made up your mind about me  hundreds of times but i dont know that i meant anything by it  he took her hand from where it lay in her lap as again she sat on one of the whiteandgold thrones beside him and gently pressed it well then lets play we have never been engaged im going west tonight to settle things up for good and i wont be back for three or four months and when i come back well start new ill ask you and you shall say yes or no just as if you had never said either before  peter when you talk like that she saw his brown round face dimly through her wet eyes and she wanted to hug him for pity of him and pride in him but she could not decide to do it they went out to lunch at the womans exchange and the only regret peter had was that it was so long past the season of strawberry shortcake and that charlotte seemed neither to talk nor to listen she ought to have done one or the other  they had left the vaneckens busy with their summer trunks at the far end of the northward corridor where their wireless station had been reestablished for charlottes advantage though she had not thought of it the whole short morning long when she came back from lunch the vaneckens were just brushing away the crumbs of theirs which the son and brother seemed to have brought in for them in a paper box at any rate he was now there making believe to help them  mrs forsyth had promised to come but she came so late in the afternoon that she owned she had been grudgingly admitted at the office and she was rather indignant about it by this time without having been west for three months peter had asked a question which had apparently never been asked before and charlotte had as newly answered it and now mother she said while mrs forsyth passed from indignant to exultant i want to be married right away before peter changes his mind about taking me west with him let us go home at once you always said i should have a home wedding  what a ridiculous idea mrs forsyth said more to gain time than anything else she added everything is at sixes and sevens in the flat there wouldnt be standingroom a sudden thought flashed upon her which because it was sudden and in keeping with her character she put into tentative words youre more at home here than anywhere else you were almost born here youve played about here ever since you were a child you first met peter here he proposed to you here and you rejected him here hes proposed here again and youve accepted him you say  mother charlotte broke in terribly upon her are you suggesting that i should be married in a storage warehouse well i havent fallen quite so low as that yet if i cant have a home wedding i will have a church wedding and i will wait till doomsday for it if necessary  i dont know about doomsday mrs forsyth said but as far as today is concerned its too late for a church wedding peter isnt there something about canonical hours and isnt it past them  thats in the episcopal church peter said and then he asked very politely will you excuse me for a moment and walked away as if he had an idea it was apparently to join the vaneckens who stood in a group at the end of their corridor watching the restoration of the trunks which they had been working over the whole day he came back with mr vanecken and mr vaneckens mother he was smiling radiantly and they amusedly  its all right he explained mr vanecken is a presbyterian minister and he will marry us now  but not here charlotte cried feeling herself weaken  no certainly not the dominie reassured her i know a church in the next block that i can borrow for the occasion but what about the license  it was in the day before the parties must both make application in person and peter took a paper from his breast pocket i thought it might be needed sometime and i got it on the way up this morning  oh how thoughtful of you peter mrs forsyth moaned in admiration otherwise inexpressible and the rest laughed even charlotte who laughed hysterically at the end of the corridor they met the misses vanecken waiting for them unobtrusively expectant and they all went down in the elevator together just as they were leaving the building which had the air of hurrying them out mrs forsyth had an inspiration good heavens she exclaimed and then in deference to mr vanecken said good gracious i mean my husband peter go right into the office and telephone mr forsyth  perhaps mr vanecken said i had better go and see about having my friends church opened in the meanwhile and  by all means mrs forsyth said from her mood of universal approbation  but mr vanecken came back looking rather queer and crestfallen i find my friend has gone into the country for a few days and i dont quite like to get the sexton to open the church without his authority and but new york is full of churches and we can easily find another with a little delay if  he looked at peter who looked at charlotte who burst out with unprecedented determination no we cant wait i shall never marry peter if we do mother you are right but must it be in the old ancestral fivedollar room  they all laughed except charlotte who was more like crying  certainly not mr vanecken said ive no doubt the manager  he never seemed to end his sentences and he now left this one broken off while he penetrated the railing which fenced in the manager alone among a group of vacated desks frowning impatient at some murmured words from the dominie he shouted what and then came out radiantly smiling and saying why certainly he knew all the group as old storers in the constitutional and called them each by name as he shook them each by the hand everything else has happened here and i dont see why this shouldnt come right into the receptionroom  with some paintings of biblical subjects unclaimed from the storage on the walls the place had a religious effect and the manager significantly looked out of it a lingering stenographer who was standing before a glass with two hatpins crossed in her mouth preparatory to thrusting them through the straw she withdrew visibly curious and reluctant and then the manager offered to withdraw himself  no charlotte said surprisingly initiative in these junctures i dont know how it is in mr vaneckens church but if father doesnt come perhaps youll have to give me away at any rate youre an old friend of the family and i should be hurt if you didnt stay  she laid her hand on the managers arm and just as he had protestingly and politely consented her father arrived in a taxicab rather grumbling from having been obliged to cut short a sitting when it was all over and the vaneckens were eliminated when in fact the breams had joined the forsyths at a wedding dinner which the brides father had given them at delmonicos and had precipitated themselves into a train for niagara so banal mrs forsyth said but i suppose they had to go somewhere and we went to niagara come to think of it and its on their way west the brides mother remained up late talking it all over she took credit to herself for the whole affair and gave herself a great deal of just praise but when she said i do believe if it hadnt been for me at the last charlotte would never have made up her mind forsyth demurred  i should say peter had a good deal to do with making up her mind for her  yes you might say that  and for once in her life charlotte seems to have had her mind ready for making up  yes you might say that too i believe she is going to turn out a decided character after all i never saw anybody so determined not to be married in a storage warehouse                                       ii                              a presentiment   over our coffee in the turkish room minver was usually a censor of our several foibles rather than a sharer in our philosophic speculations and metaphysical conjectures he liked to disable me as one professionally vowed to the fabulous and he had unfailing fun with the romantic sentimentality of rulledge which was in fact so little in keeping with the gross superabundance of his person his habitual gluttony and his ridiculous indolence minver knew very well that rulledge was a good fellow withal and would willingly do any kind action that did not seriously interfere with his comfort or make too heavy a draft upon his pocket his selfindulgence which was quite blameless unless surfeit is a fault was the basis of an interest in occult themes which was the means of even higher diversion to minver he liked to have rulledge approach wanhope from this side in the invincible persuasion that the psychologist would be interested in these themes by the law of his science though he had been assured again and again that in spite of its misleading name psychology did not deal with the soul as rulledge supposed the soul and minvers eyes lighted up with a prescience of uncommon pleasure when late one night after we had vainly tried to hit it off in talk now of this now of that rulledge asked wanhope abruptly as if it followed from something before  wasnt there a great deal more said about presentiments forty or fifty years ago than there is now  wanhope had been lapsing deeper and deeper into the hollow of his chair but he now pulled himself up and turned quickly toward rulledge what made you think of that he asked  i dont know why  because i was thinking of it myself he glanced at me and i shook my head  well minver said if it will leave acton out in the cold ill own that i was thinking of it too i was going back in my mind for no reason that i know of to my childhood when i first heard of such a thing as a presentiment and when i was afraid of having one i had the notion that presentiments ran in the family  why had you that notion rulledge demanded  i dont know that i proposed telling the painter said giving himself to his pipe  perhaps you didnt have it rulledge retaliated  perhaps minver assented  wanhope turned from the personal aspect of the matter its rather curious that we should all three have had the same thing in mind just now or rather it is not very curious such coincidences are really very common something must have been said at dinner which suggested it to all of us  all but acton minver demurred  i mightnt have heard what was said i explained i suppose the passing of all that sort of subbeliefs must date from the general lapse of faith in personal immortality  yes no doubt wanhope assented it is very striking how sudden the lapse was everyone who experienced it in himself could date it to a year if not to a day the agnosticism of scientific men was of course all the time undermining the fabric of faith and then it fell in abruptly reaching one believer after another as fast as the ground was taken wholly or partly from under his feet i can remember how people once disputed whether there were such beings as guardian spirits or not that minor question was disposed of when it was decided that there were no spirits at all  naturally minver said and the decay of the presentiment must have been hastened by the failure of so many presentiments to make good  the great majority of them have failed to make good from the beginning of time wanhope replied  there are two kinds of presentiments rulledge suggested with a philosophic air the true and the untrue  like mushrooms minver said only the true presentiment kills and the true mushroom nourishes talking of mushrooms they have a way in switzerland of preserving them in walnut oil and they fill you with the darkest forebodings after youve filled yourself with the mushrooms theres some occult relation between the two think it out rulledge  rulledge ignored him in turning to wanhope the trouble is how to distinguish the true from the untrue presentiment  it would be interesting wanhope began but minver broke in upon him maliciously  to know how much the dyspepsia of our predecessors had to with the prevalence of presentimentalism i agree with you that a better diet has a good deal to do with the decline of the dark foreboding among us what i cant understand is how a gross and reckless feeder like rulledge here doesnt go about like ancestral voices prophesying all sorts of dreadful things  thats rather cheap talk even for you minver rulledge said why did you think presentiments ran in your family  well there you have me rulledge thats where my theory fails i can remember minver continued soberly the talk there used to be about them among my people they were serious people in an unreligious way or rather an unecclesiastical way they were never spiritualists but i dont think there was one of them who doubted that he should live hereafter he might doubt that he was living here but there was no question of the other thing i must say it gave a dignity to their conversation which when they met as they were apt to do at one anothers houses on sunday nights was not of common things one of my uncles was a merchant another a doctor my father was a portraitpainter by profession and a signpainter by practice i suppose thats where i got my knack such as it is the merchant was an invalid rather though he kept about his business and our people merely recognized him as being out of health he was what we could call for that day and regionthe middle west of the early fiftiesa man of unusual refinement i suppose this was temperamental with him largely but he had cultivated tastes too i remember him as a peculiarly gentle person with a pensive cast of face and the melancholy accomplishment of playing the flute  i wonder why nobody plays the flute nowadays i mused aloud  yes its quite obsolete minver said they only play the flute in the orchestras now i always look at the man who plays it and think of my uncle he used to be very nice to me as a child and he was very fond of my father in a sort of filial way my father was so much older i can remember my young aunt and how pretty she was as she sat at the piano and sang and played to his fluting when she looked forward at the music her curls fell into her neck they wore curls then grownup women and though i dont think curls are beautiful my aunts beauty would have been less without them in fact i cant think of her without them  she was delicate too they were really a pair of invalids but she had none of his melancholy they had had several children who died one after another and there was only one left at the time i am speaking of i rather wonder now that the thought of those poor little ghostcousins didnt make me uncomfortable i was a very superstitious boy but i seem not to have thought of them i played with the little girl who was left and i liked going to my uncles better than anywhere else i preferred going in the daytime and in the summertime then my cousin and i sat in a nook of the garden and fought violets as we called it hooked the wry necks of the flowers together and twitched to see which blossom would come off first she was a sunny little thing like her mother and she had curls like her i cant express the feeling i had for my aunt she seemed the embodiment of a world that was at once very proud and very good i suppose she dressed fashionably as things went then and there and her style as well as her beauty fascinated me i would have done anything to please her far more than to please my cousin with her i used to squabble and sometimes sent her crying to her mother then i always ran off home but when i sneaked back or was sent for to come and play with my cousin i was not scolded for my wickedness  my uncle was more prosperous than his brothers he lived in a much better house than ours and i used to be quite awestruck by its magnificence he went east as we said twice a year to buy goods and he had things sent back for his house such as we never saw elsewhere those caskshaped seats of blue china for the verandas and bamboo chairs there were canebottom chairs in the sittingroom such as we had in our best room in the parlor the large pieces were of mahogany veneer upholstered in black haircloth they held me in awe the piano filled half the place the windows came down to the ground and had venetian blinds and lace curtains  we all went in there after the sunday night supper and then the fathers and mothers were apt to begin talking of those occult things that gave me the creeps it was after the rochester knockings as they were called had been exposed and so had spread like an infection everywhere it was as if people were waiting to have the fraud shown up in order to believe in it  that sort of thing happens wanhope agreed its as if the seeds of the ventilated imposture were carried atmospherically into the human mind broadcast and a universal crop of selfdelusion sprang up  at any rate minver resumed instead of the gift being confined to a few personsa small sisterhood with detonating kneejointsthere were rappings in every wellregulated household all the tables tipped people went to sleep to the soft patter of raps on the headboards of their beds and girls who could not spell were occupied in delivering messages from socrates ben franklin and shakespeare besides the physical demonstrations there were all sorts of psychical intimations from the world which weve now abolished  not permanently perhaps i suggested  well that remains to be seen minver said it was this sort of thing which my people valued above the other perhaps they were exclusive in their tastes and did not care for an occultism which the crowd could share with them though this is a conjecture too long after the fact to have much value as far as i can now remember they used to talk of the double presence of living persons like their being where they greatly wished to be as well as where they really were of clairvoyance of what we call mindtransference now of weird coincidences of all kinds of strange experiences of their own and of others of the participation of animals in these experiences like the testimony of cats and dogs to the presence of invisible spirits of dreams that came true or came near coming true and above everything of forebodings and presentiments  i dare say they didnt always talk of such things and im giving possibly a general impression from a single instance everything remembered of childhood is as if from large and repeated occurrence but it must have happened more than once for i recall that when it came to presentiments my aunt broke it up perhaps once only my cousin used to get very sleepy on the rug before the fire and her mother would carry her off to bed very cross and impatient of being kissed good night while i was left to the brunt of the occult alone i could not go with my aunt and cousin and i folded myself in my mothers skirt where i sat at her feet and listened in an anguish of drowsy terror the talk would pass into my dreams and the dreams would return into the talk and i would suffer a sort of double nightmare waking and sleeping  poor little devil rulledge broke out its astonishing how people will go on before children and never think of the misery theyre making for them  i believe my mother thought of it minver returned but when that sort of talk began the witchery of it was probably too strong for her it held her like a two years child i was eight that winter i dont know how long my suffering had gone on when my aunt came back and seemed to break up the talk it had got to presentiments and whether they knew that this was forbidden ground with her or whether she now actually said something about it they turned to talk of other things im not telling you all this from my own memory which deals with only a point or two my father and mother used to recur to it when i was older and i am piecing out my story from their memories  my uncle with all his temperamental pensiveness was my aunts stay and cheer in the fits of depression which she paid with for her usual gaiety but these fits always began with some uncommon depression of hissome effect of the forebodings he was subject to her opposition to that kind of thing was purely unselfish but certainly she dreaded it for him as well as herself i suppose there was a sort of conscious silence in the others which betrayed them to her well she said laughing have you been at it again that poor child looks frightened out of his wits  they all laughed then and my father said hypocritically i was just going to ask felix whether he expected to start east this week or next  my uncle tried to make light of what was always a heavy matter with him well yesterday he answered i should have said next week but its this week now im going on wednesday  by stage or packet my father asked  oh i shall take the canal to the lake and get the boat for buffalo there my uncle said  they went on to speak of the trip to new york and how much easier it was then than it used to be when you had to go by stage over the mountains to philadelphia and on by stage again now it seemed you got the erie canal packet at buffalo and the hudson river steamboat at albany and reached new york in four or five days in great comfort without the least fatigue they had all risen and my aunt had gone out with her sistersinlaw to help them get their wraps when they returned it seemed that they had been talking of the journey too for she said to my mother laughing again well richard may think its easy but somehow felix never expects to get home alive  i dont think i ever heard my uncle laugh but i can remember how he smiled at my aunts laughing as he put his hand on her shoulder i thought it was somehow a very sad smile on wednesday i was allowed to go with my aunt and cousin to see him off on the packet which came up from cincinnati early in the morning i had lain awake most of the night and then nearly overslept myself and then was at the canal in time we made a gay parting for him but when the boat started and i was gloating on the three horses making up the towpath at a spanking trot under the snaky spirals of the drivers smacking whiplash i caught sight of my uncle standing on the deck and smiling that sad smile of his my aunt was waving her handkerchief but when she turned away she put it to her eyes  the rest of the story such as it is i know almost to the very end from what i heard my father and mother say from my uncles report afterward he told them that when the boat started the stress to stay was so strong upon him that if he had not been ashamed he would have jumped ashore and followed us home he said that he could not analyze his feelings it was not yet any definite foreboding but simply a depression that seemed to crush him so that all his movements were leaden when he turned at last and went down to breakfast in the cabin below the stress did not lighten with the little changes and chances of the voyage to the lake he was never much given to making acquaintance with people but now he found himself so absentminded that he was aware of being sometimes spoken to by friendly strangers without replying until it was too late even to apologize he was not only steeped in this gloom but he had the constant distress of the effort he involuntarily made to trace it back to some cause or follow it forward to some consequence he kept trying at this with a mind so tensely bent to the mere horror that he could not for a moment strain away from it he would very willingly have occupied himself with other things but the anguish which the double action of his mind gave him was such that he could not bear the effort all he could do was to abandon himself to his obsession this would ease him only for a while though and then he would suffer the misery of trying in vain to escape from it  he thought he must be going mad but insanity implied some definite delusion or hallucination and so far as he could make out he had none he was simply crushed by a nameless foreboding something dreadful was to happen but this was all he felt knowledge had no part in his condition he could not say whether he slept during the two nights that passed before he reached toledo where he was to take the lake steamer for buffalo he wished to turn back again but the relentless pressure which had kept him from turning back at the start was as strong as ever with him he tried to give his presentiment direction by talking with the other passengers about a recent accident to a lake steamer in which several hundred lives were lost there had been a collision in rough weather and one of the boats had gone down in a few minutes there was a sort of relief in that but the double action of the mind brought the same intolerable anguish again and he settled back for refuge under the shadow of his impenetrable doom this did not lift till he was well on his way from albany to new york by the hudson river the canalboat voyage from buffalo to albany had been as eventless as that to toledo and his lake steamer had reached buffalo in safety for which it had seemed as if those lost in the recent disaster had paid  he tried to pierce his heavy cloud by argument from the security in which he had traveled so far but the very security had its hopelessness if something had happenedsome slight accidentto interrupt it his reason or his unreason might have taken it for a sign that the obscure doom whatever it was had been averted  up to this time he had not been able to connect his foreboding with anything definite and he was not afraid for himself he was simply without the formless hope that helps us on at every step through good and bad and it was a mortal peril which he came through safely while scores of others were lost that gave his presentiment direction he had taken the day boat from albany and about the middle of the afternoon the boat making way under a headwind took fire the pilot immediately ran her ashore and her passengers those that had the courage for it ran aft and began jumping from the stern but a great many women and children were burned my uncle was one of the first of those who jumped and he stood in the water trying to save those who came after from drowning it was not very deep some of the women lost courage for the leap and some turned back into the flames remembering children they had left behind one poor creature stood hesitating wildly and he called up to her to jump at last she did so almost into his arms and then she clung about him as he helped her ashore oh she cried out between her sobs if you have a wife and children at home god will take you safe back to them you have saved my life for my husband and little ones no he was conscious of saying i shall never see my wife again and now his foreboding had the direction that it had wanted before  from that on he simply knew that he should not get home alive and he waited resignedly for the time and form of his disaster he had a sort of peace in that he went about his business intelligently and from habit carefully but it was with a mechanical action of the mind something he imagined like the mechanical action of his body in those organs which do their part without bidding from the will he was only a few days in new york but in the course of them he got several letters from his wife telling him that all was going well with her and their daughter it was before the times when you can ask and answer questions by telegraph and he started back necessarily without having heard the latest news from home  he made the return trip in a sort of daze talking reading eating and sleeping in the calm certainty of doom and only wondering how it would be fulfilled and what hour of the night or day but it is no use my eking this out i heard it as i say when i was a child and i am afraid that if i should try to give it with the full detail i should take to inventing particulars minver paused a moment and then he said but there was one thing that impressed itself indelibly on my memory my uncle got back perfectly safe and well  oh rulledge snorted in rude dissatisfaction  what was it impressed itself on your memory wanhope asked with scientific detachment from the story as a story  minver continued to address wanhope without regarding rulledge my uncle told my father that some sort of psychical change which he could not describe but which he was as conscious of as if it were physical took place within him as he came in sight of his house  yes wanhope prompted  he had driven down from the canalpacket in the old omnibus which used to meet passengers and distribute them at their destinations in town all the way to his house he was still under the doom as regarded himself but bewildered that he should be getting home safe and well and he was refusing his escape as it were and then suddenly at the sight of the familiar house the change within him happened he looked out of the omnibus window and saw a group of neighbors at his gate as he got out of the omnibus my father took him by the hand as if to hold him back a moment then he said to my father very quietly you neednt tell me my wife is dead  there was an appreciable pause in which we were all silent and then rulledge demanded greedily and was she  really rulledge i could not help protesting  minver asked him almost compassionately and with unwonted gentleness as from the mood in which his reminiscence had left him you suspected a hoax she had died suddenly the night before while she and my cousin were getting things ready to welcome my uncle home in the morning im sorry youre disappointed he added getting back to his irony  whatever rulledge pursued became of the little girl  she died rather young a great many years ago and my uncle soon after her  rulledge went away without saying anything but presently returned with the sandwich which he had apparently gone for while wanhope was remarking that want of definition in the presentiment at first and then its determination in the new direction by as it were propinquityit is all very curious possibly we shall some day discover a law in such matters  rulledge said how was it your boyhood was passed in the middle west minver i always thought you were a bostonian  i was an adoptive bostonian for a good while until i decided to become a native newyorker so that i could always be near to you rulledge you can never know what a delicate satisfaction you are  minver laughed and we were severally restored to the wonted relations which his story had interrupted                                      iii                       captain dunlevys last trip     it was against the law in such case made and provided   of the united states but by the good will of the pilots   that we would some of us climb to the pilothouse after our breakfast   for a morning smoke and find ourselves seats on the benching   under the windows or in the wornsmooth armchairs the pilot   which one it was did not matter would tilt his head round and say           all right   when he had seen who we were and begin or go on as from stopping   in the midst of talk that was leading up to a story   just before we came in and the story begun or beginning   always began or ended with some one or something or other   having to do with the river if one left the wheel to the other   going off watch he would say to his partner standing behind him   with his hands stretched out for the spokes that were not given up yet   captain you can tell them the thing i was going to tell them   better than i could i reckon and then the other would answer   well i dont know as i feel so sure of that captain and having   recognized each other so by that courtesy title of captain   never officially failed of without offense among pilots   one would subside into jim and into jerry the other    it was on these terms at least captain dunn relieved captain davis   when we had settled ourselves one day to listen in comfort   after some psychological subtleties we had indulged in at breakfast   touching that weird experience every one knows when the senses   juggle the points of the compass out of true orientation   changing the north to the south and the east to the west why jerry           what was it   you was going to tell them oh never you mind what it was jim   you tell them something else and so captain davis submitted   while captain dunn with a laugh got away beyond reach of his protest   then captain davis with fitting deprecatory preamble   launched himself on a story that promised to be all a story   could be expected to be when one of those womenyou know them   who interrupt on any occasion or none interrupted   pointed her hand and asked oh what is that island there captain   that one maam he gave her the name and then the woman persisted   dont say you know them all by sight yes by sight or by feeling   what do you mean by feeling why just that by daylight we see them   and in the dark its like as if somehow we felt them i reckon   every foot of the channel and change in it washout and cavein   every bend and turn of it every sandbar and landmark   every island of course we have got to see them or feel them   but if you dont but weve got to but arent you ever mistaken   never the second time now what do you mean captain davis   never the second time well let me tell you a story   its not the one i begun but that island you asked about yonder   puts me in mind of it happens to be the place where it happened   three years ago i suppose no man ever knew the ohio   better than captain dunlevy if any one else knew it like him   man and boy he had been pretty much his whole life on the river   cabinboy first on a keelboat before the day of the steamboats   back in the pioneer times and watchman then on a steamboat   then second mate and then mate and then pilot and captain and owner   but he was proudest i reckon of being about the best pilot   on the ohio he knew it as well as he knew his own bible   and i dont hardly believe that ever captain dunlevy   let a single day go by without reading a chapter    while the pilot went on with his talk and in regular rhythmical motion   swayed from one side to the other before his wheel and we listened   certain typical facts of the picturesque life of the river   won their way to our consciousness as without help of our senses   it was along about the beginning of march but already   in the sleepy sunshine the budding maples and willows   where they waded out in the shallow wash of the freshet   showed the dull red and the yellow green of their blossoms and catkins   and in their tops the foremost flocks of blackbirds debated   as to which they should colonize first the indolent houseboats   loafing along the shore sent up in silvery spirals   out of their kitchen pipes the smoke of their casual breakfasts   once a wide tow of coalbarges loaded clear down to the gunwales   gave us the slack of the current with proper formalities shouted   by the hoarsethroated sternwheeler that pushed the black barges           before her   and as she passed us poured a foamy cascade from her paddles   then as a raft of logs which the spread of the barges had hidden   riverwide weltered in sight with a sudden jump forward the pilot   dropped his whole weight on the spokes of the wheel just in time to           escape it    always give those fellows he joked all the leeway they ask for   worst kind of thing on the river you want your boat to run into   where had i got about captain dunlevy oh yes i remember   well when the railroads began to run away from the steamboats   taking the carrying trade in the very edge of the water   it was all up with the old flush times and captain dunlevy   had to climb down with the rest of us pilots till he was only   captain the same as any and every pilot is captain   glad enough too to be getting his hundred and twentyfive dollars   through the months of the spring and fall while navigation was open   never lowered himself though a bit from captain and owner   knew his rights and yours and never would thought of allowing   any such thing as a liberty from you or taking one with you   i had been his cub and all that i knew of the river   captain dunlevy had learnt me and if you know what the feeling   is of a cub for the pilot that learns him the river youll trust me   when i tell you i felt it the highest kind of an honor   having him for my partner and when i came up to relieve him   one day here at the wheel and actully thought that i found him   taking that island there on the left i thought i was crazy   no i couldnt believe my senses and yet i couldnt endure it   seeing him climb the spokes of the wheel to warp the kanawha   with the biggest trip of passengers ever she carried   round on the bar at the left that fairly stuck out of the water   well as i said he learnt me all that i knew of the river   and was i to learn him now which side to take of an island   when i knew he knew it like his right hand from his left hand   my but i hated to speak it certainly seemed like my tongue clove   like the bible says to the roof of my mouth but i had to   captain i says and it seemed like another person was talking   do you usully take that island there on the eastward   yes he says and he laughed and i thought i had learnt you to do it   when you was going up but not going down did you captain   down and he whirled at me and without ever stopping his laughing   turned as white as a sheet and his eyes fairly bulged from their           sockets   then he whirled back again and looked up and down on the river   like he was hunting out the shape of the shore and the landmarks   well i suppose the thing has happened to every one sometime   when you find the points of the compass have swapped with each other   and at the instant youre looking the north and the south have changed           places   i knew what was in his mind as well as dunlevy himself did   neither one of us spoke a word for nearly a minute   then in a kind of whisper he says take the wheel captain davis   let the spokes fly and while i made a jump forwards to catch them   staggered into that chairwell the very one you are in maam   set there breathing quick and when he could speak all he said was   this is the end of it for me on the river jim davis   reached up over his head for his coat where it hung by that window   trembled onto his feet and stopped in the door there a second   stared in hard like as if for goodby to the things he was used to   shut the door behind him and never come back again through it   while we were silent not liking to prompt the pilot with questions   well he said at last it was no use to argue we tried it   in the halfhearted way that people do that dont mean it   every one was his friend here on the kanawha and we knew   it was the first time he ever had lost his bearings but he knew   in such a thing as that that the first and the last are the same time   when we had got through trying our worst to persuade him he only   shook his head and says i am done for boys and you know it   left the boat at wheeling and left his life on the river   left his life on the earth you may say for i dont call it living   setting there homesick at home for the wheel he can never go back to   reads the rivernews regular knows just the stage of the water   up and down the whole way from cincinnati to pittsburg   follows every boat from the time she starts out in the springtime   till she lays up in the summer and then again in the winter   wants to talk all about her and who is her captain and pilot   then wants to slide away to that everlastingly puzzling   thing that happened to him that morning on the kanawha   when he lost his bearings and north and south had changed places   no i dont call that living whatever the rest of you call it   we were silent again till that woman spoke up and what was it   captain that kept him from going back and being a pilot   well maam after a moment the pilot patiently answered   i dont hardly believe that i could explain it exactly                                       iv                            the return to favor   he never by any chance quite kept his word though there was a moment in every case when he seemed to imagine doing what he said and he took with mute patience the rakings which the ladies gave him when he disappointed them  disappointed is not just the word for the ladies did not really expect him to do what he said they pretended to believe him when he promised but at the bottom of their hearts they never did or could he was gentlemannered and softspoken and when he set his head on one side and said that a coat would be ready on wednesday or a dress on saturday and repeated his promise upon the same ladys expressed doubt she would catch her breath and say that now she absolutely must have it on the day named for otherwise she would not have a thing to put on then he would become very grave and his soft tenor would deepen to a bass of unimpeachable veracity and he would say sure lady you have it  the lady would depart still doubting and slightly sighing and he would turn to the customer who was waiting to have a button sewed on or something like that and ask him softly what it was he could do for him if the customer offered him his appreciation of the case in hand he would let his head droop lower and in a yet deeper bass deplore the doubt of the ladies as an idiosyncrasy of their sex he would make the customer feel that he was a favorite customer whose rights to a perfect fidelity of word and deed must by no means be tampered with and he would have the button sewed on or the rip sewed up at once and refuse to charge anything while the customer waited in his shirtsleeves in the small stuffy shop opening directly from the street when he tolerantly discussed the peculiarities of ladies as a sex he would endure to be laughed at for sufferance was the badge of all his tribe and possibly he rather liked it  the favorite customer enjoyed being there when some lady came back on the appointed wednesday or saturday and the tailor came soothingly forward and showed her into the curtained alcove where she was to try on the garments and then called into the inner shop for them the shirtsleeved journeyman with his unbuttoned waistcoatfront all pins and threaded needles would appear in his slippers with the things barely basted together and the tailor would take them with an airy courage as if they were perfectly finished and go in behind the curtain where the lady was waiting in a dishabille which the favorite customer out of reverence for the sex forbore to picture to himself then sounds of volcanic fury would issue from the alcove now mr morrison you have lied to me again deliberately lied didnt i tell you i must have the things perfectly ready today you see yourself that it will be another week before i can have my things  a week oh madam but i assure you  dont talk to me any more its the last time i shall ever come to you but i suppose i cant take the work away from you as it is when shall i have it  tomorrow yes tomorrow noon sure  now you know you are always out at noon i should think you would be ashamed  if it hadnt been for sickness in the family i would have finished your dress with my own hands sure i would if you come here tomorrow noon you find your dress all ready for you  i know i wont but i will come and youd better have it ready  oh sure  the lady then added some generalities of opprobrium with some particular criticisms of the garments her voice sank into dispassionate murmurs in these but it rose again in her renewed sense of the wrong done her and when she came from the alcove she went out of the street door purple she reopened it to say now remember before she definitely disappeared  rather a stormy session mr morrison the customer said  something fierce mr morrison sighed but he did not seem much troubled and he had one way with all his victims no matter what mood they came or went in  one day the customer was by when a kind creature timidly upbraided him this is the third time youve disappointed me mr morrison i really wish you wouldnt promise me unless you mean to do it i dont think its right for you  oh but sure madam the things will be done sure we had a strike on us  well i will trust you once more the kind creature said  you can depend on me madam sure  when she was gone the customer said i wonder you do that sort of thing mr morrison you cant be surprised at their behaving rustily with you if you never keep your word  why i assure you there are times when i dont know where to look the way they go on it is something awful you ought to hear them once and now they want the wote he rearranged some pieces of tumbled goods at the table where the customer sat and put together the disheveled leaves of the fashionpapers which looked as if the ladies had scattered them in their rage  one day the customer heard two ladies waiting for their disappointments in the outer room while the tailor in the alcove was trying to persuade a third lady that positively her things would be sent home the next day before dark the customer had now formed the habit of having his own clothes made by the tailor and his system in avoiding disappointment was very simple in the early fall he ordered a spring suit and in the late spring it was ready he never had any difficulty but he was curious to learn how the ladies managed and he listened with all his might while these two talked  i always wonder we keep coming one of them said  ill tell you why the other said because hes cheap and we get things from a fourth to a third less than we can get them anywhere else the quality is first rate and hes absolutely honest and besides hes a genius the wretch has touch the things have a style a look a hang really its something wonderful sure it iss she ended in the tailors accent and then they both laughed and joined in a common sigh  well i dont believe he means to deceive any one  oh neither do i i believe he expects to do everything he says and one cant help liking him even when he doesnt  hes a good while getting through with her the first lady said meaning the unseen lady in the alcove  shell be a good while longer getting through with him if he hasnt them ready the next time the second lady said  but the lady in the alcove issued from it with an impredicable smile and the tailor came up to the others and deferred to their wishes with a sort of voiceless respect  he gave the customer a glance of goodfellowship and said to him radiantly your things all ready for you this morning as soon as i  oh no hurry the customer responded  i wont be a minute the tailor said pulling the curtain of the alcove aside and then there began those sounds of objurgation and expostulation although the ladies had seemed so amiable before  the customer wondered if they did not all enjoy it the ladies in their patience under long trial and the tailor in the pleasure of practising upon it but perhaps he did believe in the things he promised he might be so much a genius as to have no grasp of facts he might have thought that he could actually do what he said  the customers question on these points found answer when one day the tailor remarked as it were out of a clear sky that he had sold his business sold it to the slippered journeyman who used to come in his shirtsleeves with his vestfront full of pins and needles bringing the basted garments to be tried on the ladies who had been promised them perfectly finished  he will do your clothes all right he explained to the customer he is a firstrate cutter and fitter he knows the whole business  but whywhy the customer began  i couldnt stand it the way them ladies would talk to a person when you done your best to please them its something fierce  yes i know but i thought you liked it from the way you always promised them and never kept your word  and if i hadnt promised them the tailor returned with some show of feeling they wanted me to promise themthey made methey wouldnt have gone away without it sure every one wanted her things before every one you had got to think of that  but you had to think of what they would say  say sometimes i thought they would hit me one lady said she had a notion to slap me once its no way to talk  but you didnt seem to mind it  i didnt mind it for a good while then i couldnt stand it so i sold  he shook his head sadly but the customer had no comfort to offer him he asked when his clothes would be done and the tailor told him when and then they were not the new proprietor tried them on but he would not say just when they would be finished  we have a good deal of work already for some ladies that been disappointed now we try a new way we tell people exactly what we do  well thats right the customer said but in his heart he was not sure he liked the new way  the day before his clothes were promised he dropped in from the curtained alcove he heard low murmurs the voice of the new proprietor and the voice of some lady trying on and being severely bidden not to expect her things at a time she suggested no madam we got too much work on hand already these things they will not be done before next week  i told you tomorrow the same voice said to another lady and the new proprietor came out with an unfinished coat in his hand  i know you did but i thought you would be better than your word and so i came today well then tomorrow  yes tomorrow the new proprietor said but he did not seem to have liked the ladys joke he did not look happy  a few weeks after that the customer came for some little alterations in his new suit  in the curtained alcove he heard the murmurs of trying on much cheerfuller murmurs than before the voice of a lady lifted in gladness in gaiety and an incredible voice replying oh sure madam  then the old proprietor came out in his shirtsleeves and slippers with his waistcoatfront full of pins and needles just like the new proprietor in former days  why the customer exclaimed have you bought back  no im just here like a journeyman already the new man he want me to come he dont get along very well with his way hes all right hes a good man and a firstclass tailor but and the former proprietor looked down at the basted garment hanging over his arm and picked off an irrelevant thread from it he thinks i get along better with the ladies                                       v                            somebodys mother   the figure of a woman sat crouched forward on one of the lowermost steps of the brownstone dwelling which was keeping a domestic tradition in a street mostly gone to shops and small restaurants and local expressoffices the house was black behind its closed shutters and the woman remained sitting there because no one could have come out of its door for a year past to hunt her away the neighborhood policeman faltered in going by and then he kept on the three people who came out of the large oldfashioned hotel half a block off on their way for dinner to a french table dhôte which they had heard of stopped and looked at the woman they were a father and his son and daughter and it was something like a family instinct that controlled them in their pause before the woman crouching on the steps  it was the early dusk of a december day and the day was very chilly she seems to be sick or something the father vaguely surmised or asleep  the three looked at the woman but they did nothing for a moment they would rather have gone on but they waited to see if anything would happen to release them from the spell that they seemed to have laid upon themselves they were conditional newyorkers of long sojourn and it was from no apparent motive that the son wore evening dress which his unbuttoned overcoat discovered and an operahat he would not have dressed so for that problematical french table dhôte probably he was going on later to some society affair he now put in effect the fathers impulse to go closer and look at the woman  she seems to be asleep he reported  shouldnt you think she would take cold she will get her death there oughtnt we to do something the daughter asked but she left it to the father and he said  probably somebody will come by  that we could leave her to the daughter pursued  we could do that without waiting the son commented  well yes the father assented but they did not go on they waited helplessly and then somebody came by it was a young girl not very definite in the dusk except that she was unmistakably of the working class she was simply dressed though with the new york instinct for clothes their having stopped there seemed to stay her involuntarily and after a glance in the direction of their gaze she asked the daughter  is she sick do you think  we dont know whats the matter but she oughtnt to stay there  something velvety in the girls voice had made its racial quality sensible to the ear as she went up to the crouching woman and bent forward over her and then turned to them a street lamp threw its light on her face and they saw that she was a light shade of colored girl  she seems to be sleeping  perhaps the son began shes not quite but he did not go on  the girl looked round at the others and suggested she must be somebodys mother  the others all felt abashed in their several sorts and degrees but in their several sorts and degrees they all decided that there was something romantic sentimental theatrical in the girls words like something out of some cheap storypaper story  the father wondered if that kind of thing was current among that kind of people he had a sort of esthetic pleasure in the character and condition expressed by the words  well yes he said if she has children or has had the girl looked at him uncertainly and then he added but of course  the son went up to the woman again and asked arent you well can we do anything for you it wont do to stay here you know the woman only made a low murmur and he said to his sister suppose we get her up  his sister did not come forward promptly and the colored girl said ill help you  she took one arm of the woman and the son took the other and they lifted her without her connivance to her feet and kept her on them then they walked her down the steps on the level below she showed taller than either of them she was bundled up in different incoherent wraps her head was muffled and she wore a battered bonnet at an involuntary slant  i dont know exactly what we shall do with her the son said  we ought to get her home somehow the daughter said  the father proposed nothing but the colored girl said if we keep walking her along well come to a policeman and we can  a hoarse rumble of protest came from the muffled head of the woman and the girl put her ear closer want to go home well the policeman will take you we dont know where you live and we havent the time  the woman seemed to have nothing to say further and they began walking her westward the colored girl supported her on one hand and the son in his evening dress and operahat on the other  the daughter followed in a vague anxiety but the father went along enjoying the anomaly and happy in his relish of that phrase she must be somebodys mother it now sounded to him like a catch from one of those new york songs popular in the order of life where the mother represents what is best and holiest he recalled a vaudeville ballad with the refrain of a boys best friend is his mother which when he heard it in a vaudeville theater threatened the gallery floor under the applauding feet of the frenzied audience probably this colored girl belonged to that order of life he wished he could know her social circumstance and what her outlook on the greater world might be she seemed a kind creature poor thing and he respected her somebodys motherhe liked that  they all walked westward aimlessly except that the table dhôte where they had meant to dine was in that direction they had heard of it as an amusingly harmless french place and they were fond of such mild adventures  the old woman contributed nothing to the definition of their progress she stumbled and mumbled along but between seventh avenue and eighth she stubbornly arrested her guardians she saysthe colored girl translated some obscure avowal across her backshe says she wants to go home and she lives up in harlem  oh well thats good the father said with an optimistic amiability wed better help walk her across to ninth avenue and put her on a car and tell the conductor where to let her off  he was not helping walk her himself but he enjoyed his sons doing it in evening dress and operahat with that kind colored girl on the other side of the mother the composition was agreeably droll the daughter did not like it and she cherished the ideal of a passing policeman to take the old woman in charge  no policeman passed though great numbers of other people met them without apparently finding anything noticeable in the spectacle which their group presented among the crowds going and coming on the avenues which they crossed scarcely any turned to look at them or was moved by the sense of anything odd in them  the old woman herself did nothing to attract public notice till they were midway between seventh and eighth avenues she mumbled something from time to time which the colored girl interpreted to the rest as her continued wish to go home she was now clearer about her street and number the girl as if after question of her own generous spirit said she did not see how she could go with her she was expected at home herself  oh you wont have to go with her well just put her aboard the ninth avenue car the father encouraged her he would have encouraged any one he was enjoying the whole affair  at a certain moment for no apparent reason the mother decided to sit down on a doorstep it proved to be the doorstep of a house where from time to time colored peoplesometimes of one sex sometimes of anotherwent in or came out the door seemed to open directly into a large room where dancing and dining were going on concurrently at a long table colored people sat eating and behind their chairs on both sides of the room and at the ends of the table colored couples were waltzing  the effect was the more curious because except for some almost inaudible music the scene passed in silence those who were eating were not visibly incommoded by those revolving at their backs the waltzers turned softly around and around untempted by the table now before them now behind them when some of the diners or dancers came out they stumbled over the old woman on the doorstep without minding or stopping to inquire those outside when they went in fell over her with like equanimity and joined the strange company within  the father murmured to himself the lines            vast forms that move fantastically              to a discordant melody  with a remote trouble of mind because the words were at once so graphic and yet so imperfectly applicable the son and daughter exchanged a silent wonder as long as they could bear it then the daughter asked the colored girl  what is it  its a boardinghouse the girl answered simply  oh the daughter said  sounds of more decided character than before now came from the figure on the doorstep  she seems to be saying something the daughter suggested in general terms what is she saying she asked the colored girl  the girl stooped over and listened then she answered shes swearing  swearing what about whom is she swearing at  at me i reckon she says why dont i take her home  well why doesnt she get up then  she says she wont  we cant carry her to the car the daughter noted  oh why not the father merrily demanded  the daughter turned to her brother they were both very respectful to their father but the son agreed with his sister when she said papa would joke about anything but this has passed a joke we must get this old thing up and start her off  upon experiment they could not get the old thing up even with the help of the kind colored girl they had to let her be and the colored girl reported after stooping over her again she says she cant walk  she walked here well enough the daughter said  not very well the father amended  his daughter did not notice him she said to her brother well now you must go and find a policeman its strange none has gone by  it was also strange that still their group remained without attracting the notice of the passers nobody stopped to speak or even stare perhaps the phenomena of that boardinghouse had ceased to have surprises for the public of the neighborhood and they in their momentary relation to it would naturally be without interest  the brother went away leaving his sister with their father and that kind colored creature in charge of the old woman now more and more quiescent on the doorstep she had ceased to swear or even to speak the brother came back after a time that seemed long and said that he could not find a policeman anywhere and at the same moment as if the officer had been following at his heels a policeman crossed the street from just behind him  the daughter ran after him and asked if he would not come and look at the old woman who had so steadfastly remained in their charge and she rapidly explained  sure lady the policeman said and he turned from crossing the street and went up to the old woman he laid his hand on her shoulder and his touch seemed magical whats the matter cant you stand up she stood up as if at something familiar in the voice of authority where do you live she gave an address altogether different from that she had given beforea place on the next avenue within a block or two youd better go home you can walk cant you  i can walk well enough she answered in a tone of vexation and she made her word good by walking quite actively away in the direction she had given  the kind colored girl became a part of the prevalent dark after refusing the thanks of the others the daughter then fervently offered them to the policeman  thats all right lady he said and the incident had closed except for her emotion at seeing him enter a policestation precisely across the street where they could have got a dozen policemen in a moment  well the father said we might as well go to our french table dhôte now  oh the son said as if that reminded him the place seems to be shut  well then we might as well go back to the hotel the father decided i dare say we shall do quite as well there  on the way the young people laughed over the affair and their escape from it especially at the strange appearance and disappearance of the kind colored girl with her tag of sentiment and at the instant compliance of the old woman with the suggestion of the policeman  the father followed turning the matter over in his mind did mere motherhood hallow that old thing to the colored girl and her sort and condition was there a superstition of motherhood among such people which would endear this disreputable old thing to their affection and reverence did such people hold mothers in tenderer regard than people of larger means would a mother in distress or merely embarrassment instantly appeal to their better nature as a case of want or sickness in the neighborhood always appealed to their compassion would her family now welcome the old thing home from her aberration more fondly than the friends of one who had arrived in a carriage among them in a good street but after all how little one knew of other people how little one knew of one self for that matter how next to nothing one knew of somebodys mother it did not necessarily follow from anything they knew of her that she was a mother at all her motherhood might be the mere figment of that kind colored girls emotional fancy she might be nobodys mother  when it came to this the father laughed too why anyhow were mothers more sacred than fathers if they had found an old man in that old womans condition on those steps would that kind colored girl have appealed to them in his behalf as somebodys father                                       vi                          the face at the window     he had gone down at christmas where our host   had opened up his house on the maine coast   for the weeks holidays and we were all   on christmas night sitting in the great hall   about the corner fireplace while we told   stories like those that people young and old   have told at christmas firesides from the first   till one who crouched upon the hearth and nursed   his knees in his claspt arms threw back his head   and fixed our host with laughing eyes and said   this is so good herewith your hickory logs   blazing like naturalgas ones on the dogs   and sending out their flicker on the wall   and rafters of your mockbaronial hall   all in fumedoak and on your polished floor   and the steelstudded panels of your door   i think you owe the general makebelieve   some sort of story that will somehow give   a more ideal completeness to our case   and make each several listener in his place   or herssit up with a real gooseflesh creeping   all over himor herin proper keeping   with the locality and hour and mood   come and amid the cries of yes and good   our host laughed back then with a serious air   looked around him on our hemicycle where   he sat midway of it why he began   but interrupted by the other man   he paused for him to say nothing remote   but something with the actual yankee note   of here and now in it ill do my best   our host replied to satisfy a guest   what do you say to barberry cove and would   five years be too long past no both are good   go on you noticed that big house today   close to the water and the sloop that lay   stripped for the winter there beside the pier   well there she has lain just so year after year   and she will never leave her pier again   but once each spring she sailed in sun or rain   for bay chaleuror bay shaloor as they   like better to pronounce it down this way    i like shaloor myself rather the best   but go ahead said the exacting guest   and with a glance around at us that said   dont let me bore you our host went ahead    captain gilroy built the big house and he   still lives there with his aging family   he built the sloop and when he used to come   back from the banks he made her more his home   with his two boys than the big house the two   counted with him a good half of her crew   until it happened on the banks one day   the oldest boy got in a steamers way   and went down in his dory in the fall   the others came without him that was all   that showed in either one of them except   that now the father and the brother slept   ashore and not on board when the spring came   they sailed for the old fishingground the same   as ever yet not quite the same the brother   if you believed what folks say kissed his mother   goodby in going and by general rumor   the father so far yielding as to humor   his daughters weakness rubbed his stubbly cheek   against their lips neither of them would speak   but the dumb passion of their love and grief   in so much show at parting found relief    the weeks passed and the months sometimes they heard   at home by letter from the sloop or word   of hearsay from the fleet but by and by   along about the middle of july   a time in which they had no news began   and holding unbrokenly through august ran   into september then one afternoon   while the world hung between the sun and moon   and while the mother and her girls were sitting   together with their sewing and their knitting   before the earlycoming evenings gloom   had gathered round them in the livingroom   helplessly wondering to each other when   they should hear something from their absent men   they saw all three against the windowpane   a face that came and went and came again   three times as though for each of them about   as high up from the porchs floor without   as a mans head would be that stooped to stare   into the room on their own level there   its eyes dwelt on them wistfully as if   longing to speak with the dumb lips some grief   they could not speak the women did not start   or scream though each one of them in her heart   knew she was looking on no living face   but stared as dumb as it did in her place    here our host paused and one sigh broke from all   our circle whom his tale had held in thrall   but he who had required it of him spoke   in what we others felt an illtimed joke   well this is something like a girl said dont   as if it hurt and he said well i wont   go on and in a sort of muse our host   said i suppose we all expect a ghost   will sometimes come to us but i doubt if we   are moved by its coming as we thought to be   at any rate the women were not scared   but as i said they simply sat and stared   till the face vanished then the mother said   it was your father girls and he is dead   but both had known him and now all went on   much as before till three weeks more were gone   when one night sitting as they sat before   together with their mother at the door   they heard a fumbling hand and on the walk   up from the pier the tramp and muffled talk   of different windblown voices that they knew   for the hoarse voices of their fathers crew   then the door opened and their father stood   before them palpably in flesh and blood   the mother spoke for all her own misgiving   father is this your ghost or are you living   i am alive but in this very place   we saw your face look like a spirits face   there through that window just three weeks ago   and now you are alive i did not know   that i had come all i know is that then   i wanted to tell you folks here that our ben   was dying of typhoid fever he raved of you   so that i could not think what else to do   hes there in bay shaloor                          well thats the end   and rising up to mend the fire our friend   seemed trying to shun comment but in vain   the exacting guest came at him once again   you must be going to fall down i thought   there at the climax when your story brought   the skipper home alive and well but no   you saved yourself with honor the girl said oh   who spoke before its wonderful but you   how could you think of anything so true   so delicate as the fathers wistful face   coming there at the window in the place   of the dead sons and then that quaintest touch   of halfapologythat he felt so much   he had to come how perfectly new england well   i hope nobody will undertake to tell   a common or garden ghoststory tonight    our host had turned again and at her light   and playful sympathy he said my dear   i hope that no one will imagine here   i have been inventing in the tale thats done   my little storys charm if it has one   is from no skill of mine one does not change   the course of fable from its wonted range   to such effect as i have seemed to do   only the fact could make my story true                                      vii                              an experience   for a long time after the event my mind dealt with the poor man in helpless conjecture and it has now begun to do so again for no reason that i can assign all that i ever heard about him was that he was some kind of insurance man whether life fire or marine insurance i never found out and i am not sure that i tried to find out  there was something in the event which discharged him of all obligation to define himself of this or that relation to life he must have had some relation to it such as we all bear and since the question of him has come up with me again i have tried him in several of those relationsfather son brother husbandwithout identifying him very satisfyingly in either  as i say he seemed by what happened to be liberated from the debt we owe in that kind to one anothers curiosity sympathy or whatever i cannot say what errand it was that brought him to the place a strange large indeterminate open room where several of us sat occupied with different sorts of business but as it seems to me now by only a provisional right to the place certainly the corner allotted to my own editorial business was of temporary assignment i was there until we could find a more permanent office the man had nothing to do with me or with the publishers he had no manuscript or plan for an article which he wished to propose and to talk himself into writing so that he might bring it with a claim to acceptance as though he had been asked to write it in fact he did not even look of the writing sort and his affair with some other occupant of that anomalous place could have been in no wise literary probably it was some kind of insurance business and i have been left with the impression of fussiness in his conduct of it he had to my involuntary attention an effect of conscious unwelcome with it  after subjectively dealing with this impression i ceased to notice him without being able to give myself to my own work the day was choking hot of a damp that clung about one and forbade one so much effort as was needed to relieve one of ones discomfort to pull at ones wilted collar and loosen the linen about ones reeking neck meant exertion which one willingly forbore it was less suffering to suffer passively than to suffer actively the day was of the sort which begins with a brisk heat and then with a falling breeze decays into mere swelter to come indoors out of the sun was no escape from the heat my window opened upon a shaded alley where the air was damper without being cooler than the air within  at last i lost myself in my work with a kind of humid interest in the psychological inquiry of a contributor who was dealing with a matter rather beyond his power i did not think that he was fortunate in having cast his inquiry in the form of a story i did not think that his contrast of love and death as the supreme facts of life was what a subtler or stronger hand could have made it or that the situation gained in effectiveness from having the hero die in the very moment of his acceptance in his supposition that the reader would care more for his hero simply because he had undergone that tremendous catastrophe the writer had omitted to make him interesting otherwise perhaps he could not  my mind began to wander from the story and not very relevantly to employ itself with the question of how far our experiences really affect our characters i remembered having once classed certain temperaments as the stuff of tragedy and others as the stuff of comedy and of having found a greater cruelty in the sorrows which light natures undergo as unfit and disproportionate for them disaster i tacitly decided was the fit lot of serious natures when it befell the frivolous it was more than they ought to have been made to bear it was not of their quality then by the mental zigzagging which all thinking is i thought of myself and whether i was of this make or that if it was more creditable to be of serious stuff than frivolous though i had no agency in choosing i asked myself how i should be affected by the sight of certain things like the common calamities reported every day in the papers which i had hitherto escaped seeing by another zigzag i thought that i had never known a day so close and stifling and humid i then reflected upon the comparative poverty of the french language which i was told had only that one word for the condition we could call by half a dozen different names as humid moist damp sticky reeking sweltering and so on i supposed that a book of synonyms would give even more english adjectives i thought of looking but my book of synonyms was at the back of my table and i would have to rise for it then i questioned whether the french language was so destitute of adjectives after all i preferred to doubt it rather than rise  with no more logic than those other vagaries had i realized that the person who had started me in them was no longer in the room he must have gone outdoors and i visualized him in the street pushing about crowded hither and thither and striking against other people as he went and came i was glad i was not in his place i believed i should have fallen in a faint from the heat as i had once almost done in new york on a day like that from this my mind jumped to the thought of sudden death in general was it such a happy thing as people pretended for the person himself yes perhaps but not for those whom he had left at home say in the morning and who were expecting him at home in the evening i granted that it was generally accepted as the happiest death but no one that had tried it had said so to be sure one was spared a long sickness with suffering from pain and from the fear of death but one had no time for making ones peace with god as it used to be said and after all there might be something in deathbed repentance although cultivated people no longer believed in it then i reverted to the family unprepared for the sudden death the mother the wife the children i struggled to get away from the question but the vagaries which had lightly dispersed themselves before clung persistently to the theme now i felt that it was like a bad dream that was a promising diversion had one any sort of volition in the quick changes of dreams one was aware of finding a certain nightmare insupportable and of breaking from it as by main force and then falling into a deep sweet sleep was death something like waking from a dream such as that which this life largely was and then sinking into a long restful slumber and possibly never waking again  suddenly i perceived that the man had come back he might have been there some time with his effect of fussing and his pathetic sense of unwelcome i had not noticed i only knew that he stood at the halfopen door with the knob of it in his hand looking into the room blankly  as he stood there he lifted his hand and rubbed it across his forehead as if in a sort of daze from the heat i recognized the gesture as one very characteristic of myself i had often rubbed my hand across my forehead on a close hot day like that then the man suddenly vanished as if he had sunk through the floor  people who had not noticed that he was there noticed now that he was not there some made a crooked rush toward the place where he had been and one of those helpful fellowmen who are first in all needs lifted his head and mainly carried him into the wide space which the street stairs mounted to and laid him on the floor it was darker if not cooler there and we stood back to give him the air which he drew in with long deep sighs one of us ran down the stairs to the street for a doctor wherever he might be found and ran against a doctor at the last step  the doctor came and knelt over the prostrate figure and felt its pulse and put his ear down to its heart it which has already in my telling ceased to be he drew its breath in those long suspirations which seemed to search each more profoundly than the last the lurking life drawing it from the vital recesses and expelling it in those vast sighs  they went on and on and established in our consciousness the expectation of indefinite continuance we knew that the figure there was without such consciousness as ours unless it was something so remotely withdrawn that it could not manifest itself in any signal to our senses there was nothing tragical in the affair but it had a surpassing dignity it was as if the figure was saying something to the life in each of us which none of us would have words to interpret speaking some last message from the hither side of that bourne from which there is no returning  there was a clutch upon my heart which tightened with the slower and slower succession of those awful breaths then one was drawn and expelled and then another was not drawn i waited for the breathing to begin again and it did not begin the doctor rose from kneeling over the figure that had been a man and uttered with a kind of soundlessness gone and mechanically dusted his fingers with the thumbs of each hand from their contact with what had now become all dust forever  that helpfulest one among us laid a cloth over the face and the rest of us went away it was finished the man was done with the sorrow which in our sad human order must now begin for those he loved and who loved him i tried vaguely to imagine their grief for not having been uselessly with him at the last and i could not the incident remained with me like an experience something i had known rather than seen i could not alienate it by my pity and make it anothers they whom it must bereave seemed for the time immeasurably removed from the fact                                      viii                               the boarders   the boarder who had eloped was a student at the theological seminary and he had really gone to visit his family so that he had a fairly good conscience in giving this color to the fact that he was leaving the place permanently because he could not bear it any longer it was a shade of deceit to connive with his roommate for the custody of his carpetbag and the few socks and collars and the one shirt and summer coat which did not visibly affect its lankness when gathered into it from his share of the bureaudrawers but he did not know what else to do and he trusted to a final forgiveness when all the facts were considered by a merciful providence his board was fully paid and he had suffered long he argued with his roommate that he could do no good by remaining and that he would have stayed if he could have believed there was any use besides the food was undermining his health and the room with that broken window had given him a cold already he had a right to go and it was his duty to himself and the friends who were helping him through the seminary not to get sick  he did not feel that he had convinced his roommate who took charge of his carpetbag and now sat with it between his feet waiting the signal of the fugitives surreptitious return for it he was a vaguelooking young man presently in charge of the local and literary column of the one daily paper of the place and he had just explained to the two other boarders who were watching with him for the event that he was not certain whether it was the supper or the anxiety of the situation or just what it was that was now affecting his digestion  the fellowboarders who sat on the edge of the bed in default of the one unbroken chair which their host kept for himself as easier than a mattress to get up from suddenly did not take sides for or against him in his theories of his discomfort one of them glanced at the broken window  how do you glaze that in the daytime you cant use the bolster then  im not in much in the daytime  it was a medical student who had spoken but he was now silent and the other said after they had listened to the twitter of a piano in the parlor under the room that girls playing will be the death of me  not if her mothers cooking isnt the medical student whose name was wallace observed with a professional effect  why dont you prescribe something for it the law student suggested  which wallace returned  i dont believe anything could cure the playing i must have meant the cooking  youre a promising young jurist blakeley what makes you think i could cure the cooking  oh i just wondered the sick one gets paler every day i wonder what ails her  shes not my patient  oh hippocratic oath rather fine of you wallace but if shes not your patient  listen their host interrupted sharply after a joint silence he added no it must have been the sleet  well briggs the law student said if it must have been the sleet what mustnt it have been  oh briggs explained i thought it was phillips he was to throw a handful of gravel at the window  and then you were to run down with his bag and help him to make his escape from a friendless widow well i dont know that i blame him if i didnt owe two weeks board id leave myselfthough i hope i shouldnt sneak away and if mrs betterson didnt owe wallace here two weeks board wed walk off together arminarm at high noon i cant understand how he ever came to advance her the money  wallace rose from the bed and kicked each leg out to dislodge the tight trousers of the middle eighteenfifties which had caught on the tops of his high boots youre a tonguey fellow blakeley but youll find as you live long that there are several things you cant explain  ill tell you what blakeley said well get mrs betterson to take your loan for my debt and well go at once  you can propose something like that before the justice of the peace in your first pettifogging case  i believe wallace likes to stay and yet he must know from his anatomical studies better than the animals themselves what cuts of meat the old lady gives us i shouldnt be so fastidious about the cuts if she didnt treat them all with pork gravy well i mustnt be too hard on a lone widow that i owe board to i dont suppose his diet had anything to do with the deep damnation of the late bettersons taking off does that stove of yours smoke briggs  not when there isnt a fire in it  i just asked wallaces stove smokes fire or no fire it takes advantage of the old ladys indebtedness to him there seem he added philosophically to be just two occupations open to widows who have to support themselves millinery business for young ones boardinghousing for old ones it is rather restricted what do you suppose she puts into the mincepies mincepies are rather a mystery at the best  wallace was walking up and down the room still in some difficulty with his trouserslegs and kicking out from time to time to dislodge them how long should you say blakeley had been going on he asked briggs  you never can tell briggs responded i think he doesnt know himself  well said youthful scribe with such listeners as you two i could go on forever consider yourselves clapped jovially on the back my gentle briggs i cant get up to do it from the hollow of your bed here as you were saying the wonder about these elderly widows who keep boardinghouses is the domestic dilapidation they fall into if theyve ever known how to cook a meal or sweep a room or make a bed these arts desert them in the presence of their boarders their only aim in life seems to be preventing the escape of their victims and they either let them get into debt for their board or borrow money from them but why do they always have daughters and just two of them one beautiful fashionable and devoted to the piano the other willing to work but pale pathetic and incapable of the smallest achievement with the gridiron or the washboard its a thing to make a person want to pay up and leave even if hes reading law if wallace here had the spirit of a man he would collect the money owing him and  oh stop it blakeley wallace stormed i should think youd get tired of your talk yourself  well as you insist  blakeley began again but briggs jumped to his feet and caught up phillipss carpetbag and looked wildly around its gravel this time  well take your hat briggs it may be a prolonged struggle but remember that phillipss cause is just hes paid his board and he has a perfect right to leave she has no right to prevent him think of that when the fray is at its worst but try to get him off quietly if you can deal gently with the erring while you stand firm for boarders rights remember that phillips is sneaking off in order to spare her feelings and has come pretty near prevarication in the effort have you got your shoes off no its your rubbers on thats better  briggs faltered with the carpetbag in his hand boys i dont like this it feelsclandestine  it looks that way too blakeley admitted it has an air of conspiracy  ive got half a mind to let phillips come in and get his bag himself  it would serve him right though i dont know why exactly he has a right to spare his own feelings if hes sparing hers at the same time of course hes afraid shell plead with him to stay and hell have to be inexorable with her and if i understand the yielding nature of phillips he doesnt like to be inexorable  there came another sharp rattle of small pebbles at the window  oh confound him briggs cried under his breath and he shuffled out of the room and crept noiselessly down the stairs to the front door the door creaked a little in opening and he left it ajar the current of cold air that swept up to the companions he had left behind at his room door brought them the noise of his rush down the gravel walk to the gate and a noise there as of fugitive steps on the pavement outside  a weak female tread made itself heard in the hallway followed by a sharp voice from a door in the rear was it the cat jenny  no the door just seems to have blown open the catch is broken  swift strong steps advanced with an effect of angry suspicion i dont believe it blew open more likely the cat clawed it open  the steps which the voice preceded seemed to halt at the open door as if falling back from it and wallace and blakeley looking down saw by the dim flare of the hall lamp the face of briggs confronting the face of mrs betterson from the outer darkness they saw the sick girl whose pallor they could not see supporting herself by the stairspost with one hand and pressing the other to her side  oh its you mr briggs the landlady said with a note of inculpation what made you leave the door open  the spectators could not see the swift change in briggss face from terror to savage desperation but they noted it in his voice yesyes its me i justi was just no i wont either youd better know the truth i was taking phillipss bag out to him he was afraid to come in for it because he didnt want to see you the confounded coward hes left  left and he said he would stay till spring didnt he jenny  i dont remember the girl weakly gasped but her mother did not heed her in her mounting wrath  a great preacher hell make whatd he say he left for  he didnt say will you let me upstairs  no i wont till you tell me you know well enough between you  yes i do know briggs answered savagely he left because he was tired of eating soleleather for steak and firesalt pork and tar for molasses and butter strong enough to make your nose curl and drinking burntrye slops for coffee and teagrounds for tea and so am i and so are all of us andand will you let me go upstairs now mrs betterson  his voice had risen not so high but that another voice from the parlor could prevail over it a false silly girl voice with the twitter of pianokeys as from hands swept over the whole board to help drown the noise of the quarrel in the hall oh yes ill sing it again mr saunders if you saaay  then this voice lifted itself in a silly song and a silence followed the voices in the hall except for the landladys saying brokenly well all right mr briggs you can go up to your room for all me ive tried to be a mother to you boys but if this is what i get for it  the two at the threshold of briggss room retreated within as he bounded furiously upon them and slammed the door after him it started open again from the chronic defect of the catch but he did not care  well briggs i hope you feel better now blakeley began you certainly told her the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth but i wonder you had the heart to do it before that sick girl  i didnt have the heart briggs shouted but i had the courage and if you say one word more blakeley ill throw you out of the room im going to leave my boards paid if yours isnt  he went wildly about catching things down here and there from nails and out of drawers the tears stood in his eyes but suddenly he stopped and listened to the sounds from belowthe sound of the silly singing in the parlor and the sound of sobbing in the diningroom and the sound of vain entreating between the sobs  oh i dont suppose im fit to keep a boardinghouse i never was a good manager and everybody imposes on me and everything is so dear and i dont know whats good from whats bad your poor father used to look after all that  well dont you cry now mother itll all come right youll see im getting so i can go and do the marketing now and if minervy would only help a little  no no the mothers voice came anxiously up we can get along without her we always have i know he likes her and i want to give her every chance we can get along if she was ony married once we could all live a note of selfcomforting gradually stole into the mothers voice and the sound of a nose violently blown seemed to note a period in her suffering  oh mother i wish i was well the girls voice came with a burst of wild lamenting  sh sh deary her mother entreated hell hear you and then  hazel dell the silly voice came from the parlor with a sound of fright in it i can sing it without the music the piano keys twittered the prelude and the voice sang            in the hazel dell my nellys sleeping             nelly loved so long  wallace went forward and shut the door its a shame to overhear them what are you going to do you fellows  im going to stay briggs said if it kills me at least i will till minervys married i dont care what the grubs like i can always get a bite at the restaurant  if anybody will pay up my back board ill stay too blakeley followed i should like to make a virtue of it and as things stand i cant  all right wallace said and he went out and down the stairs then from the diningroom below his heavy voice offering encouragement came up in terms which the others could not make out  ill bet hes making her another advance blakeley whispered as if he might be overheard by wallace  i wish i could have made to do it briggs whispered back i feel as mean as pursley would you like to kick me  i dont see how that would do any good i may want to borrow money of you and you cant ask a loan from a man youve kicked besides i think what you said may do her good                                       ix                        breakfast is my best meal                                     i    breakfast is my best meal and i reckon its always been   ever since i was old enough to know what breakfast could mean   i mind when we lived in the cabin out on the illinoy   where father had took up a quartersection when i was a boy   i used to go for the cows as soon as it was light   and when i started back home before i come in sight   i come in smell of the cabin where mother was frying the ham   and boiling the coffee that reached through the air like a mile o bam   n i bet you i didnt wait to see what it was that the dog   thought hed got under the stump or inside o the hollow log   but i made the old cows canter till their hoofjoints crackedyou know   that dry funny kind of a noise that the cows make when they go   and i never stopped to wash when i got to the cabin door   i pulled up my chair and et like i never had et before   and mother she set there and watched me eat and eat and eat   like as if she couldnt give her old eyes enough of the treat   and she split the shortened biscuit and spread the butter between   and let it lay there and melt and soak and soak itself in   and she piled up my plate with potato and ham and eggs   till i couldnt hold any more or hardly stand on my legs   and she filled me up with coffee that would float an iron wedge   and never give way a mite or spill a drop at the edge                                     ii    what well yes this is good coffee too if they dont know much   they do know how to make coffee i will say that for these dutch   but myoh my it aint the kind of coffee my mother made   and the coffee my wife used to make would throw it clear in the shade   and the brand of sugarcured canvased ham that she always used   well this westphalia stuff would simply have made her amused   that so heigh i saw that you was united states as soon   as ever i heard you talk i reckon i know the tune   pick it out anywhere and you understand how i feel   about these here foreign breakfasts breakfast is my best meal                                    iii    my but my wife was a cook and the breakfasts she used to get   the first years we was married i can smell em and taste em yet   corn cake light as a feather and buckwheat thin as lace   and crisp as cracklin and steak that you couldnt have the face   to compare any steak over here to and chicken fried   maryland stylei couldnt get through the bill if i tried   and then her waffles my shed kind of slip in a few   between the ham and the chickenyou know how womenll do   for a sort of little surprise and if i was running light   to take my fancy and give an edge to my appetite   done it all herself as long as we was poor and i tell you   she liked to see me eat as well as mother used to do   i reckon she went ahead of mother some if the truth was known   and everything she touched she give a taste of her own                                     iv    she was a cook i can tell you and after we got ahead   and she could a had a girl to do the cookin instead   i had the greatest time to get momma to leave the work   she said it made her feel like a misable sneak and shirk   she didnt want daughter though when we did begin to keep girls   to come in the kitchen and cook and smell up her cloes and curls   but you couldnt have stopped the child whatever you tried to do   i reckon the gift of the cookin was born in girly too   cook she would from the first and we just had to let her alone   and after she got married and had a house of her own   she tried to make me feel when i come to live with her   like it was my house too and i tell you she done it sir   she remembered that breakfast was my best meal and she tried   to have all i used to have and a good deal more beside   grapefruit to begin with or melons or peaches at least   husbands business took him there and they had went to live east   then a spanish mackerl or a softshell crab on toast   or a broiled live lobster well sir i dont want to seem to boast   but i dont believe you could have got in the whole of new york   any such an oyster fry or sausage of country pork                                     v    well i dont know whatall it means i always lived just so   never drinked or smoked and yet here about two years ago   i begun to run down i aint as young as i used to be   and the doctors all said carlsbad and i reckon this is me   but its more like some one ive dreamt of with all three of em gone   believe in ghosts well i do i know there are ghosts im one   maybe i maynt look iti was always inclined to fat   the doctors say thats the trouble and very likely its that   this is my little grandson and this is the oldest one   of girlys girls and for all that the whole of us said and done   she must come with grandpa when the doctors sent me off here   to see that they didnt starve him aint that about so my dear   she can cook i tell you and when we get home again   were goin to have something to eat im just alivin till then   but when i set here of a morning and think of them thats gone   mother and momma and girlywell i wouldnt like to let on   before the children but i can almost seem to see   all of em lookin down like as if they pitied me   after the breakfasts they give me to have me have to put up   with nothing but bread and butter and a little misable cup   of this here weakkneed coffee i cant tell how you feel   but it fairly makes me sick breakfast is my best meal                                       x                             the motherbird   she wore around the turnedup brim of her bolerolike toque a band of violets not so much in keeping with the gray of the austere november day as with the blue of her faded autumnal eyes her eyes were autumnal but it was not from this or from the lines of maturity graven on the passing prettiness of her little face that the notion and the name of motherbird suggested itself she became known as the motherbird to the tender ironic fancy of the earliest if not the latest of her friends because she was slight and small and like a bird in her eager movements and because she spoke so instantly and so constantly of her children in dresden before you knew anything else of her you knew that she was going out to them  she was quite alone and she gave the sense of claiming their protection and sheltering herself in the fact of them when she mentioned her daughters she had the effect of feeling herself chaperoned by them you could not go behind them and find her wanting in the social guarantees which women on steamers if not men exact of lonely birds of passage who are not motherbirds one must respect the convention by which she safeguarded herself and tried to make good her standing yet it did not lastingly avail her with other birds of passage so far as they were themselves motherbirds or sometimes only maidenbirds the day had not ended before they began to hold her off by slight liftings of their wings and rufflings of their feathers by quick evasive flutterings by subtle ignorances of her approach which convinced no one but themselves that they had not seen her she sailed with the sort of acquaintanceincommon which every one shares on a ship leaving port when people are confused by the kindness of friends coming to see them off after sending baskets of fruit and sheaves of flowers and scarcely know what they are doing or saying but when the ship was abreast of fire island and the pilot had gone over the side these provisional intimacies of the parting hour began to restrict themselves then the motherbird did not know half the women she had known at the pier or quite all the men  it was not that she did anything obvious to forfeit this knowledge her behavior was if anything too exemplary it might be thought to form a reproach to others perhaps it was the unseasonable band of violets around her hatbrim perhaps it was the vernal gaiety of her dress perhaps it was the uncertainty of her anxious eyes which presumed while they implored a motherbird must not hover too confidently too appealingly near coveys whose preoccupations she does not share it might have been her looking and dressing younger than nature justified at forty one must not look thirty in november one must not even involuntarily wear the things of may if one would have others believe in ones devotion to ones children in dresden one alleges in vain ones impatience to join them as grounds for joining groups or detached persons who have begun to write home to their children in new york or boston  the very readiness of the motherbird to give security by the mention of wellknown names to offer proof of her social solvency by the eager correctness of her behavior created reluctance around her some would not have her at all from the first others who had partially or conditionally accepted her returned her upon her hands and withdrew from the negotiation more and more she found herself outside that hard womanworld and trying less and less to beat her way into it  the women may have known her better even than she knew herself and it may have been through ignorance greater than her own that the men were more acquiescent but the men too were not so acquiescent or not at all as time passed  it would be hard to fix the day the hour far harder the moment when the motherbird began to disappear from the drawingroom and to appear in the smokingroom or say whether she passed from the one to the other in a voluntary exile or by the rigor of the womens unwritten law still from time to time she was seen in their part of the ship after she was also seen where the band of violets showed strange and sad through veils of smoke that were not dense enough to hide her poor pretty little face with its faded blue eyes and wistful mouth there she passed by quick transition from the conversation of the graver elderly smokers to the loud laughter of two birds of prey who became her comrades or such friends as birds like them can be to birds like her  from anything she had said or done there was no reason for her lapse from the women and the better men to such men for her transition from the better sort of women there was no reason except that it happened whether she attached herself to the birds of prey or they to her by that instinct which enables birds of all kinds to know themselves of a feather remained a touching question  there remained to the end the question whether she was of a feather with them or whether it was by some mischance or by some such stress of the elements as drives birds of any feather to flock with birds of any other to the end there remained a distracted and forsaken innocence in her looks it was imaginable that she had made overtures to the birds of prey because she had made overtures to every one else she was always seeking rather than sought and her acceptance with them was as deplorable as her refusal by better birds often they were seen without her when they had that look of having escaped which others wore but she was not often seen without them  there is not much walkingweather on a november passage and she was seen less with them in the early dark outdoors than in the late light within by which she wavered a small form through the haze of their cigars in the smokingroom or in the grillroom where she showed in faint eclipse through the fumes of the broiling and frying or through the vapors of the hot whiskies the birds of prey were then heard laughing but whether at her or with her it must have been equally sorrowful to learn  perhaps they were laughing at the maternal fondness which she had used for introduction to the general acquaintance lost almost in the moment of winning it she seemed not to resent their laughter though she seemed not to join in it the worst of her was the company she kept but since no better would allow her to keep it you could not confidently say she would not have liked the best company on board at the same time you could not have said she would you could not have been sure it would not have bored her doubtless these results are not solely the sport of chance they must be somewhat the event of choice if not of desert  for anything you could have sworn the motherbird would have liked to be as good as the best but since it was not possible for her to be good in the society of the best she could only be good in that of the worst it was to be hoped that the birds of prey were not cruel to her that their mockery was never unkind if ever it was mockery the cruelty which must come came when they began to be seen less and less with her even at the late suppers through the haze of their cigars and the smoke of the broiling and frying and the vapors of the hot whiskies then it was the sharpest pang of all to meet her wandering up and down the ships promenades or leaning on the rail and looking dimly out over the foamwhitened black sea it is the necessity of birds of prey to get rid of other birds when they are tired of them and it had doubtless come to that  one night the night before getting into port when the curiosity which always followed her with grief failed of her in the heightened hilarity of the smokingroom where the last bets on the ships run were making it found her alone beside a little iron table of those set in certain nooks outside the grillroom there she sat with no one near where the light from within fell palely upon her the boon birds of prey with whom she had been supping had abandoned her and she was supporting her cheek on the small hand of the arm that rested on the table she leaned forward and swayed with the swaying ship the violets in her bolerotoque quivered with the vibrations of the machinery she was asleep poor motherbird and it would have been impossible not to wish her dreams were kind                                       xi                                the amigo   his name was really perez armando aldeano but in the end everybody called him the amigo because that was the endearing term by which he saluted all the world there was a time when the children called him spanyard in their games for he spoke no tongue but spanish and though he came from ecuador and was no more a spaniard than they were english he answered to the call of spanyard whenever he heard it he came eagerly in the hope of fun and all the more eagerly if there was a hope of mischief in the fun still to discerning spirits he was always the amigo for when he hailed you so you could not help hailing him so again and whatever mock he put upon you afterward you were his secret and inalienable friend  the moment of my own acceptance in this quality came in the first hours of expansion following our getting to sea after long detention in the dock by fog a small figure came flying down the dock with outspread arms and a joyful cry of ah amigo as if we were now meeting unexpectedly after a former intimacy in bogotá and the amigo clasped me round the middle to his bosom or more strictly speaking his brow which he plunged into my waistcoat he was clad in a long black overcoat and a boys kneepants and under the peak of his cap twinkled the merriest black eyes that ever lighted up a smiling face of olive hue thereafter he was more and more with the thinness of his small black legs and his habit of hopping up and down and dancing threateningly about with mischief latent in every motion like a crow which in being tamed has acquired one of the worst traits of civilization he began babbling and gurgling in spanish and took my hand for a stroll about the ship and from that time we were with certain crises of disaffection firm allies  there were others whom he hailed and adopted his friends whose legs he clung about and impeded in their walks or whom he required to toss him into the air as they passed but i flattered myself that he had a peculiar because a primary esteem for myself i have thought it might be that bogotá being said to be a very literary capital as those things go in south america he was mystically aware of a common ground between us wider and deeper than that of his other friendships but it may have been somewhat owing to my inviting him to my cabin to choose such portion as he would of a ladycake sent us on shipboard at the last hour he prattled and chuckled over it in the soft gutturals of his parrotlike spanish and rushed up on deck to eat the frosting off in the presence of his small companions and to exult before them in the exploitation of a novel pleasure yet it could not have been the ladycake which lastingly endeared me to him for by the next day he had learned prudence and refused it without withdrawing his amity  this indeed was always tempered by what seemed a constitutional irony and he did not impart it to any one without some time making his friend feel the edge of his practical humor it was not long before the children whom he gathered to his heart had each and all suffered some fall or bump or bruise which if not of his intention was of his infliction and which was regretted with such winning archness that the very mothers of them could not resist him and his victims dried their tears to follow him with glad cries of spanyard spanyard injury at his hands was a favor neglect was the only real grievance he went about rolling his small black head and darting roguish lightnings from under his thickfringed eyes and making more trouble with a more enticing gaiety than all the other people on the ship put together  the truth must be owned that the time came long before the end of the voyage when it was felt that in the interest of the common welfare something must be done about the amigo at the conversational end of the doctors table where he was discussed whenever the racks were not on and the talk might have languished without their inspiration his badness was debated at every meal some declared him the worst boy in the world and held against his halfhearted defenders that something ought to be done about him and one was left to imagine all the darker fate for him because there was nothing specific in these convictions he could not be thrown overboard and if he had been put in irons probably his worst enemies at the conversational end of the table would have been the first to intercede for him it is not certain however that their prayers would have been effective with the captain if that officer framed for comfort as well as command could have known how accurately the amigo had dramatized his personal presence by throwing himself back and clasping his hands a foot in front of his small stomach and making a few tilting paces forward  the amigo had a mimic gift which he liked to exercise when he could find no intelligible language for the expression of his ironic spirit being forbidden visits in and out of season to certain staterooms whose inmates feigned a wish to sleep he represented in what grotesque attitudes of sonorous slumber they passed their day and he spared neither age nor sex in these graphic shows when age refused one day to go up on deck with him and pleaded in such spanish as it could pluck up from its past studies that it was too old he laughed it to scorn you are not old he said why the flattered dotard inquired because you smile and that seemed reason enough for ones continued youth it was then that the amigo gave his own age carefully telling the spanish numerals over and explaining further by holding up both hands with one finger shut in but he had the subtlety of centuries in his nine years and he penetrated the ship everywhere with his arch spirit of mischief it was mischief always in the interest of the goodfellowship which he offered impartially to old and young and if it were mere frolic with no ulterior object he did not care at all how old or young his playmate was this endeared him naturally to every age and the little blond germanamerican boy dried his tears from the last accident inflicted on him by the amigo to recall him by tender entreaties of spanyard spanyard while the eldest of his friends could not hold out against him more than two days in the strained relations following upon the amigos sweeping him down the back with a toy broom employed by the germanamerican boy to scrub the scuppers this was not so much an injury as an indignity but it was resented as an indignity in spite of many demure glances of propitiation from the amigos ironical eyes and murmurs of inarticulate apology as he passed  he was up to a certain point the kindest and truest of amigos then his weird seizure came and the baby was spilled out of the carriage he had been so benevolently pushing up and down or the second officers legs as he walked past with the prettiest girl on board were hit with the stick that the amigo had been innocently playing shuffleboard with or some passenger was taken unawares in his vanity or infirmity and made to contribute to the amigos passion for active amusement  at this point i ought to explain that the amigo was not traveling alone from ecuador to paris where it was said he was to rejoin his father at mealtimes and at other rare intervals he was seen to be in the charge of a very dark and very silent little man with intensely black eyes and mustache clad in raven hues from his head to the delicate feet on which he wore patentleather shoes with him the amigo walked gravely up and down the deck and behaved decorously at table and we could not reconcile the apparent affection between the two with a theory we had that the amigo had been found impossible in his own country and had been sent out of ecuador by a decree of the government or perhaps a vote of the whole people the little dark silent man in his patentleather boots had not the air of conveying a state prisoner into exile and we wondered in vain what the tie between him and the amigo was he might have been his tutor or his uncle he exercised a quite mystical control over the amigo who was exactly obedient to him in everything and would not look aside at you when in his keeping we reflected with awe and pathos that as they roomed together it was his privilege to see the amigo asleep when that little very kissable black head rested innocently on the pillow and the busy brain within it was at peace with the world which formed its pleasure and its prey in waking  it would be idle to represent that the amigo played his pranks upon that shipload of longsuffering people with final impunity the time came when they not only said something must be done but actually did something it was by the hand of one of the amigos sweetest and kindest friends namely that elderly captain off duty who was going out to be assigned his ship in hamburg from the first he had shown the affectionate tenderness for the amigo which was felt by all except some obdurate hearts at the conversational end of the table and it must have been with a loving interest in the amigos ultimate wellbeing that taking him in an ecstasy of mischief he drew the amigo face downward across his knees and bestowed the chastisement which was morally a caress he dismissed him with a smile in which the amigo read the good understanding that existed unimpaired between them and accepted his correction with the same affection as that which had given it he shook himself and ran off with an enjoyment of the joke as great as that of any of the spectators and far more generous  in fact there was nothing mean in the amigo impish he was or might be but only in the sort of the crow or the parrot there was no malevolence in his fine malice one fancied him in his adolescence taking part in one of the frequent revolutions of his continent but humorously not homicidally he would like to alarm the other faction and perhaps drive it from power or overset it from its official place but if he had the say there would be no bringing the vanquished out into the plaza to be shot he may now have been on his way to france ultimately to study medicine which seems to be preliminary to a high political career in south america but in the mean time we feared for him in that republic of severely regulated subordinations  we thought with pathos of our early parting with him as we approached plymouth and tried to be kodaked with him considering it an honor and pleasure he so far shared our feeling as to consent but he insisted on wearing a pair of glasses which had large eyes painted on them and on being taken in the act of inflating a toy balloon probably therefore the likeness would not be recognized in bogotá but it will always be endeared to us by the memory of the many mockeries suffered from him there were other friends whom we left on the ship notably those of the conversational end of the table who thought him simply a bad boy but there were none of such peculiar appeal as he when he stood by the guard opening and shutting his hand in ironical adieu and looking smaller and smaller as our tender drifted away and the vast liner loomed immense before us he may have contributed to its effect of immensity by the smallness of his presence or it may have dwarfed him no matter he filled no slight space in our lives while he lasted now that he is no longer there was he really a bad little boy merely and simply heaven knows which alone knows good boys from bad                                      xii                             black cross farm                                to f s     after full many a mutual delay   my friend and i at last fixed on a day   for seeing black cross farm which he had long   boasted the fittest theme for tale or song   in all that charming region round about   something that must not really be left out   of the account of things to do for me   it was a teasing bit of mystery   he said which he and his had tried in vain   ever since they had found it to explain   the right way was to happen as they did   upon it in the hills where it was hid   but chance could not be always trusted quite   you might not happen on it though you might   encores were usually objected to   by chance the next best thing that we could do   was in his carryall to start together   and trust that somehow favoring wind and weather   with the eccentric progress of his horse   would so far drift us from our settled course   that we at least could lose ourselves if not   find the mysterious object that we sought   so one blithe morning of the ripe july   we fared by easy stages toward the sky   that rested one rim of its turquoise cup   low on the distant sea and tilted up   the other on the irregular hilltops sweet   the sun and wind that joined to cool and heat   the air to one delicious temperature   and over the smoothcropt mowingpieces pure   the pinebreath borrowing their spicy scent   in barter for the balsam that it lent   and when my friend handed the reins to me   and drew a fuming match along his knee   and lighting his cigar began to talk   i let the old horse lapse into a walk   from his perfunctory trot content to listen   amid that leafy rustle and that glisten   of field and wood and ocean rapt afar   from every trouble of our anxious star   from time to time between effect and cause   in this or that making a questioning pause   my friend peered round him while he feigned a gay   hope that we might have taken the wrong way   at the last turn and then let me push on   or the old horse rather slanting hither and yon   and never in the middle of the track   except when slanting off or slanting back   he talked i listened while we wandered by   the scanty fields of wheat and oats and rye   with patches of potatoes and of corn   and now and then a garden spot forlorn   run wild where once a house had stood or where   an empty house yet stood and seemed to stare   upon us blindly from the twisted glass   of windows that once let no wayfarer pass   unseen of children dancing at the pane   and vanishing to reappear again   pulling their mother with them to the sight   still we kept on with turnings left and right   past farmsteads grouped in cheerful neighborhoods   or solitary then through shadowy woods   of pine or birch until the road grassgrown   had given back to nature all her own   save a faint wheeltrace that along the slope   raingullied seemed to stop and doubt and grope   and then quite ceased as if t had turned and fled   out of the forest into which it led   and left us at the gate whose every bar   was nailed against us but oh here we are   my friend cried joyously at last at last   and making our horse superfluously fast   he led the way onward by what had been   a lane now hid by weeds and briers between   meadows scarce worth the mowing to a space   shaped as by nature for the dwellingplace   of kindly human life a small plateau   open to the heaven that seemed bending low   in liking for it there beneath a roof   still against winter and summer weatherproof   with walls and doors and windows perfect yet   between its garden and its graveyard set   stood the old homestead out of which had perished   the home whose memory it dumbly cherished   and which when at our push the door swung wide   we might have well imagined to have died   and had its funeral the day before   so clean and cold it was from floor to floor   so lifelike and so deathlike with the thrill   of hours when life and death encountered still   passionate in it they that lay below   the tangled grasses or the drifted snow   husband and wife mother and little one   from that sad house less utterly were gone   than they that living had abandoned it   in moonless nights their absences might flit   homesick from room to room or dimly sit   around its fireless hearths or haunt the rose   and lily in the neglected garden close   but they whose feet had borne them from the door   would pass the footworn threshold nevermore   we read the mossgrown names upon the tombs   with lighter melancholy than the glooms   of the dead house shadowed us with and thence   turning my heart was pierced with more intense   suggestion of a mystical dismay   as in the brilliance of the summer day   we faced the vast gray barn the house was old   though so well kept as age by years is told   in our young land but the barn gray and vast   stood new and straight and strongall battened fast   at every opening and where once the mow   had yawned widewindowed on the sheathing now   a cross was nailed the bigness of a man   aslant from left to right athwart the span   and painted black as paint could make it hushed   i stood while manifold conjecture rushed   to this point and to that point and then burst   in the impotent questionings rejected first   what did it mean ah that no one could tell   who put it there that was unknown as well   was there no legend my friend knew of none   no neighborhood story he had sought for one   in vain did he imagine it accident   with nothing really implied or meant   by the boards set in that way it might be   but i could answer that as well as he   then desperately what did he guess it was   something of purpose or without a cause   other than chance he slowly shook his head   and with his gaze fixed on the symbol said   we have quite ceased from guessing or surmising   for all our several and joint devising   has left us finally where i must leave you   but now i think it is your part to do   yourself some guessing i hoped you might bring   a fresh mind to the riddles unraveling   come          and thus challenged i could not deny   the sort of right he had to have me try   and yielding i beganinstinctively   proceeding by exclusion we agree   it was not put there as a pious charm   to keep the abandoned property from harm   the owner could have been no catholic   and yet it was no sacrilegious trick   to make folks wonder and it was not chance   assuredly that set those boards askance   in that shape or before or after so   painted them to that coloring of woe   do you suppose then that it could have been   some secret sorrow or some secret sin   that tried to utter or to expiate   itself in that way some unhappy hate   turned to remorse or some liferending grief   that could not find in years or tears relief   who lived here last                          ah my friend made reply   you know as much concerning that as i   all i could tell is what those gravestones tell   and they have told it all to you as well   the names the dates the curious epitaphs   at whose quaint phrase one either sighs or laughs   just as ones heart or head happens to be   hollow or not are there for each to see   but i believe they have nothing to reveal   no wrong to publish no shame to conceal      and yet that cross i turned at his reply   fixing the silent symbol with my eye   insistently and you consent i said   to leave the enigma uninterpreted      why no he faltered then went on suppose   that some one that had known the average woes   of human nature finding that the load   was overheavy for him on lifes road   had wished to leave some token in this cross   of what had been his gain and been his loss   of what had been his suffering and of what   had also been the solace of his lot   whoever that unknown brotherman might be   i think he must have been like you and me   who bear our cross and when we fail at length   bow down and pray to it for greater strength      i mused and as i mused i seemed to find   the fancy more and still more to my mind      well let it go at that i think for me   i like that better than some tragedy   of clearer physiognomy which were   in being more definite the vulgarer   for us what after all would be the gain   of making the elusive meaning plain   i really think if i were you and yours   i would not lift the veil that now obscures   the appealing fact lest i should spoil the charm   deeding me for my own the black cross farm      a good suggestion i am glad said he   we have always practised your philosophy      he smiled we laughed we sighed and turned away   and left the mystery to the summer day   that made as if it understood and could   have read the riddle to us if it would   the wide wise sky the clouds that on the grass   let their vague shadows dreamlike trail and pass   the conscious woods the stony meadows growing   up to birch pastures where we heard the lowing   of one disconsolate cow all the warm afternoon   lulled in a reverie by the myriad tune   of insects and the chirp of songless birds   forgetful of the springtimes lyric words   drowsed round us while we tried to find the lane   that to our coming feet had been so plain   and lost ourselves among the sweetferns growth   and thickets of young pinetrees nothing loath   amidst the wilding loveliness to stray   and spend if need were looking for the way   whole hours but blundered into the right course   suddenly and came out upon our horse   where we had left himto our great surprise   stamping and switching at the pestering flies   but not apparently anxious to depart   when nearly overturning at the start   we followed down that evanescent trace   which followed up had brought us to the place      then all the wayside scenes reversing we   dropped to the glimpses of the distant sea   content as if we brought returning thus   the secret of the black cross back with us                                      xiii                          the critical bookstore   it had long been the notion of frederick erlcort who held it playfully held it seriously according to the company he was in that there might be a censorship of taste and conscience in literary matters strictly affiliated with the retail commerce in books when he first began to propose it playfully seriously as his listener chose he said that he had noticed how in the great department stores where nearly everything to supply human need was sold the shopmen and shopwomen seemed instructed by the ownership or the management to deal in absolute good faith with the customers and not to misrepresent the quality the make or the material of any article in the slightest degree a thing was not to be called silk or wool when it was partly cotton it was not to be said that it would wash when it would not wash or that the color would not come off when it would come off or that the stuff was english or french when it was american  when erlcort once noted his interest in the fact to a floorwalker whom he happened to find at leisure the floorwalker said yes that was so and the house did it because it was business good business the only good business he was instantly enthusiastic and he said that just in the same way as an extension of its good faith with the public the house had established the rule of taking back any article which a customer did not like or did not find what she had supposed when she got it home and refunding the money this was the best sort of business it held custom the woman became a customer for life the floorwalker laughed and after he had told an anxious applicant second aisle to the left lady three counters back he concluded to erlcort i say she because a man never brings a thing back when hes made a mistake but a woman can always blame it on the house that so  erlcort laughed with him and in going out he stopped at the bookcounter rather it was a bookstore and no small one with ranks of new books covering the large tables and mounting to their level from the floor neatly piled and with shelves of complete editions and sobererlooking volumes stretching along the wall as high as the ceiling do you happen to have a good booka book that would read good i meanin your stock here he asked the neat blonde behind the literary barricade  well heres a book that a good many are reading she answered with prompt interest and a smile that told in the books favor it was a protectingly filial and guardedly ladylike smile  yes but is it a book worth readingworth the money  well i dont know as im a judge the kind little blonde replied she added daringly all i can say is i set up till two last night to finish it  and you advise me to buy it  well were not allowed to do that exactly i can only tell you what i know  but if i take it and it isnt what i expected i can return it and get my money back  thats something i never was asked before mr jeffers mr jeffers she called to a floorwalker passing near and when he stopped and came up to the counter she put the case to him  he took the book from erlcorts hand and examined the outside of it curiously if not critically then he looked from it to erlcort and said oh how do you do again well no sir i dont know as we could do that you see you would have to read it to find out that you didnt want it and that would be like using or wearing an article wouldnt it we couldnt take back a thing that had been used or wornheigh  but you might have some means of knowing whether a book is good or not  well yes we might thats a point we have never had raised before miss prittiman havent we any means of knowing whether a books something we can guarantee or not  well mr jeffers theres the publishers advertisement  why yes so there is and a respectable publisher wouldnt indorse a book that wasnt the genuine article would he now sir  he mightnt erlcort said as if he felt the force of the argument  and there are the notices in the newspapers they ought to tell miss prittiman added more convincingly i dont know she said as from a sensitive conscience whether there have been any about this book yet but i should think there would be  and in the mean time as you wont guarantee the book so that i can bring it back and get my money if i find it worthless i must accept the publishers word erlcort pressed further  i should think you could do that the floorwalker suggested with the appearance of being tired  well i think i will for once erlcort relented but wait what does the publisher say  its all printed on this slip inside the blonde said and she showed it as she took the book from him shall i send it or will you  no no thank you ill take it with me let me  he kept the printed slip and began to read it the blonde wrapped the book up and laid it with a halfdollar in change on the counter before erlcort the floorwalker went away erlcort heard him saying no madam toys on the fifth floor at the extreme rear left while he lost himself in the glowing promises of the publisher it appeared that the book he had just bought was by a perfectly new author an old lady of seventy who had never written a novel before and might therefore be trusted for an entire freshness of thought and feeling the plot was of a gripping intensity the characters were painted with large bold strokes and were of an unexampled virility the story was packed with passion from cover to cover and the reader would be held breathless by the authors skill in working from the tragic conditions to an allround happy conclusion  from time to time erlcort heard the gentle blonde saying such things as oh yes its the bestseller all right and all i can say is i set up till two oclock in the morning to finish it and yes maam its by a new writer a very old lady of seventy who is just beginning to write well thats what i heard  on his way uptown in the subway he clung to the wonted strap unsupported by anything in the romance which he had bought and yet he could not take the book back and get his money or even exchange it for some article of neckwear or footwear in his extremity he thought he would try giving it to the trainman just before he reached his stop  you want to give it to me well thats something that never happened to me on this line before i guess my wife will like it i1009th street change for east brooklyn and the bronx the guard shouted and he let erlcort out of the car the very first of the tide that spilled itself forth at the station he called after him do as much for you some time  the incident first amused erlcort and then it began to trouble him but he appeased his remorse by toying with his old notion of a critical bookstore his mind was still at play with it when he stopped at the bellpull of an elderly girl of his acquaintance who had a studio ten stories above and the habit of giving him afternoon tea in it if he called there about five oclock she had her ugly paintingapron still on and her thumb through the hole in her palette when she opened her door to him  too soon he asked  she answered as well as she could with the brush held horizontally in her mouth while she glared inhospitably at him well not much and then she let him in and went and lighted her spiritlamp  he began at once to tell her of his strange experience and went on till she said well theres your tea i dont know what youve been driving at but i suppose you do is it the old thing  its my critical bookstore if thats what you call the old thing  oh that i thought it had failed way back in the dark ages  the dark ages are not back please theyre all round and you know very well that my critical bookstore has never been tried yet but tell me one thing should you wish to live with a picture even for a few hours which had been painted by an old lady of seventy who had never tried to paint before  if i intended to go crazy yes what has all that got to do with it  thats the joint commendation of the publisher and the kind little blonde who united to sell me the book i just gave to that poor subway trainman do you ever buy a new book  no i always borrow an old one  but if you had to buy a new one wouldnt you like to know of a place where you could be sure of getting a good one  i shouldnt mind or yes i should rather wheres it to be  oh i know ive had my eye on the place for a good while its a funny old place in sixth avenue  sixth avenue  dont interruptwhere the dearest old codger in the world is just going out of the housefurnishing business in a small way its kept getting smaller and smallerive watched it shrinktill now it cant stand up against the big shops and the old codger told me the other day that it was no use  poor fellow  no hes not badly off and hes going back upstate where he came from about forty years ago and he can liveor dievery well on what hes put by ive known him rather a good while and weve been friends ever since weve been acquainted  go on the elderly girl said  erlcort was not stopping but she spoke so as to close her mouth which she was apt to let hang open in a way that she did not like she had her intimates pledged to tell her when she was doing it but she could not make a man promise and she had to look after her mouth herself with erlcort it was not a bad mouth her eyes were large and it was merely large to match them  when shall you beginopen shop she asked  my old codgers lease expires in the fall he answered but he would be glad to have me take it off his hands this spring i could give the summer to changing and decorating and begin my campaign in the fallthe first of october say wouldnt you like to come some day and see the old place  i should love it but youre not supposing i shall be of the least use i hope im not decorational you know easel pictures and small ones at that  of course but you are a woman and have ideas of the cozy i mean that the place shall be made attractive  do you think the situation will beon sixth avenue  it will be quaint its in a retarded region of low buildings with a carpenters shop two doors off the l roars overhead and the surface cars squeal before but that is new york you know and its very central besides at the back of the shop with the front door shut it is very quiet  the next day the friends lunched together at an italian restaurant very near the place and rather hurried themselves away to the old codgers store  he is a dear margaret whispered to erlcort in following him about to see the advantages of the place  oh mines settinghens time he justified his hospitality in finally asking them to take seats on a nailkeg apiece you mustnt think youre interruptin look round all ye want to or set down and rest ye  that would be a good motto for your bookstore she screamed to erlcort when they got out into the roar of the avenue look round all ye want to or set down and rest ye wasnt he sweet and i dont wonder youre taken with the place it has such capabilities you might as well begin imagining how you will arrange it  they were walking involuntarily up the avenue and when they came to the park they went into it and in the excitement of their planning they went as far as the ramble where they sat down on a bench and disappointed some squirrels who supposed they had brought peanuts with them  they decided that the front of the shop should be elaborately simple perhaps the door should be painted black with a smallpaned sash and a heavy brass latch on each side should be a smallpaned showwindow with books laid inside on an inclined shelving on the door should be a modest bronze plate reading the critical bookstore they rejected shop as an affectation and they hooted the notion of ye critical bookstore as altogether loathsome the door and window would be in a rather belated taste but the beautiful is never out of date and black paint and small panes might be found rococo in their oldfashionedness now there should be a fireplace or perhaps a franklin stove at the rear of the room with a highshouldered smallpaned sash on each side letting in the light from the yard of the carpentershop on the chimneypiece should be lettered look round all ye want to or set down and rest ye  the genius of the place should be a refined hospitality such as the gentle old codger had practised with them and to facilitate this there should be a pair of highbacked settles one under each window the bookcounter should stretch the whole length of the store and at intervals beside it against the bookshelving should be set oldfashioned chairs but not too oldfashioned against the lower bookshelves on a deeper shelf might be stood against the books a few sketches in watercolor or even oil  this was margaret greens idea  and would you guarantee the quality erlcort asked  perhaps they wouldnt be for sale though if any one insisted  i see well pass the sketches what else  well a few little figures in plaster or even marble or bronze very greek or very american things in low relief  pass the little figures and low reliefs but dont forget its a bookstore  oh i wont the sketches of all kinds would be strictly subordinated to the books if i had a tearoom handy here with a table and the backs of some menus to draw on i could show you just how it would look  whats the matter with the casino  nothing only its rather early for tea yet  it isnt for sodalemonade  she set him the example of instantly rising and led the way back along the lake to the casino resting at that afternoon hour among its spring flowers and blossoms innocent of its lurid afterdark frequentation he got some paper from the waiter who came to take their order she began to draw rapidly and by the time the waiter came again she was giving erlcort the last scrap of paper  well he said i had no idea that i had imagined anything so charming if this critical bookstore doesnt succeed itll be because there are no critics but whatwhat are these little things hung against the partitions of the shelves  ohmirrors little round ones  but why mirrors of any shape  nothing only people like to see themselves in a glass of any shape and when margaret added in a burst of candor a woman looks up and sees herself with a book in her hand she will feel so intellectual she will never put it down she will buy it  margaret green this is immoral strike out those mirrors or i will smash them every one  oh very well she said and she rubbed them out with the top of her pencil if you want your place a howling wilderness  he looked at the ruin her rubber had wrought they were rather nice couldcould you rub them in again  not if i tried a hundred years besides they were rather impudent what time is it  no time at all its halfpast three  dear me i must be going and if youre really going to start that precious critical bookstore in the fall you must begin work on it right away  work  reading up for it if youre going to guarantee the books you must know whats in them mustnt you  he realized that he must do what she said he must know from his own knowledge what was in the books he offered for sale and he began reading or reading at the new books immediately he was a good deal occupied by day with the arrangement of his store though he left it mainly with the lively young decorator who undertook for a lump sum to realize margaret greens ideas it was at night that he did most of his reading in the spring books which the publishers were willing to send him gratis when they understood he was going to open a bookstore and only wanted sample copies as long as she remained in town margaret green helped him read and they talked the books over and mostly rejected them by the time she went to europe in august with another elderly girl they had not chosen more than eight or ten books but they hoped for better things in the fall  word of what he was doing had gone out from margaret and a great many women of their rather esthetic circle began writing to him about the books they were reading and commending them to him or warning him against them the circle of his volunteer associates enlarged itself in the nature of an endless chain and before society quite broke up for the summer a sympathetic tea was offered to erlcort by a leading society woman at the intellectual club where he was invited to address the intellectuals in explanation of his project this was before margaret sailed and he hurried to her in horror  why of course you must accept youre not going to hide your critical bookstore under a bushel you cant have too much publicity  the leading society woman flowed in fulsome gratitude at his acceptance and promised no one but the club should be there he had hinted his reluctance she kept her promise but among the intellectuals there was a girl who was a just beginning journalist and who pumped erlcorts whole scheme out of him unsuspicious of what she was doing till he saw it all with his picture in the sunday supplement she rightly judged that the intimacy of an interview would be more popular with her readers than the cold and distant report of his formal address which she must give though she received it so ardently with all the other intellectuals they flocked flatteringly almost suffocatingly around him at the end his scheme was just what every one had vaguely thought of something must be done to stem the tide of worthless fiction which was so often shocking as well as silly and they would only be too glad to help read for him they were nearly all just going to sail but they would each take a spring book on the ship and write him about it from the other side they would each get a fall book coming home and report as soon as they got back  his scheme was discussed seriously and satirically by the press it became a joke with many papers and a byword quickly worn out so that people thought that it had been dropped but erlcort gave his days and nights to preparation for his autumnal campaign he studied in careful comparison the reviews of the different literary authorities and was a little surprised to find when he came to read the books they reviewed how honest and adequate they often were he was obliged to own to himself that if people were guided by them few worthless books would be sold and he decided that the immense majority of the bookbuyers were not guided by the critics the publishers themselves seemed not so much to blame when he went to see them and explained his wish to deal with them on the basis of a critical bookseller they said they wished all the booksellers were like him for they would ask nothing better than to publish only good books the trouble they said lay with the authors they wrote such worthless books or if now and then one of them did write a good book and they were overtempted to publish it the public united in refusing to buy it so he saw but if the booksellers persisted in selling none but good books perhaps something might be done at any rate they would like to see the experiment tried  erlcort felt obliged to read the books suggested to him by the endless chain of readers who volunteered to read for him on both sides of the ocean or going and coming on the ocean mostly the books they praised were abject rubbish but it took time to find this out and he formed the habit of reading far into the night and if he was very much vexed at discovering that the book recommended to him was trash he could not sleep unless he took veronal and then he had a ghastly next day  he did not go out of town except for a few brief sojourns at places where he knew cultivated people were staying and could give him their opinions of the books he was reading when the publishers began as they had agreed to send him their advance sheets the stitched but unbound volumes roused so much interest by the novelty of their form that his readers could not give an undivided attention to their contents he foresaw that in the end he should have to rely upon the taste of mercenaries in his warfare against rubbish and more and more he found it necessary to expend himself in it to read at second hand as well as at first his greatest relief was in returning to town and watching the magical changes which the decorator was working in his store this was consolation this was inspiration but he longed for the return of margaret green that she might help him enjoy the realization of her ideas in the equipment of the place and he held the decorator to the most slavish obedience through the carpenters and painters who created at his bidding a miraculous interior all white or just offwhite such as had never been imagined of a bookstore in new york before it was actually ready by the end of august though smelling a little of turpentine still and erlcort letting himself in at the smallpaned black door and ranging up and down the long beautiful room and round and round the central booktable and in and out between the side tables under the soft bright shelving of the walls could hardly wait the arrival of the minnedingdong in which the elderly girl had taken her passage back one day ten days ahead of time she blew in at the front door in a paroxysm of explanation she had swapped passages home with another girl who wanted to come back later while she herself wanted to come back earlier she had no very convincing reason for this as she gave it but erlcort did not listen to her reason whatever it was he said between the raptures with the place that she fell in and out of that now she was just in time for the furnishing which he never could have dared to undertake alone  in the gay september weather they visited all the antiquity shops in fourth avenue and then threw themselves frankly upon reproductions which they bought in the native wood and ordered painted the settles and the spindlebacked chairs in the cool gray which she decided was the thing in the same spirit they bought new brass fireirons and new shovel and tongs but all very tall and antiquelooking and then they got those little immoral mirrors which margaret green attached with her own hands to the partitions of the shelving she also got soft green silk curtains for the chimney windows and for the sash of the front door even the front windows she curtained but very low so that a salesman or a saleswoman could easily reach over from the interior and get a book that any customer had seen from the outside  one day when all this was done and erlcort had begun ordering in a stock of such books as he had selected to start with she said youre looking rather peakéd arent you  well ive been feeling rather peakéd until lately keeping awake to read and read after the volunteer readers  you mean youve lost sleep  something like that  well you mustnt how many books do you start with  about twentyfive  good ones its a lot isnt it i didnt suppose there were so many  well to fill our shelves i shall have to order about a thousand of each  youll never sell them in the world youll be ruined  oh no the publishers will take them back  how nice of them but thats only what painters have to do when the dealers cant sell their pictures  a month off the prospect was brilliant and when the shelves and tables were filled and the sketches and basreliefs were stuck about and the little immoral mirrors were hung the place was charming the chairs and settles were all that could be asked margaret green helped put them about and he let her light the low fire on the hearth of the franklin stove he said he should not always burn hickory but he had got twentyfour sticks for two dollars from an italian in a cellar near by and he meant to burn that much she upbraided him for his extravagance while touching the match to the paper under the kindling but october opened cold and he needed the fire  the enterprise seemed rather to mystify the neighborhood and some old customers of the old codgers came in upon one fictitious errand and another to see about it and went away without quite making it out it was a bookstore all right they owned in conference but what did he mean by critical  the first bona fide buyer appeared in a little girl who could just get her chin on the counter and who asked for an eggbeater erlcort had begun with only one assistant the young lady who typed his letters and who said she guessed she could help him when she was not working she leaned over and tried to understand the little girl and then she called to erlcort where he stood with his back to the fire and the morning paper open before his face  mr erlcort have we got a book called the eggbeater  the eggbeater he echoed letting his paper drop below his face  no no the little girl shouted angrily it aint a book its a thing to beat eggs with mother said to come here and get it  well shes sent you to the wrong place little girl you want to go to a hardwarestore the young lady argued  aint this no 1232  yes  well this is the right place mother said to go to 1232 i guess she knows shes an old customer  the eggbeater the eggbeater the blithe young novelist to whom erlcort told the story repeated he was still happy in his original success as a bestseller and he had come to the critical bookstore to spy out the stock and see whether his last novel was in it but though it was not he joyously extended an acquaintance with erlcort which had begun elsewhere the eggbeater what a splendid title for a story of adventure keep the secret of its applicability to the last word or perhaps never reveal it at all and leave the reader worrying thats one way makes him go and talk about the book to all the girls he knows and get them guessing best ad in the world the eggbeater doesnt it suggest desert islands and penguins nests in the rocks fellow and girl shipwrecked and girl wants to make an omelette after theyve got sick of plain eggs and cant for want of an eggbeater heigh he invents onemakes it out of some wire that floats off from the wreck see when they are rescued she brings it away and doesnt let him know it till their iron wedding day they keep it over his study fireplace always  this author was the first to stretch his legs before erlcorts fire from his seat on one of the reproductions he could not say enough of the beauty of the place and he asked if he might sit there and watch for the old codgers old customers coming to buy hardware there might be copy in it  but the old customers did not come so often as he hoped and erlcort feared instead there came bona fide bookbuyers who asked some for a book and some for a particular book the first were not satisfied with the books that erlcort or his acting saleslady recommended and went away without buying the last were indignant at not finding what they wanted in erlcorts selection  why dont you stock it they demanded  because i dont think its worth reading  oh indeed the sarcastic customers were commonly ladies i thought you let the public judge of that  there are bookstores where they do this is a critical bookstore i sell only the books that i think worth reading if you had noticed my sign  oh the customer would say and she too would go away without buying  there were other ladies who came links of the endless chain of volunteer readers who had tried to help erlcort in making his selection and he could see them slyly looking his stock over for the books they had praised to him mostly they went away without comment but with heads held high in the offense which he felt even more than saw one indeed did ask him why he had not stocked her chosen book and he had to say well when i came to go through it carefully i didnt think it quite  but here is the green bay tree and the biggest toad in the puddle and  i know for one reason and another i thought them worth stocking  then another head went away high in the air with its plumes quivering one afternoon late a lady came flying in with all the marks whatever they are of transatlantic travel upon her  im just through the customs and ive motored up here the first thing even before i went home to stop you from selling that book i recommended its dreadful and horrors horrors here it is by the hundreds oh mr erlcort you mustnt sell that dreadful book you see i had skipped through it in my berth going out and posted my letter the first thing and just now coming home i found it in the ships library and came on that frightful episode you know where how could you order it without reading it on a mere sayso its utterly immoral  i dont agree with you erlcort answered dryly i consider that passage one of the finest in modern fictionone of the most ennobling and illumining  ennobling the lady made a gesture of horror very well if that is your idea of a critical bookstore all ive got to say is  but she had apparently no words to say it in and she went out banging but failing to latch the door which let through the indignant snort of her car as it whirled her away she left erlcort and his assistant to a common silence but he imagined somehow a resolution in the stenographer not to let the book go unsearched till she had grasped the full iniquity of that episode and felt all its ennobling force he was not consoled when another lady came in and after drifting unmolestedly about it was the primary rule of the place not to follow people up stopped before the side shelf where the book was ranged in dozens and scores she took a copy from the neat ranks and opened it then she lifted her head by chance and caught sight of her plume in one of the little mirrors she stealthily lifted herself on tiptoe till she could see her face and then she turned to the assistant and said gently i believe i should like this book please and paid for it and went out  it was now almost on the stroke of six and erlcort said to his assistant ill close the store miss pearsall you neednt stay any longer  all right sir the girl said and went into the little closet at the rear for her hat and coat did she contrive to get a copy of that book under her coat as she passed the shelf where it lay  when she was gone he turned the key in the door and went back and sat down before the fire dying on the hearth of the franklin stove it was not a very cheerful moment with him but he could not have said that the day had been unprofitable either spiritually or pecuniarily in its experiences it had been a varied day and he had really sold a good many books more people than he could have expected had taken him seriously and even intelligently it is true that he had been somewhat vexed by the sort of authority the president of the intellectual club had shown in the way she swelled into the store and patronized him and it as if she had invented them both and blamed him in a high sweet voice for having so many old books my idea was that it would be a place where one could come for the best of the new books but here why half of them i saw in june before i sailed she chided him merrily and she acted as if it were quite part of the joke when he said that he did not think a good book could age much in four months she laughed patronizingly at his conceit of getting in the fall books by thanksgiving but even for the humor of it she could not let him say he should not do anything in holiday books i had expected to get all my christmas books of you mr erlcort she crowed but for the present she bought nothing in compensation he recalled the gratitude almost humble gratitude of a lady she was a lady who had come that day bringing her daughter to get a book any book in his stock and to thank him for his enterprise which she had found worked perfectly in the case of the book she had got the week before the book had been an unalloyed delight and had left a sense of heightened selfrespect with her that book of the dreadful episode  he wished margaret green had been there but she had been there only once since his opening he could not think why he heard a rattling at the doorlatch and he said before he turned to look what if it should be she now but when he went to peer through the doorcurtain it was only an old fellow who had spent the better part of the afternoon in the best chair reading a book erlcort went back to the fire and let him rattle which he did rather a long time and then went away erlcort hoped in dudgeon he was one of a number of customers who had acted on the half of his motto asking them to sit down and rest them after acting on the other half to look round all they wanted most of them did not read even they seemed to know one another and they talked comfortably together erlcort recognized a companionship of four whom he had noticed in the park formerly they were cleanenoughlooking elderly men but occupied nearly all the chairs and settles so that lady customers did not like to bring books and look over them in the few places left and erlcort foresaw the time when he should have to ask the old fellows to look around more and rest them less in resuming his own place before the fire he felt the fleeting ache of a desire to ask margaret green whether it would not be a good plan to remove the motto from the chimneypiece he would not have liked to do it without asking her it had been her notion to put it there and her other notion of the immoral mirrors had certainly worked well the thoughtful expression they had reflected on the faces of lady customers had sold a good many books not that erlcort wished to sell books that way though he argued with himself that his responsibility ought strictly to end with the provision of books which he had critically approved before offering them for sale  his conscience was not wholly at peace as to his stock not only the books which he had included but also those he had excluded some of these tacitly pleaded against his severity in one case an author came and personally protested this was the case of a book by the exbestseller who held that his last book was so much better than his first that it ought certainly to be found in any critical bookstore the proceeds of his bestseller had enabled him to buy an electric runabout and he purred up to erlcorts door in it to argue the matter with him he sat down in a reproduction and proved gaily that erlcort was quite wrong about it he had the book with him and read passages from it then he read passages from some of the books on sale and defied erlcort to say that his passages were not just as good or as he put it merrily the same as he held that his marked improvement entitled him to the favor of a critical bookstore without this what motive had he in keeping from a reversion to the errors which had won him the vicious prosperity of his first venture hadnt erlcort a duty to perform in preventing his going back to the bad refuse this markedly improved fiction and you drove him to writing nothing but bestsellers from now on he urged erlcort to reflect  they had a jolly time and the exbestseller went away in high spirits prophesying that erlcort would come to his fiction yet  there were authors who did not leave erlcort so cheerful when they failed to see their books on his shelves or tables some of them were young authors who had written their worthless books with a devout faith in their worth and they went away more in sorrow than in anger and yet more in bewilderment some were old authors who had been all their lives acceptably writing secondrate books and trying to make them unacceptably firstrate if he knew them he kept out of their way but the dejection of their looks was not less a pang to him if he saw them searching his stock for their books in vain  he had his own moments of dejection the interest of the press in his enterprise had flashed through the sunday issues of a single week and then flashed out in lasting darkness he wondered vaguely if he had counted without the countinghouse in hoping for their continued favor he could not realize that nothing is so stale as old news and that no excess of advertising would have relumed those fitful fires  he would have liked to talk the case over with margaret green after his first revolt from the easy publicity the reporters had first given him he was aware of having enjoyed itperhaps vulgarly enjoyed it but he hoped not quite that he hoped that in his fleeting celebrity he had cared for his scheme rather than himself he had really believed in it and he liked having it recognized as a feature of modern civilization an innovation which did his city and his country credit now and then an essayist of those who wrote thoughtful articles in the sunday or saturdayevening editions had dropped in and he had opened his heart to them in a way he would not have minded their taking advantage of secretly he hoped they would see a topic in his enterprise and his philosophy of it but they never did and he was left to the shame of hopes which had held nothing to support defeat he would have liked to confess his shame and own the justice of his punishment to margaret green but she seemed the only friend who never came near other friends came and many strangers the friends to look and the strangers to buy he had no reason to complain of his sales the fame of his critical bookstore might have ceased in new york because it had gone abroad to chicago and st louis and pittsburg people who were clearly from these commercial capitals and others came and bought copiously of his criticized stock and they praised the notion of it in telling him that he ought to open branches in their several cities  they were all women and it was nearly all women who frequented the critical bookstore but in their multitude margaret green was not he thought it the greater pity because she would have enjoyed many of them with him and would have divined such as hoped the culture implicated by a critical bookstore would come off on them without great effort of their own she would have known the sincere spirits too and could have helped direct their choice of the best where all was so good he smiled to find that he was invoking her help which he had no right to  his longing had no effect upon her till deep in january when the weather was engaged late one afternoon in keeping the promise of a january thaw in the form of the worst snowstorm of the winter then she came thumping with her umbrellahandle at his door as if he divined she were too stiffhanded or too packageladen to press the latch and let herself in and she almost fell in but saved herself by spilling on the floor some canvases and other things which she had been getting at the artistsmaterials store near by dont bother about them she said but take me to the fire as fast as you can and when she had turned from snow to rain and had dripped partially dry before the franklin stove she asked where have you been all the time  waiting here for you he answered  well you neednt i wasnt going to comeor at least not till you sent for me or said you wanted my advice  i dont want your advice now  i didnt come to give it i just dropped in because if i hadnt i should have just dropped outside how have you been getting along with your ridiculous critical bookstore  well things are rather quiet with us just now as the publishers say to the authors when they dont want to publish their books  yes i know that saying why didnt you go in for the holiday books  how did you know i didnt  lots of people told me  well then ill tell you why i would have had to read them first and no human being could do thatnot even a volunteer link in an endless chain  i see but since christmas  you know very well that after christmas the book market drops dead  yes so ive been told she had flung her wet veil back over her shoulders and he thought she had never looked so adorably plain before if she could have seen herself in a glass she would have found her whole face out of drawing it seemed as if his thinking had put her in mind of them and she said those immoral mirrors are shameful  theyve sold more of the best books than anything else  no matter as soon as i get a little drier i shall take them down  very well i didnt put them up he laid a log of hickory on the fire im not doing it to dry you quicker  oh i know ill tell you one thing you ought to keep the magazines or at least the big four you could keep them with a good conscience and you could sell them without reading theyre always good  theres an idea in that i believe ill try it  margaret green was now dry enough and she rose and removed the mirrors in doing this she noticed that erlcort had apparently sold a good many of his best books and she said well i dont see why you should be discouraged  who said i was im exultant  then you were exulting with the corners of your mouth down just now well i must be going will you get a taxi to flounder over to the subway with me while erlcort was telephoning she was talking to him i believe the magazines will revive public interest in your scheme put them in your window try to get advance copies for it  you have a commercial genius margaret green  when it comes to selling literature i have selling art is where i fall down  thats because you always try to sell your own art i should fall down too if i tried to sell my own literature  they got quite back to their old friendliness the coming of the taxi gave them plenty of time the electric lights were turned brilliantly on but there at the far end of the store before the franklin stove they had a cozy privacy at the moment of parting she said  if i were you i should take out these settles they simply invite loafing  ive noticed that they seem to do that  and better paint out that motto  ive sometimes fancied id better that invites loafing too though some nice people like it  nice people why havent some of them bought a picture he perceived that she had taken in the persistent presence of the sketches when removing the mirrors and he shared the indignation she expressed shabby things  she stood with the mirrors under her arm and he asked what she was going to do with them as he followed her to the door with her other things  put them around the studio but you neednt come to see the effect  no i shall come to see you  but when he came in a lull of february and he could walk part of the way up through the park on the sunny saturday afternoon she said  i suppose youve come to pour out some more of your griefs well pour away has the magazine project failed  on the contrary it has been a succès fou but i dont feel altogether easy in my mind about it the fact is they seem to print much more rubbish than i supposed  of course they do they must rubbish is the breath in their nostrils  she painted away screwing her eyes almost shut and getting very close to her picture he had never thought her so plain she was letting her mouth hang open he wondered why she was so charming but when she stepped back rhythmically tilting her pretty head this way and that he saw why it was her unfailing grace she suddenly remembered her mouth and shut it to say well  well some people have come back at me theyve said what a rotten number this or that was they were right and yet there were things in all those magazines better than anything they had ever printed whats to be done about it i cant ask people to buy truck or read truck because it comes bound up with essays and stories and poems of the first quality  no you cant why she asked drifting up to her picture again dont you tear the bad out and sell the good  erlcort gave a disdainful sound such as cannot be spelled in english do you know how defiantly the bad is bound up with the good in the magazines theyre wired together and you could no more tear out the bad and leave the good than you could part vice from virtue in human nature  i see margaret green said but she saw no further and she had to let him go disconsolate after waiting a decent time she went to find him in his critical bookstore it was late in an afternoon of the days that were getting longer and only one electric was lighted in the rear of the room where erlcort sat before the fireless franklin stove so busy at something that he scarcely seemed aware of her  what in the world are you doing she demanded  he looked up who i oh its you why im merely censoring the truck in the may number of this magazine he held up a little roller as long as the magazine was wide blacked with printers ink which he had been applying to the open periodical ive taken a hint from the way the russian censorship blots out seditious literature before it lets it go to the public  and what a mess youre making  of course it will have to dry before its put on sale  i should think so listen to me frederick erlcort youre going crazy  ive sometimes thought so crazy with conceit and vanity and arrogance who am i that i should set up for a critical bookstorekeeper what is the republic of letters anyway a vast benevolent generous democracy where one may have what one likes or a cold oligarchy where he is compelled to take what is good for him is it a restricted citizenship with a minority representation or is it universal suffrage  now margaret green said you are talking sense why didnt you think of this in the beginning  is it a world a whole earth he went on where the weeds mostly outflourish the flowers or is it a wretched little florists conservatory where the wateringpot assumes to better the instruction of the rain which falls upon the just and the unjust what is all the worthy family of asses to do if there are no thistles to feed them because the succulent fruits and nourishing cereals are better for the finer organisms are the coarser not to have fodder no i have made a mistake literature is the whole world it is the expression of the gross the fatuous and the foolish and it is the pleasure of the gross the fatuous and the foolish as well as the expression and the pleasure of the wise the fine the elect let the multitude have their truck their rubbish their rot it may not be the truck the rubbish the rot that it would be to us or may slowly and by natural selection become to certain of them but let there be no artificial selection no survival of the fittest by main forcethe force of the spectator who thinks he knows better than the creator of the ugly and the beautiful the fair and foul the evil and good  oh now if the intellectual club could hear you margaret green said with a long deep admiring suspiration and what are you going to do with your critical bookstore  im going to sell it ive had an offer from the author of that bestsellerive told you about him i was just trying to censor that magazine while i was thinking it over hes got an idea hes going to keep it a critical bookstore but the criticism is to be made by universal suffrage and the will of the majority the latest books will be put to a vote and the one getting the greatest number of votes will be the first offered for sale and the author will receive a free passage to europe by the southern route  the southern route margaret mused ive never been that way it must be delightful  then come with me im going  but how can i  by marrying me  i never thought of that she said then with the conscientious resolution of an elderly girl who puts her fate to the touch of any risk the truth compels she added or yes i have but i never supposed you would ask me she stared at him and she was aware she was letting her mouth hang open while she was trying for some word to close it with he closed it for her                                      xiv                            a feast of reason   florindo and lindora had come to the end of another winter in town and had packed up for another summer in the country they were sitting together over their last breakfast until the taxi should arrive to whirl them away to the station and were brooding in a joint gloom from the effect of the dinner they had eaten at the house of a friend the night before and well thank goodness she said there is an end to that sort of thing for one while  an end to that thing he partially assented but not that sort of thing  what do you mean she demanded excitedly almost resentfully  i mean that the lunch is of the nature of the dinner and that in the country we shall begin lunching where we left off dining  not instantly she protested shrilly there will be nobody there for a whilenot for a whole month nearly  they will be there before you can turn round almost and then you women will begin feeding one another there before you have well left off here  we women she protested  yes youyou women you give the dinners can you deny it  its because we cant get you to the lunches  in the country you can and so you will give the lunches  we would give dinners if it were not for the distance and the darkness on those bad roads  i dont see where your reasoning is carrying you  no she despaired there is no reason in it no sense how tired of it all i am and as you say it will be no time before it is all going on again  they computed the number of dinners they had given during the winter that was not hard and the sum was not great six or seven at the most large and small when it came to the dinners they had received it was another thing but still she considered were they really so few its nothing to what the english do they never dine alone at home and they never dine alone abroadof course not i wonder they can stand it i think a dinner the happytoaccept kind is always loathsome the everlasting soup if there arent oysters first or grapefruit or melon and the fish and the entrée and the roast and salad and the icecream and the fruit nobody touches and the coffee and cigarettes and cigarshow i hate it all  lindora sank back in her chair and toyed desperately with the fragment of bacon on her plate  and yet florindo said there is a charm about the first dinner of autumn after youve got back  oh yes she assented its like a part of our lost youth we think all the dinners of the winter will be like that and we come away beaming  but when it keeps on and theres more and more of our lost youth till it comes to being the whole  florindo she stopped him he pretended that he was not going to have said it and she resumed dreamily i wonder what it is makes it so detestable as the winter goes on  all customs are detestable the best of them he suggested and i should say in spite of the first autumnal dinner that the society dinner was an unlovely rite you try to carry if off with china and glass and silver and linen and if people could fix their minds on these or even on the dishes of the dinner as they come successively on it would be all very well but the diners the diners  yes she said the old men are hideous certainly and the young onesi try not to look at them poking things into the hollows of their faces with spoons and forks  better than when it was done with knives still its a horror a veteran dinerout in full action is certainly a hideous spectacle often he has few teeth of his own and the dentists dont serve him perfectly he is in danger of dropping things out of his mouth both liquids and solids better not look his eyes bulge and roll in his head in the stress of mastication and deglutition his color rises and spreads to his gray hair or over his baldness his person seems to swell vividly in his chair and when he laughs  dont florindo it is awful  well perhaps no worse than the sight of a middleaged matron tending to overweight and bulking above her plate  yes yes thats dreadful too but when people are young  oh when people are young he said this in despair then he went on in an audible muse when people are young they are not only in their own youth they are in the youth of the world the race they dine but they dont think of the dinner or the unpleasantness of the diners and the grotesqueness of feeding in common they think he broke off in defect of other ideas and concluded with a laugh they think of themselves and they dont think of how they are looking  they neednt they are looking very well dont keep harping on that i remember when we first began going to dinners i thought it was the most beautiful thing in the world i dont mean when i was a girl a girl only goes to a dinner because it comes before a dance i mean when we were young married people and i pinned up my dress and we went in the horsecars or even walked i enjoyed every instant of it the finding who was going to take me in and who you were and the going in and the hovering round the table to find our places from the cards and the seeing how you looked next some one else and wondering how you thought i looked and the beads sparkling up through the champagne and getting into ones nose and the laughing and joking and talking oh the talking whats become of it the talking last night it bored me to death and what good stories people used to tell women as well as men you cant deny it was beautiful  i dont and i dont deny that the forms of dining are still charming its the dining itself that i object to  thats because your digestion is bad  isnt yours  of course it is what has that got to do with it  it seems to me that we have arrived at what is called an impasse in french he looked up at the clock on the wall and she gave a little jump in her chair oh theres plenty of time the taxi wont be here for half an hour yet is there any heat left in that coffee  there will be she said and she lighted the lamp under the pot but i dont like being scared out of half a years growth  im sorry i wont look at the clock any more i dont care if were left where were we oh i rememberthe objection to dining itself if we could have the forms without the facts dining would be all right our superstition is that we cant be gay without gorging that society cant be run without meat and drink but dont you remember when we first went to italy there was no supper at italian houses where we thought it such a favor to be asked  i remember that the young italian swells wouldnt go to the american and english houses where they werent sure of supper they didnt give supper at the italian houses because they couldnt afford it  i know that i believe they do now but            sweet are the uses of adversity  and the fasting made for beauty then more than the feasting does now it was a lovelier sight to see the guests of those italian houses conversing together without the grossness of feeding or being fedthe sort of thing one saw at our houses when people went out to supper  i wonder lindora said whether the same sort of thing goes on at evening parties stillits so long since ive been at one it was awful standing jammed up in a corner or behind a door and eating visàvis with a man who brought you a plate and it wasnt much better when you sat down and he stood over you gabbling and gobbling with his plate in one hand and his fork in the other i was always afraid of his dropping things into my lap and the sight of his jaws champing as you looked up at them from below  yes ridiculous but there was an element of the grotesque in a birdseye view of a lady making shots at her mouth with a spoon and trying to smile and look spirituelle between the shots  lindora as she laughed bowed her forehead on the back of her hand in the way florindo thought so pretty when they were both young yes she said awful awful why should people want to flock together when they feed do you suppose its a survival of the primitive hospitality when those who had something to eat hurried to share it with those who had nothing  possibly florindo said flattered into consequence by her momentary deference or show of it but the people who mostly meet to feed together now are not hungry they are already so stuffed that they loathe the sight of the things some of them shirk the consequences by frankly dining at home first and then openly or covertly dodging the courses  yes and you hear that praised as a mark of high civilization or social wisdom i call it wicked and an insult to the very genius of hospitality  well i dont know it must give the faster a good chance of seeing how funny the feeders all look  i wonder i do wonder how the feeding in common came to be the custom she said thoughtfully of course where its done for convenience like hotels or in boardinghousesbut to do it wantonly as people do in society it ought to be stopped  we might call art to our aidhave a large tableful of people kodaked in the moments of ingulfing chewing or swallowing as the act varied from guest to guest might be reproduced as picture postals or from films for the movies that would give the ten and twenty cent audiences a chance to see what life in the exclusive circles was  she listened in dreamy inattention it was a step in the right direction when people began to have afternoon teas to be sure there was the biting and chewing sandwiches but you neednt take them and most women could manage their teacups gracefully  or hide their faces in them when they couldnt  only she continued the men wouldnt come after the first go off it was as bad as lunches now that the english way of serving tea to callers has come in its better you really get the men and it keeps them from taking cocktails so much  theyre rather glad of that but still still theres the guttling and guzzling  its reduced to a minimum  but its there and the first thing you know youve loaded yourself up with cake or breadandbutter and spoiled your appetite for dinner no afternoon tea must go with the rest of it if were going to be truly civilized if people could come to one anothers tables with full minds instead of stomachs there would be some excuse for hospitality perhaps if we reversed the practice of the professional dinerout and read up at home as he now eats at home and no i dont see how it could be done but we might take a leaf from the book of people who are not in society they never ask anybody to meals if they can possibly help it if some one happens in at mealtimes they tell him to pull up a chairif they have to or he shows no signs first of going but even among these people the instinct of hospitalitythe feeding form of itlurks somewhere in our farmboarding days  dont speak of them she implored  we once went to an evening party he pursued where raw apples and cold water were served  i thought i should die of hunger and when we got home to our own farmers we ravaged the pantry for everything left from supper it wasnt much there lindora screamed there is the taxi and the shuddering sound of the clock making time at their expense penetrated from the street come  how the instinct of economy lingers in us too long after the use of it is outgrown its as bad as the instinct of hospitality we could easily afford to pay extra for the comfort of sitting here over these broken victuals  i tell you we shall be left she retorted and in the thirtyfive minutes they had at the station before their train started she outlined a scheme of social reform which she meant to put in force as soon as people began to gather in summer force at lobster cove  he derided the notion but she said you will see and in rather more time than it takes to tell it they were settled in their cottage where after some unavoidable changes of cook and laundress they were soon in perfect running order  by this time lobster cove was in the full tide of lunching and being lunched the lunches were almost exclusively ladies lunches and the ladies came to them with appetites sharpened by the incomparable air of those real lobster cove days which were all cloudless skies and west winds and by the vigorous automobile exercise of getting to one anothers cottages they seized every pretext for giving these feasts marked each by some vivid touch of invention within the limits of the graceful convention which all felt bound not to transcend it was some surprising flavor in the salad or some touch of color appealing to the eye only or it was some touch in the icecream or some daring substitution of a native dish for it as strawberry or peach shortcake or some bold transposition in the order of the courses or some capricious arrangement of the decoration or the use of wild flowers or even weeds as meadowrue or fieldlilies for the local florists flowers which set the ladies screaming at the moment and talking of it till the next lunch this would follow perhaps the next day or the next but one according as a new cottagers claims insisted or a lady had a change of guests or three days at the latest for no reason  in their rapid succession people scarcely noticed that lindora had not given a lunch and she had so far abandoned herself to the enjoyment of the others lunches that she had half forgotten her high purposes of reform when she was sharply recalled to them by a lunch which had not at all agreed with her she had in fact had to have the doctor and many people had asked one another whether they had heard how she was then she took her good resolution in both hands and gave an afternoon asking people by note or phone simply whether they would not come in at four sharp people were a good deal mystified but for this very reason everybody came some of them came from somebodys lunch which had been so nice that they lingered over it till four and then walked partly to fill in the time and partly to walk off the lunch as there would be sure to be something at lindoras later on  it would be invidious to say what the nature of lindoras entertainment was it was certainly to the last degree original and those who said the worst of it could say no worse than that it was queer it quite filled the time till six oclock and may be perhaps best described as a negative rather than a positive triumph though what lindora had aimed at she had undoubtedly achieved whatever it was whether original or queer it was certainly novel  a good many men had come one at least to every five ladies but as the time passed and a certain blankness began to gather over the spirits of all they fell into different attitudes of the despair which the ladies did their best to pass off for rapture at each unscheduled noise they started in a vain expectation and when the end came it came so without accent so without anything but the clock to mark it as the close that they could hardly get themselves together for going away they did what was nice and right of course in thanking lindora for her fascinating afternoon but when they were well beyond hearing one said to another well i shall certainly have an appetite for my dinner tonight why if there had only been a cup of the weakest kind of tea or even of cold water  then those who had come in autos gathered as many pedestrians into them as they would hold in leaving the house or caught them up fainting by the way  lindora and florindo watched them from their veranda  well my dear he said its been a wonderful afternoon an immense stride forward in the cause of antieatingor  dont speak to me she cried  but it leaves one rather hungry doesnt it  hungry she hurled back at him i could eat ai dont know what                                       xv                       city and country in the fall                         a longdistance eclogue                                   1902     morrison hello hello is that you wetherbee    wetherbee yes who are you what do you want with me    morrison oh nothing much its morrison you know   morrisondown at clamhurst shortsands    wetherbee                             oh   why morrison of course of course i know   how are you morrison and by the way   where are you what you never mean to say   you are down there yet well by the holy poker   what are you doing there you ancient joker    morrison sticking it out over thanksgiving day   i said i would i tell you it is gay   down here you ought to see the hunters moon   these silver nights prinking in our lagoon   you ought to see our sunsets glassy red   shading to pink and violet overhead   you ought to see our mornings still and clear   white silence far as you can look and hear   you ought to see the leavesour oaks and ashes   crimson and yellow with those gorgeous splashes   purple and orange against the bluish green   of the pine woods and scattered in between   the scarlet of the maples and the blaze   of blackberryvines along the dusty ways   and on the old stone walls the air just balm   and the crows cawing through the perfect calm   of afternoons all gold and turquoise say   you ought to have been with wife and me today   a drive we tookit would have made you sick   the pigeons and the partridges so thick   and on the hill just beyond barkins lane   before you reach the barn of widow payne   showing right up against the sky as clear   and motionless as sculpture stood a deer   say does that jar you just a little say   how have you found things up there anyway   since you got back air like a cotton string   to breathe the same old dust on everything   and in your teeth and in your eyes the smoke   from the soft coal got long beyond a joke   the trolleys rather more upon your curves   and all the roar and clatter in your nerves   dont you wish you had stayed here too    wetherbee                          well yes   i do at certain times i must confess   i swear it is enough at times to make you swear   you would almost rather be anywhere   than here the building up and pulling down   the getting to and fro about the town   the turmoil underfoot and overhead   certainly make you wish that you were dead   at first and all the mean vulgarity   of city life the filth and misery   you see around you make you want to put   back to the country anywhere hotfoot   yetthere are compensations    morrison                    such as    wetherbee                           why   there is the club    morrison         the club i cant deny   many o the fellows back there    wetherbee                     nearly all   over the twilight cocktails there are tall   stories and talk but you would hardly care   you have the natives to talk with down there   and always find them meaty    morrison                  well soso   their words outlast their ideas at times you know   and they have staying powers the theaters   all open now    wetherbee    yes all and it occurs   to me theres one among the things that you   would have enjoyed an opera with the new   or at least the lastmusic by sullivan   and words though not gilbertian that ran   trippingly with it oh i tell you what   id rather that you had been there than not    morrison thanks ever so    wetherbee                oh there is nothing mean   about your early friend that deer and autumn scene   were kind of you and say i think you like   afternoon teas when good i have chanced to strike   some of the best of late where people said   they had sent you cards but thought you must be dead   i told them i left you down there by the sea   and then they sort of looked askance at me   as if it were a joke and bade me get   myself some bouillon or some chocolate   and turned the subjectdid not even give   me time to prove it is not life to live   in town as long as you can keep from freezing   beside the autumn sea a little sneezing   at clamhurst shortsands since the frosts set in    morrison well not enough to make a true friend grin   slight colds mere nothings with our open fires   weve all the warmth and cheer that heart desires   next year well have a furnace in and stay   not till thanksgiving but till christmas day   its glorious in these roomy autumn nights   to sit between the firelight and the lights   of our big lamps and read aloud by turns   as long as kerosene or hickory burns   we hate to go to bed    wetherbee           of course you do   and hate to get up in the morning too   to pull the coverlet from your frostbit nose   and touch the glary matting with your toes   are you beginning yet to break the ice   in your washpitchers no well that is nice   i always hate to do itseems as if   summer was going but when your hand is stiff   with cold it can be done still i prefer   to wash and dress beside my register   when summer gets a little on like this   but some folks find the other thing pure bliss   lusty young chaps like you    morrison                   and some folks find   a sizzling radiator to their mind   what else have you there you could recommend   to the attention of a country friend    wetherbee well you know how it is in madison square   late afternoons now if the days been fair   how all the western sidewalk ebbs and flows   with pretty women in their pretty cloes   ive never seen them prettier than this year   of course i know a dear is not a deer   but still i think that if i had to meet   one or the other in the road or street   all by myself i am not sure but that   id choose the dear that wears the fetching hat    morrison get out what else    wetherbee                well it is not so bad   if you are feeling a little down or sad   to walk along fifth avenue to the park   when the day thinks perhaps of getting dark   and meet that mighty flood of vehicles   laden with all the different kinds of swells   homing to dinner in their carriages   victorias landaus chariots coupés   theres nothing like it to lift up the heart   and make you realize yourself a part   sure of the greatest show on earth    morrison                           oh yes   i know ive felt that rapture more or less   but i would rather put it off as long   as possible i suppose you like the song   of the sweet cargongs better than the cry   of jays and yellowhammers when the sky   begins to redden these october mornings   and the loons sound their melancholy warnings   or honk of the wildgeese that write their a   along the horizon in the evenings gray   or when the squirrels look down on you and bark   from the nut trees    wetherbee           we have them in the park   plenty enough but say you aged sinner   have you been out much recently at dinner    morrison what do you mean you know theres no one here   that dines except ourselves now    wetherbee                well thats queer   i thought the natives but i recollect   it was not reasonable to expect    morrison what are you driving at    wetherbee              oh nothing much   but i was thinking how you come in touch   with life at the first dinner in the fall   when you get back first as you cant at all   later along but you of course wont care   with your idyllic pleasures    morrison                   who was there    wetherbee ohha ha what dyou mean by there    morrison                              come off    wetherbee what you remain to pray that came to scoff    morrison you know what i am after    wetherbee                         yes that dinner   just a round dozen ferguson and binner   for the fine arts bowyer the novelist   dr le martin the psychologist   fletcher the english actor philipson   the two newspaper witkins bob and john   a nice bostonian bane the archæologer   and a queer russian amateur astrologer   and father gray the jolly ritualist priest   and last your humble servant but not least   the food was not so filthy and the wine   was not so poison we made out to dine   from eight till one am one could endure   the dinner but oh say the talk was poor   your natives down at clamhurst    morrison                      look ye here   what date does thanksgiving come on this year    wetherbee why i supposealthough i dont remember   certainlythe usual 28th november    morrison novem you should have waited to get sober   it comes on the 11th of october   and thats tomorrow and if you happen down   later youd better look for us in town                                      xvi                                table talk   they were talking after dinner in that cozy moment when the conversation has ripened just before the coffee into mocking guesses and laughing suggestions the thing they were talking of was something that would have held them apart if less happily timed and placed but then and there it drew these together in what most of them felt a charming and flattering intimacy not all of them took part in the talk and of those who did none perhaps assumed to talk with authority or finality at first they spoke of the subject as it forbearing to name it as if the name of it would convey an unpleasant shock out of temper with the general feeling  i dont suppose the host said that its really so much commoner than it used to be but the publicity is more invasive and explosive thats perhaps because it has got higher up in the world and has spread more among the first circles the time was when you seldom heard of it there and now it is scarcely a scandal i remember that when i went abroad twenty or thirty years ago and the english brought me to book about it i could put them down by saying that i didnt know a single divorced person  and of course a bachelor guest ventured a person of that sort must be single  at first the others did not take the joke then they laughed but the women not so much as the men  and you couldnt say that now the lady on the right of the host inquired  why i dont know he returned thoughtfully after a little interval i dont just call one to mind  then the bachelor said that classes you if you moved in our best society you would certainly know some of the many smart people whose disunions alternate with the morning murders in the daily papers  yes the fact seems to rank me rather low but im rather proud of the fact  the hostess seemed not quite to like this arrogant humility she said over the length of the table it was not very long im sure you know some very nice people who have not been  well yes i do but are they really smart people theyre of very good family certainly  you mustnt brag the bachelor said  a husband on the right of the hostess wondered if there were really more of the thing than there used to be  qualitatively yes i should say quantitatively im not convinced the host answered in a good many of the states its been made difficult  the husband on the right of the hostess was not convinced he said as to the qualitative increase the parties to the suits were rich enough and sometimes they were high enough placed and far enough derived but there was nearly always a leak in them a social leak somewhere on one side or the other they could not be said to be persons of quality in the highest sense  why persons of quality seldom can be the bachelor contended  the girl opposite who had been invited to balance him in the scale of celibacy by the hostess in her study of her dinnerparty first smiled and then alleged a very distinguished instance of divorce in which the parties were both of immaculate origin and unimpeachable fashion nobody she said can accuse them of a want of quality she was goodlooking though no longer so young as she could have wished she flung out her answer to the bachelor defiantly but she addressed it to the host and he said that was true certainly it was a signal case but wasnt it exceptional the others mentioned like cases though none quite so perfect and then there was a lull till the husband on the left of the hostess noted a fact which renewed the life of the discussion  there was a good deal of agitation six or eight years ago about it i dont know whether the agitation accomplished anything  the host believed it had influenced legislation  for or against the bachelor inquired  oh against  but in other countries its been coming in more and more it seems to be as easy in england now as it used to be in indiana in france its nothing scandalous and in norwegian society you meet so many disunited couples in a state of quadruplicate reunion that it is very embarrassing it doesnt seem to bother the parties to the new relation themselves  its very common in germany too the husband on the right of the hostess said  the husband on her left side said he did not know just how it was in italy and spain and no one offered to disperse his ignorance  in the silence which ensued the lady on the left of the host created a diversion in her favor by saying that she had heard they had a very good law in switzerland  being asked to tell what it was she could not remember but her husband on the right of the hostess saved the credit of his family by supplying her defect oh yes its very curious we heard of it when we were there when people want to be put asunder for any reason or other they go before a magistrate and declare their wish then they go home and at the end of a certain timeweeks or monthsthe magistrate summons them before him with a view to reconciliation if they come it is a good sign if they dont come or come and persist in their desire then they are summoned after another interval and are either reconciled or put asunder as the case may be or as they choose it is not expensive and i believe it isnt scandalous  it seems very sensible the husband on the left of the hostess said as if to keep the other husband in countenance but for an interval no one else joined him and the mature girl said to the man next her that it seemed rather coldblooded he was a man who had been entreated to come in on the frank confession that he was asked as a stopgap the original guest having fallen by the way such men are apt to abuse their magnanimity their condescension they think that being there out of compassion and in compliance with a hospitality that had not at first contemplated their presence they can say anything they are usually asked without but through their wives who are asked to lend them and who lend them with a grudge veiled in eager acquiescence and the men think it will afterward advantage them with their wives when they find they are enjoying themselves if they will go home and report that they said something vexing or verging on the offensive to their hostess this man now addressed himself to the lady at the head of the table  why do we all talk as if we thought divorce was an unquestionable evil  the hostess looked with a frightened air to the right and left and then down the table to her husband but no one came to her rescue and she asked feebly as if foreboding trouble for she knew she had taken a liberty with this mans wife why dont we  about one in seven of us doesnt the stopgap said  oh the girl beside him cried out in a horrorstricken voice which seemed not to interpret her emotion truly is it so bad as that  perhaps not quite even if it is bad at all he returned and the hostess smiled gratefully at the girl for drawing his fire but it appeared she had not for he directed his further speech at the hostess again really the most inoffensive person there and the least able to contend with adverse opinions  no i dont believe we do think it an unquestionable evil unless we think marriage is so everybody sat up as the stopgap had intended no doubt and he held them with his glittering eye or as many as he could sweep with his glance i suppose that the greatest hypocrite at this table where we are all so frankly hypocrites together will not deny that marriage is the prime cause of divorce in fact divorce couldnt exist without it  the women all looked bewilderedly at one another and then appealingly at the men none of these answered directly but the bachelor softly intoned out of gilbert and sullivanhe was of that date            a paradox a paradox             a most ingenious paradox  yes the stopgap defiantly assented a paradox and all aboriginal verities all giant truths are paradoxes  giant truths is good the bachelor noted but the stopgap did not mind him  he turned to the host i suppose that if divorce is an evil and we wish to extirpate it we must strike at its root at marriage  the host laughed i prefer not to take the floor im sure we all want to hear what you have to say in support of your mammoth idea  oh yes indeed the women chorused but rather tremulously as not knowing what might be coming  which do you mean that all truth is paradoxical or that marriage is the mother of divorce  whichever you like  the last proposition is selfevident the stopgap said supplying himself with a small bunch of the grapes which nobody ever takes at dinner the hostess was going to have coffee for the women in the drawingroom and to leave the men to theirs with their tobacco at the table and you must allow that if divorce is a good thing or a bad thing it equally partakes of the nature of its parent or else theres nothing in heredity  oh come one of the husbands said  very well the stopgap submitted i yield the word to you but as the other went no further he continued the case is so clear that it needs no argument up to this time in dealing with the evil of divorce if it is an evil we have simply been suppressing the symptoms and your swiss method  oh it isnt mine the man said who had stated it  is only a part of the general practice it is another attempt to make divorce difficult when it is marriage that ought to be made difficult  some the daring bachelor said think it ought to be made impossible the girl across the table began to laugh hysterically but caught herself up and tried to look as if she had not laughed at all  i dont go as far as that the stopgap resumed but as an inveterate enemy of divorce  an oh varying from surprise to derision chorused up but he did not mind it he went on as if uninterrupted  i should put every possible obstacle and at every step in the way of marriage the attitude of society toward marriage is now simply preposterous absolutely grotesque society the whole human framework in all its manifestations social literary religious artistic and civic is perpetually guilty of the greatest mischief in the matter nothing is done to retard or prevent marriage everything to accelerate and promote it marriage is universally treated as a virtue which of itself consecrates the lives of the mostly vulgar and entirely selfish young creatures who enter into it the blind and witless passion in which it oftenest originates at least with us is flattered out of all semblance to its sister emotions and revered as if it were a celestial inspiration a spiritual impulse but is it i defy any one here to say that it is  as if they were afraid of worse things if they spoke the company remained silent but this did not save them  you all know it isnt you all know that it is the caprice of chance encounter the result of propinquity the invention of poets and novelists the superstition of the victims the unscrupulous makebelieve of the witnesses as an impulse it quickly wears itself out in marriage and makes way for divorce in this country ninetenths of the marriages are lovematches the old motives which delay and prevent marriage in other countries aristocratic countries like questions of rank and descent even of money do not exist yet this is the land of unhappy unions beyond all other lands the very home of divorce the conditions of marriage are ideally favorable according to the opinions of its friends who are all more or less active in bottling husbands and wives up in its felicity and preventing their escape through divorce  still the others were silent and again the stopgap triumphed on now i am an enemy of divorce too but i would have it begin before marriage  rather paradoxical again the bachelor alone had the hardihood to suggest  not at all i am quite literal i would have it begin with the engagement i would have the betrothedthe mistress and the lovercome before the magistrate or the minister and declare their motives in wishing to marry and then i would have him reason with them and represent that they were acting emotionally in obedience to a passion which must soon spend itself or a fancy which they would quickly find illusory if they agreed with him well and good if not he should dismiss them to their homes for say three months to think it over then he should summon them again and again reason with them and dismiss them as before if they continued obstinate after three months more he should call them before him and reason with them for the last time if they persisted in spite of everything he should marry them and let them take the consequences  the stopgap leaned back in his chair defiantly and fixed the host with an eye of challenge upon the whole the host seemed not so much frightened he said i dont see anything so original in all that its merely a travesty of the swiss law of divorce  and you see nothing novel nothing that makes for the higher civilization in the application of that law to marriage you all approve of that law because you believe it prevents ninetenths of the divorces but if you had a law that would similarly prevent ninetenths of the marriages you would need no divorce law at all  oh i dont know that the hardy bachelor said what about the onetenth of the marriages which it didnt prevent would you have the parties hopelessly shut up to them would you forbid them all hope of escape would you have no divorce for any cause whatever  yes the husband on the right of the hostess asked but his wife on the right of the host looked as if she wished he had not mixed in wouldnt more unhappiness result from that one marriage than from all the marriages as we have them now  arent you both rather precipitate the stopgap demanded i said let the parties to the final marriage take the consequences but if these consequences were too dire i would not forbid them the hope of relief i havent thought the matter out very clearly yet but there are one or two causes for divorce which i would admit  ah the host inquired with a provisional smile  yes causes going down into the very nature of thingsthe nature of men and of women incompatibility of temperament ought always to be very seriously considered as a cause  yes  and above all and here the stopgap swept the board with his eye difference of sex  the sort of laugh which expresses uncertainty of perception and conditional approval went up  the hostess rose with rather a frightened air shall we leave them to their tobacco she said to the other women  when he went home the stopgap celebrated his triumph to his wife i dont think shell ask you for the loan of me again to fill a place without you  yes she answered remotely you dont suppose shell think we live unhappily together                                      xvii                      the escapade of a grandfather   well what are you doing here the younger of the two sages asked with a resolute air of bonhomie as he dragged himself over the asphalt path and sank gasping into the seat beside the other in the park his senior lifted his head and looked him carefully over to make sure of his identity and then he said  i suppose to answer your fatuous question i am waiting here to get my breath before i move on and in the next place i am watching the feet of the women who go by in their highheeled shoes  how long do you think it will take you to get your breath in the atmosphere of these motors the younger sage pursued and you dont imagine that these women are of the first fashion do you  no but i imagine their shoes are i have been calculating that their average heel is from an inch and a half to two inches high and touches the ground in the circumference of a twentyfivecent piece as you seem to be fond of asking questions perhaps you will like to answer one why do you think they do it  wear shoes like that the younger returned cheerily and laughed as he added because the rest do  mmm the elder grumbled not wholly pleased and yet not refusing the answer he had been having a little touch of grippe and was somewhat broken from his wonted cynicism he said its very strange very sad just now there was such a pretty young girl so sweet and fine went tottering by as helpless in any exigency as the daughter of a thousand years of boundfeet chinese women while she tilted on the nice young fellow with her swept forward with one stride to her three on the wide soles and low heels of naturelast boots and kept himself from outwalking her by a devotion that made him grit his teeth probably she was wiser and better and brighter than he but she didnt look it and i who voted to give her the vote the other day had my misgivings i think i shall satisfy myself for the next five years by catching cold in taking my hat off to her in elevators and getting killed by automobiles in helping her off the cars where ive given her my seat  but you must allow that if her shoes are too tight her skirts are not so tight as they were or have you begun sighing for the good old hobbleskirts now theyre gone  the hobbleskirts were prettier than i thought they were when they were with us but the tempestuous petticoat has its charm which i find id been missing  well at least its a change the younger sage allowed and i havent found the other changes in our dear old new york which i look for when i come back in the fall  the sages were enjoying together the soft weather which lingered with us a whole month from the middle of october onward and the afternoon of their meeting in the park was now softly reddening to the dim sunset over the westward trees  yes the elder assented i miss the new skyscrapers which used to welcome me back up and down the avenue but there are more automobiles than ever and the game of saving your life from them when you cross the street is madder and merrier than i have known it before  the war seems to have stopped building because people cant afford it the other suggested but it has only increased automobiling  well people cant afford that either ninetenths of them are traveling the road to ruin im told and apparently they cant get over the ground too fast just look and the sages joined in the amused and mournful contemplation of the different types of motors innumerably whirring up and down the drive before them while they choked in the fumes of the gasolene  the motors were not the costliest types except in a few instances and in most instances they were the cheaper types such as those who could not afford them could at least afford best the sages had found a bench beside the walk where the statue of daniel webster looks down on the confluence of two driveways and the stream of motors going and coming is like a seething torrent either way  the mystery is the elder continued why they should want to do it in the way they do it are they merely going somewhere and must get there in the shortest time possible or are they arriving on a wager if they are taking a pleasure drive what a droll idea of pleasure they must have maybe they are trying to escape black care but they must know he sits beside the chauffeur as he used to sit behind the horseman and they know that he has a mortgage in his pocket and can foreclose it any time on the house they have hypothecated to buy their car ah the old man started forward with the involuntary impulse of rescue but it was not one of the people who singly or in terrorized groups had been waiting at the roadside to find their way across it was only a hapless squirrel of those which used to make their way safely among the hoofs and wheels of the kind old cabs and carriages and it lay instantly crushed under the tire of a motor hes done for poor little wretch they cant get used to the change some day a policeman will pick me up from under a secondhand motor i wonder what the great daniel from his pedestal up there would say if he came to judgment  he wouldnt believe in the change any more than that squirrel he would decide that he was dreaming and would sleep on forgetting and forgotten  forgotten the elder sage assented i remember when his fame filled the united states which was then the whole world to me and now i dont imagine that our hyphenated citizens have the remotest consciousness of him if daniel began delivering one of his libertyandunionnowandforeveroneandinseparable speeches they wouldnt know what he was talking about the sage laughed and champed his toothless jaws together as old men do in the effort to compose their countenances after an emotional outbreak  well for one thing the younger observed they wouldnt understand what he said you will notice if you listen to them going by that they seldom speak english thats getting to be a dead language in new york though its still used in the newspapers he thought to hearten the other with his whimsicality for it seemed to him that the elder sage was getting sensibly older since their last meeting and that he would be the gayer for such cheer as a man on the hither side of eighty can offer a man on the thither perhaps the russian jews would appreciate daniel if he were put into yiddish for them theyre the brightest intelligences among our hyphenates and they have the oldfashioned ideals of liberty and humanity perhaps because theyve known so little of either  his gaiety did not seem to enliven his senior much ah the old ideals he sighed the old ideal of an afternoon airing was a gentle course in an open carriage on a soft drive now its a vertiginous whirl on an asphalted road round and round and round the park till the victims stagger with their brains spinning after they get out of their cars  the younger sage laughed youve been listening to the pessimism of the dear old fellows who drive the few lingering victorias if youd believe them all these people in the motors are chauffeurs giving their ladyfriends joyrides  few the elder retorted there are lots of them ive counted twenty in a single round of the park i was proud to be in one of them though my horse left something to be desired in the way of youth and beauty but i reflected that i was not very young or beautiful myself  as the sages sat looking out over the dizzying whirl of the motors they smoothed the tops of their sticks with their soft old hands and were silent oftener than not the elder seemed to drowse off from the time and place but he was recalled by the younger saying it is certainly astonishing weather for this season of the year  the elder woke up and retorted as if in offense not at all ive seen the cherries in blossom at the end of october  they didnt set their fruit i suppose  wellno  ah well i saw a butterfly up here in the sheeppasture the other day i could have put out my hand and caught it its the soft weather that brings your victorias out like the belated butterflies wait till the first cold snap and there wont be a single victoria or butterfly left  yes the elder assented we butterflies and victorias belong to the youth of the year and the world and the sad thing is that we wont have our palingenesis  why not the younger sage demanded what is to prevent your coming back in two or three thousand years  well if we came back in a year even we shouldnt find room for one reason havent you noticed how full to bursting the place seems every street is as packed as lower fifth avenue used to be when the operatives came out of the big shops for their nooning the citys shell hasnt been enlarged or added to but the life in it has multiplied past its utmost capacity all the hotels and houses and flats are packed the theaters wherever the plays are bad enough swarm with spectators along up and down every sidestreets the motors stand in rows and at the same time the avenues are so dense with them that you are killed at every crossing there has been no building to speak of during the summer but unless new york is overbuilt next year we must appeal to chicago to come and help hold it but ive an idea that the victorias are remaining to stay if some sort of mechanical horse could be substituted for the poor old animals that remind me of my mortality i should be sure of it every now and then i get an impression of permanence in the things of the park as long as the peanutmen and the swanboats are with us i shant quite despair and the other night i was moved almost to tears by the sight of a fourinhand tooling softly down the fifth avenue drive there it was like some vehicular phantom but how whence when it came as if out of the early eighteennineties two middleaged grooms with their arms folded sat on the rumble if its the rumble but of all the young people who ought to have flowered over the top none was left but the lady beside the gentlemandriver on the box ive tried every evening since for that fourinhand but i havent seen it and ive decided it wasnt a vehicular phantom but a mere dream of the past  fourhorse dream the younger sage commented as if musing aloud  the elder did not seem quite pleased a joke he challenged  not necessarily i suppose i was the helpless prey of the rhyme  i didnt know you were a poet  im not always but didnt it occur to you that danger for danger your fourinhand was more dangerous than an automobile to the passing human creature  it might have been if it had been multiplied by ten thousand but there was only one of it and it wasnt going twenty miles an hour  thats true the younger sage assented but there was always a fearful hazard in horses when we had them we supposed they were tamed but after all they were only trained animals like hagenbacks  and what is a chauffeur  ah you have me there the younger said and he laughed generously or you would have if i hadnt noticed something like amelioration in the chauffeurs at any rate the taxis are cheaper than they were and i suppose something will be done about the street traffic some time theyre talking now about subway crossings but i should prefer overhead footbridges at all the corners crossing one another diagonally they would look like triumphal arches and would serve the purpose of any future dewey victory if we should happen to have another hero to win one  well we must hope for the best i rather like the notion of the diagonal footbridges but why not rows along the second stories as they have them in chester i should be pretty sure of always getting home alive if we had them now if im not telephoned for at a hospital before im restored to consciousness i think myself pretty lucky and yet it seems but yesterday as the people used to say in the plays since i had a pride in counting the automobiles as i walked up the avenue once i got as high as twenty before i reached fiftyninth street now i couldnt count as many horse vehicles  the elder sage mocked himself in a feeble laugh but the younger tried to be serious we dont realize the absolute change our streets are not streets any more they are railroad tracks with locomotives let loose on them and no signs up to warn people at the crossings its pathetic to see the footpassengers saving themselves especially the poor pretty highheeled women looking this way and that in their fright and then tottering over as fast as they can totter  well i should have said it was outrageous humiliating insulting once but i dont any more it would be no use  no and so much depends upon the point of view when im on foot i feel all my rights invaded but when im in a taxi it amuses me to see the women escaping and i boil with rage in being halted at every other corner by the policeman with his newfangled semaphore and its go and stop in red and blue and my taxiclock going round all the time and getting me in for a dollar when i thought i should keep within seventy cents then i feel that pedestrians of every age and sex ought to be killed  yes theres something always in the point of view and theres some comfort when youre stopped in your taxi to feel that they often do get killed  the sages laughed together and the younger said i suppose when we get aeroplanes in common use therell be annoying traffic regulations and policemen anchored out at intervals in the central blue to enforce them after all  what he was going to add in amplification cannot be known for a girlish voice trying to sharpen itself from its native sweetness to a conscientious severity called to them as its owner swiftly advanced upon the elder sage now see here grandfather this wont do at all you promised not to leave that bench by the indian hunter and here you are away down by the falconer and weve been looking everywhere for you its too bad i shall be afraid to trust you at all after this why its horrid of you grandfather you might have got killed crossing the drive  the grandfather looked up and verified the situation which seemed to include a young man tall and beautiful but neither so handsome nor so many heads high as the young men in the advertisements of readytowear clothing who smiled down on the young girl as if he had arrived with her and were finding an amusement in her severity which he might not later she was in fact very pretty and her skirt flared in the fashion of the last moment as she stooped threateningly yet fondly over her grandfather  the younger sage silently and somewhat guiltily escaped from the tumult of emotion which ignored him and shuffled slowly down the path the other finally gave an oh of recognition and then said for all explanation and excuse i didnt know what had become of you and then they all laughed                                     xviii                     selfsacrifice a farcetragedy                                     i                miss isobel ramsey and miss esther garnett  miss ramsey and they were really understood to be engaged miss ramsey is a darkeyed darkhaired girl of nearly the length of two ladys umbrellas and the bulk of one closely folded in its sheath she stands with her elbow supported on the corner of the mantel her temple resting on the knuckle of a thin nervous hand in an effect of thoughtful absentmindedness miss garnett more or less merovingian in a costume that lends itself somewhat reluctantly to a low thick figure is apparently poising for departure as she stands before the chair from which she has risen beside miss ramseys teatable and looks earnestly up into miss ramseys absent face both are very young but aim at being much older than they are with occasional lapses into extreme girlhood  miss garnett yes distinctly i knew you couldnt know and i thought you ought to she speaks in a deep convictionbearing and convictioncarrying voice if he has been coming here so much  miss ramsey with what seems temperamental abruptness sit down one can always think better sitting down she catches a chair under her with a deft movement of her heel and miss garnett sinks provisionally into her seat and i think it needs thought dont you  miss garnett that is what i expected of you  miss ramsey and have some more tea there is nothing like fresh tea for clearing the brain and we certainly need clear brains for this she pushes a button in the wall beside her and is silent till the maid appears more tea nora she is silent again while the maid reappears with the tea and disappears i dont know that he has been coming here so very much but he has no right to be coming at all if he is engaged that is in that way  miss garnett no not unlesshe wishes he wasnt  miss ramsey that would give him less than no right  miss garnett that is true i didnt think of it in that light  miss ramsey im trying to decide what i ought to do if he does want to get off she said herself that they were engaged  miss garnett as much as that conny understood her to say so and conny never makes a mistake in what people say emily didnt say whom she was engaged to but conny felt that that was to come later and she did not quite feel like asking dont you know  miss ramsey of course and how came she to decide that it was mr ashley  miss garnett simply by putting two and two together they two were together the whole time last summer  miss ramsey i see then there is only one thing for me to do  miss garnett admiringly i knew you would say that  miss ramsey dreamily the question is what the thing is  miss garnett yes  miss ramsey that is what i wish to think over chocolates she offers a box catching it with her left hand from the mantel at her shoulder without rising  miss garnett thank you do you think they go well with tea  miss ramsey they go well with anything but we mustnt allow our minds to be distracted the case is simply this if mr ashley is engaged to emily fray he has no right to go round calling on other girlswell as if he wasntand he has been calling here a great deal that is perfectly evident he must be made to feel that girls are not to be trifled withthat they are not mere toys  miss garnett how splendidly you do reason and he ought to understand that emily has a right  miss ramsey oh i dont know that i care about heror not primarily or do you say primarily  miss garnett i never know i only use it in writing  miss ramsey its a clumsy word i dont know that i shall but what i mean is that i must act from a general principle and that principle is that when a man is engaged it doesnt matter whether the girl has thrown herself at him or not  miss garnett she certainly did from what conny says  miss ramsey he must be shown that other girls wont tolerate his behaving as if he were not engaged it is wrong  miss garnett we must stand together  miss ramsey yes though i dont infer that he has been attentive to other girls generally  miss garnett no i meant that if he has been coming here so much you want to prevent his trifling with others  miss ramsey something like that but it ought to be more definite he ought to realize that if another girl cared for him it would be cruel to her paying her attentions when he was engaged to some one else  miss garnett and cruel to the girl he is engaged to  miss ramsey yes she speaks coldly vaguely but that is the personal ground and i wish to avoid that i wish to deal with him purely in the abstract  miss garnett yes i understand that and at the same time you wish to punish him he ought to be made to feel it all the more because he is so severe himself  miss ramsey severe  miss garnett not tolerating anything thats the least out of the way in other people taking you up about your ideas and showing where youre wrong or even silly spiritually snubbing conny calls it  miss ramsey oh i like that in him its so invigorating it braces up all your good resolutions it makes you ashamed and shame is sanative  miss garnett thats just what i told conny or the same thing do you think another one would hurt me i will risk it anyway she takes another chocolate from the box go on  miss ramsey oh i was just wishing that i had been out longer and had a little more experience of men then i should know how to act how do you suppose people do generally  miss garnett why you know if they find a man in love with them after hes engaged to another girl they make him go back to her it doesnt matter whether theyre in love with him themselves or not  miss ramsey im not in love with mr ashley please  miss garnett no im supposing an extreme case  miss ramsey after a moment of silent thought did you ever hear of anybody doing it  miss garnett not just in our set but i know its done continually  miss ramsey it seems to me as if i had read something of the kind  miss garnett oh yes the books are full of it are those mallows they might carry off the effects of the chocolates miss ramsey passes her the box of marshmallows which she has bent over the table to look at  miss ramsey and of course they couldnt get into the books if they hadnt really happened i wish i could think of a case in point  miss garnett why there was peg woffington  miss ramsey with displeasure she was an actress of some sort wasnt she  miss garnett with meritorious candor yes she was but she was a very good actress  miss ramsey what did she do  miss garnett well its a long time since i read it and its rather oldfashioned now but there was a countryman of some sort i remember who came away from his wife and fell in love with peg woffington and then the wife follows him up to london and begs her to give him back to her and she does it theres something about a portrait of pegi dont remember exactly she puts her face through and cries when the wife talks to the picture the wife thinks it is a real picture and she is kind of soliloquizing and asking peg to give her husband back to her and peg does in the end that part is beautiful they become the greatest friends  miss ramsey rather silly i should say  miss garnett yes it is rather silly but i suppose the author thought she had to do something  miss ramsey and disgusting a married man that way i dont see any comparison with mr ashley  miss garnett no there really isnt any emily has never asked you to give him up and besides peg woffington really liked him a littleloved him in fact  miss ramsey and i dont like mr ashley at all of course i respect himand i admire his intellect theres no question about his being handsome but i have never thought of him for a moment in any other way and now i cant even respect him  miss garnett nobody could im sure emily would be welcome to him as far as i was concerned but he has never been about with me so much as he has with you and i dont wonder you feel indignant  miss ramsey coldly i dont feel indignant i wish to be just  miss garnett yes that is what i mean and poor emily is so uninteresting in the play that kentucky summers does she is perfectly fascinating at first and you can see why the poor girls fiancé should be so taken with her but im sure no one could say you had ever given mr ashley the least encouragement it would be pure justice on your part i think you are grand i shall always be proud of knowing what you were going to do  miss ramsey after some moments of snubbing intention i dont know what i am going to do myself yet or how what was that play i never heard of it  miss garnett i dont remember distinctly but it was about a young man who falls in love with her when hes engaged to another girl and she determines as soon as she finds it out to disgust him so that he will go back to the other girl dont you know  miss ramsey that sounds rather more practical than the peg woffington plan what does she do  miss garnett nothing youd like to do  miss ramsey id like to do something in such a cause what does she do  miss garnett oh when he is calling on her kentucky summers pretends to fly into a rage with her sister and she pulls her hair down and slams everything round the room and scolds and drinks champagne and wants him to drink with her and i dont know what all the upshot is that he is only too glad to get away  miss ramsey its rather loathsome isnt it  miss garnett it is rather loathsome but it was in a good cause and i suppose it was what an actress would think of  miss ramsey an actress  miss garnett i forgot the heroine is a distinguished actress you know and kentucky could play that sort of part to perfection but i dont think a lady would like to cut up much in the best cause  miss ramsey cut up  miss garnett she certainly frisks about the room a good deal how delicious these mallows are have you ever tried toasting them  miss ramsey at school there seems an idea in it and the hero isnt married i dont like the notion of a married man  miss garnett oh im quite sure he isnt married hes merely engaged that makes the whole difference from the peg woffington story and theres no portrait im confident so that you wouldnt have to do that part  miss ramsey haughtily i dont propose to do any part if the affair cant be arranged without some such mountebank business  miss garnett you can manage it if anybody can you have so much dignity that you could awe him into doing his duty by a single glance i wouldnt be in his place  miss ramsey i shall not give him a glance i shall not see him when he comes that will be simpler still to nora at the door what is it nora                                     ii                     nora miss ramsey miss garnett  nora mr ashley miss ramsey  miss ramsey with a severity not meant for nora ask him to sit down in the receptionroom a moment  nora yes miss ramsey                                    iii                        miss ramsey miss garnett  miss garnett rising and seizing miss ramseys hands oh isobel but you will be equal to it oh oh  miss ramsey with state why are you going esther sit down  miss garnett if i only could stay if i could hide under the sofa or behind the screen isnt it wonderfulprovidentialhis coming at the very instant oh isobel she clasps her friend convulsively and after a moments resistance miss ramsey yields to her emotion and they hide their faces in each others neck and strangle their hysteric laughter they try to regain their composure and then abandon the effort with a shuddering delight in the perfection of the incident what shall you do shall you trust to inspiration shall you make him show his hand first and then act or shall you tell him at once that you know all and or no of course you cant do that hes not supposed to know that you know oh i can imagine the freezing hauteur that youll receive him with and the icy indifference youll let him understand that he isnt a persona grata with if i were only as tall as you he isnt as tall himself and you can tower over him dont sit down or bend or anything just stand with your head up and glance carelessly at him under your lashes as if nobody was there then it will gradually dawn upon him that you know everything and hell simply go through the floor they take some ecstatic turns about the room miss ramsey waltzing as gentleman she abruptly frees herself  miss ramsey no it cant be as tacit as all that there must be something explicit as you say i must do something to cure him of his fancyhis perfidyand make him glad to go back to her  miss garnett yes do you think he deserves it  miss ramsey ive no wish to punish him  miss garnett how noble you are i dont wonder he adores you i should but you wont find it so easy you must do something drastic it is drastic isnt it or do i mean static one of those things when you simply crush a person but now i must go how i should like to listen at the door we must kiss each other very quietly and i must slip out oh you dear how i long to know what youll do but it will be perfect whatever it is you always did do perfect things they knit their fingers together in parting on second thoughts i wont kiss you it might unman you and you need all your strength unman isnt the word exactly but you cant say ungirl can you it would be ridiculous though girls are as brave as men when it comes to duty goodby dear she catches miss ramsey about the neck and pressing her lips silently to her cheek runs out miss ramsey rings and the maid appears                                     iv                            nora miss ramsey  miss ramsey starting oh is that you nora of course nora  nora yes miss ramsey  miss ramsey do you know where my brother keeps his cigarettes  nora why in his room miss ramsey you told him you didnt like the smell here  miss ramsey yes yes i forgot and has he got any cocktails  nora hes got the whole bottle full of them yet  miss ramsey full yet  nora you wouldnt let him offer them to the gentlemen he had to lunch last week because you said  miss ramsey what did i say  nora they were vulgar  miss ramsey and so they are and so much the better bring the cigarettes and the bottle and some glasses here nora and then ask mr ashley to come she walks away to the window and hurriedly hums a musical comedy waltz not quite in tune as from not remembering exactly and after nora has tinkled in with a tray of glasses she lights a cigarette and stands puffing it gasping and coughing a little as walter ashley enters oh mr ashley sorry to make you wait                                     v                         mr ashley miss ramsey  mr ashley the time has seemed long but i could have waited all day i couldnt have gone without seeing you and telling you he pauses as if bewildered at the spectacle of miss ramseys resolute practice with the cigarette which she now takes from her lips and waves before her face with innocent recklessness  miss ramsey chokingly do sit down she drops into an easychair beside the teatable and stretches the tips of her feet out beyond the hem of her skirt in extremely ladylike abandon have a cigarette she reaches the box to him  ashley thank you i wont smoke i believe he stands frowning while she throws her cigarette into a teacup and lights another  miss ramsey i thought everybody smoked then have a cocktail  ashley a what  miss ramsey a cocktail so many people like them with their tea instead of rum you know  ashley no i didnt know he regards her with amaze rapidly hardening into condemnation  miss ramsey i hope you dont object to smoking englishwomen all smoke  ashley i think ive heard i didnt know that american ladies did  miss ramsey they dont all but they will when they find how nice it is  ashley and do englishwomen all drink cocktails  miss ramsey they will when they find how nice it is but why do you keep standing sit down if its only for a moment there is something i would like to talk with you about what were you saying when you came in i didnt catch it quite  ashley nothingnow  miss ramsey and i cant persuade you to have a cocktail i believe ill have another myself she takes up the bottle and tries several times to pour from it i do believe noras forgotten to open it that is a good joke on me but i mustnt let her know do you happen to have a pocketcorkscrew with you mr ashley  ashley no  miss ramsey well never mind she tosses her cigarette into the grate and lights another i wonder why they always have cynical persons smoke on the stage i dont see that the two things necessarily go together but it does give you a kind of thrill when they strike a match and it lights up their faces when they put it to the cigarette you know something good and wicked is going to happen she puffs violently at her cigarette and then suddenly flings it away and starts to her feet will youwould youopen the window she collapses into her chair  ashley springing toward her miss ramsey are youyou are ill  miss ramsey no no the window a little faintits so close there its all right now or it will bewhenive hadanother cigarette she leans forward to take one ashley gravely watches her but says nothing she lights her cigarette but without smoking throws it away go on  ashley i wasnt saying anything  miss ramsey oh i forgot and i dont know what we were talking about myself she falls limply back into her chair and closes her eyes  ashley shant i ring for the maid im afraid  miss ramsey imperiously not at all not on any account far less imperiously you may pour me a cup of tea if you like that will make me well the full strength please she motions away the hotwater jug with which he has proposed qualifying the cup of tea which he offers her  ashley one lump or two  miss ramsey only one thank you she takes the cup  ashley offering the milk cream  miss ramsey a drop he stands anxiously beside her while she takes a long draught and then gives back the cup that was perfect  ashley another  miss ramsey no that is just right now go on or i forgot you were not going on oh dear how much better i feel there must have been something poisonous in those cigarettes  ashley yes there was tobacco  miss ramsey oh do you think it was the tobacco do throw the whole box into the fire i shall tell bob never to get cigarettes with tobacco in them after this wont you have one of the chocolates or a mallow i feel as if i should never want to eat anything again where was i she rests her cheek against the side of her chair cushion and speaks with closed eyes in a weak murmur mr ashley watches her at first with anxiety then with a gradual change of countenance until a gleam of intelligence steals into his look of compassion  ashley you asked me to throw the cigarettes into the fire but i want you to let me keep them  miss ramsey with wideflung eyes you you said you wouldnt smoke  ashley laughing may i change my mind one talks better he lights a cigarette and miss ramsey i believe i will have a cocktail after all  miss ramsey mr ashley  ashley without noting her protest i had forgotten that i had a corkscrew in my pocketknife dont trouble yourself to ring for one he produces the knife and opens the bottle then as miss ramsey rises and stands aghast he pours out a glass and offers it to her with mock devotion as she shakes her head and recoils oh i thought you liked cocktails they are very good after cigarettesvery reviving but if you wont he tosses off the cocktail and sets down the glass smacking his lips tell your brother i commend his tastein cocktails andpuffing his cigarettetobacco poison for poison let me offer you one of my cigarettes theyre milder than these he puts his hand to his breast pocket  miss ramsey with nervous shrinking no  ashley its just as well i find that i hadnt brought mine with me after a moment you are so unconventional so fearless that i should like your notion of the problem in a book ive just been reading why should the mere fact that a man is married to one woman prevent his being in love with another or half a dozen others or vice versa  miss ramsey mr ashley do you wish to insult me  ashley dear me no but put the case a little differently suppose a couple are merely engaged does that fact imply that neither has a right to a change of mind or to be fancy free to make another choice  miss ramsey indignantly yes it does they are as sacredly bound to each other as if they were married and if they are false to each other the girl is a wretch and the man is a villain and if you think anything i have said can excuse you for breaking your engagement or that i dont consider you the wickedest person in the world and the most barefaced hypocrite andandi dont know whatyou are very much mistaken  ashley what in the world are you talking about  miss ramsey i am talking about you and your shameless perfidy  ashley my shameless perf i dont understand i came here to tell you that i love you  miss ramsey how dare you to speak to me of that when or perhaps you have broken with her and think you are free to hoodwink some other poor creature but you will find that you have chosen the wrong person and its no excuse for you her being a littlea littlenot so bright as some girls and not so goodlooking oh its enough to make any girl loathe her own looks you mustnt suppose you can come here redhandedyes its the same as a murder and any true girl would say soand tell me you care for me no walter ashley i havent fallen so low as that though i have the disgrace of your acquaintance and i hopei hopeif you dont like my smoking and offering you cocktails and talking the way i have it will be a lesson to you and yesi will say it if it will add to your misery to know that i did respect you very much and thought everythingvery highlyof you and might have answered you very differently before when you were free to tell me thatnow i have nothing but the utmost abhorrenceanddisapproval of you andand oh i dont see how you can be so hateful she hides her face in her hands and rushes from the room overturning several chairs in her course toward the door ashley remains staring after her while a succession of impetuous rings make themselves heard from the street door there is a sound of opening it and then a flutter of skirts and anxieties and miss garnett comes running into the room                                     vi                         miss garnett mr ashley  miss garnett to the maid hovering in the doorway yes i must have left it here for i never missed it till i went to pay my fare in the motorbus and tried to think whether i had the exact dime and if i hadnt whether the conductor would change a fivedollar bill or not and then it rushed into my mind that i had left my purse somewhere and i knew i hadnt been anywhere else she runs from the mantel to the writingdesk in the corner and then to the sofa where peering under the teatable she finds her purse on the shelf oh here it is nora just where i put it when we began to talk and i must have gone out and left it i she starts with a little shriek in encountering ashley oh mr ashley what a fright you gave me i was just looking for my purse that i missed when i went to pay my fare in the motorbus and was wondering whether i had the exact dime or the conductor could change a fivedollar bill and she discovers or affects to discover something strange in his manner whatwhat is the matter mr ashley  ashley i shall be glad to have you tell meor any one  miss garnett i dont understand has isobel  ashley miss garnett did you know i was engaged  miss garnett why yes i was just going to congrat  ashley well dont unless you can tell me whom i am engaged to  miss garnett why arent you engaged to emily fray  ashley not the least in the world  miss garnett in despair then what have i done oh what a fatal fatal scrape with a ray of returning hope but she told me herself that she was engaged and you were together so much last summer desperately then if she isnt engaged to you whom is she engaged to  ashley on general principles i shouldnt know but in this particular instance i happen to know that she is engaged to owen brooks they were a great deal more together last summer  miss garnett with conviction so they were with returning doubt but why didnt she say so  ashley i cant tell you she may have had her reasons or she may not can you possibly tell me in return for my ignorance why the fact of her engagement should involve me in the strange way it seems to have done with miss ramsey  miss garnett with a burst of involuntary candor why i did that or no whats she been doing  ashley really miss garnett  miss garnett how can i tell you anything if you dont tell me everything you wouldnt wish me to betray confidence  ashley no certainly not what was the confidence  miss garnett well but i shall have to know first what shes been doing you must see that yourself mr ashley he is silent has shehas isobelbeen behavingwell out of character  ashley very much indeed  miss garnett i expected she would she fetches a thoughtful sigh and for her greater emotional convenience she sinks into an easychair and leans forward oh dear it is a scrape suddenly and imperatively tell me exactly what she did if you hope for any help whatever  ashley why she offered me a cocktail  miss garnett oh how good i didnt suppose she would dare well  ashley and she smoked cigarettes  miss garnett how perfectly divine and what else  ashley coldly may i ask why you admire miss ramseys behaving out of character so much i think the smoking made her rather faint and  miss garnett she would have let it kill her never tell me that girls have no moral courage  ashley but whatwhat was the meaning of it all  miss garnett thoughtfully i suppose if i got her in for it i ought to get her out even if i betray confidence  ashley it depends upon the confidence what is it  miss garnett why but youre sure its my duty  ashley if you care what i think of her  miss garnett oh mr ashley you mustnt think it strange of isobel on my bended knees you mustnt why dont you see she was just doing it to disgust you  ashley disgust me  miss garnett yes and drive you back to emily fray  ashley drive me ba  miss garnett if she thought you were engaged to emily when you were coming here all the time and she wasnt quite sure that she hated to have you dont you see it would be her duty to sacrifice herself and oh i suppose shes heard everything up there and she catches herself up and runs out of the room leaving ashley to await the retarded descent of skirts which he hears on the stairs after the crash of the street door has announced miss garnetts escape he stands with his back to the mantel and faces miss ramsey as she enters the room                                    vii                           miss ramsey ashley  miss ramsey with the effect of cold surprise mr ashley i thought i heard wasnt miss garnett  ashley she was did you think it was the street door closing on me  miss ramsey how should i know then courageously no i didnt think it was why do you ask she moves uneasily about the room with an air of studied inattention  ashley because if you did i can put you in the right though i cant restore miss garnetts presence by my absence  miss ramsey youre ratherenigmatical a ring is heard the maid pauses at the doorway im not at home nora to mr ashley it seems to be very close  ashley its my having been smoking  miss ramsey your having she goes to the window and tries to lift it  ashley let me he follows her to the window where he stands beside her  miss ramsey now shes seen me and you here with me of course  ashley i shouldnt mind but im so sorry ifand i will go  miss ramsey you cant go nowtill shes round the corner shell keep looking back and shell think i made you  ashley but havent you arent you sending me back to miss fray to tell her that i must keep my engagement though i care nothing for her and care all the world for you isnt that what you want me to do  miss ramsey but youre not engaged to her you just  ashley just what  miss ramsey desperately you wish me to disgrace myself forever in your eyes well i will what does it matter now i heard you telling esther you were not engaged i overheard you  ashley i fancied you must  miss ramsey i tried to overhear i eavesdropped i wish you to know that  ashley and what do you wish me to do about it  miss ramsey i should think any selfrespecting person would know im not a selfrespecting person her wandering gaze seems to fall for the first time upon the tray with the cocktails and glasses and cigarettes she flies at the bellbutton and presses it impetuously as the maid appears take these things away nora please to ashley when the maid has left the room dont be afraid to say what you think of me  ashley i think all the world of you but i should merely like to ask  miss ramsey oh you can ask anything of me now  ashley with palpable insincerity i should like to ask why you dont respect yourself  miss ramsey was that what you were going to ask i know it wasnt but i will tell you because i have been a fool  ashley thank you now i will tell you what i was really going to ask why did you wish to drive me back to miss fray when you knew that i would be false to her a thousand times if i could only once be true to you  miss ramsey now you are insulting me and that is just the point you may be a very clever lawyer mr ashley and everybody says you arevery able and talented and all that but you cant get round that point you may torture any meaning you please out of my words but i shall always say you brought it on yourself  ashley brought what on  miss ramsey mr ashley i wont be crossquestioned  ashley was that why you smoked and poured cocktails out of an unopened bottle was it because you wished me to hate you and remember my duty and go back to miss fray well it was a dead failure it made me love you more than ever i am a fool too as you call it  miss ramsey say anything you please i have given you the right i shall not resent it go on  ashley i should only repeat myself you must have known how much i care for you isobel do you mind my calling you isobel  miss ramsey not in the least if you wish to humiliate me by it i should like you to trample on me in every way you can  ashley trample on you i would rather be run over by a steamroller than tread on the least of your outlying feelings dearest do you mind my saying dearest  miss ramsey i have told you that you can say anything you like i deserve it but oh if you have a spark of pity  ashley im a perfect conflagration of compassion darling do you object to darling  miss ramsey with starting tears it doesnt matter now she has let her lovely length trail into the corner of the sofa where she desperately reclines supporting her elbow on the arm of it and resting her drooping head on her hand he draws a hassock up in front of her and sits on it  ashley this represents kneeling at your feet one doesnt do it literally any more you know  miss ramsey in a hollow voice i should despise you if you did anddeeply murmurousi dont wish to despise you  ashley no i understand that you merely wish me to despise you but why  miss ramsey nervously you know  ashley but i dont knowisobel dearest darling if you will allow me to express myself so fully how should i know  miss ramsey ive told you  ashley may i take your hand for goodby he possesses himself of it it seems to go along with those expressions  miss ramsey selfcontemptuously oh yes  ashley thank you where were we  miss ramsey sitting up and recovering her hand you were saying goodby  ashley was i but not before i had told you that i knew you were doing all that for my best good and i wishi wish you could have seen how exemplary you looked when you were trying to pour a cocktail out of a corked bottle between your remarks on passionate fiction and puffs of the insidious cigarette when the venomous tobacco began to get in its deadly work and you turned pale and reeled a little and called for air it made me mentally vow to go back to miss fray instantly whether i was engaged to her or not and cut out poor old brooks  miss ramsey was it mr brooks i didnt hear the name exactly  ashley when i was telling miss garnett i ought to have spoken louder but i wasnt sure at the time you were listening though as you were saying what does it matter now  miss ramsey did i say that  ashley words to that effect and they have made me feel how unworthy of you i am im not heroicby nature but i could be if you made meby art  miss ramsey springing to her feet indignantly now you are ridiculing meyou are making fun of me  ashley gathering himself up from his hassock with difficulty and confronting her do i look like a man who would dare to make fun of you i am half a head shorter than you and in moral grandeur you overtop me so that i would always have to wear a high hat when i was with you  miss ramsey thoughtfully plenty of girls are that way now but if you are ashamed of my being tall flashingly and with starting tears  ashley ashamed i can always look up to you you can always stoop to me he stretches his arms toward her  miss ramsey recoiling bewildered wait we havent got to that yet  ashley oh isobeldearestdarling weve got past it were on the home stretch now                                      xix                        the night before christmas                                a morality                                     i                      mr and mrs clarence fountain  mrs clarence fountain backing into the room and closing the door noiselessly before looking round oh you poor thing i can see that you are dead at the first glance im dead myself for that matter she is speaking to her husband who clings with one hand to the chimneypiece and supports his back with the other from this hand a little girls long stocking lumpily dangles mrs fountain turning round observes it not finished yet but i dont wonder i wonder youve even begun well now i will take hold with you in token of the aid she is going to give mrs fountain sinks into a chair and rolls a distracted eye over the littered and tumbled room its worse than i thought it would be you ought to have smoothed the papers out and laid them in a pile as fast as you unwrapped the things that is the way i always do and wound the strings up and put them one side then you wouldnt have had to wade round in them i suppose i oughtnt to have left it to you but if i had let you put the children to bed you know youd have told them stories and kept them all night over their prayers and as it was each of them wanted to put in a special christmas clause i know what kind of christmas clause i should have put in if id been frank im not sure its right to keep up the deception one comfort the oldest ones dont believe in it any more than we do dear i did think at one time this afternoon i should have to be brought home in an ambulance it would have been a convenience with all the packages i simply marvel at their delivery wagons getting them here  fountain coming to the table where she sits and taking up one of the toys with which it is strewn they havent all of them  mrs fountain what do you mean by all of them  fountain i mean half he takes up a mechanical locomotive and stuffs it into the stocking he holds  mrs fountain staying his hand what are you doing putting jimmys engine into susys stocking shell be perfectly insulted when she finds it for shell know you werent paying the least attention and you cant blame santa claus for it with her if thats what youve been doing with the other stockings but there arent any others dont tell me youve just begun well i could simply cry  fountain dropping into the chair on the other side of the table under the shelter of a tall christmas tree standing on it do you call unwrapping a whole carload of truck and getting it sorted just beginning ive been slaving here from the dawn of time and i had to have some leisure for the ghosts of my own christmases when i was little i didnt have to wade round in the wrappings of my presents in those days but it isnt the sad memories that take it out of you its the happy ones ive never had a ghastlier halfhour than ive just spent in the humiliating multiplicity of these gifts all the old birthdays and weddingdays and fourth of julys and homecomings and childrens christenings ive ever had came trooping back there oughtnt to be any gay anniversaries they should be forbidden by law if i could only have recalled a few dangerous fevers and funerals  mrs fountain clarence dont say such a thing youll be punished for it i know how you suffer from those gloomy feelings and i pity you you ought to bear up against them if i gave way you must think about something cheerful in the future when the happiness of the past afflicts you and set one against the other life isnt all a vale of tears you must keep your mind fixed on the work before you i dont believe its the number of the packages here thats broken you down its the shopping thats worn you out im sure im a mere thread and i had been at it from immediately after breakfast and i lunched in one of the stores with ten thousand suburbans who had come pouring in with the first of their unnatural trains i did hope i should have some of the places to myself but they were every one jammed and you came up from your office about four perfectly fresh  fountain fresh yes quite dewy from a days fight with the beasts at ephesus on the eve of christmas week  mrs fountain well dont be cynical clarence on this of all nights of the year you know how sorry i always am for what you have to go through down there and i suppose its worse as you say at this season than any other time of year its the terrible concentration of everything just before christmas that makes it so killing i really dont know which of the places was the worst the big department stores or the separate places for jewelry and toys and books and stationery and antiques they were all alike and all maddening and the rain outside and everybody coming in reeking though i dont believe that sunshine would have been any better thered have been more of them i declare it made my heart ache for those poor creatures behind the counters and i dont know whether i suffered most for them when they kept up a ghastly cheerfulness in their attention or were simply insulting in their indifference i know they must be all dead by this time going up going down caish here boy i believe it will ring in my ears as long as i live and the whiz of those overhead wire things and having to wait ages for your change and then drag your tatters out of the stores into the streets if i hadnt had you with me at the last i should certainly have dropped  fountain yes and what had become of your good resolutions about doing all your christmas shopping in july  mrs fountain my good resolutions really clarence sometimes if it were not cruelty to animals i should like to hit you my good you know that you suggested that plan and it wasnt even original with you the papers have been talking about it for years but when you brought it up as such a new idea i fell in with it to please you  fountain now look out lucy  mrs fountain yes to please you and to help you forget the christmas worry just as ive been doing tonight you never spare me  fountain stick to the record why didnt you do your christmas shopping in july  mrs fountain why didnt i did you expect me to do my christmas shopping down at sculpin beach where i spent the whole time from the middle of june till the middle of september why didnt you do the christmas shopping in july you had the stores under your nose here from the beginning till the end of summer with nothing in the world to hinder you and not a chick or a child to look after  fountain oh i like that you think i was leading a life of complete leisure here with the thermometer among the nineties ninetenths of the time  mrs fountain i only know you were bragging in all your letters about your bath and your club and the folly of any one going away from the cool comfortable town in the summer i suppose youll say that was to keep me from feeling badly at leaving you when it was only for the childrens sake i will let you take them the next time  fountain while you look after my office and you think the stores are full of christmas things in july i suppose  mrs fountain i never thought so and now i hope you see the folly of that idea no clarence we must be logical in everything you cant get rid of christmas shopping at christmastime  fountain shouting wrathfully then i say get rid of christmas                                     ii                mr frank watkins mrs fountain fountain  watkins opening the door for himself and struggling into the room with an armful of parcels im with you there clarence christmas is at the root of christmas shopping and christmas giving and all the rest of it oh you neednt be afraid lucy i didnt hear any epithets just caught the drift of your argument through the keyhole ive been kicking at the door ever since you began where shall i dump these things  mrs fountain oh you poor boy hereanywhereon the flooron the sofaon the table she clears several spaces and helps watkins unload clarence im surprised at you what are you thinking of  fountain im thinking that if this goes on ill let somebody else arrange the presents  watkins if i saw a man coming into my house with a load like this tonight id throw him into the street but living in a ninthstory flat like you it might hurt him  mrs fountain reading the inscriptions on the packages for benny from his uncle frank oh how sweet of you frank and heres a kiss for his uncle frank she embraces him with as little interruption as possible from uncle frank to jim oh i know what that is she feels the package over and this is for susy from her aunt sue oh i knew she would remember her namesake for maggie merry christmas from mrs watkins bridget with mrs watkinss best wishes for a merry christmas both the girls but its like sue she never forgets anybody and whats this for clarence i must know not a bathgown undoing it i simply must see it blue his very color holding it up from you frank he nods clarence  watkins if fountain tries to kiss me ill  fountain i wouldnt kiss you for a dozen bathgowns lifting it up from the floor where mrs fountain has dropped it it is rather nice  watkins dont overwhelm me  mrs fountain dancing about with a long soft roll in her hand oh oh oh she saw me gloating on it at shumakers i do wonder if it is  fountain reaching for it why open it  mrs fountain you dare no it shall be opened the very last thing in the morning now to punish you how is poor sue i saw her literally dropping by the way at shumakers  watkins making for the door well she must have got up again i left her registering a vow that if ever she lived to see another christmas she would leave the country months before the shopping began she called down maledictions on all the recipients of her gifts and wished them the worst harm that can befall the wicked  mrs fountain poor sue she simply lives to do people good and i can understand exactly how she feels toward them ill be round bright and early tomorrow to thank her why do you go  watkins well i cant stay here all night and id better let you and clarence finish up he escapes from her detaining embrace and runs out                                    iii                         mrs fountain fountain  mrs fountain intent upon her roll how funny he is i wonder if he did hear anything but our scolding voices where were we  fountain i had just called you a serpent  mrs fountain with amusement no really feeling the parcel if its that spanish lace scarf i can tell her it was machine lace i saw it at the first glance but poor sue has no taste i suppose i must stand it but i cant bear to think what shes given the girls and children she means well did you really say serpent clarence you never called me just that before  fountain no but you called me a laughing hyena and said i scoffed at everything sacred  mrs fountain i cant remember using the word hyena exactly though i do think the way you talk about christmas is dreadful but i take back the laughing hyena  fountain and i take back the serpent i meant dove anyway but its this christmastime when a man gets so tired he doesnt know what hes saying  mrs fountain well youre good anyway dearest whatever you say and now im going to help you arrange the things i suppose therell be lots more tomorrow but we must get rid of these now dont you wish nobody would do anything for us just the childrendear little souls i dont believe but what we can make jim and susy believe in santa claus again benny is firm in the faith he put him into his prayer i declare his sweetness almost broke my heart at a knock whos that i wonder come in oh its you maggie well                                     iv                    the fountains fountains sisters  maggie its mr fountains sisters just telephoned up  mrs fountain have them come up at once maggie of course as maggie goes out another interruption if its going to keep on like this shouldnt you have thought they might have sent their presents  fountain i thought something like it in franks case but i didnt say it  mrs fountain and i dont know why i say it now its because im so tired i dont know what i am saying do forgive me its this terrible christmas spirit that gets into me but now youll see how nice i can be to them at a tap on the door come in come in dont mind our being in all this mess so darling of you to come you can help cheer clarence up you know his christmas eve dumps she runs to them and clasps them in her arms with several halfopen packages dangling from her hands and contrasting their disarray with the neatness of their silkribboned and tissuepapered parcels which their embrace makes meet at her back minnie aggie to lug here when you ought to be at home in bed dying of fatigue but its just like you both of you did you ever see anything like the stores today do sit down or swoon on the floor or anything let me have those wretched bundles which are simply killing you she looks at the different packages for benny from grandpa for a good girl from susys grandmother jim from aunt minnie and aunt aggie lucy with love from aggie and minnie and clarence what hearts you have got well i always say there never were such thoughtful girls and you always show such taste and such originality i long to get at the things she keeps fingering the large bundle marked with her husbands name notnota  minnie yes a bathrobe unless you give him a cigarcase its about the only thing you can give a man  aggie minnie thought of it and i chose it blue because its his color try it on clarence and if its too long  mrs fountain yes do dear lets see you with it on while the girls are fussily opening the robe she manages to push her brothers gift behind the door then without looking round at her husband it isnt a bit too long just the very looking well it can easily be taken up at the hem i can do it tomorrow she abandons him to his awkward isolation while she chatters on with his sisters sit down i insist dont think of going did you see that frightful pack of people when the cab horse fell down in front of shumakers  minnie see it  aggie we were in the midst of it i wonder we ever got out alive its enough to make you wish never to see another christmas as long as you live  minnie a great many wont live there will be more grippe and more pneumonia and more appendicitis from those jams of people in the stores  aggie the germs must have been swarming  fountain lucy was black with them when we got home  mrs fountain dont pay the slightest attention to him girls hell probably be the first to sneeze himself  minnie i dont know about sneezing i shall only be too glad if i dont have nervous prostration from it  aggie im glad we got our motorcar just in time any one that goes in the trolleys now will take their life in their hand the girls rise and move toward the door well we must go on now were making a regular round you cant trust the delivery wagons at a time like this goodby merry christmas to the children theyre fast asleep by this time i suppose  minnie i only wish i was  mrs fountain i believe you minnie goodby good night good night aggie clarence go to the elevator with them or no he cant in that ridiculous bathgown turning to fountain as the door closes now ive done it                                     v                         mrs fountain fountain  fountain it isnt a thing you could have wished to phrase that way exactly  mrs fountain and you made me do it never thanking them or anything and standing there like i dont know what and leaving the talk all to me and now making me lose my temper again when i wanted to be so nice to you well it is no use trying and from this on i wont clarence she has opened the parcel addressed to herself and now stands transfixed with joy and wonder see what the girls have given me the very necklace ive been longing for at planets and denying myself for the last fortnight well never will i say your sisters are mean again  fountain you ought to have said that to them  mrs fountain it quite reconciles one to christmas what oh that was rather nasty you know i didnt mean it i was so excited i didnt know what i was saying im sure nobody ever got on better with sistersinlaw and that shows my tact if i do make a slip now and then i can always get out of it they will understand do you think it was very nice of them to flaunt their new motor in my face but of course anything your family does is perfect and always was though i must say this necklace is sweet of them i wonder they had the taste a tap on the door is heard come in maggie sotto voce take it off she snatches his bathrobe and tosses it behind the door                                     vi                       wilbur hazard the fountains  hazard i suppose i can come in even if im not maggie catch fountain he tosses a large bundle to fountain its huge but it isnt hefty he turns to go out again  mrs fountain oh oh oh dont go come in and help us what have you brought clarence may i feel  hazard you can look if you like im rather proud of it theres only one other thing you can give a man and i said no not a cigarcase fountain smokes enough already but if a bathrobe can induce him to wash he goes out  mrs fountain screaming after him through the open door oh how good come back and see it on him she throws the bathrobe over fountains shoulders  hazard looking in again perfect fit just as the jew said and the very color for fountain he vanishes shutting the door behind him                                    vii                         mrs fountain fountain  mrs fountain how coarse well my dear i dont know where you picked up your bachelor friends i hope this is the last of them  fountain hazards the only one who has survived your rigorous treatment but he always had a passion for cold shoulder poor fellow as bathrobes go this isnt bad he gets his arms into it and walks up and down heigh  mrs fountain yes it is pretty good but the worst of christmas is that it rouses up all your old friends  fountain they feel so abnormally good confound them i suppose poor old hazard half killed himself looking this thing up and building the joke to go with it  mrs fountain well take it off now and come help me with the childrens presents youre quite forgetting about them and itll be morning and youll have the little wretches swarming in before you can turn round dear little souls i can sympathize with their impatience of course but what are you going to do with these bathrobes you cant wear four bathrobes  fountain i can change them every day but there ought to be seven this hood is rather a new wrinkle though isnt it i suppose its for a voyage and you pull it up over your head when you come through the corridor back to your stateroom we shall have to go to europe lucy  mrs fountain i would go to asia africa and oceanica to escape another christmas now if there are any more bathrobes come in maggie                                    viii                          maggie the fountains  maggie bringing in a bundle something a district messenger brought will you sign for it maam  mrs fountain you sign clarence if i know anything about the look and the feel of a bundle this is another bathrobe but i shall soon see while she is cutting the string and tearing the wrappings away fountain signs and maggie goes mrs fountain shakes out the folds of the robe well upon my word i should think there was conspiracy to insult you clarence i should like to know who has had the effrontery whats on it  fountain reading from the card which had fallen out of the garment to the floor with christmas greetings from mrs arthur j gibby  mrs fountain dropping the robe and seizing the card mrs arthur j gibby well upon my word this is impudence its not only impudence its indelicacy and i had always thought she was the very embodiment of refinement and ive gone about saying so now i shall have to take it back the idea of a lady sending a bathrobe to a gentleman what next i wonder what right has mrs gibby to send you a bathrobe dont prevaricate remember that the truth is the only thing that can save you matters must have gone pretty far when a woman could send you anything sointimate what are you staring at with that paper you neednt hope to divert my mind by  fountain giving her the paper in which the robe came seems to be for mrs clarence fountain  mrs fountain snatching it from him what it is it is oh poor dear lilly how can you ever forgive me she saw me looking at it today at shumakers and it must have come into her head in despair what else to get me but it was a perfect inspirationfor it was just what i was longing for whylaughing hysterically while she holds up the robe and turns it this way and thati might have seen at a glance that it wasnt a mans with this lace on and this silk hood andshe hurries into it and pulls it forward looking down at either sideits just the right length and if it was made for me it couldnt fit me better what a joke i shall have with lilly when i tell her about it i shant spare myself a bit  fountain then i hope youll spare me i have some little delicacy of feeling and i dont like the notion of a ladys giving me a bathrobe itsintimate i dont know where you picked up your girl friends  mrs fountain capering about joyfully oh how funny you are darling but go on i dont mind it now and you may be glad youve got off so easily only now if there are any more bathrobes a timid rap is heard at the door come in maggie the door is slowly set ajar then flung suddenly wide open and jim and susy in their nightgowns rush dancing and exulting in                                     ix                         jim susy the fountains  susy weve caught you weve caught you  jim i just bet it was you and now ive won havent i mother  susy and ive won too havent i father arrested at sight of her father in the hooded bathgown he does look like santa claus doesnt he jimmy but the real santa claus would be all over snow and a long white beard you cant fool us  jim you cant fool us we know you we know you and mother dressed up too there isnt any mrs santa claus and that proves it  mrs fountain severely dreadful little things who said you might come here go straight back to bed this minute or will you send them back clarence and not stand staring so what are you thinking of  fountain dreamily nothing merely wondering what we shall do when weve got rid of our superstitions shall we be the better for it or even the wiser  mrs fountain what put that question into your head christmas i suppose and thats another reason for wishing there was no such thing if i had my way there wouldnt be  jim oh mother  susy no christmas  mrs fountain well not for disobedient children who get out of bed and come in spoiling everything if you dont go straight back it will be the last time santa claus or no santa claus  jim and if we go right back  susy and promise not to come in any more  mrs fountain well well see how you keep your promise if you dont thats the end of christmas in this house  jim its a bargain then come on susy  susy and we do it for you mother and for you father we just came in for fun anyway  jim we just came for a surprise  mrs fountain kissing them both well then if it was only for fun well excuse you this time run along now thats good children clarence                                     x                         mrs fountain fountain  fountain well he looks up at her from where he has dropped into a chair beside the table strewn with opened and unopened gifts at the foot of the christmas tree  mrs fountain what are you mooning about  fountain what if it was all a fake those thousands and hundreds of thousands of churches that pierce the clouds with their spires those millions of ministers and missionaries those billions of worshipers sitting and standing and kneeling and singing and praying those nuns and monks and brotherhoods and sisterhoods with their ideals of selfdenial and their duties to the sick and poor those martyrs that died for the one true faith and those other martyrs of the other true faiths whom the one true faith tortured and killed those masses and sermons and ceremonies what if they were all a delusion a mistake a misunderstanding what if it were all as unlike the real thing if there is any real thing as this pagan christmas of ours is as unlike a christian christmas  mrs fountain springing up i knew it i knew that it was this christmas giving that was making you morbid again cant you shake it off and be cheerfullike me im sure i have to bear twice as much of it as you have ive been shopping the whole week and youve been just this one afternoon she begins to catch her breath and fails in searching for her handkerchief in the folds of her dress under the bathrobe  fountain offering his handkerchief take mine  mrs fountain catching it from him and hiding her face in it on the table you ought to help me bear up and instead of that you fling yourself on my sympathies and break me down lifting her face and if it was all a fake as you say and an illusion what would you do what would you give people in place of it  fountain i dont know  mrs fountain what would you have in place of christmas itself  fountain i dont know  mrs fountain well then i wouldnt set myself up to preach down everythingin a blue bathgown youve no idea how ridiculous you are  fountain oh yes i have i can see you you look like one of those blue nuns in rome but i dont remember any lace on them  mrs fountain well you dont look like a blue monk you neednt flatter yourself for there are none you look like what are you thinking about  fountain oh nothing what do you suppose is in all these packages here useful things that we need that we must have you know without looking that its the superfluity of naughtiness in one form or other and the givers of these gifts they had to give them just as weve had to give dozens of gifts ourselves we ought to have put on our cards with the seasons bitterest grudges in hopes of a return with a hopeless sense of the folly to pay a hateful debt with impotent rage and despair  mrs fountain i dont deny it clarence youre perfectly right i almost wish we had put it how it would have made them hop but theyd have known it was just the way they felt themselves  fountain going on thoughtfully its the capsheaf of the social barbarism we live in the hideous hypocrisy its no use to put it on religion the jews keep christmas too and we know what they think of christianity as a belief no weve got to go further back to the pagan saturnalia well i renounce the whole affair here and now im going to spend the rest of the night bundling these things up and tomorrow im going to spend the day in a taxi going round and giving them back to the fools that sent them  mrs fountain and im going with you i hate it as much as you do come in maggie                                     xi                     maggie mrs fountain fountain  maggie something the elevatorboy says he forgot it came along with the last one  mrs fountain taking a bundle from her if this is another bathrobe clarence it is as i live now if it is a woman sending it she picks up a card which falls out of the robe as she unfolds it love the giver indeed now clarence i insist i demand  fountain hold on hold on my dear the last bathrobe that came from a woman was for you  mrs fountain so it was i dont know what i was thinking about and i do beg your par but this is a mans bathrobe  fountain taking the card which she mechanically stretches out to him and a man sends itold fellows cant you read print ambrose j fellows and a message in writing it was a tossup between this and a cigarcase and the bathrobe won hope you havent got any other thoughtful friends  mrs fountain oh very brilliant giving me a start like this i shall let mr fellows know what is it maggie open the door please  maggie opening its just a district messenger  fountain ironically oh only a district messenger he signs the messengers slip while his wife receives from maggie a bundle which she regards with suspicion                                    xii                         mrs fountain fountain  mrs fountain from uncle philip for clarence well uncle philip if you have sent clarence clarence breaking into a whimper it is it is its another  fountain well that only makes the seventh and just enough for every day in the week its quite my ideal now if theres nothing about a cigarcase hello he feels in the pocket of the robe and brings out a cigarcase from which a slip of paper falls couldnt make up my mind between them so send both uncle phil well this is the last stroke of christmas insanity  mrs fountain his brain simply reeled under it and gave way it shows what christmas really comes to with a man of strong intellect like uncle phil  fountain opening the case oh i dont know hes put some cigars in herein a lucid interval probably theres hope yet  mrs fountain in despair no clarence theres no hope dont flatter yourself the only way is to bundle back all their presents and never never never give or receive another one come lets begin tying them up at once it will take us the rest of the night a knock at the door come maggie                                    xiii                  jim and susy mrs fountain fountain  jim and susy pushing in we cant sleep mother may we have a pillow fight to keep us amused till were drowsy  mrs fountain desolately yes go and have your pillow fight it doesnt matter now were sending the presents all back anyway she begins frantically wrapping some of the things up  susy oh father are you sending them back  jim shes just making believe isnt she father  fountain well im not so sure of that if she doesnt do it i will  mrs fountain desisting will you go right back to bed  jim and susy yes we will  mrs fountain and to sleep instantly  jim and susy in succession we wont keep awake a minute longer  mrs fountain very well then well see now be off with you as they put their heads together and go out laughing and remember if you come here another single time back go every one of the presents  fountain as soon as ever santa claus can find a moment for it  jim derisively oh yes santa claus  susy i guess if you wait for santa claus to take them back                                    xiv                         mrs fountain fountain  mrs fountain tiresome little wretches of course we cant expect them to keep up the selfdeception  fountain theyll grow to another when theyre men and women theyll pretend that christmas is delightful and go round giving people the presents that theyve worn their lives out in buying and getting together and theyll work themselves up into the notion that they are really enjoying it when they know at the bottom of their souls that they loathe the whole job  mrs fountain there you are with your pessimism again and i had just begun to feel cheerful about it  fountain since when since i proposed sending this rubbish back to the givers with our curse  mrs fountain no i was thinking what fun it would be if we could get up a sort of christmas game and do it just among relations and intimate friends  fountain ah i wish you luck of it then the thing would begin to have some reality and just as in proportion as people had the worst feelings in giving the presents their best feeling would be hurt in getting them back  mrs fountain then why did you ever think of it  fountain to keep from going mad come lets go on with this job of sorting the presents and putting them in the stockings and hanging them up on the tree and laying them round the trunk of it one thing its for the last time as soon as christmas week is over i shall inaugurate an educational campaign against the whole christmas superstition it must be extirpated root and branch and the extirpation must begin in the minds of the children we old fools are hopeless we must die in it but the children can be saved we must organize and make a housetohouse fight and ill begin in our own house tomorrow as soon as the children have made themselves thoroughly sick with candy and cake and midday dinner i will appeal to their reason and get them to agree to drop it to sign the antichristmas pledge to  mrs fountain clarence i have an idea  fountain not a bright one  mrs fountain yes a bright one even if you didnt originate it have christmas confined entirely to childrento the very youngestto children that believe firmly in santa claus  fountain oh hello wouldnt that leave jim and susy out i couldnt have them left out  mrs fountain thats true i didnt think of that well say to children that either believe or pretend to believe in him whats that she stops at a faint soft sound on the door its maggie with her hands so full shes pushing with her elbow come in maggie come in come in dont you hear me come in i say oh it isnt maggie of course its those worthless worthless little wretches again she runs to the door calling out naughty naughty naughty as she runs then flinging the door wide with a final cry of naughty i say she discovers a small figure on the threshold nightgowned to its feet and looking up with a frightened wistful face why benny she stoops down and catches the child in her arms and presses him tight to her neck and bends over covering his head with kisses what in the world are you doing here you poor little lamb is mothers darling walking in his sleep what did you want my pet tell mudda do whisper it in muddas big ear cant you tell mudda what whisper a little louder love were not angry with you sweetness now try to speak louder is that santa claus no dearest thats just dadda santa claus hasnt come yet but he will soon what say it again is there any santa claus why who else could have brought all these presents presents for benny and jim and susy and mudda and seven bathgowns for dadda isnt that funny seven and one for mudda what i cant quite hear you pet are we going to send the presents back why who ever heard of such a thing jim said so and susy well i will settle with them when i come to them you dont want me to well i wont then if benny doesnt want mudda to ill just give them a kiss apiece pop in their big ears what youve got something for santa claus to give them what where in your crib and shall we go and get it for mudda too and dadda oh my little angel she begins to cry over him and to kiss him again youll break my heart with your loveliness he wants to kiss you too dadda she puts the boy into his fathers arms then catches him back and runs from the room with him fountain resumes the work of filling the long stocking he had begun with then he takes up a very short sock he has that in his hand when mrs fountain comes back wiping her eyes hell go to sleep now i guess he was half dreaming when he came in here i should think when you saw how benny believed in it youd be ashamed of saying a word against christmas  fountain whos said anything against it ive just been arguing for it and trying to convince you that for the sake of little children like benny it ought to be perpetuated to the end of the world it began with the childhood of the race in the rejuvenescence of the spirit  mrs fountain didnt you say that christmas began with the pagans how monstrously you prevaricate  fountain that was merely a figure of speech and besides since youve been out with benny ive been thinking and i take back everything ive said or thought against christmas i didnt really think it ive been going back in my mind to that first christmas we had together and its cheered me up wonderfully  mrs fountain tenderly have you dearest i always think of it if you could have seen benny how i left him just now  fountain i shouldnt mind seeing him and i shouldnt care if i gave a glance at poor old jim and susy id like to reassure them about not sending back the presents he puts his arm round her and presses her toward the door  mrs fountain how sweet you are and how funny and good she accentuates each sentiment with a kiss and dont you suppose i felt sorry for you making you go round with me the whole afternoon and then leaving you to take the brunt of arranging the presents now ill tell you next year i will do my christmas shopping in july its the only way  fountain no theres a better way as you were saying they dont have the christmas things out the only way is to do our christmas shopping the day after christmas everything will be round still and dogcheap come well begin day after tomorrow  mrs fountain we will we will  fountain do you think we will  mrs fountain well well say we will they laugh together and then he kisses her  fountain even if it goes on in the same old way as long as we have each other  mrs fountain and the children  fountain i forgot the children  mrs fountain oh how delightful you are
