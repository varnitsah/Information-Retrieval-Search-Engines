49642833	the ocean and its wonders by rm ballantyne    chapter one  what the ocean has to sayits whispersits thundersits secrets  there is a voice in the waters of the great sea  it calls to man continually  sometimes it thunders in the tempest when the waves leap high and strong and the wild winds shriek and roar as if to force our attention  sometimes it whispers in the calm and comes rippling on the shingly beach in a still small voice as if to solicit our regard  but whether that voice of ocean comes in crashing billows or in gentle murmurs it has but one tale to tellit speaks of the love and power and majesty of him who rides upon the storm and rules the wave  yes the voice of ocean tells but one tale yet there are many chapters in that wonderful story  the sea has much to say far more than could possibly be comprehended in one volume however large  it tells us of the doings of man on its broad bosom from the day in which he first ventured to paddle along shore in the hollow trunk of a tree to the day when he launched his great iron ship of 20000 tons and rushed out to sea against wind and tide under an impulse equal to the united strength of 11500 horses  no small portion of the oceans tale this comprising many chapters of deeds of daring blood villainy heroism and enterprise  but with this portion of its story we have nothing to do just now  it tells us also of gods myriad and multiform creatures that dwell in its depths from the vast whale whose speed is so great that it might if it chose circle round the world in a few days to the languid zoophyte which clings to the rock and bears more resemblance to a plant than to a living animal  the sea has secrets too some of which it will not divulge until that day when its creator shall command it to give up its dead while others it is willing to part with to those who question it closely patiently and with intelligence  among the former kind of secrets are those foul deeds that have been perpetrated in all ages by abandoned men when no human ears listened to the stifled shriek or the gurgling plunge when no human eyes beheld the murderous acts the bloody decks the blazing vessels or the final hiss of the sinking wrecks  among the latter kind of secrets are the lives and habits of the creatures of the deep and the causes and effects of those singular currents of air and water which to the eye of ignorance seem to be nothing better than irregularity and confusion but which to the minds of those who search them out and have pleasure therein are recognised as a part of that wonderful orderly and systematic arrangement of things that we call nature much of which we now know more of which we shall certainly know as each day and year adds its quota to the sum of human knowledge but a great deal of which will doubtless remain for ever hidden in the mind of natures god whose ways are wonderful and past finding out  it is the latter class of secrets to which we purpose directing the readers attention in the following pages  on approaching so vast a subject we feel like the traveller who finding himself suddenly transported into the midst of a new and magnificent region stands undecided whither to direct his steps in the endlessly varied scene  or still more like the visitor to our great international exhibition of 1862 whoentering abruptly that gigantic palace where were represented the talent the ingenuity time wealth and industry of every people and climeattempts in vain to systematise his explorations or to fix his attention  it is probable that in each of these supposed cases the traveller and visitor resigning the desire to achieve what is impossible would give themselves up to the agreeable guidance of a wandering and wayward fancy  let us reader act in a somewhat similar manner  let us touch here and there and everywhere on the wonders of the sea and listen to such notes of the oceans voice as strike upon our ears most pleasantly    chapter two  composition of the seaits saltspower and uses of wateradvantage and disadvantage of saltsanecdotedeepsea soundingsbrookes apparatusimportance of the search after truthillustrations discoveries resulting from deepsea soundings  before proceeding to the consideration of the wonders connected with and contained in the sea we shall treat of the composition of the sea itself and of its extent depth and bottom  what is the sea made of  salt water is the ready reply that rises naturally to every lip  but to this we add the questionwhat is salt water or as there are many kinds of salt water of what sort of salt water does the sea consist  to these queries we give the following reply which we doubt not will rather surprise some of our readers  fresh water as most people are aware is composed of two gasesoxygen and hydrogen  sea water is composed of the same gases with the addition of muriate of soda magnesia iron lime sulphur copper silex potash chlorine iodine bromine ammonia and silver  what a dose  let bathers think of it next time they swallow a gulp of sea water  most of these substances however exist in comparatively small quantity in the sea with the exception of muriate of soda or common table salt of which as all bathers know from bitter experience there is a very considerable quantity  the quantity of silver contained in sea water is very small indeed  nevertheless small though it be the ocean is so immense that it has been calculated if all the silver in it were collected it would form a mass that would weigh about two hundred million tons  the salt of the ocean varies considerably in different parts  near the equator the great heat carries up a larger proportion of water by evaporation than in the more temperate regions and thus as salt is not removed by evaporation the ocean in the torrid zone is salter than in the temperate or frigid zones  the salts of the sea and other substances contained in it are conveyed thither by the freshwater streams that pour into it from all the continent of the world  maury in his delightful work the physical geography of the sea tells us that water is natures great carrier with its currents it conveys heat away from the torrid zone and ice from the frigid or bottling the caloric away in the vesicle of its vapour it first makes it impalpable and then conveys it by unknown paths to the most distant parts of the earth  the materials of which the coral builds the island and the seaconch its shell are gathered by this restless leveller from mountains rocks and valleys in all latitudes  some it washes down from the mountains of the moon in africa or out of the goldfields of australia or from the mines of potosi others from the battlefields of europe or from the marble quarries of ancient greece and rome  the materials thus collected and carried over falls and down rapids are transported to the sea  here as these substances cannot be evaporated they would accumulate to such a degree as to render the ocean uninhabitable by living creatures had not god provided against this by the most beautiful compensation he has filled the ocean with innumerable animals and marine plants whose special duty it is to seize and make use of the substances thus swept from the land and reconvert them into solids  we cannot form an adequate conception of the extent of the great work carried on continually in this way but we see part of it in the chalk cliffs the marl beds of the sea shore and the coral islands of the south seasof which last more particular notice shall be taken in a succeeding chapter  the operations of the ocean are manifold  besides forming a great reservoir into which what may be termed the impurities of the land are conveyed it is as has been shown the great laboratory of nature where these are reconverted and the general balance restored  but we cannot speak of these things without making passing reference to the operations of water as that wonderworking agent of which the ocean constitutes but a part  nothing in this world is ever lost or annihilated  as the ocean receives all the water that flows from the land so it returns that water fresh and pure in the shape of vapour to the skies where in the form of clouds it is conveyed to those parts of the earth where its presence is most needed and precipitated in the form of rain and dew fertilising the soil replenishing rivers and lakes penetrating the earths deep caverns whence it bubbles up in the shape of springs and after having gladdened the heart of man by driving his mills and causing his food to grow it finds its way again into the sea and thus the good work goes on with ceaseless regularity  water beats upon the rocks of the seashore until it pounds them into sand or rolls them into pebbles and boulders  it also sweeps the rich soil from the mountains into the valleys  in the form of snow it clothes the surface of the temperate and frigid zones with a warm mantle which preserves vegetable life from the killing frosts of winter  in the form of ice it splits asunder the granite hills and in the northern regions it forms great glaciers or masses of solidified snow many miles in extent and many hundred feet thick  these glaciers descend by slow imperceptible degrees to the sea their edges break off and fall into it and floating southward sometimes in great mountainous masses are seen by man in the shape of icebergs frequently huge rocks that have fallen upon these glaciers from cliffs in the arctic regions are carried by them to other regions and are deposited on flat beaches far from their native cliffs  the saltness of the sea rendering it more dense necessarily renders it more buoyant than fresh water  this is obviously a great advantage to man in the matter of commerce  a ship does not sink so deep in the sea as it does in a freshwater lake hence it can carry more cargo with greater facility  it is easier to swim in salt than in fresh water  the only disadvantage to commerce in the saltness of the sea is the consequent unfitness of its water for drinking  many and harrowing are the accounts of instances in which sailors have been reduced to the most terrible extremities for want of fresh water and many a time since navigation began have men been brought to feel the dread reality of that condition which is so forcibly expressed in the poem of the ancient mariner    water water everywhere   and not a drop to drink  science however at length enabled us to overcome this disadvantage of saltness  by the process of distillation men soon managed to procure enough water at least to save their lives  one captain of a ship by accident lost all his fresh water and before he could put into port to replenish a gale of wind which lasted three weeks drove him far out to sea  he had no distilling apparatus on board and it seemed as if all hope of the crew escaping the most horrible of deaths were utterly taken away  in this extremity the captains inventive genius came to his aid  he happened to have on board an old iron pitchpot with a wooden cover  using this as a boiler a pipe made of a pewter plate and a wooden cask as a receiver he set to work filled the pot with sea water put an ounce of soap therein to assist in purifying it and placed it on the fire  when the pot began to boil the steam passed through the pipe into the cask where it was condensed into water minus the saline particles which not being evaporable were left behind in the pitchpot  in less than an hour a quart of fresh water was thus obtained which though not very palatable was sufficiently good to relieve the thirst of the ships crew  many ships are now regularly supplied with apparatus for distilling sea water and on the african coasts and other unhealthy stations where water is bad the men of our navy drink no other water than that which is distilled from the sea  the salts of the ocean have something to do with the creating of oceanic currents which in their turn have a powerful influence on climates they also retard evaporation to some extent and have some effect in giving to the sea its beautiful blue colour  the ocean covers about twothirds of the entire surface of the earth its depth has never been certainly ascertained but from the numberless experiments and attempts that have been made we are warranted in coming to the conclusion that it nowhere exceeds five miles in depth probably does not quite equal that  professor wyville thompson estimates the average depth of the sea at about two miles  of the three great oceans into which the sea is naturally dividedthe atlantic the pacific and the arcticthe atlantic is supposed to be the deepest  there are profundities in its bosom which have never yet been sounded and probably never will be  the difficulty of sounding great depths arises from the fact that after a large quantity of line has been run out the shock of the lead striking the bottom cannot be felt  moreover there is sufficient force in the deepsea currents to sweep out the line after the lead has reached the bottom so that with the ordinary soundinglines in use among navigators it is impossible to sound great depths  scientific men have therefore taxed their brains to invent instruments for sounding the deep seafor touching the bottom in what sailors call blue water  some have tried it with a silk thread as a plumbline some with spunyarn threads and various other materials and contrivances  it has even been tried by exploding petards and ringing bells in the deep sea when it was supposed that an echo or reverberation might be heard and from the known rate at which sound travels through water the depth might thus be ascertained  deepsea leads have been constructed having a column of air in them which by compression would show the aqueous pressure to which they had been subjected but the trial proved to be more than the instrument could stand  captain maury of the american navywhose interesting book has been already referred toinvented an instrument for sounding the deep sea here is his own description of itto the lead was attached upon the principle of the screwpropeller a small piece of clockwork for registering the number of revolutions made by the little screw during the descent and it having been ascertained by experiment in shoal water that the apparatus in descending would cause the propeller to make one revolution for every fathom of perpendicular descent hands provided with the power of selfregistering were attached to a dial and the instrument was complete  it worked beautifully in moderate depths but failed in blue water from the difficulty of hauling it up if the line used were small and from the difficulty of getting it down if the line used were large enough to give the requisite strength for hauling it up  one eccentric old sea captain proposed to sound the sea with a torpedo or shell which should explode the instant it touched the bottom  another gentleman proposed to try it by the magnetic telegraph and designed an instrument which should telegraph to the expectant measurers above how it was getting on in the depths below  but all these ingenious devices failed and it is probable that the deepest parts of the oceanbed still remained untouched by man  at last an extremely simple and remarkably successful deepsea sounding apparatus was invented by mr brooke an american officer  it consisted of nothing more than thin twine for a soundingline and a cannon ball for a sinker  the twine was made for the purpose fine but very strong and was wound on a reel to the extent of ten thousand fathoms  the cannon ball which was from thirtytwo to sixtyeight pounds weight had a hole quite through it into which was fixed a sliding rod the end of which covered with grease projected several inches beyond the ball by an ingenious and simple contrivance the cannon ball was detached when it reached the bottom of the sea and the light rod was drawn up with specimens of the bottom adhering to the grease  with this instrument the americans went to work with characteristic energy and by always using a line of the same size and make and a sinker of the same shape and weight they at last ascertained the law of descent  this was an important achievement because having become familiar with the precise rate of descent at all depths they were enabled to tell very nearly when the ball ceased to carry out the line and when it began to go out in obedience to the influence of deepsea currents  the greatest depth reached by brookes soundingline is said to have been a little under five miles in the north atlantic  the value of investigations of this kind does not appear at first sight to unscientific men  but those who have paid even a little attention to the methods and processes by which grand discoveries have been made and useful inventions have been perfected can scarcely have failed to come to the conclusion that the search after truth pure and simple of any kind and of every kind either with or without reference to a particular end is one of the most useful as well as elevating pursuits in which man can engage  all truth is worth knowing and labouring after  no one can tell to what useful results the discovery of even the smallest portion of truth may lead  some of the most serviceable and remarkable inventions of modern times have been the result of discoveries of truths which at first seemed to have no bearing whatever on those inventions  when james watt sat with busy reflective mind staring at a boiling kettle and discovered the expansive power of steam no one could have for a moment imagined that in the course of years the inventions founded on the truth then discovered would result in the systematic driving of a fleet of floating palaces all round the world at the rate of from twelve to fifteen or twenty miles an hour  instances of a similar kind might be multiplied without end  in like manner deepsea sounding may lead to great as yet unimagined results  although yet in its infancy it has already resulted in the discovery of a comparatively shallow plateau or ridge in the north atlantic ocean rising between ireland and newfoundland a discovery which has been turned to practical account inasmuch as the plateau has been chosen to be the bed of our electric telegraph between europe and america  the first atlantic cable was laid on it and although that cable suffered many vicissitudes at first as most contrivances do in their beginnings communication between the two continents was successfully established  soundings taken elsewhere showed that somewhat similar plateaus existed in other parts of the atlantic and now the whole of western europe is being bound more firmly by additional cables to the eastern seaboard of america  this great and glorious achievement has been the result of the discovery of two truthsof a truth in science on the one hand and a truth in regard to the structure of the bed of the sea on the other  the study of electricity and of deepsea soundings was begun and carried on for the sake of the discovery of truth alone and without the most distant reference to the atlantic telegraphyet that telegraph has been one of the results of that study  who can tell how many more shall follow and even were no other result ever to follow this one may prove to be of the most stupendous importance to the human race  another discovery that has been made by deepsea sounding is that the lowest depths of the ocean are always in a state of profound calm oceanic storms do not extend to the bottom  when the tempest is lashing the surface of the sea into a state of the most violent and tremendous agitation the caverns of the deep are wrapped in perfect repose  this has been ascertained from the fact that in many places the bottom of the sea as shown by the specimens brought up by brookes apparatus and more recently by professor thompsons deepsea dredge is composed of exceedingly minute shells of marine insects  these shells when examined by the microscope are found to be unbroken and perfect though so fragile that they must certainly have been broken to pieces had they ever been subjected to the influence of currents or to the pulverising violence of waves  hence the conclusion that the bottom of the sea is in a state of perpetual rest and placidity  indeed when we think of it we are led to conclude that this must necessarily be the case  there are as we shall presently show currents of vast size and enormous power constantly flowing through the ocean and when we think of the tremendous power of running water to cut through the solid rock as exemplified in the case of niagara and many other rivers what would be the result of the action of currents in the sea compared with which niagara is but a tiny rivulet  ocean currents then flow on a bed of still water that protects the bottom of the sea from forces which by calculation we know would long ago have torn up the foundations of the deep and would probably have destroyed the whole economy of nature had not this beautiful arrangement been provided by the allwise creator    chapter three  wavessystem

confusion that the winds which blew west yesterday and blow east todayshifting it may be with gusty squalls now here now there in chaotic furyare actuated by no laws governed by no directing power  yet no thought could be more unphilosophical than this  apart altogether from divine revelation by which we are informed that all deeps fire and hail snow and vapour and stormy wind are fulfilling gods word which information we are bound to receive as a matter of faith if we be christians and as a matter of necessity if we be men of common sense because it is mere absurdity to suppose that the stormy winds etcetera are not fulfilling gods wordor will we now know to a great extent from practical experience and scientific investigation that the winds blow and the waters of the ocean flow in grand regular uninterrupted currents  amongst these there are numberless eddies which perhaps have tended to fill our minds with the idea of irregularity and confusion but which nevertheless as well as the grand currents themselves are subject to law and are utterly devoid of caprice  in regard to these matters there is much about which we are still in ignorance  but the investigations of late yearsespecially those conducted under the superintendence of captain maury of the american navy and doctors carpenter and thompson of englandhave shown that our atmosphere and our ocean act in accordance with a systematic arrangement many facts regarding which have been discovered and turned in some cases to practical account  see note 1  a very interesting instance of the practical use to which scientific inquiry can be turned even in its beginnings is given by maury  after telling us of the existence and nature of a current in the ocean called the gulf stream he gives the following account of the manner in which upon one occasion be made use of his theoretical knowledge  in the month of december 1853 the fine steamship san francisco sailed from new york with a regiment of united states troops on board bound for california by way of cape horn  she was overtaken while crossing the gulf stream by a gale of wind in which she was dreadfully crippled  her decks were swept and by one single blow of those terrible seas that the storms raise in the gulf stream more than in any other part of the atlantic one hundred and seventynine souls officers and soldiers were washed overboard and drowned  the day after this disaster she was seen by one vessel and again the next day december 26th by another but neither of them could render her any assistance  when these two vessels arrived in the united states and reported what they had seen the most painful apprehensions were entertained by friends for the safety of those on board the steamer  vessels were sent out to search for and relieve her  but where should these vessels go where should they look  an appeal was made to know what light the system of researches carried on at the national observatory concerning winds and currents could throw upon the subject  the materials they had been discussing were examined and a chart was prepared to show the course of the gulf stream at that season of the year  two revenue cutters were then appointed to proceed to sea in search of the steamer and maury was requested to furnish them with instructions  it will be observed here that the gentleman thus appealed to was at the time engaged in his study at washington utterly ignorant of all that had occurred within the previous few weeks on the stormy atlantic except through the reports brought thence by ships  these reports furnished him with meagre data to proceed uponsimply that a crippled steamer had been seen in a certain latitude and longitude on a particular day  but this information was sufficient for the practical man of science proceeding upon the supposition that the steamer had been completely disabled he drew two lines on the chart to define the limits of her drift  this his previous knowledge of the flow of the gulf stream at all seasons of the year enabled him to do  between these two lines he said the steamer if she could neither steam nor sail after the gale had drifted  and that she could neither steam nor sail he had good reason to suppose from the account of her brought in by the vessels above mentioned  a certain point was marked on the chart as being the spot where the searching vessels might expect to fall in with the wreck  while these preparations were being made two ships fell in with the wreck and relieved the crew  this however was not known at the time by the anxious friends on shore  the cutters sailed on their mission and reached the indicated spot in the sea where of course their assistance was now unnecessary  but when the vessels that had relieved the crew of the wreck arrived in harbour and reported where the wreck had been last seen it was found to be within a few miles of the spot indicated by maury  thus upon very slight data a man of science and observation was enabled while seated in his study to follow the drift of a wrecked vessel over the pathless deep and to indicate to a rescue party not only the exact course they ought to steer but the precise spot where the wreck should be found  the waves of the ocean are by no means so high as people imagine  their appearance in the atlantic or pacific when raised by a violent storm is indeed very awful and men have come to speak of them as being mountains of water  but their sublime aspect and their tumultuous state of agitation have contributed much to deceive superficial observers as to their real height  scientific men have measured the height of the waves  not many years ago a vessel while crossing the atlantic was overtaken by a violent storm  the sea rose in its might the good ship reeled under the combined influence of wind and waves  while the majority of the passengers sought refuge from the driving spray in the cabin one eccentric old gentleman was seen skipping about the deck with unwonted activitynow on the bulwarks now on the quarterdeck and anon in the rigging utterly regardless of the drenching sea and the howling wind and seeming as though he were a species of human stormy petrel  this was the celebrated dr scoresby a man who had spent his youth and manhood in the whalefishing who late in life entered the church and until the day of his death took a special delight in directing the attention of sailors to him whose word stilled the tempest and bade the angry waves be calm  being an enthusiast in scientific research dr scoresby was availing himself of the opportunity afforded by this storm to measure the waves  others have made similar measurements and the result goes to prove that waves seldom or never rise much more than ten feet above the sealevel  the corresponding depression sinks to the same depth thus giving the entire height of the largest waves an elevation of somewhere between twenty and thirty feet  when it is considered that sometimes the waves of the sea especially those off the cape of good hope are so broad that only a few of them occupy the space of a mile and that they travel at the rate of about forty miles an hour we may have some slight idea of the grandeur as well as the power of the ocean billows  the forms represented in our illustration are only wavelets on the backs of these monster waves  waves travel at a rate which increases in proportion to their size and the depth of water in which they are formed  every one knows that on most lakes they are comparatively small and harmless  in some lakes however such as lake superior in north america which is upwards of three hundred miles long the waves are so formidable as to resemble those of the ocean and they are capable of producing tremendous effects  but the waves of the sea when roused to their greatest height and travelling at their greatest speed are terrible to behold their force is absolutely irresistible  sometimes waves of more than usually gigantic proportions arise and after careering over the broad sea in unimpeded majesty fall with crushing violence on some doomed shore  they rush onward pass the usual barriers of the seabeach and do not retire until horrible devastation has been carried far into the land  maury gives the following anecdote from the notes of a russian officer which shows the awful power of such waves  on the 23rd of december 1854 at 945 am the shocks of an earthquake were felt on board the russian frigate diana as she lay at anchor in the harbour of simoda not far from jeddo in japan  in fifteen minutes afterwards 10 oclock a large wave was observed rolling into the harbour and the water on the beach to be rapidly rising  the town as seen from the frigate appeared to be sinking  this wave was followed by another and when the two receded which was at fifteen minutes past ten there was not a house save an unfinished temple left standing these waves continued to come and go until halfpast two pm during which time the frigate was thrown on her beamends five times a piece of her keel eightyone feet long was torn off holes were knocked in her by striking on the bottom and she was reduced to a wreck  in the course of five minutes the water in the harbour fell it is said from twentythree to three feet and the anchors of the ship were laid bare there was a great loss of life many houses were washed into the sea and many junks carried upone two miles inlandand dashed to pieces on the shore  the day was beautifully fine and no warning was given of the approaching convulsion the sea was perfectly smooth when its surface was broken by the first wave  monster waves of this kind occur at regular intervals among the islands of the pacific once and sometimes twice in the year and this without any additional influence of an earthquake at least in the immediate neighbourhood of the islands though it is quite possible that earthquakes in some remote part of the world may have something to do with these waves  one such wave is described as breaking on one of these islands with tremendous violence  it appeared at first like a dark line or low cloud or fogbank on the seaward horizon  the day was fine though cloudy and a gentle breeze was blowing but the sea was not rougher or the breaker on the coral reef that encircled the island higher than usual  it was supposed to be an approaching thunderstorm but the line gradually drew nearer without spreading upon the sky as would have been the case had it been a thundercloud  still nearer it came and soon those on shore observed that it was moving swiftly towards the island but there was no sound until it reached the smaller islands out at sea as it passed these a cloud of white foam encircled each and burst high into the air  this appearance was soon followed by a loud roar and it became evident that the object was an enormous wave  when it approached the outer reef its awful magnitude became more evident  it burst completely over the reef at all points with a deep continuous roar yet although part of its force was thus broken on it came as if with renewed might and finally fell upon the beach with a crash that seemed to shake the solid earth then rushing impetuously up into the woods it levelled the smaller trees and bushes in its headlong course and on retiring left a scene of wreck and desolation that is quite indescribable  stormwaves as those unusually gigantic billows are called are said to be the result of the removal of atmospheric pressure in certain parts of the ocean over which a storm is raging  this removal of pressure allows the portion thus relieved to be forced up high above the ordinary sealevel by those other parts that are not so relieved  the devastating effects of these stormwaves is still further illustrated by the total destruction of coringa on the coromandel coast in 1789  during a hurricane in december of that year at the moment when a high tide was at its highest point and the northwest wind was blowing with fury accumulating the waters at the head of the bay three monstrous waves came rolling in from the sea upon the devoted town following each other at a short distance  the horrorstricken inhabitants had scarcely time to note the fact of their approach when the first wave sweeping everything in its passage carried several feet of water into the town  the second swept still further in its destructive course inundating all the low country  the third rushing onward in irresistible fury overwhelmed everything submerging the town and twenty thousand of its inhabitants  vessels at anchor at the mouth of the river were carried inland and the sea on retiring left heaps of sand and mud which rendered it a hopeless task either to search for the dead or for buried property  we have spoken of waves travelling at such and such a rate but they do not in reality travel at all  it is the undulation or so to speak the motion of a wave that travels in the same manner that a wave passes from one end of a carpet to the other end when it is shaken  the water remains stationary excepting the spray and foam on the surface and is only possessed of a rising and sinking motion  this undulatory motion or impulse is transmitted from each particle of water to its neighbouring particle until it reaches the last drop of water on the shore  but when a wave reaches shallow water it has no longer room to sink to its proper depth hence the water composing it acquires actual motion and rushes to the land with more or less of the tremendous violence that has been already described  waves are caused by wind which first ruffles the surface of the sea into ripples and then acting with everincreasing power on the little surfaces thus raised blows them up into waves and finally into great billows  sometimes however winds burst upon the calm ocean with such sudden violence that for a time the waves cannot lift their heads  the instant they do so they are cast down and scattered in foam and the ocean in a few minutes presents the appearance of a cauldron of boiling milk  such squalls are extremely dangerous to mariners and vessels exposed to them are often thrown on their beamends even though all sail has been previously taken in  generally speaking however the immediate effect of wind passing either lightly or furiously over the sea is to raise its surface into waves  but these waves however large they may be do not affect the waters of the ocean more than a few yards below its surface  the water below their influence is comparatively calm being affected only by ocean currents  the tides of the seaas the two great flowings and ebbings of the water every twentyfour hours are calledare caused principally by the attractive influence of the moon which to a small extent lifts the waters of the ocean towards it as it passes over them and thus causes a high wave  this wave or current when it swells up on the land forms high tide  when the moons influence has completely passed away it is low tide  the moon raises this wave wherever it passes not only in the ocean directly under it but strange to say it causes a similar wave on the opposite side of the globe  thus there are two waves always following the moon and hence the two high tides in the twentyfour hours  this second wave has been accounted for in the following way the cohesion of particles of water is easily overcome  the moon in passing over the sea separates the particles by her attractive power and draws the surface of the sea away from the solid globe  but the moon also attracts the earth itself and draws it away from the water on its opposite side thus causing the high wave there as represented in the diagram figure 1  the sun has also a slight influence on the tides but not to such an extent as the moon  when the two luminaries exert their combined influence in the same direction they produce the phenomenon of a very high or springtide as in figure 2 where the tide at a and b has risen extremely high while at c and d it has fallen correspondingly low  when they act in opposition to each other as at the moons quarter there occurs a very low or neaptide  in figure 3 the moon has raised high tide at a and b but the sun has counteracted its influence to some extent at c and d thus producing neaptides which neither rise so high nor fall so low as do other tides  tides attain various elevations in different parts of the world partly owing to local influences  in the bristol channel the tide rises to nearly sixty feet while in the mediterranean it is extremely small owing to the landlocked nature of that sea preventing the tidal wave from having its full effect  up some gulfs and estuaries the tides sweep with the violence of a torrent and any one caught by them on the shore would be overtaken and drowned before he could gain the dry land  in the open sea they rise and fall to an elevation of little more than three or four feet  the value of the tides is unspeakable  they sweep from our shores pollution of every kind purify our rivers and estuaries and are productive of freshness and health all round the world    the gentlemen here referred to are agreed as to the fact of systematic arrangement of currents though they differ in regard to some of the causes thereof

important perhaps as well as the most wonderful is the gulf stream  this mighty current has been likened by maury to a river in the ocean  in the severest droughts it never fails and in the mightiest floods it never overflows  its banks and its bottom are of cold water while its current is of warm  it takes its rise in the gulf of mexico hence its name and empties into the arctic seas  its current is more rapid than the mississippi or the amazon and its volume more than a thousand times greater  this great current is of the most beautiful indigoblue colour as far out as the carolina coasts and its waters are so distinctly separated from those of the sea that the line of demarcation may be traced by the eye  its influences on the currents of the sea and on the climates and the navigation of the world are so great and important that we think a somewhat particular account of it cannot fail to interest the reader  the waters of the gulf stream are salter than those of the sea which fact accounts for its deeper blue colour it being well known that salt has the effect of intensifying the blue of deep water  the cause of the gulf stream has long been a subject of conjecture and dispute among philosophers  some have maintained that the mississippi river caused it but this theory is upset by the fact that the stream is saltsalter even than the seawhile the river is fresh  besides the volume of water emptied into the gulf of mexico by that river is not equal to the three thousandth part of that which issues from it in the form of the gulf stream  scientific men are still disagreed on this point  they all indeed seem to hold the opinion that difference of temperature has to do with the origination of the stream but while some such as captain maury hold that this is the chief cause others such as professor thompson believe the tradewinds to be the most important agent in the matter we venture to incline to the opinion that not only the gulf stream but all the constant currents of the sea are due chiefly to difference of temperature and saltness  these conditions alter the specific gravity of the waters of the ocean in some places more than in others hence the equilibrium is destroyed and currents commence to flow as a natural result seeking to restore that equilibrium  but as the disturbing agents are always at work so the currents are of necessity constant other currents there are in the sea but they are the result of winds and various local causes they are therefore temporary and partial while the great currents of the ocean are permanent and are comparatively little affected by the winds  every one knows that when a pot is put on the fire to boil the water contained in it as soon as it begins to get heated commences to circulate  the heated water rises to the top the cold descends  when heated more than that which has ascended it in turn rises to the surface and so there is a regular current established in the pot which continues to flow as long as the heating process goes on  this same principle of temperature then is one of the causes of the gulf stream  the torrid zone is the furnace where the waters of the ocean are heated  but in this process of heating evaporation goes on to a large extent hence the waters become salter than those elsewhere  here is another agent called into action the hot salt waters of the torrid zone at once rush off to distribute their superabundant caloric and salt to the seas of the frigid zones where the ice around the poles has kept the waters cold and the absence of great heat and to a large extent of evaporation has kept them comparatively fresh  in fact the waters of the sea require to be stirred because numerous agents are at work day and night from pole to pole altering their specific gravity and deranging so to speak the mixture  this stirring is secured by the unalterable laws which the creator has fixed for the carrying on of the processes of nature  the currents of the sea may be said to be the result of this process of stirring its waters  it is curious and interesting to note the apparently insignificant instruments which god has seen fit to use in the carrying out of his plans  the smallest coral insect that builds its little cell in the southern seas exercises an influence in the production of the gulf stream  it has been said with some degree of truth that one such insect is capable of setting in motion the entire ocean  the coral insect has in common with many other marine creatures been gifted with the power of extracting from sea water the lime which it contains in order to build its cell  the lime thus extracted leaves a minute particle of water necessarily destitute of that substance  before that particle can be restored to its original condition of equality every other particle of water in the ocean must part with a share of its superabundant lime  the thing must be done  that bereaved particle cannot rest without its lime  it forthwith commences to travel for the purpose of laying its brotherparticles under contribution and it travels far and wideround and round the world  myriads upon myriads of coral insects are perpetually engaged in thus robbing the sea water of its lime shells are formed in a similar manner so that our particle soon finds itself in company with innumerable other particles of water in a like destitute condition  it rises to the surface  here the sun as if to compensate it for the loss of its lime bestows upon it an unusual amount of heat and the surrounding particles not to be outdone make it almost unlimited presents of salt  full to overflow with the gifts of its new companions it hastens to bestow of its superabundance on less favoured particles joins the great army of the oceans currents enters perchance the gulf of mexico where it is turned back and hastens along with the gulf stream with all its natural warmth of character to ameliorate the climate of great britain and the western shores of europe  having accomplished this benevolent work it passes on with some of its heat and vigour still remaining to the arctic seaswhere it is finally robbed of all its heat and nearly all its salt and frozen into an iciclethere for many a long day to exert a chilling influence on the waters and the atmosphere around it being melted at last by the hot sun of the short arctic summer it hurries back with the cold currents of the north to the genial regions of the equator in search of its lost caloric and salt taking in a full cargo of lime etcetera as it passes the mouths of rivers  arrived at its old startingpoint our wanderer receives once more heat and salt to the full parts with its lime and at once hastens off on a new voyage of usefulnessto give out of its superabundance in exchange for the superabundance of others thus quietly teaching man the lesson that the true principles of commerce were carried out in the depths of the sea ages before he discovered them and carried them into practice on its surface  perchance another fate awaits this adventurous particle of water mayhap before it reaches the cold regions of the north it is evaporated into the clouds and descends upon the earth in fresh and refreshing rain or dew  having fertilised the fields it flows back to its parent ocean laden with a superabundant cargo of earthy substances which it soon parts with in exchange for salt  and thus on it goes round and round the world down in the oceans depths up in the cloudy sky deep in the springs of earth ever moving ever active never lost and always fulfilling the end for which it was created  all ocean currents are composed of water in one or other of the conditions just describedthe hot and salt waters of the equator flowing north to be cooled and freshened the cold and fresh waters of the north flowing south to be heated and salted  the gulf stream is simply the stream of equatorial hot water that flows towards the pole through the atlantic  its fountainhead is the region of the equator not the gulf of mexico but it is carried by the conformation of the land into that gulf and deflected by it and from it out into the ocean in the direction of europe  this stream in the atlantic is well defined owing to the comparative narrowness of that sea  the gulf stream then is like a river of oil in the oceanit preserves its distinctive character for more than three thousand miles it flows towards the polar regions and the waters of those regions flow in countercurrents towards the equator because of the fixed law that water must seek its equilibrium as well as its level thus keeping up a continuous circulation of the hot waters towards the north and the cold towards the south  there are similar currents in the pacific but they are neither so large nor so regular as those of the atlantic owing to the wide formation of the basin of the former sea  the effect of the gulf stream on climate is very great  the dreary furtrading establishment of york factory on the shores of hudsons bay is surrounded by a climate of the most rigorous characterthe thermometer seldom rising up so high as zero during many months and often ranging down so low as 50 degrees below zero sometimes even lower while the winter is seven or eight months long the lakes and rivers are covered with ice upwards of six feet thick and the salt sea itself is frozen  yet this region lies in the same latitude with scotland york factory being on the parallel of 57 degrees north which passes close to aberdeen  the difference in temperature between the two places is owing very much if not entirely to the influence of the gulf stream  starting from its caldron in the gulf of mexico it carries a freight of caloric towards the north atlantic  owing partly to the diurnal motion of the earth on its axis its flow trends towards the east hence its warm waters embrace our favoured coasts and ameliorate our climate while the eastern seaboard of north america is left in winter to the rigour of unmitigated frost  but besides the powerful influence of this current on climate it exerts a very considerable influence on navigation  in former times when men regarded the ocean as a great watery wasteutterly ignorant of the exquisite order and harmonious action of all the varied substances and conditions which prevail in the sea just as much as on the landthey committed themselves to the deep as to a blind chance and took the storms and calms they encountered as their inevitable fate which they had no means of evading  ascertaining as well as they could from the imperfect charts of those days the position of their desired haven they steered straight for it through fair weather and foul regarding interruptions and delays as mere unavoidable matters of course  but when men began to study the causes and effects of the operation of those elements in the midst of which they dwelt they soon perceived that order reigned where before they had imagined that confusion revelled and that by adapting their operations to the ascertained laws of providence they could even upon the seemingly unstable sea avoid dangers and delays of many kinds and oftentimes place themselves in highly favourable circumstances  navigators no longer dash recklessly into the gulf stream and try to stem its tide as they did of yore but as circumstances require they either take advantage of the countercurrents which skirt along it or avail themselves of the warm climate which it creates even in the midst of winter  there is a certain spot in the atlantic known by the name of the sargasso sea which is neither more nor less than a huge oceaneddy in which immense quantities of seaweed collect  the weed floats so thickly on the surface as to give to the sea the appearance of solid land and ships find extreme difficulty in getting through this region which is rendered still further unnavigable by the prevalence of longcontinued calms  this sargasso sea is of considerable extent and lies off the west coast of africa a little to the north of the cape verd islands  in former years ships used to get entangled in this weedy region for weeks together unable to proceed on their voyage  the great columbus fell in with it on his voyage to america and his followers thinking they had reached the end of the world were filled with consternation this sargasso sea lies in the same spot at the present day but men now know its extent and position  instead of steering straight for port they proceed a considerable distance out of their way and by avoiding this calm region accomplish their voyages with much greater speed  the ocean currents have been by repeated and longcontinued investigation ascertained and mapped out so also have the currents of the atmosphere so that nowadays by taking advantage of some of these currents and avoiding others voyages are performed not only in much shorter time but with much greater precision and certainty  as it was with ocean currents long ago so was it with atmospheric navigators merely put to sea steered as near as possible on their direct course and took advantage of such winds as chanced to blow  now they know whither to steer in order to meet with such winds and currents as will convey them in the shortest space of time to the end of their voyage  the knowledge necessary to this has not been gained by the gigantic effort of one mind nor by the accidental collocation of the results of the investigations of many ordinary minds  but a few masterminds have succeeded in gathering within their own grasp the myriad facts collected by thousands of naval men of all countries in their various voyages and by a careful comparison and philosophical investigation of these facts they have ascertained and systematised truths which were before unknown and have constructed wind and current charts by the use of which voyages are wonderfully shortened commercial enterprises greatly facilitated and the general good and comfort of nations materially advanced  the truth of this has of late been proved by incontestable facts  for instance one year particular note was taken of the arrival of all the vessels at the port of san francisco in california and it was found that of 124 vessels from the atlantic coast of the united states 70 were possessed of maurys wind and current charts  the average passage of these 70 vessels on that long voyage round cape horn was 135 days while the average of those that sailed without the charts that is trusted to their own unaided wisdom and experience was 146 days between england and australia the average length of the voyage out used very recently to be 124 days  with the aid of these charts it has now been reduced to 97 days on the average  the saving to commerce thus achieved is much greater than one would suppose  at the risk of becoming tedious to uninquiring readers we will make a brief extract from hunts merchants magazine of 1854 as given in a footnote in maurys physical geography of the sea  now let us make a calculation of the annual saving to the commerce of the united states effected by these charts and sailing directions according to mr maury the average freight from the united states to rio janeiro is 177 cents per ton per day to australia 20 cents to california also about 20 cents  the mean of this is a little over 19 cents per ton per day but to be within the mark we will take it at 15 and include all the ports of south america china and the east indies  the sailing directions have shortened the passage to california 30 days to australia 20 to rio janeiro 10  the mean of this is 20 but we will take it at 15 and also include the abovenamed ports of south america china and the east indies  we estimate the tonnage of the united states engaged in trade with these places at 1000000 tons per annum  with these data we see that there has been effected a saving for each one of these tons of 15 cents per day for a period of 15 days which will give an aggregate of 2250000 dollars 468750 pounds saved per annum  this is on the outward voyage alone and the tonnage trading with all other parts of the world is also left out of the calculation take these into consideration and also the fact that there is a vast amount of foreign tonnage trading between these places and the united states and it will be seen that the annual sum saved will swell to an enormous amount  before the existence of the gulf stream was ascertained vessels were frequently drifted far out of their course in cloudy or foggy weather without the fact being known until the clearing away of the mists enabled the navigators to ascertain their position by solar observation now not only the existence but the exact limits and action of this stream are known and mapped so that the current which was formerly a hindrance to navigation is now made to be a help to it  the line of demarcation between the warm waters of the gulf stream and the cold waters of the sea is so sharp and distinct that by the use of the thermometer the precise minute of a ships leaving or entering it can be ascertained  and by the simple application of the thermometer to the gulf stream the average passage from england to america has been reduced from upwards of eight weeks to little more than four  but this wonderful current is useful to navigators in more ways than one  its waters being warm carry a mild climate along with them through the ocean even in the depth of winter and thus afford a region of shelter to vessels when attempting to make the atlantic coast of north america which at that season is swept by furious storms and chilled by bitter frosts  the atlantic coasts of the united states are considered to be the most stormy in the world during winter and the difficulty of making them used to be much greater in former days than now  the number of wrecks that take place off the shores of new england in midwinter is frightful  all down that coast flows one of the great cold currents from the north  the combined influence of the cold atmosphere above it and the warm atmosphere over the gulf stream far out at sea produces terrific gales  the months average of wrecks off that coast has been as high as three a day  in making the coast vessels are met frequently by snowstorms which clothe the rigging with ice rendering it unmanageable and chill the seamans frame so that he cannot manage his ship or face the howling blast  formerly when unable to make the coast owing to the fury of these bitter westerly gales he knew of no place of refuge short of the west indies whither he was often compelled to run and there await the coming of genial spring ere he again attempted to complete his voyage  now however the region of the gulf stream is sought as a refuge  when the stiffened ropes refuse to work and the ship can no longer make head against the storm she is put about and steered for the gulf stream  in a few hours she reaches its edge and almost in a moment afterwards she passes from the midst of winter into a sea of sunnier heat  now as maury beautifully expresses it the ice disappears from her apparel the sailor bathes his limbs in tepid waters  feeling himself invigorated and refreshed with the genial warmth about him he realises out there at sea the fable of antaeus and his mother earth  he rises up and attempts to make his port again and is again perhaps as rudely met and beat back from the northwest but each time that he is driven off from the contest he comes forth from this stream like the ancient son of neptune stronger and stronger until after many days his freshened strength prevails and he at last triumphs and enters his haven in safetythough in this contest he sometimes falls to rise no more for it is terrible  the power of ocean currents in drifting vessels out of their course and in sweeping away great bodies of ice is very great although from the fact that there is no land to enable the eye to mark the flow such drifts are not perceptible  one of the most celebrated drifts of modern times and the most astonishing on account of its extent was that of the fox in baffins bay in the year 1857 a somewhat detailed account of which will be found in a succeeding chapter  the gulf stream is the cause of many of the most furious storms  the fiercest gales sweep along with it and it is supposed that the spring and summer fogs of newfoundland are caused by the immense volumes of warm water poured by it into the cold seas of that region  we are told that sir philip brooke found the temperature of the sea on each side of this stream to be at the freezingpoint while that of its waters was 80 degrees  from this it may be easily seen how great are the disturbing influences around and above it for as the warm and moist atmosphere over it ascends in virtue of its lightness the cold air outside rushes in violently to supply its place thus creating storms  the warm waters of this stream do not it is believed anywhere extend to the bottom of the sea  it has been ascertained by means of the deepsea thermometer that they rest upon or rather flow over the cold waters which are hastening from the north in search of those elements which in their wanderings they have lost  as cold water is one of the best nonconductors of heat the gulf stream is thus prevented from losing its caloric on its way across the atlantic to ameliorate the climates of the western coasts of europe and moderate the bitterness of the northern seas  were it otherwise and this great stream flowed over the crust of the earth so much of its heat would be extracted that the climates of france and our own islands would probably resemble that of canada  our fields would be covered for two three or four months with deep snow our rivers would be frozen nearly to the bottom our land traffic would perhaps be carried on by means of sledges and carioles our houses would require to be fitted with double windowframes and heated with iron stoves and our garments would have to be made of the thickest woollens and the warmest furs  the presence and the unchanging regularity of these great hot and cold currents in the ocean is indicated very clearly by the living inhabitants of the deep  these as certainly as the creatures of the land are under the influence of climate so much so that many of them never quit their native region in the sea  all the beautiful and delicate marine creatures and productions which dwell in the warm waters of the south are utterly absent from those shores which are laved by the cold currents that descend from the north while owing to the influence of the gulf stream we find many of those lovely and singular creatures upon our comparatively northern shores  of late years as every one knows we have all over the land been gathering these marine gems and studying their peculiar habits with deep interest in that miniature ocean the aquarium  in the same parallel on the other side of the atlantic none of these little lovers of heat are to be found  on the other hand the whale delighting as it does to lave its huge warmblooded body in iced water is never found to enter the gulf stream  thus these fish to some extent define its position  other fish there are which seem to resemble man in their ability to change their climate at will but like him also they are apt in so doing to lose their health or at least to get somewhat out of condition  some kinds of fish when caught in the waters off virginia and the carolinas are excellent for the table but the same species when taken off the warm coral banks of the bahamas are scarcely worth eating  in fact we see no reason for doubting that when these fish find their health giving way in the warm regions of the south they seek to reinvigorate themselves by change of water and quitting for a time the beauteous coral groves spend a few of the sunnier months of each year in gambolling in the cool regions of the north or what is much the same thing in those cool currents that flow from the north in clearly defined channels  besides its other useful and manifold purposes the gulf stream would seem to be one of the great purveyors of food to the whales seanettles or medusae are well known to constitute the principal food of that species of whale which is termed the right whale  navigators have frequently observed large quantities of these medusae floating along with the gulf stream and one sea captain in particular fell in with an extraordinarily large quantity of them of a very peculiar species off the coast of florida  as we have said no whales ever enter the warm waters of the gulf stream therefore at that time at least the leviathan could not avail himself of this rich provision the captain referred to was bound for england  on his return voyage he fell in with the same mass of medusae off the western islands and was three or four days in sailing through them  now the western islands is a great place of resort for the whale and thither had the gulf stream been commissioned to convey immense quantities of its peculiar food  we might enlarge endlessly on this great ocean current but enough we think has been said to show that the sea instead of being an ocean of unchanging drops driven about at random by the power of stormy winds is a mighty flood flowing in an appointed coursesteady regular and systematic in its motions varied and wonderful in its actions benign and sweet in its influences as it sweeps mound and round the world fulfilling the will of its great creator    chapter five  the atmospheric oceanorder in its flowoffices of the atmosphere dangers lessened by sciencecurrents of atmospherecause of windtwo great currentsdisturbing influencescalmsvariable windscauses thereoflocal causes of disturbancegulf streaminfluencethe winds mapped outa supposed case  fish are not the only creatures that live in this ocean  the human inhabitants of earth dwell at the bottom of an ocean of air which encircles the globe  fish however have the advantage of us inasmuch as they can float and dart about in their ocean while we like the crabs can only crawl about at the bottom of ours  this atmospheric ocean is so closely connected with the sea and exercises upon it so constant universal and important an influence that to omit in a work of this kind very special reference to the winds would be almost as egregious an oversight as to ignore the waves  wind or atmospheric air in motion is the cause of storms of waves of watertransport through the sky and of an incalculable amount of varied phenomena on land and sea  without this great agent no visible motion would ever take place in the sea  its great currents indeed might flow on though even that is questionable but its surface would never present any other aspect than that of an unruffled sheet of clear glass the air then becomes in this place an appropriate subject of consideration  the voice of ocean has something very emphatic to say about the atmosphere  in regard to its nature it is sufficient to say that atmospheric air is composed of two gasesoxygen and nitrogen  like the sea the atmosphere is an ocean which flows not in chaotic confusion but in regular appointed courses acting in obedience to the fixed unvarying laws of the almighty and having currents countercurrents and eddies also just like the watery ocean which exercise a specific and salutary influence where they exist  the offices of the atmosphere are thus quaintly enumerated by maury  the atmosphere is an envelope or covering for the distribution of light and heat over the earth it is a sewer into which with every breath we draw we cast vast quantities of dead animal matter it is a laboratory for purification in which that matter is recompounded and wrought again into wholesome and healthful shapes it is a machine for pumping up all the rivers from the sea and for conveying the water from the ocean to their sources in the mountains  it is an inexhaustible magazine marvellously stored and upon the proper working of this machine depends the wellbeing of every plant and animal that inhabits the earth  an element whose operations are so manifold and so important could not fail to engage the study of philosophic men in all ages but so difficult has been that study that little progress was made until very recently when men acting in unison in all parts of the world have by collating their observations become acquainted with some of those laws which govern the atmosphere and direct its courses and velocities  in early ages very little indeed was known about the wind beyond the palpable facts of its existence its varied condition and its tremendous power and mens observations in regard to it did not extend much beyond the noting of those peculiar and obvious aspects of the sky which experience taught them to regard as evidences of approaching storm  but although such aspects of the heavens were and always will be pretty safe and correct indicators of the weather they are by no means infallible and in some regions and under certain conditions they are wanting altogether  when the sea captain observes a lowering aspect of the sky with it may be a dark line above the distant edge of the sea he knowshowever calm and unruffled may be the ocean around himthat wind may be expected and calling the crew he orders sail to be taken in and preparation made for the approaching breeze  but there are times when no such warning is given when the atmospheric is perfectly still the sea calm as glass and the vessel floats motionless with her sails hanging idly from the yards as if she were    a painted ship upon a painted ocean  suddenly and before preparation can be made to withstand it the hurricane bursts in appalling fury over the sea the sails are blown to ribbons the masts perhaps broken down and frequently the vessel itself overwhelmed and sent to the bottom  many a gallant ship which has left the harbour ably commanded and well manned and never more been heard of has doubtless gone down in sudden storms such as those we have referred to  but the inventions of science have now very much lessened the danger of these storms  the barometer by the sudden fall of its column of mercury tells as plainly and certainly as if it spoke with an audible voice that a storm is approaching even though all nature should appear to contradict the fact by its calm and serene aspect so that the crew thus warned have time to furl the sails fasten down the hatches and otherwise prepare to face the impending danger  the atmosphere flows in a grand harmonious system of currents and countercurrents with their corresponding eddies just like the ocean and the grand final results of its varied action are to equalise in some degree the temperatures of the world to carry off and distribute moisture where it is required to sweep away noxious vapours and generally to ventilate the earth and gladden the heart of man  the primary cause of all wind is the combined action of heat and cold if the world were heated with perfect equality all round there would be as far at least as heat is concerned a perfect and permanent stagnation of the atmosphere and this would speedily result in the destruction of every living thing  but by the varied and beautiful arrangements which the almighty has made in nature he has secured a regular flow of atmospheric currents which will continue unalterably to move as long as the present economy of things exists  the intense and constant action of the suns rays in the torrid zone produces great heat while the less powerful and frequently interrupted influence of his rays in the frigid zones induces extreme cold  hence we have in one region heated air in another cool air  now the effect of heat upon air is to expand it make it light and cause it to rise  the moment it does so the cold air rushes in to supply its place and this rushing in of the cold air is what we call wind  it may surprise many people to be told that there are only two great and neverceasing courses of the winds of this worldnamely north and south  they flow perpetually from the equator to the poles and from the poles to the equator  all the irregularities and interruptions that we observe are mere temporary and partial deflections from this grand course  the heated air at the equator rises continually and flows in an upper current towards the pole getting gradually cooled on its way north  that from the pole flows in an under current towards the equator getting gradually heated on its way south  we speak only of the northern hemisphere for the sake of simplifying explanationthe action of the great windcurrent in the southern hemisphere is precisely similar  but our broad simple statement about the upper current from the equator and the under current from the pole requires a slight modification which we thought it best not to mingle with the statement itself  the heated air from the equator does indeed commence to flow in an upper current and the cooled air from the pole in an under current but as the upper currents of air are speedily cooled by exposure to space and the under currents are heated by contact with the earths surface they constantly change placesthe lower current becoming the upper and vice versa  but they do not change direction  the equatorial current ascends rushes north to a point about latitude 30 degrees where being sufficiently cooled it swoops down and continues its northward rush along the earth  at another point the polar current quits the earth and soaring up in consequence of its recently acquired heat becomes the upper current  this change in the two currents takes place twice in their course  of course the effect of these changes is to produce north winds in one latitude and south winds in another according to the particular wind equatorial or polar that happens to be in contact with the earth  at the points where these two currents cross in changing places we necessarily have calms or conflicting and variable winds  here then we have the first of the constant disturbing causes and of apparent irregularities in the winds  the earth as every one knows whirls rapidly on its axis from west to east  at the equator the whirl is so rapid that the atmosphere does not at once follow the earths motion  it lags behind and thus induces an easterly tendency to the winds so that a north wind becomes a northeast and a south wind a southeast  here we have another constant cause of variation from the northerly and southerly flow  we thus account for an easterly tendency to the winds but whence their westerly flow  it is simply explained thus  the motion of the earth is greatest at the equator  it diminishes gradually towards the poles where there is no motion at all  the atmosphere partakes of the earths motion when in contact with it and when thrown upwards by heat as at the equator it keeps up the motion for some time as it meets with no resistance there  bearing this in mind let us now follow a gush of warm atmosphere from the equator  it rushes up and turning north and south seeks the poles  we follow the northern division  when it left the earth it had acquired a very strong motion towards the eastnot so great as that of the earth itself but great enough to be equivalent to a furious gale from west to east if we suppose this air to redescend whence it rose it would on reaching the equator find the earth going too fast for it  it would lag a little and become a gentle easterly breeze  but now throw aside this suppositionour breeze rushes north at latitude 30 degrees it has got cooled and swoops down upon the earth but the earth at this latitude is moving much slower than at the equator the wind however has lost little or none of its easterly velocity  on reaching the earth it rushes east much faster than the earth itself and thus becomes a westerly gale  there are however many other agents at work which modify and disturb what we may call the legitimate flow of the wind and these agents are diverse in different places so that the atmosphere is turned out of a straight course and is caused to deflect to halt and to turn round sometimes sweeping low as if in haste at other times pausing as if in uncertainty and often whirling round as if in mad confusion  to the observer who sees only the partial effects around his own person all this commotion seems but the disorderly action of blind chance but to the eye of him who sees the end from the beginning we may certainly conclude that naught is seen but order and perfect harmony  and to the eye of science there now begins to appear in what was formerly an atmospheric chaos an evidence of design and system which is not indeed absolutely clear but which is nevertheless abundantly perceptible to minds that cannot hope in this life to see otherwise than through a glass darkly  the causes which modify the action of the winds are as we have said various  local causes produce local currents  a clear sky in one region allows the suns rays to pour upon let us say the ocean producing great heat the result of which is evaporation  aqueous vapour is very light therefore it rises and in doing so the aqueous particles carry the air up with them and the wind necessarily rushes in below to supply its place  the falling of heavy rain in certain conditions of the atmosphere has the effect of raising wind electricity has also in all probability something to do with the creation of motion in the atmosphere  now as these are all local causes they produce localor what in regard to the whole atmosphere may be termed irregulareffects  and as these causes or agents are in ceaseless operation at all times so their disturbing influence is endless and hence the apparent irregularity in the winds  but these causes are themselves not less than their results dependent on other causes or laws the workings of which are steady and unvarying and the little irregularities that appear to us in the form of fluctuating and changing winds and calms may be compared to the varying ripples and shifting eddies of a river whose surface is affected by the comparatively trifling influences of wind rain and drought but whose grand onward course is never for a single moment interrupted  among these disturbing influences the gulf stream is a very important one  it is constantly sending up large volumes of steam which rising into the air induce a flow of wind from both sides towards its centre and many of the storms that arise in other parts of the atlantic make for this stream and follow its course  so much has been ascertained by scientific investigation of the winds that we can now distinctly map out the great belts or currents which pass right round the world  we can tell in which parallels winds with easting and in which those with westing in them will be most frequently found and by directing our course to such places we can to a certain extent count upon profiting by the winds that will be most suitable  before the facts of atmospheric circulation were known mariners sailed by chance  if they happened to get into the belt of wind that suited them their voyages were favourable if they got into the wrong region their voyages were unfavourablethat was all  but they had no idea that there was any possibility of turning the tables and by a careful investigation of the works of the creator coming at last to such knowledge as would enable them to reduce winds and waves in a great degree to a state of slavery instead of themselves being at their mercy  the world may be said to be encircled by a succession of belts of wind which blow not always in the same direction but almost invariably with the same routine of variations  a vessel sailing from north to south encounters these belts in succession  to mariners of old these varying winds seemed to blow in utter confusion  to men of the present time their varied action is counted on with some degree of certainty  the reason why men were so long in discovering the nature of atmospheric circulation was that they were not sufficiently alive to the immense value of united effort  they learned wisdom chiefly from personal experienceeach man for himself and in the great majority of cases stores of knowledge that would have been of the utmost importance to mankind were buried with the individuals who had laid them up moreover the life of an individual was too short and his experience too limited to enable him to discover any of the grand laws of nature and as there was no gathering together of information from all quarters and all sorts of men and all seasons as there is now the knowledge acquired by individuals was almost always lost to the world  thus men were ever learning but never arriving at a knowledge of the truth  may we not here remark that this evil was owing to another evil namely mans ignorance of or indifference to the duty of what we may term human communication  as surely as gravitation is an appointed law of god so surely is it an appointed duty that men shall communicate their individual knowledge to each other in order that the general knowledge of the species may advance and just in proportion to the fidelity with which men obey this dutythe care and ability with which they collate and systematise and investigate their knowledgewill be the result of their efforts  in order to make the above remarks more clear as regards atmospheric phenomena let us suppose the case of a sailor who makes the same voyage every year but not precisely at the same time each year and it must be remembered that the rigid punctuality at starting which now holds good did not exist in former times  in his first voyage he had to cross say four of the windbelts  while crossing belt number one he experiences southwest winds chiefly and being an observant man notes the fact  in belt number two he encounters westerly winds  in number three he is in a region of variable winds and calms  in this region the winds blow all round the compass averaging about three months from each quarter  but our sailor does not know that he does not stay there all the year to make notes he passes on having recorded his experience in crossing belt number four he finds the prevailing winds to be easterly  next year he sets forth again but merchants are not always punctual the lading cannot be completed in time or adverse winds render the setting sail unadvisable  at length after a month or six weeks delay he proceeds on his voyage and finds belt number one perhaps much the same as last year  he congratulates himself on his good fortune and notes his observations but in belt number two the wind is somewhat modified owing to its being later in the seasonit is rather against him  in number three it is right in his teeth whereas last year it was quite in his favour  in number four which we will suppose is the tradewind belt of which more hereafter he finds the wind still easterly  here then is the groundwork of confusion in our sailors mind  he has not the remotest idea that in belt number one the wind blows chiefly but not always in one particular direction that in number four it blows invariably in one way and that in number three it is regularly irregular  in fact he does not know that such belts exist at all and his opportunities of observing are not sufficiently frequent or prolonged to enable him to ascertain anything with certainty  now when we remember that in this imperfect experience of his he is still further misled by his frequently encountering local vicissitudessuch as storms and calms resulting from local and temporary causeswe see how confusion becomes worse confounded  no doubt he does gather some few crumbs of knowledge but he is called on perhaps to change his scene of action  another ship is given to him another route entered on and he ceases altogether to prosecute his inquiries in the old region  or old age comes on and even although he may have been beginning to have a few faint glimmerings as to laws and systems in his mind he has not the power to make much of these  he dies his knowledge is to a very large extent lost and his logbooks disappear as all such books do nobody knows or cares where  now this state of things has been changing during the last few years logbooks are collected in thousands  the experiences of many men in reference to the same spots in the same years months and even hours are gathered collated and compared and the result is that although there are conflicting elements and contradictory appearances order has been discovered in the midst of apparent confusion and scientific men have been enabled to pierce through the chaos of littlenesses by which the worlds vision has been hitherto obscured and to lay bare many of those grand progressions of nature which move unvaryingly with stately step through space and time as the river with all its minor eddies and countercurrents flows with unvarying regularity to the ocean    chapter six  tradewindsstormstheir effectsmonsoonstheir valueland and sea breezesexperimentshurricanesthose of 1801rotatory stormstheir terrible effectschina seashurricane in 1837whirlwindsweight of atmospherevalue of atmospheric circulationheight of atmosphere  before proceeding to speak of the power and the dreadful effects of wind it is necessary to say a word or two about the tradewinds  it is supposed that the trades derived their name from the fact of their being favourable to navigation and therefore to trade  they consist of two belts of wind one on each side of the equator which blow always in the same direction  in the last chapter it was explained that the heated atmosphere at the equator rises and that the cooler atmosphere from the poles rushes in to supply its place  that which rushes from the south pole is of course a south wind that from the north pole a north wind but owing to the earths motion on its axis from west to east the one becomes a northeast the other a southeast wind  these are the northeast and the southeast trades  they blow regularlysometimes gently sometimes fiercelyall the year round  between the two is a belt of calms and changeable breezes varying from 150 to 500 miles broad according to the time of the yearwhere there are frequent and violent squalls of very short duration accompanied with heavy rains  this region is called by seamen the doldrums and considerable trouble and difficulty do ships experience in crossing it  it has already been explained that about latitude 30 degrees the upper current of wind from the south descends  at the same point the upper current from the north also descends  they cut through each other and the point where these two cut each other is the northern limit of the northeast tradewinds  the same explanation holds in regard to the southern limit of the southeast trades  in the accompanying diagram the arrows within the circle point out the direction of the northeast and the southeast trades between the tropics of cancer and capricorn and also the counter currents to the north and south of these while the arrows around the circle show how counter currents meet and rise or descend and produce the calm belts  we have hitherto enlarged chiefly on the grand currents of the atmosphere and on those modifying causes and effects which are perpetual  let us now turn to the consideration of those winds which are produced by local causes and the effects of which are partial  and here we are induced to revert to the gulf stream which has been already referred to as a local disturber of the regular flow of the atmosphere  this immense body of heated water passing through cold regions of the sea has the effect of causing the most violent storms the hurricanes of the west indies are among the most violent in the world  we have read of one so violent that it forced the gulf stream back to its sources and piled up the water in the gulf to the height of thirty feet  a vessel named the ledbnry snow attempted to ride it out  when it abated she found herself high up on the dry land having let go her anchor among the treetops of elliotts quay  the florida quays were inundated many feet and it is said the scene presented in the gulf stream was never surpassed in awful sublimity on the ocean the water thus dammed up rushed out with frightful velocity against the fury of the gale producing a sea that beggared description  the monsoons of the indian ocean are among the most striking and regular of the locallycaused winds  before touching on their causes let us glance at their effects  they blow for nearly six months in one direction and for the other six in the opposite direction  at the period of their changing terrific gales are frequentgales such as we in our temperate regions never dream of  what is termed the rainy season in india is the result of the southwest monsoon which for four months in the year deluges the regions within its influence with rain  the commencement of the southwest monsoon is described as being sublime and awful beyond description  before it comes the whole country is pining under the influence of longcontinued drought and heat the ground is parched and rent scarcely a blade of verdure is to be seen except in the beds of rivers where the last pools of water seem about to evaporate and leave the land under the dominion of perpetual sterility  man and beast pant for fresh air and cool water but no cool breeze comes  a blast as if from the mouth of a furnace greets the burning cheek no blessed drops descend the sky is clear as a mirror without a single cloud to mitigate the intensity of the suns withering rays  at last on some happy morning small clouds are seen on the horizon  they may be no bigger than a mans hand but they are blessed harbingers of rain  to those who know not what is coming there seems at first no improvement on the previous sultry calms  there is a sense of suffocating heat in the atmosphere a thin haze creeps over the sky but it scarcely affects the broad glare of the sun  at length the sky begins to change  the horizon becomes black  great masses of dark clouds rise out of the sea  fitful gusts of wind begin to blow and as suddenly to cease and these signs of coming tempest keep dallying with each other as if to tantalise the expectant creation  the lower part of the sky becomes deep red the gathering clouds spread over the heavens and a deep gloom is cast upon the earth and sea  and now the storm breaks forth  the violent gusts swell into a continuous furious gale  rain falls not in drops but in broad sheets  the black sea is crested with white foam which is quickly swept up and mingled with the waters above while those below heave up their billows and rage and roar in unison with the tempest  on the land everything seems about to be uprooted and hurled to destruction the tall straight cocoanut trees are bent over till they almost lie along the ground the sand and dry earth are whirled up in eddying clouds and everything movable is torn up and swept away  to add to the dire uproar thunder now peals from the skies in loud continuous roars and in sharp angry crashes while lightning plays about in broad sheets all over the sky the one following so close on the other as to give the impression of perpetual flashes and an unintermitting roar the whole scene presenting an aspect so awful that sinful man might well suppose the season of the earths probation had passed away and that the almighty were about to hurl complete destruction upon his offending creatures  but far other intentions are in the breast of him who rides upon the storm  his object is to restore not to destroyto gladden not to terrify  this tempestuous weather lasts for some days but at the end of that time the change that comes over the face of nature seems little short of miraculous  in the words of mr elphinstone who describes from personal observationthe whole earth is covered with a sudden but luxuriant verdure the rivers are full and tranquil the air is pure and delicious and the sky is varied and embellished with clouds  the effect of this change is visible on all the animal creation and can only be imagined in europe by supposing the depth of a dreary winter to start at once into all the freshness and brilliancy of spring  from that time the rain falls at intervals for about a month when it comes on again with great violence and in july the rains are at their height during the third month they rather diminish but are still heavy  in september they gradually abate and are often suspended till near the end of the month when they depart amid thunders and tempests as they came  such are the effects of the monsoons upon land and sea  of course the terrific gales that usher them in and out could not be expected to pass without doing a good deal of damage especially to shipping  but this is more than compensated by the facilities which they afford to navigation  in many parts of the world especially in the indian ocean merchants calculate with certainty on these periodical winds  they despatch their ships with say the northeast monsoon transact business in distant lands and receive them back laden with foreign produce by the southwest monsoon  if there were no monsoons the voyage from canton to england could not be accomplished in nearly so short a time as it is at present  and now as to the cause of monsoons  they are for the most part deflected tradewinds  and they owe their deflection to the presence of large continents  if there were no land near the equator the tradewinds would always blow in the same manner right round the world but the great continents with their intenselyheated surfaces cause local disturbance of the tradewinds  when a tradewind is turned out of its course it is regarded as a monsoon  for instance the summer sun beating on the interior plains of asia creates such intense heat in the atmosphere that it is more than sufficient to neutralise the forces which cause the tradewinds to blow  they are accordingly arrested and turned back  the great general law of the trades is in this region temporarily suspended and the monsoons are created  it is thus that the heated plains of africa and central america produce the monsoons of the atlantic the pacific and the gulf of mexico  we think it unnecessary to explain minutely the causes that produce variation in the monsoons  every intelligent reader will readily conceive how the change of seasons and varied configuration as well as unequal arrangement of land and water will reverse alter and modify the direction and strength of the monsoons  land and sea breezes are the next species of wind to which we would direct attention  they occur in tropical countries and owe their existence to the fact that the land is much more easily affected by sudden changes of temperature than the sea  thus the land in warm regions is much heated by the suns rays during the day the atmosphere over it becomes also heated in virtue of which it rises the cool atmosphere over the sea rushes in to supply its place and forms the sea breeze which occurs only during the day  at night the converse of this takes place  land heats and cools rapidly water heats and cools slowly  after the sun sets the cooling of the land goes on faster than that of the sea  in a short time the atmosphere over the land becomes cooler than that over the sea it descends and flows off out to sea thus forming the land breeze  it occurs only at night and when the change from one to the other is taking place there is always a short period of calm  land and sea breezes are of the greatest use in refreshing those regions which without them would be almost if not altogether uninhabitable  in the tempest an interesting work on the origin and phenomena of wind published by the society for promoting christian knowledge a curious and simple experiment is described whereby the existence of upper and under currents of air and the action of land and sea breezes may be clearly seen and understood  we quote the passage  the existence of the upper and under currents of air which mark the phenomena of the tradewinds and of land and sea breezes may be beautifully illustrated in two adjoining rooms in one of which a good fire is burning while in the other there is none  if the door between the two rooms be thrown open the cold air will enter the heated room in a strong current or in other words as a violent wind  at the same time the heated air of the warm room ascends and passes the contrary way into the cold room at the upper part of the same doorway while in the middle of this opening exactly between the two currents the air appears to have little or no motion  the best way to show this experiment is to introduce the flame of a candle into the doorway between a hot and a cold room  if the flame be held near the bottom of the doorway where the air is most dense it will be strongly drawn towards the heated room and if held near the top of the door it will be drawn towards the cold room with somewhat less force while midway between the top and bottom the flame will be scarcely disturbed  there is also another pretty experiment which illustrates well the theory of land and sea breezes  take a large dish fill it with cold water and in the middle of this put a waterplate or a saucer filled with warm water  the first will represent the ocean and the latter an island made hot by the rays of the sun and rarefying the air above it take a lighted wax candle and blow it out and if the air of the room be still on applying it successively to every side of the saucer the smoke will be seen moving towards the saucer and rising over it thus indicating the course of the air from sea to land  on reversing the experiment by filling the saucer with cold water to represent the island at night and the dish with warm water the land breeze will be shown by holding the smoking wick over the edge of the saucer the smoke will then be wafted to the warmer air over the dish  we have just tried the first of these experiments with complete success  we would however recommend a piece of twisted brown paper lighted and blown out instead of a wax candle because it gives out more smoke and is probably more obtainable on short notice  the experiment of the doorway moreover does not require that there should lie two rooms with a door between  we have found that the door of our study which opens into a cold passage serves the purpose admirably  were we treating chiefly of the atmosphere in this work it would be necessary that we should enlarge on all the varieties of winds with their causes effects and numerous modifications  but our main subject is the ocean  the atmosphere although it could not with justice have been altogether passed over must hold a secondary place here therefore we will conclude our remarks on it with a brief reference to hurricanes  it has been ascertained that most of the great storms that sweep with devastating fury over the land and sea are not as was supposed rectilinear in their motion but circular  they are in fact enormous whirlwinds sometimes upwards of one hundred and fifty miles in diameter and they not only whirl round their own centres but advance steadily forward through space  in the year 1831 a memorable and dreadful series of storms passed over some of the india islands and caused terrible havoc especially in the island of barbadoes  the peculiarity of these hurricanes was that they ravaged the different islands at different dates and were therefore supposed to be different storms  such however was not the case  it was one mighty cyclone or circular storma gigantic whirlwindwhich traversed that region at the rate of about sixteen miles an hour  it was not its progressive but its rotatory motion that constituted its terrible power  on the 10th of august it reached barbadoes on the 11th the islands of saint vincent and saint lucia on the 12th it touched the southern coast of porto rico on the 13th it swept over part of cuba on the 14th it encountered havanna on the 17th it reached the northern shores of the gulf of mexico and travelled on to new orleans where it raged till the 18th  it thus in six days passed as a whirlwind of destruction over two thousand three hundred miles of land and sea  it was finally dissipated amid heavy rains  the effect of a hurricane is well described by washington irving about midday he says a furious gale sprang up from the east driving before it dense volumes of cloud and vapour  encountering another tempest from the west it appeared as if a violent conflict ensued  the clouds were rent by incessant flashes or rather streams of lightning  at one time they were piled up high in the sky at another they descended to the earth filling the air with a baleful darkness more impenetrable than the obscurity of midnight  wherever the hurricane passed whole tracts of forest were shivered and stripped of their leaves and branches and trees of gigantic size which resisted the blast were torn up by the roots and hurled to a great distance groves were torn from the mountainprecipices and vast masses of earth and rock precipitated into the valleys with terrific noise choking the course of the rivers  the fearful sounds in the air and on the earth the pealing thunder the vivid lightning the howling of the wind the crash of falling trees and rocks filled every one with affright and many thought that the end of the world was at hand  some fled to caverns for safety for their frail houses were blown down and the air was filled with the trunks and branches of trees and even with fragments of rocks carried along by the fury of the tempest  when the hurricane reached the harbour it whirled the ships round as they lay at anchor snapped their cables and sunk three of them to the bottom with all who were on board  others were driven about dashed against each other and tossed mere wrecks upon the shore by the swelling surges of the sea which in some places rolled for three or four miles upon the land  this tempest lasted for three hours  the china seas are the most frequently visited by severe tempests or typhoons yet of all vessels the chinese junks as they are called seem to be least adapted by their build for encountering such storms  a terrible hurricane burst upon the china seas in the month of january 1837 as we learn from the united service journal of that year  an english vessel was exposed to it  the sea rising in mountains around and over the ships sides hurled her rapidly on her passage homeward when suddenly a wreck was discovered to the westward  the order to shorten sail was given and promptly obeyed and when they neared the wreck they found her to be a chinese junk without mast or ruddera helpless log on the breast of that boiling sea  there were many chinamen on deck vehemently imploring assistance  the exhibition of their joy on beholding the approach of the stranger was of the wildest and most extravagant nature but it was doomed to be suddenly turned to despair as the violence of the storm drove the ship past the wreck  it became necessary to put her on the other tack a manoeuvre which the poor creatures construed into abandonment and the air rang with the most agonising shrieks of misery  but hope was again raised when a boat was lowered and a rope thrown on board for the purpose of towing the junk to the ship  this intention was frustrated by the windlass breaking  at sight of this one man in a paroxysm of despair jumped overboard after the rope but he missed it  being a good swimmer he tried to reach the boat but his feeble power could avail him nothing in the midst of such raging elements he speedily sank to rise no more  another rope however was secured to the junk and by means of it the rest of the crew eighteen in number were saved  their gratitude was boundless  they almost worshipped the officers the crew and the vessel prostrating themselves and kissing the feet of the former and the very planks of the latter  wellbuilt ships however are not always able to withstand the violence of rotatory storms  instances occur in which the tightest built and best manned ships are destroyed as suddenly as the clumsiest of illmanaged junks  not many years ago a vessel was proceeding prosperously on her voyage when signs of a coming tempest induced the wary captain to reduce and finally to take in all sail  but his precautions were in vain  the storm burst on the devoted ship and in a few minutes the masts went over the side and the hull lay a total wreck upon the sea  these hurricanes or cyclones although in reality whirlwinds are so large that mans eye cannot measure them and it is only by scientific investigation that we have arrived at the knowledge of the fact  the whirlwind properly so called is a much smaller body of atmosphere sometimes we see miniature whirlwinds even in our own temperate land passing along a road in autumn lifting the leaves and dust into the air and carrying them along in the form of a rotatory pillar  in other regions they exert a power quite equal to the tempest though in a more limited space overturning houses uprooting trees cutting a track twenty or thirty yards wide through the dense forest as thoroughly as if a thousand woodmen had been at work there for many years  when whirlwinds pass from the land to the sea they create waterspouts of which we shall have something to say in another chapter  meanwhile we think it may be interesting to give the following miscellaneous information regarding the atmosphere gathered from the work of dr buist who devoted much earnest study to the subject of atmospheric phenomena  the weight of the atmosphere is equal to that of a solid globe of lead sixty miles in diameter  its principal elements are oxygen and nitrogen gases with a vast quantity of water suspended in them in the shape of vapour and commingled with these a quantity of carbon in the shape of fixed air sufficient to restore from its mass manyfold the coal that now exists in the world  water is not compressible or elastic it may be solidified into ice or vaporised into steam but the air is elastic and compressible  it may be condensed to any extent by pressure or expanded to an infinite degree of tenuity by pressure being removed from it  it is not liable to undergo any changes in constitution beyond these by any of the ordinary influences by which it is affected  if the heating and cooling processwhich we have described as being carried on between the equator and the poleswere to cease we should have a furious hurricane rushing perpetually round the globe at the rate of one thousand miles an hourten times the speed of the most violent tornado that has ever carried devastation over the surface of the earth  the air heated and dried as it sweeps over the arid surface of the soil drinks up by day myriads of tons of moisture from the seaso much indeed that were none restored to it the surface of the ocean would be depressed eight or ten feet annually  we do not certainly know the height of the atmosphere  it is said that its upper surface cannot lie nearer to us than fifty and can scarcely be further off than five hundred miles  it surrounds us on all sides yet we cannot see it it presses on us with a weight of fifteen pounds on every square inch of the surface of our bodiesin other words we are at all times sustaining a load of between seventy and one hundred tons of it on our personsyet we do not feel it  softer than the finest down more impalpable than the lightest gossamer it leaves the cobweb undisturbed and at times scarcely stirs the most delicate flower that feeds on the dew it supplies yet it bears the fleets of nations on its wings round the world and crushes the most refractory substances with its weight  it bends the rays of the sun from their path to give us the aurora of the morning and the twilight of evening it disperses and refracts their various tints to beautify the approach and the retreat of the orb of day  but for the atmosphere sunshine would burst on us in a moment and fail us in the twinkling of an eye removing us in an instant from midnight darkness to the blaze of noon  we have written a good deal on this subject yet the thousandth part has not been told of even the grand and more obvious operations of the atmosphere much less the actions and results of its minor and invisible processes  were we to descend with philosophers into the minuter laboratories of the world and consider the permeating ramifying subtle part the atmosphere plays in the innumerable transformations that are perpetually going on around and within us we should be constrained to feel more deeply than we have ever yet felt that the works of the creator are indeed wonderful beyond all expression or conception    chapter seven  waterspoutscauses ofappearanceelectricityexperimentsartificial waterspoutsshowers of fishmr ellis on waterspouts in the south seas  we turn back now from the atmospheric to the aqueous ocean  yet so intimate is the connection between the two that we shall find it impossible to avoid occasional reference to the former  our present subject waterspouts obliges us to recur for a little to the atmosphere which we dismissed or attempted to dismiss in the last chapter  there is no doubt that waterspouts are to a great extent if not altogether due to the presence of electricity in the air  when the clouds have been raging for some time in the skies of tropical regions rendering the darkness bright and the air tremulous with their dread artillery they seem to grow unusually thirsty the ordinary means of watersupply through the atmosphere do not appear to be sufficient for the demand or wartax in the shape of waterspouts that is levied on nature  the clouds therefore descend to the sea and putting down their dark tongues lick up the water thirstily in the form of waterspouts  these whirling pillars of water frequently appear in groups of several at a time  they are of various heights sometimes ranging up to seven hundred yards with a thickness of fifty yards and are very dangerous to ships that happen to come within their influence  that they are caused by electricity has been proved by experiment miniature waterspouts have been produced by artificial means and as dr bonzano of new york gives particular directions how the thing ought to be done we quote his words for the benefit of those who happen to possess electrical machines  from the conductor of an electrical machine suspend by a wire or chain a small metallic ball one of wood covered with tinfoil and under the ball place a rather wide metallic basin containing some oil of turpentine at the distance of about threequarters of an inch  if the handle of the machine be now turned slowly the liquid in the basin will begin to move in different directions and form whirlpools  as the electricity on the conductor accumulates the troubled liquid will elevate itself in the centre and at last become attached to the ball draw off the electricity from the conductor to let the liquid resume its position a portion of the turpentine remains attached to the ball turn the handle again very slowly and observe now the few drops adhering to the ball assume a conical shape with the apex downward while the liquid under it assumes also a conical shape the apex upward until both meet  as the liquid does not accumulate on the ball there must necessarily be as great a current downward as upward giving the column of liquid a rapid circular motion which continues until the electricity from the conductor is nearly all discharged silently or until it is discharged by a spark descending into the liquid  the same phenomena take place with oil or water  using the latter liquid the ball must be brought much nearer or a much greater quantity of electricity is necessary to raise it  if in this experiment we let the ball swing to and fro the little waterspout will travel over its immature sea carrying its whirlpools along with it  when it breaks up a portion of the liquidand with it anything it may containremains attached to the ball  the fish seeds leaves etcetera that have fallen to the earth in rainsqualls may have owed their elevation to the clouds to the same cause that attaches a few drops of the liquid with its particles of impurities to the ball  there can be no doubt whatever that fish are carried up in waterspouts because the descent of those creatures from the skies in rain is a wellestablished fact and if they did not get there in waterspouts which when we consider it seems most naturalthen we are driven to the conclusion that their native region is the sky which is by no means so natural or so probable  many travellers have recorded the fact that small fish have descended in rain  in a letter written not long ago by a gentleman in singapore we have the following account of a shower of fish  we experienced a shock of earthquake here on the 16th february last its duration was about two minutes  although it caused no damage its undulatory motion was sufficiently strong to affect certain persons with a sensation akin to seasickness  it was followed by rain in torrents on the 20th 21st and 22nd  on the latter day especially we were for half an hour surrounded with water to a considerable depth  we could not see three yards before us  when the sun came out again i saw a number of malays and chinese filling their baskets with fish contained in the pools formed by the rain  they told me the fish had fallen from heaven and three days later when the pools were all dried up there were still many dead fish lying about  as they lay in my courtyard which is surrounded by a wall they could not have been brought in by the overflowing of a torrent indeed there is none of any considerable size in the neighbourhood  the space covered by these fish might be about fifty acres comprising the eastern part of the town  they were very lively and seemed to be in good health  the writer of the above suggests with some degree of hesitation that these fish were sucked up by waterspouts  we think that there need be no hesitation in the matter  the appearance usually presented by a waterspout is that of a column of aqueous vapour reaching from the sea to the clouds sometimes straight more frequently a little bent and thicker above and below than in the centre of the column  mr ellis the missionary in his polynesian researches mentions having with a companion met and narrowly escaped being overwhelmed by several waterspouts when passing on one occasion in an open boat between two islands about thirty miles apart  on the passage they were overtaken by a sudden and violent squall which lasted several hours and in order to avoid being sunk they tied their masts oars and sails in a bundle and attaching a rope to them and to the boat cast them into the sea  thus they lay as it were at anchor in the lee of this extemporised breakwater  it was but a feeble barrier however against so wild a storm and the native boatmen were so overcome by fear that they sat down in the bottom of the boat and covered their eyes with their hands  after a time the rain diminished the sky began to clear and the boats crew to revive when suddenly one of the men uttered a cry of consternation and pointed to an object towards which all eyes were instantly turned  they beheld a large cylindrical waterspout extending like a massive column from the ocean to the dark and impending clouds  it was not far distant and seemed to move slowly towards the boat  had mr ellis had any doubt as to the danger of a waterspout the extreme terror exhibited by the natives on this occasion must have removed it for it was not probable that just after escaping from the most imminent peril they would fail back into a much more violent state of terror unless former experience had given them too good reason to dread the presence of the object they now saw before them  the roughness of the sea forbade their attempting to hoist a sail in order to avoid the waterspout  they were compelled therefore to summon all the resolution they possessed to enable them calmly to await its approach and put their trust in the arm of jehovah  the helm was in the hands of a seaman whose steadiness could be depended on  the natives were down in the bottom of the boat they had given way to despair  two other waterspouts now came into view and subsequently a third if not more so that they felt as if completely surrounded by them  some were well defined extending in an unbroken line from the sea to the sky like pillars resting on the ocean as their basis and supporting the clouds others assuming the shape of a funnel or inverted cone attached to the clouds extended their sharp points to the ocean below from the distinctness with which they were seen it was judged that the furthest could not have been many miles distant  in some they imagined they could trace the spiral motion of the water as it was drawn up to the clouds which were every moment being augmented in their portentous darkness  the sense of personal danger mr ellis confesses and the certainty of instant destruction if brought within their vortex prevented a very careful observation of their appearance and accompanying phenomena  the storm continued all day and at intervals the party in the boat beheld through the driving clouds and rain one or other of those towering waterspouts which however did not come nearer to them  it is interesting to read the record left by a christian missionary of his conflicting feelings on that terrible occasion  mr ellis believed that all hope of escape was over and his mind went through that ordeal which must be the experience of every one who sees the steady approach of speedy death  he says that during those hours when he sat awaiting his doom the thought of death itself did not make a deep impression the struggle the gasp as the wearied arm should attempt to resist the impetuous waves the straining vision that should linger on the last ray of retiring light as the deepening veil of water would gradually conceal it for ever and the rolling billows heaving over the sinking and dying body which perhaps ere life should be extinct might become the prey of voracious inhabitants of the deepthese things caused scarcely a thought compared with the immediate prospect of the disembodied spirit being ushered into the presence of its maker the account to be rendered and the awful and unalterable destiny that would await it there  these momentous objects he says absorbed all the powers of the mind and produced an intensity of feeling which for a long time rendered me almost insensible to the storm or the liquid columns which threatened our destruction  it was now that the missionary could look back with deepest gratitude upon that mercy which had first brought him to a knowledge of the saviour  him and him alone he adds i found to be a refuge a rock in the storm of contending feelings on which my soul could cast the anchor of its hope for pardon and acceptance before god  i could not but think how awful would have been my state had i in that hour been ignorant of christ or had i neglected or despised the offers of his mercy  our prayers were offered to him who is a present help in every time of danger for ourselves and those who sailed with us and under these and similar exercises several hours passed away  those prayers were answered for the waterspouts gradually disappeared and the boat got safe to land  in speaking of another waterspout seen on a subsequent voyage mr ellis tells us that it was well definedan unbroken column from the sea to the clouds which on this occasion were neither dense nor lowering  around the outside of the liquid cylinder was a kind of thick mist and within a substance resembling steam ascending apparently with a spiral motion  the water at its base was considerably agitated with a whirling motion while the spray which was thrown off from the circle formed by the lower part of the column rose several feet above the level of the sea  it passed about a mile astern of the ship  occasionally when passing nearer to a ship than was deemed safe a waterspout has been dissipated by a cannonshot as represented in our engraving  such are the usual appearances and actions of waterspouts  they are not however properly named being simply whirlwinds at sea instead of whirlwinds on land  professor oersted suggests the name stormpillar as being a more appropriate term  it does not follow that a large ship would inevitably be destroyed if brought within the vortex of a waterspout but it is certain that she would run the risk of being dismasted and perhaps thrown on her beamends  navigators have not had sufficient experience of the power of waterspouts to pronounce authoritatively on that pointand it is to be hoped they never will  captain beechy in his narrative of a voyage to the pacific describes one into which his ship actually entered and from which he received extremely rough handling before he was set free  but this might not have been a very large waterspout and it is not absolutely certain whether he was quite within its vortex or was merely brushed by the skirts of its outer garment  certain it is that waterspouts vary in size and in power for we read of them passing from the sea to the land and there rooting up trees unroofing and overturning houses dismounting cannon emptying fish ponds half emptying harbours and otherwise exhibiting a degree of force that would undoubtedly sink the largest vessel that ever was built if brought thoroughly to bear upon it  the rate of motion in waterspouts varies  sometimes they revolve slowly sometimes with the utmost rapidity  they often produce violent noise as indeed might be expected and they are generally accompanied by thunder and lightning though not invariably so for they are sometimes observed when the heavens are clear and the sea calm    chapter eight  the arctic seastheir character scenery and atmospherical illusions  there is a tendency on the part of most writers on the subject of polar regionsespecially compilersto dwell disproportionately on the gloomy side of the picture insomuch that readers are led not to overestimate the grand and the terrible aspects of the polar oceans but to underestimate the sweet and the beautiful influences that at certain periods reign there  we quarrel not with authors for dwelling on the tremendous and the awful  too much cannot be said on these points but while they do not by any means paint the dark side of their picture too black they fail to touch in the lights with sufficient brilliancy  we have had some personal experience of the arctic regions and have found it extremely difficult to get many personseven educated men and womento understand that there is a summer there though a short one that in many places it is an uncommonly hot and excessively brilliant summer and that the sun as if to make amends for its prolonged absence in winter shines all night as well as all day blazing on the crystal icebergs and pure snow which never disappear from those seas with a degree of splendour that renders the far north transcendently beautiful and preeminently attractive  we admit freely that the prevailing character of arctic seas during the greater part of the year is dark gloomy forbidding  but this is the very reason why their brief but cheering smiles should be brought prominently into the foreground and if they cannot in justice be dwelt on long at least be touched upon with emphasis  why in some of our cyclopaedia accounts of the realms of thickribbed ice so much prominence is given to the horrors and wide desolation of the scene and so much graphic power is expended in working up the readers imagination to a conception of the dreadful dangers and the appalling terrors that await the madman who should dare to venture within the arctic circle that persons who have not been there might well be tempted to shrink in affright from the very contemplation of a region in which there does not appear to be one redeeming quality  we repeat that we do not think the one side of the picture has been too darkly paintedbut the other side has been painted too slightly  at the same time we would caution our readers against jumping to the opposite extreme  the dark side of the picture is in reality out of all proportion to the light  and we do not hesitate to state our confirmed opinion that the arctic regions are more interesting to read about than pleasant to dwell in  having then defended the lights let us commence our investigations with the shadows  those oceans lying within the arctic circle exhibit phenomena so grand so wonderful and so varied that they claim distinct and separate treatment from the ocean as a whole  here the extreme cold acts with such power and produces such extraordinary results that it is difficult to find words or similes by which to convey a just conception of natures aspects to the general reader  during nearly twothirds of the year the arctic regions are under the absolute dominion of winter and for many weeks of that bitter season they are shrouded with the mantle of a dark sunless night  the entire ocean is locked in the embrace of a covering of ice many feet thick so that its liquid aspect is thoroughly removed and owing to icemasses scattered over its surface together with mounds of drifted snow it bears a much stronger resemblance to the land than to the sea  gales of wind sometimes sweep over those frozen plains in bitter fury hurling the snow into the air in vast eddying masses and threatening destruction to any living creature that may chance to be exposed to themnot so much from their violence however as from the intense cold of the atmosphere which is put in motion  but in regard to gales although there are no lack of them they are neither so fierce nor so frequent as are those of the torrid zone  it might be supposed that in such a climate animal life could scarcely exist but such is not the case  the inhabitants of part of the arctic regions named esquimaux more correctly eskimos with the accent on the last syllable are a stout hardy healthy race and the polar bears foxes wolves seals muskoxen walruses etcetera that dwell there seem to enjoy their existence just as much as do the animals of more favoured and warmer climes  during the short but hot summer of the arctic regions the immense masses of ice formed in winter are by no means cleared away  a great part of the heat of early summer there is no season there that merits the name of spring is spent in breaking up the solid crust of ice on the sea a large proportion of which is carried south by the currents that flow to the equator and melted long before they reach the temperate zones  but a considerable quantity of broken icemasses get locked in narrow places or stranded on shallows and although they undergo the process of melting the whole summer they are not much diminished ere the returning frost stops the process and locks them in the new ice of a succeeding winter  thus there is no period of the year in which large quantities of ice may not be seen floating about in the arctic seas  this fact it is that enables us to speak appropriately of the scenery of the arctic ocean  and assuredly this scenery of the ice is exceedingly and strikingly beautiful  the imagination cannot conceive the dazzling effect of a bright summer day in those regions when the ocean is clear as glass and icehumps and icemountains of every shape and size are glittering in the suns rays with intense brilliancy while the delicate whiteness of these floating islands and the magical atmospheric illusions by which they are frequently surrounded render the scene preeminently fairylike  all the navigators who have penetrated into the arctic seas speak with enthusiasm of the splendour of floating icemasses  they take the most curious and fantastic shapes sometimes appearing like great cities of white marble with domes and towers and spires in profusion sometimes looming huge and grand like fortresses and many of them with their summits overhanging so much as to suggest the idea that they are about to fall  this indeed they often do adding to the grandeur of the scene and not a little to the danger should ships chance to be in the neighbourhood  the atmospheric illusions before mentioned are the result of different temperatures existing within a few miles of each other and which are caused by the presence of large bodies of ice  the effect of this is to cause the icemasses on the horizon to appear as if floating in the air and to distort them into all sorts of shapes even turning them upside down and thus affording to an innovative mind a most ample and attractive field wherein to expatiate  to ascertain the causes of facts and effects so curious must be interesting to all who have inquiring minds  we will therefore attempt to describe and account for arctic phenomena in the following chapters as simply as may be    chapter nine  formation of icedangers of disrupting iceanecdotedrifting ice drift of the foxnipping anecdoteloss of the breadalbane  it is well known that when fresh water becomes so cold that its temperature is 32 degrees of fahrenheits scale it loses its liquid form and becomes ice  a somewhat lower temperature than this is necessary to freeze salt water the reason being that greater force is required to expel the salt which the sea holds in solutionwhich salt is always more or less expelled in the process of freezing  ice commences to form in the shape of needles which shoot out at angles from each other  in smooth water under the influence of intense cold the process is rapid and a thin cake soon covers the water and increases in thickness hour by hour  but when the sea is agitated the process is retarded and the fine needles are broken up into what arctic navigators call sludge  this however soon begins to cake and is broken by the swell into small cakes which as they thicken again unite and are again broken up into larger masses  these masses by rubbing against each other have their edges slightly rounded up and in this form receive the name of pancake ice  when a quantity of ice covers the ocean in a wide level sheet of considerable extent it is called an icefield  fields of this kind are often seen by navigators hundreds of miles in extent and nearly thirty feet thick  ice of such thickness however only shows five or six feet above water  when fields are broken by heavy oceanswells the edges are violently forced up and fall in debris on the surface thus hummocks or mounds are formed  when fieldice breaks up under the influence of an oceanswell caused by a storm the results are terrific  an exceedingly graphic account of an incident of this kind is given by dr brown in his history of the propagation of christianity  he writes  the missionaries met a sledge with esquimaux turning in from the sea who threw out some hints that it might be as well for them to return after some time their own esquimaux hinted that there was a groundswell under the ice  it was then scarcely perceptible except on lying down and applying the ear close to the ice when a hollow disagreeable grating sound was heard ascending from the abyss  as the motion of the sea under the ice had grown more perceptible they became alarmed and began to think it prudent to keep close to the shore  the ice also had fissures in many places some of which formed chasms of one or two feet but as these are not uncommon in ice even in its best state and the dogs easily leap over them they are frightful only to strangers  as the wind rose to a storm the swell had now increased so much that its effects on the ice were extraordinary and really alarming  the sledges instead of gliding smoothly along as on an even surface sometimes ran with violence after the dogs and sometimes seemed with difficulty to ascend a rising hill  noises too like the report of cannon were now distinctly heard in many directions from the bursting of the ice at a distance  alarmed at these frightful phenomena our travellers drove with all haste towards the shore and as they approached it the prospect before them was tremendous  the ice having burst loose from the rocks was tossed to and fro and broken in a thousand pieces against the precipices with a dreadful noise which added to the raging of the sea the roaring of the wind and the driving of the snow so overpowered them as almost completely to deprive them of the use of their eyes and ears  to make the land was now the only resource that remained but it was with the utmost difficulty that the frightened dogs could be driven forward and as the whole body of the ice frequently sank below the summits of the rocks and then rose above them the only time for landing was the moment it gained the level of the coasta circumstance which rendered the attempt extremely nice and hazardous  both sledges however succeeded in gaining the shore and were drawn up off the beach though not without great difficulty  scarcely had they reached it when that part of the ice from which they had just escaped burst asunder and the water rushing up from beneath instantly precipitated it into the ocean  in a moment as if by a signal the whole mass of ice for several miles along the coast and extending as far as the eye could reach began to break up and to be overwhelmed by the waves  the spectacle was awfully grand  the immense fields of ice rising out of the ocean clashing against each other and then plunging into the deep with a violence which no language can describe and with a noise like the discharge of a thousand cannon was a sight which must have filled the most unreflecting mind with feelings of solemnity  the brethren were overwhelmed with amazement at their miraculous escape and even the esquimaux expressed gratitude to god for their deliverance  such is the terrible aspect in which fieldice is seen when broken up and converted into smaller masses or floes  when these lie closely together the mass is called packice in which shape it usually drifts away with the southern currents and separating as it travels south is met with in loose floating masses of every fantastic form  there is always as we have said a large quantity of floe and packice in the polar seas which becomes incorporated with the new ice of the succeeding winter and not infrequently whale and discovery ships get frozen into the pack and remain there as firmly embedded as if they lay high and dry on land  when the pack is thus refrozen it usually remains stationary but there are occasions and circumstances in which the entire body of a pack drifts slowly southward even during the whole year showing clearly that oceanic circulation is by no means arrested by the icy hand of the hyperborean winter  a very remarkable drift of this kind is recorded by captain mcclintock of the fox which is worthy of being noticed here as illustrative of the subject we are now considering and also as showing in a remarkable manner the awful dangers to which navigators may be exposed by the disruption of the pack in spring and the wonderful almost miraculous manner in which they are delivered from imminent destruction  in attempting to cross baffins bay by penetrating what is called the middle ice the fox was beset and finally frozen in for the winter and here although their voyage may be said to have just commenced they were destined to spend many months in helpless inactivity and comparative peril and privation  their little vessel lay in the centre of a field of ice of immense extent so large indeed that they could not venture to undertake a journey to ascertain its limits  yet this field slowly and steadily descended baffins bay during the whole winter and passed over no fewer than 1385 statute miles in the space of 242 days during which period the fox was firmly embedded in it  it is with difficulty the mind can form any adequate conception of the position of those voyagersunable to move from their icy bed yet constantly drifting over miles and miles of ocean uncertain as to the where or the when of their deliverance from the pack exposed to the terrible dangers of disrupting ice and surrounded by the depressing gloom of the long arctic night  at length deliverance came but it came surrounded by terrors  in february mcclintock writes thus daylight reveals to us evidences of vast icemovements having taken place during the dark months when we fancied all was still and quiet and we now see how greatly we have been favoured what innumerable chances of destruction we have unconsciously escaped  a few days ago the ice suddenly cracked within ten yards of the ship and gave her such a smart shock that every one rushed on deck with astonishing alacrity  one of these sudden disruptions occurred between me and the ship when i was returning from the iceberg  the sun was just setting as i found myself cut off  at length i reached a place where the jagged edges of the floes met so crossed and got safely on board  again in march he says last night the ice closed shutting up our lane but its opposite sides continued for several hours to move vast each other rubbing off all projections crushing and forcing out of the water masses four feet thick  although one hundred and twenty yards distant this pressure shook the ship and cracked the intervening ice  soon after that a heavy gale burst upon them from the southeast encircling them with snowdrift so dense that they could neither hear nor see what was going on twenty yards off  at night the ship became suddenly detached from her wintry bed and heeled over to the storm inducing them to believe that the whole pack had been broken in and was pressing against them  this was not the case  a large mass of ice had protected them but at a distance of about fifty yards ice of four and a half feet thick had been crushed to atoms  soon after the protecting mass yielded and the fox received a nip which lifted her stern about a foot while occasional groaning from her sturdy little hull replied to the wild surgings of the ice without  but all this was as nothing compared with the scene of desperate turmoil and confusion which took place when the ice finally broke up and a gale raised a fearful swell so that the fox found herself surrounded by huge masses which tossed and ground against each other furiously and any two of which pieces could have crushed in her sides as if she had been made of walnut shell  gradually the pack opened out and the vessel by aid of wind and steam was mercifully delivered from her dangerous position  before passing from the subject of risk to navigators to the consideration of other forms and aspects of polar ice let us take a glance at an effectual case of nipping  there have been many partial and severe nips the descriptions of which are all more or less graphic but few ships have come so suddenly to the end of their career as did the breadalbane a small vessel that was used as a transport ship to the expedition in search of sir john franklin in 1852  one who was on board when it occurred thus describes it  sunday august 21stabout ten minutes past four the ice passing the ship awoke me and the door of my cabin from the pressure opened  i hurriedly put on my clothes and on getting on deck found some hands on the ice endeavouring to save the boats but the latter were instantly crushed to pieces  they little thought when using their efforts to save the boats that the ship was in so perilous a situation  i went forward to hail the phoenix another ship that was fortunately near for men to save the boats and whilst doing so the ropes by which we were secured parted and a heavy nip took us making every timber creak and the ship tremble all over  i looked in the main hold and saw the beams giving way  i hailed those on the ice and told them of our critical situation they not for one moment suspecting it  i then rushed to my cabin hauled out my portmanteau on deck and roared like a bull to those in their beds to jump out and save their lives  the startling effect on them might be more easily imagined than described on reaching the deck those on the ice called out to me to jump over the side that the ship was going over  i left my portmanteau and jumped over the side on the loose ice and with difficulty and with the assistance of those on the ice succeeded in getting on the unbroken part with the loss of the slippers i had on when quitting the vessel with wet feet etcetera  the cold was little thought of at the exciting momentlife not property being the object to be saved  after being on the ice about five minutes the timbers etcetera in the ship cracking up as matches would in the hand it eased for a short time and i with some others returned to the ship with the view of saving some of our effects  captain inglefield now came running towards the ship and ordered me to see if the ice was through it  on looking down into the hold i saw all the beams etcetera falling about in a manner that would have been certain death to me had i ventured down there  but there was no occasion for that i mean to ascertain the fact of the ice being through it being too evident that the ship could not last many minutes  i then sounded the well and found five feet in the hold and whilst in the act of sounding a heavier nip than before pressed out the starboard bow and the ice was forced right into the forecastle  every one then abandoned the ship with what few clothes they savedsome with only what they had on  the ship now began to sink fast and from the time her bowsprit touched the ice until her mastheads were out of sight did not occupy above one minute and a half  it was a very sad and unceremonious way of being turned out of our ship  from the time the first nip took her until her disappearance did not occupy more than fifteen minutes  such is the account of the fate of the breadalbane  while we read it we cannot help feeling that many arctic ships must have perished in a similar manner  it is wonderful nevertheless how many of those that dare the dangers of the ice survive the conflict  undoubtedly this is owing to a large extent to the fact that ships bottoms are rounded so that when a severe nip takes place there is a tendency in the ice to slip under their rounded bottoms and squeeze the vessels up out of the water  were it not for this few ships that have gone to those seas would ever have returned  a catastrophe such as that which befell the breadalbane shows the immense power of fieldice  hundreds of somewhat similar incidents might be cited to illustrate this power but we content ourselves with the selection of one instance which exhibits it in a remarkable manner and at the same time shows the way in which heavy vessels are sometimes forced out of the water  in the year 1836 captain back commanded the terror which was sent out to make geographical discoveries in the polar regions and spent the winter of that year in the ice  few ships have undergone severer tests than did the terror on that voyage  the severest treatment she experienced was in the spring when the disruption of the winter ice began to take place  the evening of the 7th of march was specially fraught with danger  we quote the gallant commanders graphic account  ominous rushing sounds were heard far off to the northeast and northwest  these gradually drew nearer as the flood made its way either under the compact bodies that withstood the shock or along the cracks and openingsgaining in these latter a furious velocity to which everything seemed to yield  it happened that there were several of these around the ship and when they opened on us like so many conduits pouring their contents to a common centre the concussion was absolutely appalling rending the lining and bulkheads in every part loosening some shores and stanchions so that the slightest effort would have thrown them down and compressing others with such force as to make the turpentine ooze out of their extremities  one fir plank placed horizontally between the beams and the shores actually glittered with globules  at the same time the pressure was going on from the larboard side where the three heaviest parts of the ruin of the floe remained cracked here and there but yet adhering in firm and solid bodies  these of course were irresistible and after much groaning splitting and cracking accompanied by sounds like the explosion of cannon the ship rose fore and aft and heeled over about ten degrees to starboard  again on the 11th back says at this time she showed symptoms of suffering in the hull which was evidently undergoing a severe ordeal inexplicable noises in which the sharp sounds of splitting and the harsher ones of grinding were most distinct came in quick succession and then again stopped suddenly leaving all so still that not even a breath was heard  in an instant the ship was felt to rise under our feet and the roaring and rushing commenced with a deafening din alongside abeam and astern at one and the same instant  alongside the grinding masses held the ship tight as in a vice while the overwhelming pressure of the entire body advancing from the west so wedged the stern and starboard quarter that the greatest apprehensions were entertained for the sternpost and framework abaft  some idea of the power exerted on this occasion may be gathered from thisat the moment which i am now describing the forepart of the ship was literally buried as high as the flukes of the anchors in a dock of perpendicular walls of ice so that in that part she might well have been thought immovable  still such was the force applied to her abaft that after much cracking and perceptible yielding of the beams which seemed to curve upwards she actually rose by sheer pressure above the dock forward and then with sudden jerks did the same abaft during these convulsions many of the carpenters and others stationed below were violently thrown down on the deck as people are in an earthquake  it was a moment of intense suspense  on the 16th another rush drove irresistibly on the larboard quarter and stern and forcing the ship ahead raised her on the ice  a chaotic ruin followed  the ship was careened fully four streaks and sprang a leak as before  scarcely were ten minutes left us for the expression of our astonishment that anything of human build could outlive such assaults when another equally violent rush succeeded and in its way toward the starboard quarter threw up a rolling wave thirty feet high crowned by a blue square mass of many tons resembling the entire side of a house which after hanging for some time in doubtful poise on the ridge at length fell with a crash into the hollow in which as in a cavern the afterpart of the ship seemed embedded  it was indeed an awful crisis rendered more frightful from the mistiness of the night and dimness of the moon  the poor ship cracked and trembled violently and no one could say that the next minute would not be her lastand indeed his own too for with her our means of safety would probably perish  it is unnecessary to give additional instances of this kind in order to show the terrible power of fieldice  indeed it requires little in the way of illumination to prove that masses of solid matter many thousands of tons in weight can when in motion utterly destroy the most powerful engines of human construction  we shall now turn our attention to another and a very prominent form in which arctic ice presents itselfnamely that of icebergs    chapter ten  icebergstheir appearance and formstheir causeglacierstheir nature and originanecdote of scoresbyrisk among icebergsmcclures experience  there are not only icefields icefloes etcetera in the polar seas but there are icemountains or bergs  it was long a matter of uncertainty as to where and how those immense mountains that are met with occasionally at sea were formed  we are now in a position to tell definitely where they originate and how they are produced  they are not masses of frozen sea water  their birthplace is in the valleys of the far north and they are formed by the accumulation of the snows and ice of ages  this is a somewhat general way of stating the matter but our subsequent explanations will we trust make our meaning abundantly clear  icebergs are found floating in great numbers in the arctic seas  they drift southward each spring with the general body of polar ice and frequently travel pretty far south in the atlantic before the heat of the water and atmosphere united accomplishes their dissolution  they sometimes travel as far south as florida with the southerly current that flows along that coast but the warm waters of the gulf stream together with its northerly flow form an impassable barrier between these icemountains and europe  icebergs assume every variety of form and almost every size  they sometimes resemble castles sometimes churches with glittering spires and sometimes the peaked and jagged mountains of norway  they are also frequently seen in the form of immense misshapen and topheavy masses  in size they vary from one hundred to seven or eight hundred feet in height  one iceberg seen by ross in baffins bay was above two miles in length nearly the same in width and fifty feet high  but in stating this we have not given the reader any idea of its vast proportions for it is well known that all icebergs or masses of ice have a much greater proportion of their bulk under than above waterin other words they sink very deep  the relative proportion that sinks depends on the nature of the ice  of some kinds there is usually ten times as much below as there is above water of other kinds there may be eight or five parts below  in all cases there is much more below than above so that a mountain of a hundred feet highif afloatmay be safely calculated to be a mass of ice not far short of a thousand feet thick  as these bergs float southward with the currents they melt very rapidly  the heat of the sun and the action of the waves gradually round off the sharp angles and topple down the spires that characterised them in the land of their birth  the process of dissolution too is carried on internally for rain and melted water on the surface percolates through the mass rendering it porous  as the waves cut away the base the centre of gravity is thrown out and the whole berg turns over with a terrible crash  sometimes loud reports like cannonshots are heard and the huge mountain splits asunder while not unfrequently the whole berg falls into a heap of chaotic ruins and floats away in a mass of smaller pieces which disappear gradually in their parent sea  the formation of icebergs has as we have said puzzled mankind for many years  their existence has long been known for even before men dared to venture their lives in the polar regions navigators in crossing the atlantic ocean frequently met with these marblelike mountains and what is worse sometimes ran at full speed against them and were sunk with all on board  bergs are frequently enveloped in dense fogs caused by the cold atmosphere by which they are surrounded condensing the moisture of the warmer atmosphere which they encounter on their voyage southward hence they are exceedingly dangerous to navigation  but now to speak of their formation  many of the great valleys of the far north are completely filled up with solid ice  observe we do not say that they are merely covered over with ice they are absolutely filled up with it from top to bottom those icemasses are known by the name of glaciers and they are found in most of the elevated regions of the earthon the alps and the mountains of norway for instancebut they exist in greater abundance about the poles than elsewhere  glaciers never melt  they have existed for unknown ages probably since the world began and they will in all likelihood continue to exist until the world comes to an endat least until the present economy of the world terminates  they began with the first fall of snow and as falls of snow during the long winters of the polar regions are frequent and heavy the accumulated masses are many feet deep especially in places where drifts are gatheredsometimes fifteen twenty thirty and even forty feet deep  the summer sun could not melt such drifts entirely  new snow was added each winter until the valleys of the far north were filled up and so they remain filled up to this day  in order to understand the nature of glaciers clearly let us turn back to those remote ages that rolled over this earth long before man was created  let us in spirit leap back to the time when no living creature existed even before the great mastodon began to leave his huge footprints on the sands of time  we have reached one of the large valleys of the arctic regions  it is solemn grand and still  no merry birds no prowling creatures are there to disturb the universal calm  the creator has not yet formed the living creatures and pronounced them very good  it is the worlds first winter  as we look upward to the sky we observe the first white snowflakes falling gently to the ground  they reach it and for the first time that valley is covered with a garment of virgin snow  the valley is upwards of two miles broad  it rises from the sea and goes far back into the mountains perhaps to the extent of ten or twelve miles  the mountains that flank it are five or six thousand feet high we have seen such valleys in norway within the arctic circle  before that first winter has passed many and many a fall of snow has thickened and pressed down that first coat and many a furious storm has caught up the snow from the mountaintops and swept it into the valley adding to and piling up the mass and packing it firmly down  spring arrives  the short but warm arctic summer bursts upon that vale melting the surface of the snow and the water thus produced sinks through the mass converting it into a sort of thick slushhalf snow half waternot liquid yet not solid just solid enough to lie there apparently without motion yet just liquid enough to creep by slow absolutely imperceptible degrees down the valley  the snow in all the mountain gorges is similarly affected it creeps it cannot be said to flow out and joins that in the vale  but we cannot perceive any of the motion of which we are writing  the mass of snow seems to be as still and motionless as the rocks on which we stand nay if we choose we may walk on its hard surface almost without leaving the slightest print of our foot  but if we throw a large stone on the surface of the snow and mark the spot and return again after many days we shall find that the stone has descended the valley a short distance  we shall also observe that the snow has now a variety of markings on its surface which might lead us to fancy had we not known better that it had once been a river which while raging down to the sea with all its curling rapids and whirling eddies had been arrested in all instant by the iceking and frozen solidin fact it has all the graceful lines and forms of fluidity with all the steady motionless aspect of solidity  it really moves this vast body of snow but like the hour hand of a watch its motion cannot be recognised though we should observe it with prolonged unflagging attention  we have called it a vast body of snow but this is only comparatively speaking  it will be vaster yet before we have done with it  at present it is but a thick semifluid covering lying at the bottom of this ancient arctic vale  the brief summer ends  much of the winter snow has been melted and returned to the sea but much very much more is still lying deep upon the ground  the worlds second winter comes  the first frost effectually puts a stop to all the melting and moving that we have been describing  the snowriver no longer movesit is arrested  the water no longer percolates through the snowit is frozen  the mass is no longer semifluidit is solid ice and the first step in the process of a glaciers formation is begun  thereafter this process is continued from year to year each winter adding largely to its bulk each summer deducting slightly therefrom  the growing mass of ice ascends the mountainsides swallows the rocks and shrubs and trees in its progress until its body becomes a thousand feet thick the extreme summits of the mountainpeaks alone tower above the snowy waste and the mass at the bottom is now by the pressure of superincumbent masses pure ice hard and clear as crystal  when the great glacier grows old it still maintains its stealthy downward motion during every summer  it has reached the shore and has been pushed like a huge white tongue out into the sea  but what has all this to do with icebergs it may be inquired  much very much  it is common enough in commenting on a child to speak of the parent  the glacier is the mother of the iceberg  when in the worlds early morning the embryo glacier reached the sea its thin edges were easily broken off by the waves but as it increased and still further encroached these edges became thicker and thicker until at last a wall of pure ice several hundred feet high presented its glittering front to the ocean  it was hard and massive the sun of summer had little effect on its frigid face and it seemed to bid defiance to the sea itself  but things often are not what they seem each billow sapped its foundation it soon began to overhang its base at length the cohesion of the mass was not sufficient to sustain its weight  a rending accompanied by sounds like heavens artillery took place the crystal mountain bowed its brow and fell with thunderous crash upon the water then rocking slowly under the impulse of its dread plunge the first iceberg floated off to sea  it is right to remark here that this explanation is to some extent disputedat least there is a difference of opinion as to the manner in which the iceberg leaves its parent glacier  there is no dispute as to its origin  this difference will be explained shortly in a quotation from dr kanes work meanwhile in support of the present theory let us listen to the words of one who saw with his own eyes something similar to what has been described  dr scoresby than whom a better man never explored the arctic seas says  in july 1818 i was particularly fortunate in witnessing one of the grandest effects which these polar glaciers ever present  a strong northwesterly swell having for some hours been beating on the shore had loosened a number of fragments attached to the iceberg and various heaps of broken ice denoted recent shoots of the seaward edge  as we advanced towards it with a view of proceeding close to its base i observed a few little pieces fall from the top and while my eye was fixed upon the place an immense column probably fifty feet square and one hundred and fifty feet high began to leave the parent ice at the top and leaning majestically forward with an accelerated velocity fell with an awful crash into the sea  the water into which it plunged was converted into an appearance of vapour or smoke like that from a furious cannonading  the noise was equal to that of thunder which it nearly resembled  the column which fell was nearly square and in magnitude resembled a church  it broke into thousands of pieces  this circumstance was a happy caution for we might inadvertently have gone to the very base of the icy cliff from whence masses of considerable magnitude were continually breaking  now this incident suggests the probability that had the face of the glacier projected into deep water the mass which broke off might have fallen into the sea without being broken to pieces and might have floated away as a berg  we confess however to be partial to the view expressed by some writers that the great glaciers continue year by year to thrust their thick tongues out to sea until the projecting masses reach water sufficiently deep to float them when they are quietly cracked off from their parent and carried away without any fall or plunge  the following remarks by dr kane will make this more clear writing of the iceberg he says  so far from falling into the sea broken by its weight from the parent glacier it rises from the sea  the process is at once gradual and comparatively quiet  the idea of icebergs being discharged so universal among systematic writers and so recently admitted by myself seems to me at variance with the regulated and progressive action of nature  developed by such a process the thousands of bergs which throng these seas should keep the air and water in perpetual commotion one fearful succession of explosive detonations and propagated waves but it is only the lesser masses falling into deep waters which could justify the popular opinion  the enormous masses of the great glacier of greenland are propelled step by step and year by year until reaching water capable of supporting them they are floated off to be lost in the temperatures of other regions  the height of the icewall at the nearest point was about three hundred feet measured from the waters edge and the unbroken right line of its diminishing perspective showed that this might be regarded as its constant measurement  it seemed in fact a great icy tableland abutting with a clean precipice against the sea  this is indeed characteristic of all those arctic glaciers which issue from central reservoirs or mers de glace upon the fords or bays and is strikingly in contrast with the dependent or hanging glacier of the ravines  elsewhere the same writer speaks of this glacier as a line of cliff rising in a solid glassy wall to a height of three hundred feet above the waterlevel and with an unfathomable depth below it and its curved face sixty miles in length from cape agassiz to cape forbes vanished into unknown space at not more than a single days railroad travel from the pole  the interior with which it communicated and from which it issued was an unsurveyed mer de glace or sea of ice of apparently boundless dimensions and from one part of this great cliff he saw long lines of huge bergs floating slowly away  here we think is ice enough and of sufficient dimensions to account for the largest bergs that were ever beheld  it will be at once seen then that icebergs though found floating in the sea are not necessarily of the sea  they are composed entirely of fresh water and arctic ships can at any time procure a plentiful supply of good soft drinkable water from the pools that are formed in the hollows of the bergs  the risk of approaching icebergs in the arctic regions is not so great as when they are found floating further south because when in their native regions they are comparatively tough whereas on their southern journeys they become more or less disintegratedin fact the blow of an axe is sometimes sufficient to cause a rent which in its turn will induce other rents and failings asunder so that the whole mass runs the risk of being entirely broken up  hence the danger of ships in certain circumstances venturing to anchor to them  nevertheless this is a common practicesometimes a necessityamong discovery ships and whalers  it is a convenient practice too for many a vessel has been saved from absolute destruction by getting under the lee of a good sound iceberg where she has lain as safely for the time being as if in a harbour  when captain mcclure was endeavouring to make the northwest passage in 1851 he was saved from what appeared to be at least very probable destruction by a small iceberg  on the 17th of september he writes  there were several heavy floes in the vicinity  one full six miles in length passed at the rate of two knots crushing everything that impeded its progress and grazed our starboardbow  fortunately there was but young ice upon the opposite side which yielded to the pressure had it otherwise occurred the vessel must inevitably have been cut asunder  in the afternoon we secured to a moderatelysized iceberg drawing eight fathoms which appeared to offer a fair refuge and from which we never afterwards parted  to this lump of ice the ship clung with the tenacity of a bosom friend and followed it literally through thick and thin  there is something almost ludicrous as well as striking in mcclures account of their connection with this bit of ice  it conveyed them to their furthest northeast position and back round the princess royal islandspassed the largest within five hundred yardsreturned along the coast of prince alberts landand finally froze in at latitude 70 degrees 50 minutes north longitude 117 degrees 55 minutes west on the 30th september during which circumnavigation they received many severe nips and were frequently driven close to the shore from which their dear friend the iceberg small though he was kept them off  icebergs assume almost every conceivable form and are seen of every sizesometimes also in great numbers  scoresby mentions one occasion on which he was surrounded by bergs to the number of several hundreds  now all this ice that we have been speaking of besides being in a secondary way a passive agent in the affairs of man chiefly in barring his progress northward is one of the most potent agents in the economy of nature  it is the means by which the world is kept cool enough for man and beast to dwell in  the polar regionsnorth and southare as it were the worlds refrigerators tempering the heated air of the south and in connection with the torrid zone spreading throughout the earth those beneficial influences which gladden the sphere of mans temporal existence    chapter eleven  ice an agent in transporting bouldershow this comes aboutdr kanes observationslong night in winter and long day in summerextreme darknessinfluence on dogsintense coldeffect on the sea  there are many things in this world which up to within a few years back have been to men a source of surprise and mystery  some of these problems have been solved by recent travellers and not a few of them are referable to polar oceans and ice  in many parts of our coasts we find very striking and enormously large boulderstones lying on the beach perfectly isolated and their edges rounded away like pebbles as if they had been rolled on some antediluvian beach strewn with titanic stones  these boulders are frequently found upon the loose sands of the seashore far removed from any rocks or mountains from which they might be supposed to have been broken and more than that totally different in their nature from the geological formations of the districts in which they are found  whence came these has been the question of the inquisitive of all ages and how came they there  there may for aught we know to the contrary be more than one answer to these questions but there is at least one which is quite satisfactory as to how and whence at least some of them have come  ice was the means of conveying these boulders to their present positions  it has been said that once upon a time a large part of this country was under the dominion of ice even as the polar regions and some of the mountains and valleys of norway are at the present day that the boulders we see in elevated places were conveyed thither by glacier action and that when the glacial period passed away they were left there on the hillsidessometimes almost on the mountaintops  but this is not the question we are considering just now  we are now inquiring into the origin of those huge boulders that are found upon our coasts and on the coasts of other landsboulders which could not have rolled down from the hills for there are no hills at all near many of them and those hills that are near some of them are of different geological formation  this question will be answered at once and one of the phenomena of arctic ice and oceanic agency will be exhibited by reference to the recent discoveries of the celebrated arctic voyager dr kane of the american navy  while wintering far beyond the head of baffins bay and beyond the most northerly point in that direction that had at that time been reached by any previous traveller dr kane made many interesting observations and discoveries  he seems to have penetrated deep into the heart of natures northern secrets  among other things he ascertained the manner in which boulders are transported from their northern home  the slow creeping movement of glaciers to which we have already referred is one means whereby large boulders are formed  at the lower edge of one of the glaciers of norway we saw boulders thirty or forty feet in diameter which had been rolled and forced probably for ages down the valley by the glacier and thrust out on the seabeach where they lay with their angles and corners rubbed off and their surfaces rounded and smoothed as completely as those of the pebbles by which they were surrounded  had these boulders been formed in the arctic regions they might have been thrust out upon the thick solid crust of the frozen sea which in time would have been broken off and floated away thus rafting the boulders to other shores  the formation of boulders and their positions are facts that we have seen  their being carried out to sea by icerafts is a fact that dr kane has seen and recorded  on the wild rocky shores where his ship was set fast there was a belt of ice lining the margin of the sea which he termed the icebelt or the icefoot  this belt never melted completely and was usually fast to the shore  in fact it was that portion of the seaice which was left behind each spring when the general body of ice was broken up and swept away  referring to this he writes  the spot at which we landed i have called cape james kent  it was a lofty headland and the landice which hugged its base was covered with rocks from the cliffs above  as i looked over this icebelt losing itself in the far distance and covered with its millions of tons of rubbish greenstones limestones chlorite slates rounded and angular massive and ground to powder its importance as a geological agent in the transportation of drift struck me with great force  its whole substance was studded with these varied contributions from the shore and further to the south upon the now frozen waters of marshall bay i could recognise raft after raft from the last years icebelt which had been caught by the winter each one laden with its heavy freight of foreign material  the water torrents and thaws of summer unite with the tides in disengaging the icebelt from the coast but it is not uncommon for large bergs to drive against it and carry away the growths of many years  i have found masses that had been detached in this way floating many miles out at sealong symmetrical tables two hundred feet long by eighty broad covered with large angular rocks and boulders and seemingly impregnated throughout with detrited matter  these rafts in marshall bay were so numerous that could they have melted as i saw them the bottom of the sea would have presented a more curious study for the geologist than the bouldercovered lines of our middle latitudes  one boulder in particular had had its origin in a valley where rounded fragments of waterwashed greenstone had been poured out by the torrents and frozen into the coastice of the belt  the attrition of subsequent matter had truncated the great eggshaped rock and worn its sides into a striated face whose scratches still indicated the line of waterflow  so then when we next meet with a huge isolated boulder on any of our flat beaches we may gaze at it with additional interest when we reflect that perchance it was carried thither by the ocean countless ages ago from the arctic regions on a gigantic raft of ice after having been at a still more remote period torn from its cliffs by some mighty glacier and slowly rolled and rounded for hundreds of years perhaps down the scarred slopes of its native valley  the primary cause of the intense and prolonged cold of the arctic regions is the shortness of the time during which they are under the influence of the suns rays  for a few months in summer the sun shines brightly but owing to the position of the globe obliquely on the poles  during part of that period it shines at midnight as well as at midday  put during the greater part of the year its beams throw but a feeble light there and for several months in winter there is absolutely no day at allnothing but one long dismal night of darkness that seems as if the bright orb of day had vanished from the heavens for ever  the length of this prolonged day in summer and this dreary night in winter depends of course upon latitude  the length of both increases as we approach the poles  the long daylight in summer is exceedingly delightful  we once saw the sun describe an almost unbroken circle in the sky for many days and nights and had we been a few degrees further north we should have seen it describe an entire circle  as it was it only disappeared for twenty minutes  it set about midnight and in twenty minutes it rose again so that there was no night not even twilight but a bright beautiful blazing day for several weeks together  dr kane describes the midnight sun thus on our road we were favoured with a gorgeous spectacle which hardly any excitement of peril could have made us overlook  the midnight sun came out over the northern crest of the great berg our late fast friend kindling variouslycoloured fires on every part of its surface and making the ice around us one great resplendency of gemworkblazing carbuncles and rubies and molten gold  very different indeed is the aspect of the winter night  let the same authority speak for he had great experience thereof  on december 15th he writes we have lost the last vestige of our midday twilight  we cannot see print and hardly paper  the fingers cannot be counted a foot front the eyes  noonday and midnight are alike and except a vague glimmer on the sky that seems to define the hilloutlines to the south we have nothing to tell us that this arctic world of ours has a sun  in one week more we shall reach the midnight of the year  the influence of this long intense darkness was most depressing  even our dogs although the greater number of them were natives of the arctic circle were unable to withstand it  most of them died from an anomalous form of disease to which i am satisfied the absence of light contributed as much as extreme cold  quoting from his journal he says i am so afflicted with the insomnia of this eternal night that i rise at any time between midnight and noon  i went on deck this morning at five oclock  it was absolutely dark the cold not permitting a swinging lamp there was not a glimmer came to me through the icecrusted windowpanes of the cabin  while i was feeling my way half puzzled as to the best method of steering clear of whatever might be before me two of my newfoundland dogs put their cold noses against my hand and instantly commenced the most exuberant antics of satisfaction it then occurred to me how very dreary and forlorn must these poor animals be at atmospheres 10 degrees above zero indoors and 50 degrees below zero withoutliving in darkness howling at an accidental light as if it reminded them of the moonand with nothing either of instinct or sensation to tell them of the passing hours or to explain the long lost daylight  they shall see the lantern more frequently  yet this state of midnight darkness is not altogether unmitigated there are a few ameliorating influences at work the nature of some of which we will treat of in the next chapter  among others the moon frequently shines there with great brilliancy in winter  dr kane says that in october the moon had reached her greatest northern declination she is a glorious object  sweeping around the heavens at the lowest part of her curve she is still 14 degrees above the horizon  for eight days she has been making her circuit with nearly unvarying brightness it is one of those sparkling nights that bring back the memory of sleighbells and songs and glad communings of hearts in lands that are far away  but despite all the varied and transient beauties of the northern skies in winter the long arctic night is undoubtedly depressing in the extreme  in these regions men speak of being able to read the thermometer on the 7th of november at noonday without a light as being matter for gratulation  the darkness still before them at that time would be of about three months duration and even then they would only get back to a species of twilight  the cold experienced by these navigators of the northern seas is terribly intense  their thermometers have frequently indicated a temperature as low as 75 degrees below zero or 107 degrees of frost on fahrenheits scale  the thermometers of arctic explorers are always filled with spirits of wine as quicksilver freezes at about 40 degrees below zero and is therefore unsuitable  it would be frozen indeed the greater part of the winter  dr kane says at such temperatures chloric ether became solid and carefully prepared chloroform exhibited a granular pellicle on its surface  spirits of naphtha froze at 54 degrees below zero and oil of sassafras at 49 degrees  the oil of wintergreen was in a flocculent state at 56 degrees and solid at 63 degrees  the exhalations from the surface of the body invested the exposed or partially clad parts with a wreath of vapour  the air had a perceptible pungency upon inspiration but i could not perceive the painful sensation which has been spoken of by some siberian travellers  when breathed for any length of time it imparted a sensation of dryness to the airpassages  i noticed that as it were involuntarily we all breathed guardedly with compressed lips  now strange to say this extremely low temperature does not affect the ocean to any great depth  just below the ice in cold such as the above the sea was found to be 29 degrees above zero  no doubt deeper down the temperature was still warmer  we have heard it said that when men chance to fall into the water in cold regions in the depth of winter it feels at first rather warm and agreeable  on scrambling out again however their condition is not enviable for in a few minutes the keen frost causes their garments to become as hard as boards  much light has been thrown on the fact of the existence of under and upper currents in the sea by the phenomena of the arctic regions and some of the questions to which these currents give rise are so interesting that we shall treat of them in a new chapter    chapter twelve  question of an open sea round the polesupper and under currents of the oceancause thereofhabits of the whale as bearing on the question dr kanes discovery of an open sea in the far northnotes on the expeditiona bearhunt  it was long and very naturally supposed that the impenetrable ice of the arctic regions extended to and as it were sealed up the pole  but from time to time philosophic observers of natures laws began to hint their opinion that there is an open ocean around the pole and of late years this opinion has all but been converted into a firm belief  maury remarks that like airlike the bodythe ocean must have a system of circulation for its waters  and an attentive study of the currents of the sea and a close examination of the laws which govern the movements of the waters in their channels of circulation through the ocean will lead us irresistibly to the conclusion that always in summer and winter there must be somewhere within the arctic circle a large body of open water  there is an undercurrent setting from the atlantic northward through davis straits into the arctic ocean and a surfacecurrent setting out  the fact is proved beyond a doubt by the observations of arctic explorers who have seen immense icebergs drifting rapidly northward against a strong current  this apparent anomaly could only be accounted for by the fact that a powerful undercurrent carried them northward and as at least seven times more of these bergs must have been under than above water we can easily understand how the undercurrent acting on the larger mass of each berg had power to carry it against the surfacecurrent  this undercurrent is warm while the uppercurrent is cold  now we know that according to natures laws heated water like heated air rises to the surface and cold water sinks to the bottom  how then comes this warm current to be underneath the cold as soundings have proved it to be  it is owing to the fact that the undercurrent is much salter and therefore heavier despite its warmth than the surfacecurrent which latter being mingled with the drainage and icemasses of the arctic regions is comparatively fresh and therefore light as well as cold  the hot and salt waters of the tropics are carried north by the gulf stream  there are here two counteracting agents at work  heat inclines the gulf stream to rise saltness inclines it to sink  during the first part of its journey as we know its great heat prevails over the other influence and it flows as a surfacecurrent  but at a certain point in its northward route it meets with the cold brackish icebearing currents that flow out of the arctic basin  having lost much of its heat though still possessing a great deal more than the arctic currents the saltness of the gulf stream prevails it dips below the polar waters and thenceforth continues its course as an undercurrent salt and comparatively warm  to state the matter briefly the hot water which ought to keep on the surface because of its heat is sunk by its superabundant salt and the cold water which ought to sink because of its cold is buoyed on the surface because of its want of salt  now arises the questionwhat becomes of the great quantity of salt that is thus being carried perpetually into the polar basin  manifestly it must be carried out again by the surfacecurrent otherwise the polar basin would of necessity become a basin of salt  the undercurrent must therefore rise to the surface somewhere near the pole with its temperature necessarily only a little if at all below the freezingpointwhich be it observed is a warm temperature for such regions  here then where the warm waters from the south rise to the surface it is supposed this open arctic ocean must exist  so much for theory  now for facts that have been observed and that tend more or less to corroborate this proposition of an open polar sea  the habits of the whale have gone far to prove it  the logbooks of whalers have for many years been carefully examined and compared by scientific men  these investigations have led to the discovery that the tropical regions of the ocean are to the right whale as a sea of fire through which he cannot pass and into which he never enters  it has also been ascertained that the same kind of whale which is found off the shores of greenland in baffins bay etcetera is found in the north pacific and about behrings straits and that the right whale of the southern hemisphere is a different animal from that of the northern  how then came the greenland whales to pass from the greenland seas to the pacific  not by the capes horn or good hope the sea of fire precluded that  clearly there was ground here for concluding that they did so through the supposed open sea lying beyond or rather within the frozen ocean  it is true the objection might be made that the same kind of whale which exists in the north pacific exists also in the north atlantic although they never cross over to see each other  but another discovery has met this objection  it is the custom among whalers to have their harpoons marked with date and name of ship and dr scoresby in his work on arctic voyages mentions several instances of whales having been taken near behrings straits with harpoons in them bearing the stamp of ships that were known to cruise in the greenland seas and the dates on the harpoons were so recent as to preclude the supposition that the said whales had after being struck made a voyage round the capes above mentionedeven were such a voyage possible to them  all this does not indeed absolutely prove the existence of an open arctic sea but it does we think prove the existence of at least an occasionally open sea there for it is well known that whales cannot travel such immense distances under ice  but the most conclusive evidence that we have in regard to this subject is the fact that one of the members of dr kanes expedition while in search of sir john franklin did actually on foot reach what we have every reason to believe was this open sea but not being able to get their ship into it the party had no means of exploring it or extending their investigations  the account of this discovery is so interesting and withal so romantic that we extract a few paragraphs relating to it from kanes work  after spending the dreary winter in the icelocked and unexplored channels beyond the head of baffins bay kane found his little ship still hopelessly beset in the month of june he therefore resolved to send out a sledgeparty under morton one of his best men to explore the channel to the north of their position  after twelve days travelling they came to the base of the great glacier where morton left his party and in company with an esquimaux named hans set out with a dogsledge to prosecute the journey of exploration  they walked on the seaice in a line parallel with the glacier and proceeded twentyeight miles that day although the snow was kneedeep and soft  at the place where they encamped a crack enabled them to measure the ice  it was seven feet five inches thick  and this in june  we may mention here in passing that dr kane never got his vessel out of that frozen strait which seems to be bound by perpetual ice  he and his party escaped with their lives but the vessel that bore them thither is probably still embedded in that ice  next day morton and hans came to a region of icebergs which had arrested a previous sledgingparty of the same expedition  these icebergs were generally very high evidently newly separated from the glacier  their surfaces were fresh and glassy and not like those generally met with in baffins bayless worn and bluer and looking in all respects like the face of the great glacier  many were rectangular some of them regular squares a quarter of a mile each way others more than a mile long  to pass amidst these bergs was a matter of labour difficulty and danger  sometimes the sides of them came so close together that the men could scarcely squeeze between them and they were obliged to search for other passages in doing which the variation of their compass confused them  at other times a tolerably wide passage would appear between two bergs which they would gladly follow then a narrower one then no opening in front but one to the side  following that a little distance a blank icecliff would close the way altogether and they were forced to retrace their steps and begin again  thus they puzzled their way through like a blind man in the streets of a strange city but more difficulties awaited them beyond  after advancing many miles they were arrested by broad rents in the ice and were obliged to diverge frequently far out of their course or to bridge the chasms over by cutting down the ice hummocks and filling them up with loose ice until the dogs were able to haul the provisionsledge over  advancing thus for several days and encamping on the snow at night they at last came to a spot where the ice was dangerous  it was weak and rotten and the dogs began to tremble  proceeding at a brisk rate they had got upon unsafe ice before they were aware of it  their course was at the time nearly up the middle of the channel but as soon as possible they turned and by a backward circuit reached the shore  the dogs as their fashion is at first lay down and refused to proceed trembling violently  the only way to induce the terrified obstinate brutes to get on was for hans to go to a whitelooking spot where the ice was thicker the soft stuff looking dark then calling the dogs coaxingly by name they would crawl to him on their bellies  so they retreated from place to place until they reached the firm ice they had quitted  a half mile brought them to comparatively safe ice a mile more to good ice again  in the midst of this danger they had during the liftings of the fog sighted open water  soon after they saw it plainly  so many long and dreary months had these men passed since they were gladdened by the sight of open water that they could scarcely believe their eyes and morton declared that but for the birds which were seen flying about it in great numbers he would not have believed it  they made for the landice as fast as possible and quickly gained it but the seaice had cracked off and sunk so much that the landice presented a wall along the whole coast of about eight or nine feet high it was quite perpendicular in some places overhanging so that it was a matter of the greatest difficulty they managed to throw up the provisions clamber up themselves and haul the dogs and sledge up afterwards  this accomplished however they were safe and could advance with confidence  but this mass of landice became narrower as they proceeded till at last it dwindled to a mere narrow ledge clinging to the high perpendicular cliffs and looking as if at any moment it might crumble off and fall with them into the open water between it and the floating seaice  the sea here was very deep and clear  they could see the bottom quite plainly although a stone they cast in the size of a mans head took twentyeight seconds to reach it  being now afraid of the iceledge they attempted to find a path along the face of the cliff but failing in this morton determined to leave part of the provisions in cache and proceed with a lighter load the cape round which they were travelling and on the other side of which lay the open water was extremely bold and the iceledge at the end of it was barely three feet wide so they were obliged to unloose the dogs and drive them forward alone then tilted the sledge on one runner and thus pushed it past the worst place  here the ice on the sea was partly broken up and a strong tide was running from the southward  the night before it had been running from the north  as they advanced the channel became still more open and after passing the cape they saw nothing but open water with innumerable wild seabirds of every description flying overhead or disporting in the pools  let it by observed here however that this was the open water of a strait or channelnot the great arctic sea about the probable existence of which we have been writing  upon the icemasses near them numerous seals were seen basking  one thing that struck them much here was that although strong north winds amounting to a gale at times had been blowing for several days no ice had been brought down from the north into the channel along the shore of which they travelled  thick damp fogs prevailed preventing them from seeing far in advance at any time  at last they came to a place where the broken ice of the shore rendered passage for the sledge impossible  they therefore tied the dogs intending to push forward a short way alone  but they had not been sufficiently careful to secure them for the poor animals supposing themselves deserted no doubt succeeded in breaking their lines and rejoined the two men in about an hour after  this as it turned out was rather a fortunate circumstance  preparatory to quitting their sledge the men had loaded themselves with eight pounds of pemmican and two of biscuit besides the artificial horizon sextant and compass a rifle and a boathook  they had not been an hour gone when as above stated four of the dogs overtook them an hour afterwards they came upon a polar bear with her cub  the fight that followed although somewhat foreign to our subject is so graphically described by dr kane that we think it quite unnecessary to apologise for inserting it here  the bear instantly took to flight but the little one being unable to keep pace with her she turned back and putting her head under its haunches threw it some distance  the cub safe for the moment she would then wheel round and face the dogs so as to give it a chance to run away but it always stopped just as it alighted till she came up and threw it ahead again it seemed to expect her aid and would not go on without it  sometimes the mother would run a few yards ahead as if to coax the young one up to her and when the dogs came up she would turn and drive them back then as they dodged her blows she would rejoin the cub and push on sometimes putting her head under it sometimes catching it in her mouth by the nape of the neck  for a time she managed her retreat with great celerity leaving the two men far in the rear  they had engaged her on the landice but she led the dogs inshore up a small stony valley which opened into the interior  after she had gone a mile and a half her pace slackened and the little one being jaded she soon came to a halt  the men were then only half a mile behind and running at full speed they soon came up to where the dogs were holding her at bay  the fight was now a desperate one  the mother never went more than two yards ahead constantly looking at the cub  when the dogs came near her she would sit upon her haunches and take the little one between her hindlegs fighting the dogs with her paws and roaring so that she could have been heard a mile off  never was an animal more distressed she would stretch her neck and snap at the nearest dog with her shining teeth whirling her paws like the arms of a windmill  if she missed her aim not daring to pursue one dog lest the others should harm the cub she would give a great roar of baffled rage and go on pawing and snapping and facing the ring grinning at them with her mouth stretched wide  when the men came up the little one was perhaps rested for it was able to turn round with its dam no matter how quick she moved so as to keep always in front of her belly  the five dogs were all the time frisking about her actively tormenting her like so many gadflies  indeed they made it difficult to take an aim at her without killing them  but hans lying on his elbow took a quiet aim and shot her through the head she dropped and rolled over dead without moving a muscle  the dogs sprang towards her at once but the cub jumped upon her body and reared up for the first time growling hoarsely  they seemed quite afraid of the little creature she fought so actively and made so much noise and while tearing mouthfuls of hair from the dead mother they would spring aside the minute the cub turned towards them  the men drove the dogs off for a time but were obliged to shoot the cub at last as she would not quit the body  hans fired into her head  it did not reach the brain though it knocked her down but she was still able to climb on her mothers body and try to defend it her mouth bleeding like a gutterspout  they were obliged to despatch her with stones  after skinning the old one they gashed its body and the dogs fed upon it ravenously  the little one they cached for themselves against their return  this little fight quite knocked up hans the esquimaux morton therefore advanced alone in the hope of being able to get beyond a huge cape that lay before him  on reaching it the grand sight of an apparently boundless ocean of open water met his eye  only four or five small pieces of ice were seen on the glancing waves of this hitherto unknown sea  viewed from the cliffs writes dr kane and taking thirtysix miles as the mean radius open to reliable survey this sea had a justlyestimated extent of more than 4000 square miles  here then in all probability is the great arctic ocean that has been supposed to exist in a perpetually fluid state round the pole encircled by a ring of ice that has hitherto presented an impenetrable barrier to all the adventurers of ancient and modern times  there were several facts connected with this discovery that go far to prove that this ocean is perpetually open  further south where dr kanes brig lay in ice that seemed never to melt there were few signs of animal lifeonly a seal or two now and then but here on the margin of this far northern sea were myriads of waterfowl of various kinds  the brent goose writes the doctor had not been seen before since entering smiths strait  it is well known to the polar traveller as a migratory bird of the american continent  like the others of the same family it feeds upon vegetable matter generally on marine plants with their adherent molluscan life  it is rarely or never seen in the interior and from its habits may be regarded as singularly indicative of open water  the flocks of this bird easily distinguished by their wedgeshaped line of flight now crossed the water obliquely and disappeared over the land to the northeast  the rocks on shore were crowded with seaswallows birds whose habits require open water and they were already breeding  the gulls were represented by no less than four species  the kittiwakesreminding morton of old times in baffins baywere again stealing fish from the water probably the small whiting and their grim cousins the burgomasters enjoying the dinner thus provided at so little cost to themselves  it was a picture of life all round  here for the first time morton noticed the arctic petrela fact which shows the accuracy of his observation though he had not been aware of its importance  this bird had not been met with since we left the north water of the english whalers more than two hundred miles south of the position on which he stood  its food is essentially marine and it is seldom seen in numbers except in the highways of open water frequented by the whale and the larger representatives of ocean life  they were in numbers flitting and hovering over the crests of the waves like their relatives of kinder climatesthe cape of good hope pigeons mother careys chickens and the petrels everywhere else  it must have been an imposing sight as morton stood at this termination of his journey looking out upon the great waste of waters before him  not a speck of ice could be seen  there from a height of 480 feet which commanded a horizon of almost forty miles his ears were gladdened with the novel music of dashing waves and a surf breaking in among the rocks at his feet stayed his further progress  strong presumptive evidence all this that there is an ocean of open water round the pole and a milder climate there than exists nearer to the arctic circle  had the short barrier of ice that intervened between the brig and that mysterious sea been removed as perchance it is sometimes removed by a hot summer dr kane might have been the first to reach the north pole  this however is reserved for some other navigator  the gallant kane now lies in an early grave but some of his enterprising comrades have returned to those regions bent on solving this problem and it is possible that even while we now write their adventurous keel may be ploughing the waters of the hitherto untraversed and mysterious polar sea    chapter thirteen  miscellaneous phenomena of the polar seas and regionsthe aurora borealisiceblinkoptical illusionsanecdote of scoresbyhaloes coronaemock sunsrefractionfrosts  owing to the intensity of the cold in the arctic regions there are as we may readily believe many singular appearances connected with the ocean and the atmosphere which are worthy of special notice  chief perhaps among the phenomena of those regions is the aurora borealis  ever mindful of the welfare of the creatures whom he has formed the almighty has appointed a light to mitigate the darkness of the polar regions when the sun in its appointed course withdraws for a season  what the aurora borealis is no one knows although many have hazarded opinions regarding it  what it is like is known even to ourselves though the faint indications of it which sometimes seen in our own heavens are not to be compared to the brilliancy of the spectacle that is occasionally presented in the northern skies  the most ordinary aspect of the aurora is that of a band of palegreen light extending irregularly over part of the sky and marked by wavy motions as well as by varying brightness  sometimes one part of this band becomes more bright than another part  sometimes the whole seems to move gently like the undulations of a flag in a light breeze at other times more vigorous action takes place and pointed tongues of light shoot vividly up into the zenith  this sometimes takes place so frequently and the tongues are so long and numerous that the aurora has been popularly termed the northern streamers  although palegreen is the most frequent colour the aurora borealis has often been observed with blue and red hues and the sky has been seen suffused with an intense crimson colour by it  captains parry and lyon saw these northern lights in full splendour during their residence in the arctic regions  they tell us that the aurora had a tendency to form an irregular arch which in calm weather was very often distinct though its upper boundary was seldom well defined but whenever the air was agitated showers of rays spread in every direction with the rapidity of lightning but always appearing to move to and from a fixed point somewhat like a ribbon held in the hand and shaken with an undulatory motion  no rule however could be traced in the movement of those lighter parcels called the merry dancers which flew about perpetually towards every quarter becoming in stormy weather more rapid in their motions and sharing all the wildness of the blast  they gave an indescribable air of magic to the whole scene and made it not wonderful that by the untaught indian they should be viewed as the spirits of his fathers roaming through the land of souls  we are told by some that the aurora borealis is accompanied by a loud hissing and crackling sound and captain lyon says that the sudden glare and rapid bursts of those wondrous showers of fire make it difficult to believe that their movements are wholly without sound  yet such would seem to be the case for the same authority tells us that he stood on the ice for hours listening intently and could hear nothing  he was thoroughly convinced that no sound proceeds from the aurora and most intelligent voyagers support him in this opinion  that the aurora dims the lustre of the stars seen through it is a fact which was ascertained clearly by the same gentleman and that it moves in a region beyond the clouds is also evident from the fact that when the latter covered the sky the aurora disappeared  but some of the most singular appearances of the sea and sky in the polar regions are presented in summer  during that season the perpetual presence of the sun and the large tracts of ice floating about on the sea exert their opposing influences so as to produce the most astonishing results  one part of the sea being covered with ice produces a cold atmosphere another part being free from ice produces a warmer atmosphere refraction is the result of viewing objects through those different media and very curious appearances follow  when scoresby was in greenland a singular atmospheric phenomenon occurred whereby he became aware of the approach of his fathers ship some time before it rose above the horizon  he had reached greenland before his father who followed him in the fame  the following is his account of the circumstance  on my return to the ship about eleven oclock the night was beautifully fine and the air quite mild  the atmosphere in consequence of the warmth being in a highly refractive state a great many curious appearances were presented by the land and icebergs  the most extraordinary effect of this state of the atmosphere however was the distinct inverted image of a ship in the clear sky over the middle of the large bay or inlet the ship itself being entirely beyond the horizon  appearances of this kind i have before noticed but the peculiarities of this were the perfection of the image and the great distance of the vessel that it represented  it was so extremely well defined that when examined with a telescope i could distinguish every sail the general rig of the ship and its peculiar character insomuch that i confidently pronounced it to be my fathers ship the fame which it afterwards proved to be though on comparing notes with my father i found that our relative positions at the time gave our distance from one another very nearly thirty miles being about seventeen miles beyond the horizon and some leagues beyond the line of direct vision  scoresby was perhaps one of the most persevering and intelligent observers of nature that ever went to the polar seas  his various accounts of what he saw are most interesting  we cannot do better than quote his remarks upon iceblink that curious appearance of white light on the horizon whereby voyagers are led to infer the presence of ice  this appearance of the iceblink says he occurred on the 13th of june 1820 in latitude 76 degrees north  the sky aloft was covered with dense uniform hazy cloud which indeed occupied the whole of the heavens excepting a portion near the horizon where it seemed to be repelled  the upper white blink referred to ice about six miles distant being beyond the horizon the narrow yellowish portions referred to floes and compact ice the lowest yellow blink which in brightness and colour resembled the moon was the reflection of a field at the distance of thirty miles to which directed by the blink we made way in the baffin through the channels of water represented in the sky by bluishgrey streaks  the field we found to be a sheet of ice 150 miles in circumference  another very singular appearance observed occasionally in foggy weather is a series of bright circles or coronae surrounding the heads or persons of individuals in certain positions  we have while standing at the masthead of a vessel in hudsons straits observed our own shadow thrown on the sea with a bright halo round it  the day was bright and hazy at the time  referring to a particular case of this kind scoresby says  during the month of july 1820 the weather being often foggy with a bright sun sometimes shining at the height of the day some extraordinary coronae were observed from the masthead  these occurred opposite to the sun the centre of all the circles being in a line drawn from the sun through the eye of the observer  on one occasion four coloured luminous circles were observed  the exterior one might be twenty degrees in diameter  it exhibited all the colours of the spectrum  the next a little within it was of a whitishgrey colour the third was only four or five degrees in diameter and though it exhibited the colours of the spectrum these colours were not very brilliant  the fourth was extremely beautiful and brilliant  the interior colour was yellow then orange red violet etcetera  the colours of the whole three coronae were i think in the same order but of this i am not very certain  indeed on reflection i suspect that the second circle must have been in the reverse order of the first the first and the fourth being the same  the third was not coloured  in the midst of these beautiful coronae i observed my own shadow the head surrounded by a glory  all the coronae were evidently produced by the fog my shadow was impressed on the surface of the sea  the cause of these phenomena is the reflection of the suns rays decomposed by different refractions in minute globules of water of which the mist wherein the coronae occur in a great measure appears to consist  mock suns or parhelia are common appearances in northern skies sometimes two of these mock suns are seen one on each side of their great original glowing so brightly that either of them if we could suppose it to have shone in the sky alone would have made a very respectable sun indeed  even four of these sundogsas they are some times calledhave been seen surrounding the sun one on each side of it one directly above and one immediately below with a ring of light connecting them together a streak of light passing horizontally and another passing perpendicularly between them thus forming a luminous cross in the centre of which was the sun itself  this magnificent spectacle is sometimes enhanced by a second circle of light enclosing the whole and the edges of several outer circles springing in faint light therefrom until gradually lost leaving the imagination to call up the idea of an endless series of glories extending over the whole sky  refraction frequently causes grotesque as well as wonderful and beautiful appearances  ships are sometimes seen with their hulls flattened and their masts and sails drawn out to monstrous dimensions or the hulls are heightened so as to appear like heavy castle walls while the masts and sails are rendered ludicrously squat and disproportioned and not only so but ships are often seen with their images inverted over their own masts so that to the observer it appears as if one ship were balancing another upside downmasthead to masthead  land and icebergs assume the same curious appearancespeaks touching peaks one set pointing upwards the other set pointing down while the broad bases are elevated in the air  at other times the whole mass of land and ice on the horizon is more or less broken up and scattered about as if in confusion yet with a certain amount of regularity in the midst of it all arising from the fact of every object being presented in duplicate sometimes triplicate and occasionally though seldom fourfold  when sharp sudden frosts occur in those regions the splendour of the scenery is still further enhanced by the formation of innumerable minute crystals which sparkle literally with as much lustrous beauty as the diamond  on one occasion scoresbys ship was decorated with uncommon magnificence and in a peculiarly interesting manner  in the course of the night he writes the rigging of the ship was most splendidly decorated with a fringe of delicate crystals  the general form of these was that of a feather having half of the vane removed  near the surface of the ropes was first a small direct line of very white particles constituting the stem or shaft of the feather and from each of these fibres in another plane proceeded a short delicate range of spiculae or rays discoverable only by the help of a microscope with which the elegant texture and systematic construction of the feather were completed  many of these crystals possessing a perfect arrangement of the different parts corresponding with the shaft vane and rachis of a feather were upwards of an inch in length and threefourths of an inch in breadth  some consisted of a single flake or feather but many of them gave rise to other feathers which sprang from the surface of the vane at the usual angle  there seemed to be no limit to the magnitude of these feathers so long as the producing cause continued to operate until their weight because so great or the action of the wind so forcible that they were broken off and fell in flakes to the deck of the ship  it is impossible for the mind to conceive the effect of such a galaxy of curious and bright and eminently beautiful combinations as are sometimes displayed in the arctic regions  none of the fabulous conceptions of man even though profoundly elaborated and brightly gilded with the coruscations of the most sparkling genius and fancy ever produced so gorgeous a spectacle as may be witnessed there every summer day  four or five suns in the blue sky with lines and circles of light shooting from or circling round them  ice in all its quaint majestic and shining forms rendered still more quaint and grand by the influence of refraction and by the same power ships sailing in the sky sometimes as if natures laws were abrogated with their keels upwards and their masts pointing to the sea  walls of pure ice hundreds of feet high many miles in extent clear as crystal and sending back the rays of heavens luminaries in broad blazing beams while the icebergs pinnacles reflect them in sparkling points  white luminous fogs like curtains of gauze too thin to dim the general brightness yet dense enough to invest the whole scene with a silver robe of mystery and to refract the light and compel it to shine in great circles of prismatic colours  and everythingfrom the nature of the materials of which the gay scenery is composedeither white or blue varying in all gradations from the fairest snow to the deepest azure save where the rainbows delicate hues are allowed to intermingle enough of pink yellow purple orange and green to relieve the eye and enable it more fully to appreciate the virgin drapery of the scene  all this seen in detailseen frequently in rapid successionsometimes seen almost all at one momentall this is absolutely beyond conception and utterly beyond adequate description  yet all this is seen at times in those realms of ice and snow which are as we have already said too much represented as the gloomy forbidding inhospitable polar regions  there are two sides to every picture  we take leave of this particular branch of our sun with the remark that if the shady side of the far north is dreadfully dark and dreary its bright side is intensely brilliant and beautiful    chapter fourteen  animal life in the seamedusaefood of the whalephosphoric light cause thereofluminosity of the ocean  reference has elsewhere been made in this volume to the immense amount of animal life that exists in the ocean not only in the form of fish of all sizes but in that of animalcules which although scarcely visible to the naked eye are in some cases so innumerable as to give a distinct colouring to the water  the medusae or more familiarly sea blubbers are seen in the waters that lave our own shores  they are of various sizes from that of a large plate to a pinhead  they are almost colourless like clear jelly and when carelessly observed seem to be dead objects drifting with the tide but a closer observation shows that they are possessed of life though not of a particularly active kind and that they swim by alternate contractions and expansions of their bodies  these creatures constitute a large part of the whales food  some of them are flat some semiglobular others are bellshaped while some have got little heads and small fins  of these last it is said that each little creature has no fewer than three hundred and sixty thousand minute suckers on its head with which it seizes its prey  when we think of the exceeding smallness of the creatures thus preyed upon and consider the fact that each little thing must obtain food by making war upon some creatures still smaller than itself we are led almost in spite of ourselves into that mysteriously metaphysical questioninfinitesimal divisibility which may be translated thusthe endless division and subdivision of atoms  this subject has puzzled the heads of the profoundest philosophers of all ages we will not therefore puzzle our readers with it any further  scoresby tells us that the colour of the greenland sea varies from ultramarine blue to olivegreen from the purest transparency to striking opacity and that these colours are permanent and do not depend on the state of the weather but on the quality of the water  he observed that whales were found in much greater numbers in the green than in the blue water and he found on examining the former with the microscope that its opacity and its colour were due to countless multitudes of those animalcules on which the whale feeds  we need scarcely remark that it is utterly beyond the power of man to form anything approaching to a correct conception of the amount of life that is thus shown to exist in the ocean  although it has pleased the creator to limit our powers yet it has also pleased him to leave the limit of those powers undefined  we may not indeed ever hope in this life to attain to perfect knowledge nevertheless by searching we may find out wisdom and certain it is that although there undoubtedly must be a point of knowledge on any given subject which man cannot reach there is in man a power incessantly to extend his knowledge and increase his powers of conception by each successive effort that he makes in his course from the cradle to the grave  even although we were told the exact number of the little creatures that inhabit the sea we could not by any simple effort of the mind however powerful form a conception of what that number implied  we might shut ourselves up like the hermits of old abstract our thoughts from all other things and ponder the subject for weeks or months together and at the termination of our effort we should be as wise as we were at its commencement but no wiser  but by searching round the subject and comparing lesser things with greater although we should still fail to arrive at a full comprehension of the truth we may advance our powers of conception very considerably beyond the point attained by our first effort and which point as we have said could not be surmounted by a hairs breadth by the mere exertion of simple or abstract thought  dr scoresbys remarks on the subject of animal life in the ocean are so graphic and curious that we extract the passages verbatim from the admirable memoir of that gentleman written by his nephew  he says  i procured a quantity of snow from a piece of ice that had been washed by the sea and was greatly discoloured by the decomposition of some peculiar substance upon it  a little of this snow dissolved in a wineglass appeared perfectly nebulousthe water being found to contain a great number of semitransparent spherical substances with others resembling small portions of fine hair  on examining these substances with a compound microscope i was enabled to make the following observations  the semitransparent globules appeared to consist of an animal of the medusa kind  it was from onetwentieth to onethirtieth of an inch in diameter  its surface was marked with twelve distinct patches or nebulae of dots of a brownish colour  these dots were disposed in pairs four pairs or sixteen pairs alternately composing one of the nebula  the body of the medusa was transparent  when the water containing these animals was heated it emitted a very strong odour in some respects resembling the smell of oysters when thrown on hot coals but much more offensive  the fibrous or hairlike substances were more easily examined being of a darker colour  they varied in length from a point to onetenth of an inch and when highly magnified were found beautifully moniliform whether they were living animals and possessed of locomotion i could not ascertain  they possessed the property of decomposing light and in some cases showed all the colours of the spectrum very distinctly  i afterwards examined the different qualities of sea water and found these substances very abundant in that of an olivegreen colour and also occurring but in lesser quantity in the bluishgreen water  the number of medusae in the olivegreen water was found to be immense they were about onefourth of an inch asunder  in this proportion a cubic inch of water must contain 64 a cubic foot 110592 a cubic fathom 23887872 and a cubic mile about 23888000000000000  of course we have in the last two numbers reached the utterly incomprehensible but dr scoresby goes into comparisons which help us a little at least to ascertain how hopelessly beyond our conceptions such numbers are  from soundings made in the situation where these animals were found it is probable the sea is upwards of a mile in depth but whether these substances occupy the whole depth is uncertain  provided however the depth to which they extend be but two hundred and fifty fathoms the above immense number of one species may occur in the space of two miles square  it may give a better conception of the amount of medusae in this extent if we calculate the length of time that would be requisite with a certain number of persons for counting this number  allowing that one person could count a million in seven days which is barely possible it would have required that eighty thousand persons should have started at the creation of the world to complete the enumeration at the present time  what a stupendous idea this gives of the immensity of creation and of the bounty of divine providence in furnishing such a profusion of life in a region so remote from the habitations of men  the larger portion of these medusae consisting of transparent substances of a lemonyellow colour and globular form appeared to possess very little power of motion  some of them were seen advancing by a slight waving motion at the rate of a hundred and eightieth of an inch in a second and others spinning round with considerable celerity gave great interest and liveliness to the examination  but the progressive motion of the most active however distinct and rapid it might appear under a high magnifying power was in reality extremely slow for it did not exceed an inch in three minutes  at this rate they would require one hundred and fiftyone days to travel a nautical mile  the vastness of their numbers and their exceeding minuteness are circumstances discovered in the examination of these animalcules of uncommon interest  in a drop of water examined by a power of 28224 magnified superficies there were fifty in number on an average in each square of the micrometer glass of an eight hundred and fortieth of an inch and as the drop occupied a circle on a plate of glass containing 529 of these squares there must have been in this single drop of water taken out of the yellowishgreen sea in a place by no means the most discoloured about 26450 animalcules  hence reckoning sixty drops to a dram there would be a number in a gallon of water exceeding by one half the amount of the population of the whole globe it gives a powerful conception of the minuteness and wonders of creation when we think of more than twentysix thousand animals living obtaining subsistence and moving perfectly at their ease without annoyance to one another in a single drop of water  a whale requires a sea an ocean to sport in  about one hundred and fifty millions of these animalcules would have abundant room in a tumbler of water  but besides furnishing food to the whale and no doubt to many other of the inhabitants of the deep those medusae are the cause of the phosphorescent light that sometimes glows on the ocean with resplendent brilliancy  we see this light oftentimes on our own coasts  it is usually of a pale bluishwhite colour more or less intense apparently according to the condition of the creatures by which it is emitted  it can only be seen at night  we have seen it on the west coast of scotland so bright that the steamer in which we sailed left behind her what appeared to be a broad highway of liquid fire  at times it requires vigorous motion such as takes place when an oar is dipped a stone thrown or paddlewheels dashed into the water but at other times the mere motion of the ocean swell even in calm weather is sufficient to stir up the lambent light and cause the crest of every undulation to glitter as if tipped with burnished silver  in such circumstances we have seen the ends of the oars of a boat silvered with it when lifted out of the wave and the drops which fell from them before being redipped resembled the most beautiful diamonds  mr ph gosse in his interesting work the ocean gives the following account of this luminosity of the sea as witnessed by himself on one occasion  in a voyage to the gulf of mexico i saw the water in those seas more splendidly luminous than i had ever observed before  it was indeed a magnificent sight to stand on the forepart of the vessel and watch her breasting the waves  the mass of water rolled from her bows as white as milk studded with those innumerable sparkles of blue light  the nebulosity instantly separated into small masses curdled like clouds of marbles leaving the water between of its own clear blackness the clouds soon subsided but the sparks remained  sometimes one of these points of greater size and brilliancy than the rest suddenly burst into a small cloud of superior whiteness to the mass and be then lost in it  the curdling of the milky appearance into clouds and masses and its quick subsidence were what i had never before observed elsewhere  many scientific travellers have carefully examined this subject and we believe that all agree in referring this beautiful appearance to the medusae  one gentleman drew a bucketful of water from the sea when it was in this condition and found on examining it in a dark place that the little creatures could be distinctly seen emitting a bright speck of light  sometimes this was like a sudden flash at others appearing like an oblong or round luminous point which continued bright for a short time like a lamp lit beneath the water and moving through it still possessing its definite shape and then suddenly disappearing when the bucket was sharply struck on the outside there would appear at once a great number of these luminous bodies which retained their brilliant appearance for a few seconds and then all was dark again they evidently appeared to have it under their own will giving out their light frequently at various depths in the water without any agitation being given to the bucket  at times might be seen minute but pretty bright specks of light darting across a piece of water and then vanishing the motion of the light being exactly that of the cyclops through the water  upon removing a tumblerful from the bucket and taking it to the light a number of cyclops were accordingly found swimming and darting about in it  we have given the above quotation at full length because it proves in an interesting manner the fact that phosphorescence or luminosity of the sea is actually produced by multitudes of living creatures  we cannot pass from it however without expressing our difference of opinion in regard to the power of the medusae to emit their light at will  it seems much more probable that the light is the result of passion and action  when a mans feelings are strongly roused whether pleasurably or otherwise he usually starts into action under a sudden impulse which sends the blood violently through his veins causing his face to become flushed and red  this reddening is not the result of will  it is the unavoidable result of passionate impulse and could not possibly be produced by an effort of the will  it is well known that electric fluid permeates the bodies of all animals more or less and it is quite conceivable that under the influence of nervous impulse one creature should become luminous while another only becomes red  man leaps and sings for joy and the result is that the actions cause his countenance to glow with colour  the marine animalcule experiencing a sudden influx of delight darts hither and thither under the strong impulse of its exuberant glee and the result is that its little body gleams with light  vigorous action is the direct cause of the emission of light in the one case just as vigorous action is the direct cause of the suffusion of the countenance in the other  but in both cases the primary cause is passionat least so it seems to us  no doubt fear as well as joy may create vigorous action and produce the same result but as we know that as a general rule there is much more of joy than of fear dwelling at all times in the hearts of gods creatures we can well believe that the amount of luminosity produced in the sea by the latter passion is immeasurably smaller than that produced by the former  we are thus therefore set free to indulge in the pleasing reflection that when we behold that magnificent gleaming of the sea which almost resembles liquid silver reflecting the stars of heaven we are witnessing the frolicsome and joyous gambols of those myriads of little beings to whom the beneficent creator has assigned the ocean as their dwellingplace  the theory which we have ventured to propound in regard to vigorous impulse whether of joy or fear being the cause of eliciting luminosity is supported in some degree by the remark in our last quotation that when the bucket was sharply struck there appeared at once a number of luminous bodies which shone for a few seconds and then disappeared  undoubtedly the poor little things got a fright when their residence was sharply assailed in such an unusual manner their energies were roused and their light emitted  then as they gradually calmed down their light disappeared  we are further told that when a drop of sulphuric acid was put into a tumbler of water several bright flashes were seen  this we venture to think was somewhat similar to the putting of a few drops of brandy and water into the human stomach the usual result of which is as we all know to produce several bright flashes of wit if not of light or of something at least meant to be remarkably luminous  but this luminosity is not entirely confined to the minute creatures of the sea  some fish have the power of emitting light  some species of the shark emit a greenish light and the sunfish is said when seen down in the sea on a dark night to glow like a whitehot cannonball fish when dead and putrid frequently glow in the dark with a truly magnificent light as can be proved by every one who will take the trouble to procure several kinds of fish and keep them for the purpose of proving the fact in a dark closet  of all the minute inhabitants of the deep that which is to our mind the most curious both as to its nature and its stupendous works is the coral insect  this creature is much too important to be dragged in at the tail of a chapter  we will therefore commence its history in a new one    chapter fifteen  coral insects and coral islandspolynesiaoperations of the coral insectgrowth of coral reefs  many of the large and beautiful islands that stud the pacific ocean like emeralds in a field of blue are artificial that is to say they were made by artiststhey were actually built by artisans  these artisans are the coral insects and as they not only affect the face of the sea by raising large islands above it but also in consequence of their labours assist in causing the circulation of the ocean we think they are justly entitled to very special attention  the great archipelago called polynesia covers an area of the pacific nearly 5000 miles in length and not far short of 2000 in breadth  some of the islands of this group are of volcanic origin and some are crystal but by far the greater number are of coral formationthe work of those curious little insects which are so small that they inhabit a dwelling sometimes little larger than a pinpoint  the manner in which these islands are made is to some extent a matter of uncertainty  the most generally received opinion is that the insects fasten round the summit of a submarine mountain and build upwards until they reach the surface of the sea where they die and their labours cease  as however the sea is sometimes unfathomable close to those islands it has been supposed that the submarine islands on which the corallines began to build have gradually subsided and that as they did so the insects always built a little more so as to keep the top of their structures on a level with the sea  above the sea they cannot build  to be washed by the waves is essential to their existence  we do not think this a very satisfactory theory because it supposes a prolonged subsiding of these islands and then an unaccountably sudden stoppage  for although the corallines might continue to build during the whole time of subsidence it were utterly impossible that the coral island with its luxuriant herbage could be formed until that subsidence should have ceased  the manner in which the islands are formed makes this obvious  when the coral reef as it is called reaches the surface it advances no further  soon the action of the waves breaks off the branches of the upper portions of coral which are tossed upon the reef and pulverised into fine sand  this goes on increasing until the island rises a little above the waves  when this happens birds alight there seadrift is carried thither seeds are blown to it by the wind and gradually a few green blades arise  from this little beginning it is easy to conceive the process by which at last a flourishing island springs up  at the same time it is not easy to see how such islands could ever be formed on the supposition that the submarine rocks on which they were founded were perpetually subsiding  but be that as it may we have no difficulty in understanding the fact that the coral insect does build those islands  it possesses the power of secreting the lime held in solution by sea water and depositing the same on the rocks below the waves  the coral rock is the edifice of the coralline  the insect itself is a soft and very minute worm which when washed by the waves thrusts its head out of its tiny little door and spreading abroad its numerous feelers so that it resembles a beautiful little star moves these about as if enjoying itselfthough doubtless it is actually engaged in the process of manufacturing its little atom of coral rock  it is extremely interesting to think of the immense power of union thus exhibited  singly those little creatures could not produce a sufficient result to attract the attention of any creature save such as chanced to come in direct and close contact with its little cell united they have formed vast islands which have become the abode of man and which in the aggregate form no inconsiderable portion of the globe  the consideration of this leads us to perceive that god has ordained that units cannot separately accomplish much and that united effort in order to be successful requires the harmonious action of units  a house divided against itself cannot stand  the innumerable and eminently beautiful isles of the pacific had never stood where they now stand if the curious and separately insignificant little architects that reared them had not wrought unitedly upon a fixed and systematic planeach insect working its utmost from the hour of its birth until that of its death  there are various kinds of coral insects which form varied species of coral rock  some kinds of coral assume the form of rounded masses some are like a branching shrub others are in layers or thin plates and some are shaped like the human brain from which they derive their namebrainstones  these different kinds differ also in colour and thus present a beautiful appearance when seen at the bottom of clear and shallow water  in regard to the rate at which the corallines build their cells there is some diversity of opinionsome asserting that the process is imperceptible while others state as positively that it is rapid  there can be no doubt that some localities and positions are more favourable to the growth of coral than others  dr allan while at madagascar made several experiments to test this  he selected several masses of coral each weighing about ten pounds and of different species  these he placed three feet below the surface of the sea and staked them in to prevent removal  in a little more than six months they were found to have risen nearly to the surface and to have attached themselves to the solid rock  there is also a case mentioned of a ship in the persian gulf which in the course of twenty months had her copper encased with living coral to the thickness of two feet  on the other hand it is asserted and we doubt not with equal truth that many reefs do not seem to increase in size in the course of many years  when a coral reef has reached the surface the formation of an island instantly begins but it necessarily takes a long time ere this island becomes habitable by man  among the first plants that raise their heads to the seabreeze is the graceful cocoanut palm  this tree is exceedingly hardy and is found growing on reefs which are so low that at a distance the trees seem to be standing on the surface of the water indeed many of them spring out of the pure white sand and their roots are washed perpetually by the salt spray  nevertheless the fruit of such trees is sweet and good  coral islands of the kind we have just described seldom rise more than a few feet above the level of the sea but most of them are clothed with luxuriant vegetation  we might easily fill a volume on the subject of the oceans inhabitants small and great but we think the few to which we have made reference is sufficient for the purpose of showing that one set of creatures accounts for that strange luminosity of the ocean which is seen at times in all marine parts of the globe while another set accounts not only for the sudden appearance of coral islands in the sea where no such islands existed in days of old but also partly for that circulation of the waters of the ocean which is absolutely necessary to the wellbeing of all the creatures on this earth  there are other animals in the sea besides medusae which assist in giving luminosity to its waters and there are other insects besides corallines which extract its lime destroy its equilibrium and assist in causing its perpetual motion but the two species which we have described are the best types of the respective classes to which they belong    chapter sixteen  volcanic islandsopinions of the ancientsatlantisinstance of the formation of a volcanic islandconclusion  in the last chapter we described the manner in which a certain class of islands in the south seas are formed in the present we will make a few observations on another class which have sprung up from the bottom of the sea as if by magic under the irresistible influence of fire  there are volcanoes in the sea as well as on the land and these volcanoes have in former times upheaved huge masses of land so as to form large islands while in other cases they have caused islands formerly in existence to subside and disappear  in the writings of the ancients we find reference made to an island which if it ever did exist now exists no longer  it was situated opposite the straits of gibraltar was nearly two hundred miles in length and was called atlantishence the name of the atlantic ocean many believe and with some reason we think that this island was not altogether a myth although much that is said of it is undoubtedly fabulous  plato tells us that it was a large island in the western ocean situated before or opposite to the straits of gades and that out of this island there was an easy passage into some others which lay near a large continent exceeding in bigness all europe and asia  so far plato may have told the truth and from this passage it is conjectured that the existence of the continent of america was known to the ancients  but he goes on immediately after to draw upon his imagination and to tell us that neptune settled on this island and that his posterity dwelt there for a period of nine thousand years in the midst of fertility and abundance  but not content with their ample possessions and prolific soil they went over to africa and europe and even penetrated into asia bent on conquest  passing from this mixture of probable truth and undoubted fable plato then asserts that the island of atlantis finally sank and disappeared this may or may not be true but there is more reason for our crediting the statement than many people would suppose  certain it is that no such island exists at the present time but it is believed by some that the azores which are volcanic in their formation are the summits of the mountain ranges of the atlantis of the ancients  but the best evidence we have of the possible existence of such an island is the fact that in modern times an island has been seen to rise out of the sea and after a time to disappear under the influence of volcanic action  this remarkable event is related by captain tillard an officer of the british navy who saw it on the 12th of june 1811 when approaching the island of st michael  on this occasion smoke was seen to rise from the surface of the sea and soon after showers of cinders to burst forth we cannot do better than give the captains own words as follows  imagine an immense body of smoke rising from the sea the surface of which was marked by the silvery rippling of the waves  in a quiescent state it had the appearance of a circular cloud revolving on the water like a horizontal wheel in various and irregular involutions expanding itself gradually on the lee side when suddenly a column of the blackest cinders ashes and stones would shoot up in the form of a spire at an angle of from ten to twenty degrees from a perpendicular line the angle of inclination being universally to windward  this was rapidly succeeded by a second third and fourth shower each acquiring greater velocity and overtopping the other till they had attained an altitude as much above the level of our eye as the sea was below it  as the impetus with which the several columns were severally propelled diminished and their ascending motion had nearly ceased they broke into various branches resembling a group of pines  these again formed themselves into festoons of white feathery smoke in the most fanciful manner imaginable intermixed with the finest particles of falling ashes which at one time assumed the appearance of innumerable plumes of black and white ostrich feathers surmounting each other at another that of the light wavy branches of a weeping willow  during these bursts the most vivid flashes of lightning continually issued from the densest part of the volcano and the cloud of smoke now ascending to an altitude much above the highest point to which the ashes were projected rolled off in large masses of fleecy clouds gradually expanding themselves before the wind in a direction nearly horizontal and drawing up to them a quantity of waterspouts which formed a most beautiful and striking addition to the general appearance of the scene  such is the description given of this submarine volcano in action and the crater which was thrown up at the time was about twenty feet above the level of the sea  as captain tillard could not however delay his voyage to make further observations at that time the action that subsequently took place is not known but its results were seen shortly afterwards  in about three weeks after the date of his passing the spot captain tillard returned to it and found an island of about a mile in circumference with a height of between two and three hundred feet at its highest point  there was no violent eruption going on although the craters still emitted smoke  he therefore landed and on reaching the largest crater found it to be full of boiling water which overflowed and found its way to the ocean in a river of about six yards in width this island however was not a permanent addition to the worlds archipelago  it sank into the ocean again and disappeared in october of the same year in which it rose  in commencing this little book we set out with the intention of rambling hither and thither among things that relate to the sea without regard to order  we have carried out our intention and now at the close of our task find that the more we listen to the oceans voice the more we find its tale to be interminable though the reverse of uninteresting  in these rambles we have sought to treat chiefly of those scientific facts relating to the sea and the atmospheric ocean which are not so frequently made the subject of books for the young as are the wild and daring deeds of man upon the surface of the mighty deep  it is not sufficient that man should become acquainted with the doings of his fellows on the sea  this is but one branch of general knowledge and a very secondary one compared with that infinitely higher branch which treats of the workings of the almighty in the ocean workings which render it what it isnot merely a means of commercial enterprise for man and a home for fish but also a great purifier and revivifier of the earth and sweetener of the atmosphere  god is the great first cause of all that is and that operates in the universe  it were an act of presumption to inquire into what we may term the first acts of the almightys power  but there is no presumptionon the contrary there is propriety as well as the highest gratification of which the human mind is capablein penetrating through the paths of knowledge up to that first series of second causes which circle like a glory round the fountainhead  we may not put the question how did god create all things out of nothing but all things having been created it is quite legitimate to inquire how the circles of their manifold operations are carried on and in what respect the things that be do affect each other  no book that has of late years issued from the press treats more eloquently and interestingly of such subjects of inquiry than that admirable work of captain maury of the united states navy entitled the physical geography of the sea  much of the substance of what we have written has been culled from the pages of that fascinating volume  but we have merely plucked one or two leaves as it were and presented them to our readers in the hope that they may be tempted by their fragrance to pluck the flower  the mysteries of the atmospheric and aqueous oceans are here treated of fully yet so agreeably that one is frequently apt to fancy one is perusing the pages of romance  in our own little book we have been compelled to skim lightly and in many places to pass over subjects of great interest  as for other subjects connected with the sea of which we may not treat they are innumerable  of the seaweeds that clothe the bottom of the deep with the rich profusion and glowing colours of the gardens of earthof the myriads of animalcules besides those we have mentioned that disport in its waters and fill the abyss with life and lambent fireof the great whales and other huge creatures that revel in its depths and lash its waters in their terrible mightof these and a host of kindred subjects our space forbids our saying more than that the voice of ocean has much to tell us in regard to them and in regard to the provident care of their beneficent creator
