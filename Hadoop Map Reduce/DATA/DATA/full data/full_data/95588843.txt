95588843	the story of a mine   by bret har    udo brachvogel esq  whose clever translations of my writings have helped to introduce me to the favor of his countrymen both here and in germany this little volume is heartily dedicated  bret harte  new york december 1877     the story of a mine     parti    chapter i  who sought it   it was a steep trail leading over the monterey coast range concho was very tired concho was very dusty concho was very much disgusted to conchos mind there was but one relief for these insurmountable difficulties and that lay in a leathern bottle slung over the machillas of his saddle concho raised the bottle to his lips took a long draught made a wry face and ejaculated  carajo  it appeared that the bottle did not contain aguardiente but had lately been filled in a tavern near tres pinos by an irishman who sold had american whisky under that pleasing castilian title nevertheless concho had already nearly emptied the bottle and it fell back against the saddle as yellow and flaccid as his own cheeks thus reinforced concho turned to look at the valley behind him from which he had climbed since noon it was a sterile waste bordered here and there by arable fringes and valdas of meadow land but in the main dusty dry and forbidding his eye rested for a moment on a low white cloud line on the eastern horizon but so mocking and unsubstantial that it seemed to come and go as he gazed concho struck his forehead and winked his hot eyelids was it the sierras or the cursed american whisky  again he recommenced the ascent at times the halfworn halfvisible trail became utterly lost in the bare black outcrop of the ridge but his sagacious mule soon found it again until stepping upon a loose boulder she slipped and fell in vain concho tried to lift her from out the ruin of camp kettles prospecting pans and picks she remained quietly recumbent occasionally raising her head as if to contemplatively glance over the arid plain below then he had recourse to useless blows then he essayed profanity of a secular kind such as assassin thief beast with a pigs head food for the bulls horns but with no effect  then he had recourse to the curse ecclesiastic  ah judas iscariot is it thus renegade and traitor thou leavest me thy master a league from camp and supper waiting stealer of the sacrament get up  still no effect concho began to feel uneasy never before had a mule of pious lineage failed to respond to this kind of exhortation he made one more desperate attempt  ah defiler of the altar lie not there look he threw his hand into the air extending the fingers suddenly behold fiend i exorcise thee ha tremblest look but a little nowsee apostate iiexcommunicate theemula  what are you kicking up such a devil of row down there for said a gruff voice from the rocks above  concho shuddered could it be that the devil was really going to fly away with his mule he dared not look up  come now continued the voice you just let up on that mule you dd old greaser dont you see shes slipped her shoulder  alarmed as concho was at the information he could not help feeling to a certain extent relieved she was lamed but had not lost her standing as a good catholic  he ventured to lift his eyes a strangeran americano from his dress and accentwas descending the rocks toward him he was a slightbuilt man with a dark smooth face that would have been quite commonplace and inexpressive but for his left eye in which all that was villainous in him apparently centered shut that eye and you had the features and expression of an ordinary man cover up those features and the eye shone out like ebliss own nature had apparently observed this too and had by a paralysis of the nerve ironically dropped the corner of the upper lid over it like a curtain laughed at her handiwork and turned him loose to prey upon a credulous world  what are you doing here said the stranger after he had assisted concho in bringing the mule to her feet and a helpless halt  prospecting senor  the stranger turned his respectable right eye toward concho while his left looked unutterable scorn and wickedness over the landscape  prospecting what for  gold and silver senoryet for silver most  alone  of us there are four  the stranger looked around  in campa league beyond explained the mexican  found anything  of thismuch concho took from his saddle bags a lump of greyish iron ore studded here and there with star points of pyrites the stranger said nothing but his eye looked a diabolical suggestion  you are lucky friend greaser  eh  it is silver  how know you this  it is my business im a metallurgist  and you can say what shall be silver and what is not  yessee here the stranger took from his saddle bags a little leather case containing some half dozen phials one enwrapped in darkblue paper he held up to concho  this contains a preparation of silver  conchos eyes sparkled but he looked doubtingly at the stranger  get me some water in your pan  concho emptied his water bottle in his prospecting pan and handed it to the stranger he dipped a dried blade of grass in the bottle and then let a drop fall from its tip in the water the water remained unchanged  now throw a little salt in the water said the stranger  concho did so instantly a white film appeared on the surface and presently the whole mass assumed a milky hue  concho crossed himself hastily mother of god it is magic  it is chloride of silver you darned fool  not content with this cheap experiment the stranger then took conchos breath away by reddening some litmus paper with the nitrate and then completely knocked over the simple mexican by restoring its color by dipping it in the salt water  you shall try me this said concho offering his iron ore to the strangeryou shall use the silver and the salt  not so fast my friend answered the stranger in the first place this ore must be melted and then a chip taken and put in shape like thisand that is worth something my greaser cherub no sir a man dont spend all his youth at freiburg and heidelburg to throw away his science gratuitously on the first greaser he meets  it will costehhow much said the mexican eagerly  well i should say it would take about a hundred dollars and expenses totofind silver in that ore but once youve got it thereyoure all right for tons of it  you shall have it said the now excited mexican you shall have it of usthe four you shall come to our camp and shall melt itand show the silver andenough come and in his feverishness he clutched the hand of his companion as if to lead him forth at once  what are you going to do with your mule said the stranger  true holy motherwhat indeed  look yer said the stranger with a grim smile she wont stray far ill be bound ive an extra pack mule above here you can ride on her and lead me into camp and tomorrow come back for your beast  poor honest conchos heart sickened at the prospect of leaving behind the tired servant he had objurgated so strongly a moment before but the love of gold was uppermost i will come back to thee little one tomorrow a rich man meanwhile wait thou here patient oneadiosthou smallest of mulesadios  and seizing the strangers hand he clambered up the rocky ledge until they reached the summit then the stranger turned and gave one sweep of his malevolent eye over the valley  wherefore in after years when their story was related with the devotion of true catholic pioneers they named the mountain la canada de la visitacion del diablo the gulch of the visitation of the devil the same being now the boundary lines of one of the famous mexican land grants   chapter ii  who found it   concho was so impatient to reach the camp and deliver his good news to his companions that more than once the stranger was obliged to command him to slacken his pace is it not enough you infernal greaser that you lame your own mule but you must try your hand on mine or am i to put jinny down among the expenses he added with a grin and a slight lifting of his baleful eyelid  when they had ridden a mile along the ridge they began to descend again toward the valley vegetation now sparingly bordered the trail clumps of chemisal an occasional manzanita bush and one or two dwarfed buckeyes rooted their way between the interstices of the blackgray rock now and then in crossing some dry gully worn by the overflow of winter torrents from above the grayish rock gloom was relieved by dull red and brown masses of color and almost every overhanging rock bore the mark of a miners pick presently as they rounded the curving flank of the mountain from a rocky bench below them a thin ghostlike stream of smoke seemed to be steadily drawn by invisible hands into the invisible ether it is the camp said concho gleefully i will myself forward to prepare them for the stranger and before his companion could detain him he had disappeared at a sharp canter around the curve of the trail  left to himself the stranger took a more leisurely pace which left him ample time for reflection scamp as he was there was something in the simple credulity of poor concho that made him uneasy not that his moral consciousness was touched but he feared that conchos companions might knowing conchos simplicity instantly suspect him of trading upon it he rode on in a deep study was he reviewing his past life a vagabond by birth and education a swindler by profession an outcast by reputation without absolutely turning his back upon respectability he had trembled on the perilous edge of criminality ever since his boyhood he did not scruple to cheat these mexicansthey were a degraded raceand for a moment he felt almost an accredited agent of progress and civilization we never really understand the meaning of enlightenment until we begin to use it aggressively  a few paces further on four figures appeared in the now gathering darkness of the trail the stranger quickly recognized the beaming smile of concho foremost of the party a quick glance at the faces of the others satisfied him that while they lacked conchos good humor they certainly did not surpass him in intellect pedro was a stout vaquero manuel was a slim halfbreed and exconvert of the mission of san carmel and miguel a recent butcher of monterey under the benign influences of concho that suspicion with which the ignorant regard strangers died away and the whole party escorted the strangerwho had given his name as mr joseph wilesto their campfire so anxious were they to begin their experiments that even the instincts of hospitality were forgotten and it was not until mr wilesnow known as don josesharply reminded them that he wanted some grub that they came to their senses when the frugal meal of tortillas frijoles salt pork and chocolate was over an oven was built of the darkred rock brought from the ledge before them and an earthenware jar glazed by some peculiar local process tightly fitted over it and packed with clay and sods a fire was speedily built of pine boughs continually brought from a wooded ravine below and in a few moments the furnace was in full blast mr wiles did not participate in these active preparations except to give occasional directions between his teeth which were contemplatively fixed over a clay pipe as he lay comfortably on his back on the ground whatever enjoyment the rascal may have had in their useless labors he did not show it but it was observed that his left eye often followed the broad figure of the exvaquero pedro and often dwelt on that worthys beetling brows and halfsavage face meeting that baleful glance once pedro growled out an oath but could not resist a hideous fascination that caused him again and again to seek it  the scene was weird enough without wiless eye to add to its wild picturesqueness the mountain towered abovea heavy rembrandtish mass of black shadowsharply cut here and there against a sky so inconceivably remote that the worldsick soul must have despaired of ever reaching so far or of climbing its steelblue walls the stars were large keen and brilliant but cold and steadfast they did not dance nor twinkle in their adamantine setting the furnace fire painted the faces of the men an indian red glanced on brightly colored blanket and serape but was eventually caught and absorbed in the waiting shadows of the black mountain scarcely twenty feet from the furnace door the low halfsung halfwhispered foreign speech of the group the roaring of the furnace and the quick sharp yelp of a coyote on the plain below were the only sounds that broke the awful silence of the hills  it was almost dawn when it was announced that the ore had fused and it was high time for the pot was slowly sinking into the fastcrumbling oven concho uttered a jubilant god and liberty but don jose wiles bade him be silent and bring stakes to support the pot then don jose bent over the seething mass it was for a moment only but in that moment this accomplished metallurgist mr joseph wiles had quietly dropped a silver half dollar into the pot  then he charged them to keep up the fires and went to sleepall but one eye  dawn came with dull beacon fires on the near hill tops and far in the east roses over the sierran snow birds twittering in the alder fringes a mile below and the creaking of wagon wheelsthe wagon itself a mere cloud of dust in the distant roadwere heard distinctly then the melting pot was solemnly broken by don jose and the glowing incandescent mass turned into the road to cool  and then the metallurgist chipped a small fragment from the mass and pounded it and chipped another smaller piece and pounded that and then subjected it to acid and then treated it to a salt bath which became at once milkyand at last produced a white somethingmirabile dictutwo cents worth of silver  concho shouted with joy the rest gazed at each other doubtingly and distrustfully companions in poverty they began to diverge and suspect each other in prosperity wiless left eye glanced ironically from the one to the other  here is the hundred dollars don jose said pedro handing the gold to wiles with a decidedly brusque intimation that the services and presence of a stranger were no longer required  wiles took the money with a gracious smile and a wink that sent pedros heart into his boots and was turning away when a cry from manuel stopped him the potthe potit has leaked look behold see  he had been cleaning away the crumbled fragments of the furnace to get ready for breakfast and had disclosed a shining pool of quicksilver  wiles started cast a rapid glance around the group saw in a flash that the metal was unknown to themand then said quietly  it is not silver  pardon senor it is and still molten wiles stooped and ran his fingers through the shining metal  mother of godwhat is it thenmagic  no only base metal but here concho emboldened by wiless experiment attempted to seize a handful of the glistening mass that instantly broke through his fingers in a thousand tiny spherules and even sent a few globules up his shirt sleeves until he danced around in mingled fear and childish pleasure  and it is not worth the taking queried pedro of wiles  wiless right eye and bland face were turned toward the speaker but his malevolent left was glancing at the dull redbrown rock on the hill side  noand turning abruptly away he proceeded to saddle his mule  manuel miguel and pedro left to themselves began talking earnestly together while concho now mindful of his crippled mule made his way back to the trail where he had left her but she was no longer there constant to her master through beatings and bullyings she could not stand incivility and inattention there are certain qualities of the sex that belong to all animated nature  inconsolable footsore and remorseful concho returned to the camp and furnace three miles across the rocky ridge but what was his astonishment on arriving to find the place deserted of man mule and camp equipage concho called aloud only the echoing rocks grimly answered him was it a trick concho tried to laugh ahyesa good onea jokenonothey had deserted him and then poor concho bowed his head to the ground and falling on his face cried as if his honest heart would break  the tempest passed in a moment it was not conchos nature to suffer long nor brood over an injury as he raised his head again his eye caught the shimmer of the quicksilverthat pool of merry antic metal that had so delighted him an hour before in a few moments concho was again disporting with it chasing it here and there rolling it in his palms and laughing with boylike glee at its elusive freaks and fancies ah sprightly oneskipjackthere thou goestcome here this waynow i have thee little onecome muchachacome and kiss me until he had quite forgotten the defection of his companions and even when he shouldered his sorry pack he was fain to carry his playmate away with him in his empty leathern flask  and yet i fancy the sun looked kindly on him as he strode cheerily down the black mountain side and his step was none the less free nor light that he carried with him neither the brilliant prospects nor the crime of his late comrades   chapter iii  who claimed it   the fog had already closed in on monterey and was now rolling a white billowy sea above that soon shut out the blue breakers below once or twice in descending the mountain concho had overhung the cliff and looked down upon the curving horseshoe of a bay below himdistant yet many miles earlier in the afternoon he had seen the gilt cross on the whitefaced mission flare in the sunlight but now all was gone by the time he reached the highway of the town it was quite dark and he plunged into the first fonda at the wayside and endeavored to forget his woes and his weariness in aguardiente but conchos head ached and his back ached and he was so generally distressed that he bethought him of a medicoan american doctorlately come into the town who had once treated concho and his mule with apparently the same medicine and after the same heroic fashion concho reasoned not illogically that if he were to be physicked at all he ought to get the worth of his money the grotesque extravagance of life of fruit and vegetables in california was inconsistent with infinitesimal doses in conchos previous illness the doctor had given him a dozen 4 grain quinine powders  the following day the grateful mexican walked into the doctors officecured the doctor was gratified until on examination it appeared that to save trouble and because his memory was poor concho had taken all the powders in one dose the doctor shrugged his shoulders andaltered his practice  well said dr guild as concho sank down exhaustedly in one of the doctors two chairs what now have you been sleeping again in the tule marshes or are you upset with commissary whisky come have it out  but concho declared that the devil was in his stomach that judas iscariot had possessed himself of his spine that imps were in his forehead and that his feet had been scourged by pontius pilate  that means blue mass said the doctor and gave it to hima bolus as large as a musket ball and as heavy  concho took it on the spot and turned to go  i have no money senor medico  never mind its only a dollar the price of the medicine  concho looked guilty at having gulped down so much cash then he said timidly  i have no money but i have got here what is fine and jolly it is yours and he handed over the contents of the precious tin can he had brought with him  the doctor took it looked at the shivering volatile mass and said why this is quicksilver  concho laughed yes very quick silver so and he snapped his fingers to show its sprightliness  the doctors face grew earnest where did you get this concho he finally asked  it ran from the pot in the mountains beyond  the doctor looked incredulous then concho related the whole story  could you find that spot again  madre de dios yesi have a mule there may the devil fly away with her  and you say your comrades saw this  why not  and you say they afterwards left youdeserted you  they did ingrates  the doctor arose and shut his office door hark ye concho he said that bit of medicine i gave you just now was worth a dollar it was worth a dollar because the material of which it was composed was made from the stuff you have in that canquicksilver or mercury it is one of the most valuable of metals especially in a goldmining country my good fellow if you know where to find enough of it your fortune is made  concho rose to his feet  tell me was the rock you built your furnace of red  si senor  and brown  si senor  and crumbled under the heat  as to nothing  and did you see much of this red rock  the mountain mother is in travail with it  are you sure that your comrades have not taken possession of the mountain mother  as how  by claiming its discovery under the mining laws or by preemption  they shall not  but how will you singlehanded fight the four for i doubt not your scientific friend has a hand in it  i will fight  yes my concho but suppose i take the fight off your hands now heres a proposition i will get half a dozen americanos to go in with you you will have to get money to work the mineyou will need funds you shall share half with them they will take the risk raise the money and protect you  i see said concho nodding his head and winking his eyes rapidly bueno  i will return in ten minutes said the doctor taking his hat  he was as good as his word in ten minutes he returned with six original locaters a board of directors a president secretary and a deed of incorporation of the blue mass quicksilver mining co this latter was a delicate compliment to the doctor who was popular the president added to these necessary articles a revolver  take it he said handing over the weapon to concho take it my horse is outside take that ride like hl and hang on to the claim until we come  in another moment concho was in the saddle then the mining director lapsed into the physician  i hardly know said dr guild doubtfully if in your present condition you ought to travel you have just taken a powerful medicine and the doctor looked hypocritically concerned  ahthe devil laughed concho what is the quicksilver that is in to that which is out hoopa la mula and with a clatter of hoofs and jingle of spurs was presently lost in the darkness  you were none too soon gentlemen said the american alcalde as he drew up before the doctors door another company has just been incorporated for the same location i reckon  who are they  three mexicanspedro manuel and miguel headed by that dd cockeyed sydney duck wiles  are they here  manuel and miguel only the others are over at tres pinos lallygaging roscommon and trying to rope him in to pay off their whisky bills at his grocery  if thats so we neednt start before sunrise for theyre sure to get roaring drunk  and this legitimate successor of the grave mexican alcaldes having thus delivered his impartial opinion rode away  meanwhile concho the redoubtable concho the fortunate spared neither riata nor spur the way was dark the trail obscure and at times even dangerous and concho familiar as he was with these mountain fastnesses often regretted his surefooted francisquita care not o concho he would say to himself tis but a little while only a little while and thou shalt have another francisquita to bless thee eh skipjack there was a fine music to thy dancing a dollar for an ouncetis as good as silver and merrier yet for all his good spirits he kept a sharp lookout at certain bends of the mountain trail not for assassins or brigands for concho was physically courageous but for the evil one who in various forms was said to lurk in the santa cruz range to the great discomfort of all true catholics he recalled the incident of ignacio a muleteer of the franciscan friars who stopping at the angelus to repeat the credo saw luzbel plainly in the likeness of a monstrous grizzly bear mocking him by sitting on his haunches and lifting his paws clasped together as if in prayer nevertheless with one hand grasping his reins and his rosary and the other clutching his whisky flask and revolver he fared on so rapidly that he reached the summit as the earlier streaks of dawn were outlining the faroff sierran peaks tethering his horse on a strip of tableland he descended cautiously afoot until he reached the bench the wall of red rock and the crumbled and dismantled furnace it was as he had left it that morning there was no trace of recent human visitation revolver in hand concho examined every cave gully and recess peered behind trees penetrated copses of buckeye and manzanita and listened there was no sound but the faint soughing of the wind over the pines below him for a while he paced backward and forward with a vague sense of being a sentinel but his mercurial nature soon rebelled against this monotony and soon the fatigues of the day began to tell upon him recourse to his whisky flask only made him the drowsier until at last he was fain to lie down and roll himself up tightly in his blanket the next moment he was sound asleep  his horse neighed twice from the summit but concho heard him not then the brush crackled on the ledge above him a small fragment of rock rolled near his feet but he stirred not and then two black figures were outlined on the crags beyond  sttt whispered a voice there is one lying beside the furnace the speech was spanish but the voice was wiless  the other figure crept cautiously to the edge of the crag and looked over it is concho the imbecile said pedro contemptuously  but if he should not be alone or if he should waken  i will watch and wait go you and affix the notification  wiles disappeared pedro began to creep down the face of the rocky ledge supporting himself by chemisal and brushwood  the next moment pedro stood beside the unconscious man then he looked cautiously around the figure of his companion was lost in the shadow of the rocks above only a slight crackle of brush betrayed his whereabouts suddenly pedro flung his serape over the sleepers head and then threw his powerful frame and tremendous weight full upon conchos upturned face while his strong arms clasped the blanketpinioned limbs of his victim there was a momentary upheaval a spasm and a struggle but the tightlyrolled blanket clung to the unfortunate man like cerements  there was no noise no outcry no sound of struggle there was nothing to be seen but the peaceful prostrate figures of the two men darkly outlined on the ledge they might have been sleeping in each others arms in the black silence the stealthy tread of wiles in the brush above was distinctly audible  gradually the struggles grew fainter then a whisper from the crags  i cant see you what are you doing  watching  sleeps he  he sleeps  soundly  soundly  after the manner of the dead  after the fashion of the dead  the last tremor had ceased pedro rose as wiles descended  all is ready said wiles you are a witness of my placing the notifications  i am a witness  but of this one pointing to concho shall we leave him here  a drunken imbecilewhy not  wiles turned his left eye on the speaker they chanced to be standing nearly in the same attitude they had stood the preceding night pedro uttered a cry and an imprecation carramba take your devils eye from me what see you ehwhat  nothing good pedro said wiles turning his bland right cheek to pedro the infuriated and halffrightened exvaquero returned the long knife he had halfdrawn from its sheath and growled surlily go on then but keep thou on that side and i will on this and so side by side listening watching distrustful of all things but mainly of each other they stole back and up into those shadows from which they might like evil spirits have been poetically evoked  a half hour passed in which the east brightened flashed and again melted into gold and then the sun came up haughtily and a fog that had stolen across the summit in the night arose and fled up the mountain side tearing its white robes in its guilty haste and leaving them fluttering from tree and crag and scar a thousand tiny blades nestling in the crevices of rocks nurtured in storms and rocked by the trade winds stretched their wan and feeble arms toward him but concho the strong concho the brave concho the lighthearted spake not nor stirred   chapter iv  who took it   there was persistent neighing on the summit conchos horse wanted his breakfast  this protestation reached the ears of a party ascending the mountain from its western face to one of the party it was familiar  why blank it all thats chiquita that dd mexicans lying drunk somewhere said the president of the b m co  i dont like the look of this at all said dr guild as they rode up beside the indignant animal if it had been an american it might have been carelessness but no mexican ever forgets his beast drive ahead boys we may be too late  in half an hour they came in sight of the ledge below the crumbled furnace and the motionless figure of concho wrapped in a blanket lying prone in the sunlight  i told you sodrunk said the president  the doctor looked grave but did not speak they dismounted and picketed their horses then crept on all fours to the ledge above the furnace there was a cry from secretary gibbs look yer some fellar has been jumping us boys see these notices  there were two notices on canvas affixed to the rock claiming the ground and signed by pedro manuel miguel wiles and roscommon  this was done doctor while your trustworthy greaser locaterdn himlay there drunk whats to be done now  but the doctor was making his way to the unfortunate cause of their defeat lying there quite mute to their reproaches the others followed him  the doctor knelt beside concho unrolled him placed his hand upon his wrist his ear over his heart and then said  dead  of course he got medicine of you last night this comes of your dd heroic practice  but the doctor was too much occupied to heed the speakers raillery he had peered into conchos protuberant eye opened his mouth and gazed at the swollen tongue and then suddenly rose to his feet  tear down those notices boys but keep them put up your own dont be alarmed you will not be interfered with for here is murder added to robbery  murder  yes said the doctor excitedly ill take my oath on any inquest that this man was strangled to death he was surprised while asleep look here he pointed to the revolver still in conchos stiffening hand which the murdered man had instantly cocked but could not use in the struggle  thats so said the president no man goes to sleep with a cocked revolver whats to be done  everything said the doctor this deed was committed within the last two hours the body is still warm the murderer did not come our way or we should have met him on the trail he is if anywhere between here and tres pinos  gentlemen said the president with a slight preparatory and half judicial cough two of you will stay here and stick the others will follow me to tres pinos the law has been outraged you understand the court  by some odd influence the little group of halfcynical halftrifling and wholly reckless men had become suddenly sober earnest citizens they said go on nodded their heads and betook themselves to their horses  had we not better wait for the inquest and swear out a warrant said the secretary cautiously  how many men have we  five  then said the president summing up the revised statutes of the state of california in one strong sentence then we dont want no dd warrant   chapter v  who had a lien on it   it was high noon at tres pinos the three pines from which it gained its name in the dusty road and hot air seemed to smoke from their balsamic spires there was a glare from the road a glare from the sky a glare from the rocks a glare from the white canvas roofs of the few shanties and cabins which made up the village there was even a glare from the unpainted redwood boards of roscommons grocery and tavern and a tendency of the warping floor of the veranda to curl up beneath the feet of the intruder a few mules near the watering trough had shrunk within the scant shadow of the corral  the grocery business of mr roscommon although adequate and sufficient for the village was not exhausting nor overtaxing to the proprietor the refilling of the pork and flour barrel of the average miner was the work of a brief hour on saturday nights but the daily replenishment of the average miner with whisky was arduous and incessant roscommon spent more time behind his bar than his grocers counter add to this the fact that a long shedlike extension or wing bore the legend cosmopolitan hotel board or lodging by the day or week m roscommon and you got an idea of the variety of the proprietors functions the hotel however was more directly under the charge of mrs roscommon a lady of thirty years strong truculent and goodhearted  mr roscommon had early adopted the theory that most of his customers were insane and were to be alternately bullied or placated as the case might be nothing that occurred no extravagance of speech nor act ever ruffled his equilibrium which was as dogged and stubborn as it was outwardly calm when not serving liquor or in the interval while it was being drank he was always wiping his counter with an exceedingly dirty towelor indeed anything that came handy miners noticing this purely perfunctory habit occasionally supplied him slily with articles inconsistent with their servicefragments of their shirts and underclothing flour sacking tow and once with a flannel petticoat of his wifes stolen from the line in the backyard roscommon would continue his wiping without looking up but yet conscious of the presence of each customer and its not another dhrop yell git jack brown until yeve wiped out the black score that stands agin ye and its there ye are darlint and its heres the bottle thats been lukin for ye sins saturday and fwhot hev you done with the last i sent ye ye divil of a mccorkle and heres me back thats bruk entoirely wid dipping intil the pork barl to giv ye the best sides and ye spending yur last cint on a tare into gilroy whist and if its fer foighting ye are boys theres an illigant bit of sod beyant the corral and it may be meselfll come out with a shtick and be sociable  on this particular day however mr roscommon was not in his usual spirits and when the clatter of horses hoofs before the door announced the approach of strangers he absolutely ceased wiping his counter and looked up as dr guild the president and secretary of the new company strode into the shop  we are looking said the president for a man by the name of wiles and three mexicans known as pedro manuel and miguel  ye are  we are  faix and i hope yell foind em and if yell git from em the score ive got agin em darlint ill add a blessing to it  there was a laugh at this from the bystanders who somehow resented the intrusion of these strangers  i fear you will find it no laughing matter gentlemen said dr guild a little stiffly when i tell you that a murder has been committed and the men i am seeking within an hour of that murder put up that notice signed by their names and dr guild displayed the paper  there was a breathless silence among the crowd as they eagerly pressed around the doctor only roscommon kept on wiping his counter  you will observe gentlemen that the name of roscommon also appears on this paper as one of the original beaters  and sure darlint said roscommon without looking up if yeve no better ividince agin them boys then you have forninst me its home yed bether be riding to wanst for its meself as hasnt sturred fut out of the store the day and noightmore betoken as the boys ive sarved kin testify  thats so ross right chorused the crowd weve been running the old man all night  then how comes your name on this paper  o murdher will ye listen to him boys as if every felly that owed me a whisky bill didnt come to me and say ah misther roscommon or moike as the case moight be sure its an illigant sthrike ive made this day and its meself that has put down your name as an original locater and yer fortunes made mr roscommon and will yer fill me up another quart for the good luck betune you and me ah but ask jack brown over yar if it isnt sick that i am of his original locations  the laugh that followed this speech and its practical application convinced the party that they had blundered that they could obtain no clue to the real culprits here and that any attempt by threats would meet violent opposition nevertheless the doctor was persistent  when did you see these men last  when did i see them is it bedad what with sarvin up the liquor and keeping me counters dry and swate i never see them at all  thats so ross chorused the crowd again to whom the whole proceeding was delightfully farcical  then i can tell you gentlemen said the doctor stiffly that they were in monterey last night that they did not return on that trail this morning and that they must have passed here at daybreak  with these words which the doctor regretted as soon as delivered the party rode away  mr roscommon resumed his service and counter wiping but late that night when the bar was closed and the last loiterer was summarily ejected mr roscommon in the conjugal privacy of his chamber produced a legallooking paper read it maggie darlint for its meself never had the larning nor the parts  mistress roscommon took the paper  shure its law papers making over some property to yis o moike ye havnt been spekilating  whist and fwhotz that durty gray paper wid the sales and flourishes  faix it bothers me intoirely shure it oint in english  whist maggie its a spanish grant  a spanish grant o moike and what did ye giv for it  mr roscommon laid his finger beside his nose and said softly whishky     part iiin the courts    chapter vi  how a grant was got for it   while the blue mass company with more zeal than discretion were actively pursuing pedro and wiles over the road to tres pinos senors miguel and manuel were comfortably seated in a fonda at monterey smoking cigarritos and discussing their late discovery but they were in no better mood than their late companions and it appeared from their conversation that in an evil moment they had sold out their interest in the alleged silver mine to wiles and pedro for a few hundred dollarssuccumbing to what they were assured would be an active opposition on the part of the americanos the astute reader will easily understand that the accomplished mr wiles did not inform them of its value as a quicksilver mine although he was obliged to impart his secret to pedro as a necessary accomplice and reckless coadjutor that pedro felt no qualms of conscience in thus betraying his two comrades may be inferred from his recent direct and sincere treatment of concho and that he would if occasion offered or policy made it expedient as calmly obliterate mr wiles that gentleman himself never for a moment doubted  if we had waited but a little he would have given morethis cockeye regretted manuel querulously  not a peso said miguel firmly  and why my miguel thou knowest we could have worked the mine ourselves  good and lost even that labor look you little brother show to me now the mexican that has ever made a real of a mine in california how many eh none not a one who owns the mexicans mine eh americanos who takes the money from the mexicans mine americanos thou rememberest briones who spent a gold mine to make a silver one who has the lands and house of briones americanos who has the cattle of briones americanos who has the mine of briones americanos who has the silver briones never found americanos always the same forever ah carramba  then the evil one evidently took it into his head and horns to worry and toss these mencomparatively innocent as they werestill further for a purpose for presently to them appeared one victor garcia whilom a clerk of the ayuntamiento who rallied them over aguardiente and told them the story of the quicksilver discovery and the two mining claims taken out that night by concho and wiles whereat manuel exploded with profanity and burnt blue with sulphurous malediction but miguel the recent ecclesiastic sat livid and thoughtful  finally came a pause in manuels bombardment and something like this conversation took place between the cooler actors  miguel thoughtfully when was it thou didst petition for lands in the valley friend victor  victor amazedly never it is a sterile waste am i a fool  miguel softly thou didst of thy governor micheltorena i have seen the application  victor beginning to appreciate a rodential odor si i had forgotten art thou sure it was in the valley  miguel persuasively in the valley and up the falda        falda or valda i e that part of the skirt of a      womans robe that breaks upon the ground and is also      applied to the final slope of a hill from the angle that it      makes upon the level plain  victor with decision certainly of a veritythe falda likewise  miguel eying victor and yet thou hadst not the grant painful is it that it should have been burned with the destruction of the other archives by the americanos at monterey  victor cautiously feeling his way possiblemente  miguel it might be wise to look into it  victor bluntly as why  miguel for our good and thine friend victor we bring thee a discovery thou bringest us thy skill thy experience thy government knowledgethy custom house paper        grants applications and official notifications under      the spanish government were drawn on a stamped paper known      as custom house paper  manuel breaking in drunkenly but for what we are mexicans are we not fated we shall lose who shall keep the americanos off  miguel we shall take one american in ha seest thou this american comrade shall bribe his courts his corregidores after a little he shall supply the men who invent the machine of steam the mill the furnace eh  victor but who is henot to steal  miguel he is that man of ireland a good catholic at tres pinos  victor and manuel omnes roscommon  miguel of the same we shall give him a share for the provisions for the tools for the aguardiente it is of the irish that the americanos have great fear it is of them that the votes are madethat the president is chosen it is of him that they make the alcalde in san francisco and we are of the church like him  they said bueno altogether and for the moment appeared to be upheld by a religious enthusiasma joint confession of faith that meant death destruction and possibly forgery as against the men who thought otherwise  this spiritual harmony did away with all practical consideration and doubt i have a little niece said victor whose work with the pen is marvellous if one says to her carmen copy me this or the other oneeven if it be copperplatelook you it is done and you cannot know of which is the original madre de dios the other day she makes me a rubric of the governor pio pico the same identical thou knowest her miguel she asked concerning thee yesterday        the spanish rubric is the complicated flourish attached      to a signature and is as individual and characteristic as      the handwriting  with the embarrassment of an underbred man miguel tried to appear unconcerned but failed dismally indeed i fear that the black eyes of carmen had already done their perfect and accepted work and had partly induced the application for victors aid he however dissembled so far as to ask  but will she not know  she is a child  but will she not talk  not if i say nay and if thoueh miguel  this bit of flattery which by the way was a lie for victors niece did not incline favorably to miguel had its effect they shook hands over the table but said miguel what is to be done must be done now at the moment said victor and thou shalt see it done eh does it content thee then come  miguel nodded to manuel we will return in an hour wait thou here  they filed out into the dark irregular street fate led them to pass the office of dr guild at the moment that concho mounted his horse the shadows concealed them from their rival but they overheard the last injunctions of the president to the unlucky concho  thou hearest said miguel clutching his companions arm  yes said victor but let him ride my friend in one hour we shall have that that shall arrive years before him and with a complacent chuckle they passed unseen and unheard until abruptly turning a corner they stopped before a low adobe house  it had once been a somewhat pretentious dwelling but had evidently followed the fortunes of its late owner don juan briones who had offered it as a last sop to the threeheaded cerberus that guarded the el refugio plutonean treasures and who had swallowed it in a single gulp it was in very bad case the furrows of its redtiled roof looked as if they were the results of age and decrepitude its best room had a musty smell there was the dampness of deliquescence in its slow decay but the spanish californians were sensible architects and its massive walls and partitions defied the earthquake thrill and all the year round kept an even temperature within  victor led miguel through a low anteroom into a plainlyfurnished chamber where carmen sat painting  now mistress carmen was a bit of a painter in a pretty little way with all the vague longings of an artist but without i fear the artists steadfast soul she recognized beauty and form as a child might without understanding their meaning and somehow failed to make them even interpret her womans moods which surely were natures too so she painted everything with this innocent lust of the eyeflowers birds insects landscapes and figureswith a joyous fidelity but no particular poetry the bird never sang to her but one song the flowers or trees spake but one language and her skies never brightened except in color she came out strong on the catholic saints and would toss you up a cleanlyshaven aloysius sweetly destitute of expression or a dropsical lethargic madonna that you couldnt have told from an old master so bad it was her faculty of faithful reproduction even showed itself in fanciful letteringand latterly in the imitation of fabrics and signatures indeed with her eye for beauty of form she had always excelled in penmanship at the conventan accomplishment which the good sisters held in great repute  in person she was petite with a still unformed girlish figure perhaps a little too flat across the back and with possibly a too great tendency to a boyish stride in walking her brow covered by blueblack hair was low and frank and honest her eyes a very dark hazel were not particularly large but rather heavily freighted in their melancholy lids with sleeping passion her nose was of that unimportant character which no man remembers her mouth was small and straight her teeth white and regular the whole expression of her face was piquancy that might be subdued by tenderness or made malevolent by anger at present it was a salad in which the oil and vinegar were deftly combined the astute feminine reader will of course understand that this is the ordinary superficial masculine criticism and at once make up her mind both as to the character of the young lady and the competency of the critic i only know that i rather liked her and her functions are somewhat important in this veracious history  she looked up started to her feet leveled her black brows at the intruder but at a sign from her uncle showed her white teeth and spake  it was only a sentence and a rather commonplace one at that but if she could have put her voice upon her canvas she might have retrieved the garcia fortunes for it was so musical so tender so sympathizing so melodious so replete with the graciousness of womanhood that she seemed to have invented the language and yet that sentence was only an exaggerated form of the how dye do whined out doled out lisped out or shot out from the pretty mouths of my fair countrywomen  miguel admired the paintings he was struck particularly with a crayon drawing of a mule mother of god it is the mule itself observe how it will not go then the crafty victor broke in with but it is nothing to her writing look you shall tell to me which is the handwriting of pio pico and from a drawer in the secretary he drew forth two signatures one was affixed to a yellowish paper the other drawn on plain white foolscap of course miguel took the more modern one with loverlike gallantry it is this is genuine victor laughed triumphantly carmen echoed the laugh melodiously in childlike glee and added with a slight toss of her piquant head it is mine the best of the sex will not refuse a just and overdue compliment from even the man they dislike its the principle theyre after not the sentiment  but victor was not satisfied with this proof of his nieces skill say to her he demanded of miguel what name thou likest and it shall be done before thee here miguel was not so much in love but he perceived the drift of victors suggestion and remarked that the rubric of governor micheltorena was exceedingly complicated and difficult she shall do it responded victor with decision  from a file of old departmental papers the governors signature and that involved rubric which must have cost his late excellency many youthful days of anxiety was produced and laid before carmen  carmen took her pen in her hand looked at the brownishlooking document and then at the virgin whiteness of the foolscap before her but she said pouting prettily i should have to first paint this white paper brown and it will absorb the ink more quickly than that when i painted the san antonio of the mission san gabriel for father acolti i had to put the decay in with my oils and brushes before the good padre would accept it  the two scamps looked at each other it was their supreme moment i think i have said victor with assumed carelessness i think i have some of the old customhouse paper he produced from the secretary a sheet of brown paper with a stamp try it on that  carmen smiled with childish delight tried it and produced a marvel it is as magic said miguel feigning to cross himself  victors role was more serious he affected to be deeply touched took the paper folded it and placed it in his breast i shall make a good fool of don jose castro he said he will declare it is the governors own signature for he was his friend but have a care carmen that you spoil it not by the opening of your red lips when he is fooled i will tell him of this marvelthis niece of mine and he shall buy her pictures eh little one and he gave her the avuncular caress i e a pat of the hand on either cheek and a kiss miguel envied him but cupidity outgeneraled cupid and presently the conversation flagged until a convenient recollection of victorsthat himself and comrade were due at the posada del toros at 10 oclockgave them the opportunity to retire but not without a chance shot from carmen tell to me she said half to victor and half to miguel what has chanced with concho he was ever ready to bring to me flowers from the mountain and insects and birds thou knowest how he would sit oh my uncle and talk to me of the rare rocks he had seen and the bears and the evil spirits and now he comes no longer my concho how is this nothing evil has befallen him surely and her drooping lids closed halfpathetically  miguels jealousy took fire he is drunk senorita doubtless and has forgotten not only thee but mayhap his mule and pack it is his custom ha ha  the red died out of carmens ripe lips and she shut them together with a snap like a steel purse the dove had suddenly changed to a hawk the childgirl into an antique virago the spirit hitherto dimly outlined in her face of some shrewish garcia ancestress came to the fore she darted a quick look at her uncle and then with her little hands on her rigid lips strode with two steps up to miguel  possibly o senor miguel dominguez perez a profound courtesy here it is as thou sayest drunkard concho may be but drunk or sober he never turned his back on his friendorthe words grated a little herehis enemy  miguel would have replied but victor was ready fool he said pinching his arm tis an old friend andandthe application is still to be filled up are you crazy  but on this point miguel was not and with the revenge of a rival added to his other instincts he permitted victor to lead him away  on their return to the fonda they found master manuel too far gone with aguardiente and a general animosity to the average americano to be of any service so they worked alone with pen ink and paper in the stuffy cigarritoclouded back room of the fonda it was midnight two hours after concho had started that miguel clapped spurs to his horse for the village of tres pinos with an application to governor micheltorena for a grant to the rancho of the red rocks comfortably bestowed in his pocket   chapter vii  who plead for it   there can be little doubt the coroners jury of fresno would have returned a verdict of death from alcoholism as the result of their inquest into the cause of conchos death had not dr guild fought nobly in support of the law and his own convictions a majority of the jury objected to there being any inquest at all a sincere juryman thought it hard that whenever a greaser pegged out in a sneakin kind o way american citizens should be taken from their business to find out what ailed him spose he was killed said another thar aint no time this thirty year he werent so to speak just sufferin for it ez his natral right ez a mexican the jury at last compromised by bringing in a verdict of homicide against certain parties unknown yet it was understood tacitly that these unknown parties were severally wiles and pedro manuel miguel and roscommon proving an unmistakable alibi wiles and pedro had fled to lower california and manuel miguel and roscommon deemed it advisable in the then excited state of the public mind to withhold the forged application and claim from the courts and the public comment so that for a year after the murder of concho and the flight of his assassins the blue mass mining company remained in undisturbed and actual possession of the mine and reigned in their stead  but the spirit of the murdered concho would not down any more than that of the murdered banquo and so wrought no doubt in a quiet concholike way sore trouble with the blue mass company for a great capitalist and master of avarice came down to the mine and found it fair and taking one of the company aside offered to lend his name and a certain amount of coin for a controlling interest accompanying the generous offer with a suggestion that if it were not acceded to he would be compelled to buy up various mexican mines and flood the market with quicksilver to the great detriment of the blue mass company which thoughtful suggestion offered by a man frequently alluded to as one of californias great mining princes and as one who had done much to develop the resources of the state was not to be lightly considered and so after a cautious nonconsultation with the company and a commendable secrecy the stockholder sold out whereat it was speedily spread abroad that the great capitalist had taken hold of blue mass and the stock went up and the other stockholders rejoiceduntil the great capitalist found that it was necessary to put up expensive mills to employ a high salaried superintendent in fact to develop the mine by the spending of its earnings so that the stock quoted at 112 was finally saddled with an assessment of 50 per share another assessment of 50 to enable the superintendent to proceed to russia and spain and examine into the workings of the quicksilver mines there and also a general commission to the gifted and scientific pillageman to examine into the various component parts of quicksilver and report if it could not be manufactured from ordinary sandstone by steam or electricity speedily brought the other stockholders to their senses it was at this time the good fellow tom the seriousminded dick and the speculative but fortunate harry brokers of the great capitalist found it convenient to buy up for the great capitalist aforesaid the various other shares at great sacrifice  i fear that i have bored my readers in thus giving the tiresome details of that ingenuous american pastime which my countrymen dismiss in their epigrammatic way as the freezingout process and lest any reader should question the ethics of the proceeding i beg him to remember that one gentleman accomplished in this art was always a sincere and direct opponent of the late mr john oakhurst gambler  but for once the great master of avarice had not taken into sufficient account the avarice of others and was suddenly and virtuously shocked to learn that an application for a patent for certain lands known as the redrock rancho was about to be offered before the united states land commission this claim covered his mining property but the information came quietly and secretly as all of the great masters information was obtained and he took the opportunity to sell out his clouded title and his proprietorship to the only remaining member of the original blue mass company a young fellow of pith before manytongued rumor had voiced the news far and wide the blow was a heavy one to the party left in possession saddled by the enormous debts and expenses of the great capitalist with a credit now further injured by the defection of this lucky magnate who was admired for his skill in anticipating a loss and whose relinquishment of any project meant ruin to it the singlehanded impoverished possessor of the mine whose title was contested and whose reputation was yet to be madepoor biggs first secretary and only remaining officer of the blue mass company looked ruefully over his books and his last transfer and sighed but i have before intimated that he was built of good stuff and that he believed in his workwhich was welland in himself which was better and so having faith even as a grain of mustard seed i doubt not he would have been able to remove that mountain of quicksilver beyond the overlapping of fraudulent grants and again providencehaving disposed of these several scampsraised up to him a friend but that friend is of sufficient importance to this veracious history to deserve a paragraph to himself  the pylades of this orestes was known of ordinary mortals as royal thatcher his genealogy birth and education are i take it of little account to this chronicle which is only concerned with his friendship for biggs and the result thereof he had known biggs a year or two previously they had shared each others purses bunks cabins provisions and often friends with that perfect freedom from obligation which belonged to the pioneer life the varying tide of fortune had just then stranded thatcher on a desert sand hill in san francisco with an uninsured cargo of expectations while to thatchers active but not curious fancy it had apparently lifted his friends bark over the bar in the monterey mountains into an open quicksilver sea so that he was considerably surprised on receiving a note from biggs to this purport   dear royrun down here and help a fellow ive too much of a load for one maybe we can make a team and pull blue mass out yet biggsey   thatcher sitting in his scantily furnished lodgings doubtful of his next meal and in arrears for rent heard this macedonian cry as st paul did he wrote a promissory and soothing note to his landlady but fearing the sweet sorrow of personal parting let his collapsed valise down from his window by a cord and by means of an economical combination of stage riding and pedestrianism he presented himself at the close of the third day at biggss door in a few moments he was in possession of the story half an hour later in possession of half the mine its infelix past and its doubtful future equally with his friend  business over biggs turned to look at his partner youve aged some since i saw you last he said starvation luck i spose id know your eyes old fellow if i saw them among ten thousand but your lips are parched and your mouths grimmer than it used to be thatcher smiled to show that he could still do so but did not say as he might have said that selfcontrol suppressed resentment disappointment and occasional hunger had done something in the way of correcting natures obvious mistakes and shutting up a kindly mouth he only took off his threadbare coat rolled up his sleeves and saying weve got lots of work and some fighting before us pitched into the affairs of the blue mass company on the instant   chapter viii  of counsel for it   meanwhile roscommon had waited then in garcias name and backed by him he laid his case before the land commissioner filing the application with forged indorsements to governor micheltorena and alleging that the original grant was destroyed by fire and why  it seemed there was a limit to miss carmens imitative talent admirable as it was it did not reach to the reproduction of that official seal which would have been a necessary appendage to the governors grant but there were letters written on stamped paper by governor micheltorena to himself garcia and to miguel and to manuels father all of which were duly signed by the sign manual and rubric of mrsgovernormicheltorenacarmendeharo and then there was parol evidence and plenty of it witnesses who remembered everything about itnamely manuel miguel and the allrecollecting de haro here were details poetical and suggestive and damequicklyish as when his late excellency sitting not by a seacoal fire but with aguardiente and cigarros had sworn to him the execclesiastic miguel that he should grant and had granted garcias request there were clouds of witnesses conversations letters and records glib and pat to the occasion in brief there was nothing wanted but the seal of his excellency the only copy of that was in the possession of a rival school of renaissant art and the restoration of antiques then doing business before the land commission  and yet the claim was rejected having lately recommended two separate claimants to a patent for the same land the land commission became cautious and conservative  roscommon was at first astounded then indignant and then warlikehe was for an appale to onst  with the readers previous knowledge of roscommons disposition this may seem somewhat inconsistent but there are certain natures to whom litigation has all the excitement of gambling and it should be borne in mind that this was his first lawsuit so that his lawyer mr saponaceous wood found him in that belligerent mood to which counsel are obliged to hypocritically bring all the sophistries of their profession  of course you have your right to an appeal but calm yourself my dear sir and consider the case was presented strongly the evidence overwhelming on our side but we happened to be fighting previous decisions of the land commission that had brought them into trouble so that if micheltorena had himself appeared in court and testified to his giving you the grant it would have made no differenceno spanish grant had a show then nor will it have for the next six months you see my dear sir the government sent out one of its big washington lawyers to look into this business and he reported frauds sir frauds in a majority of the spanish claims and why sir why he was bought sir boughtbody and soulby the ring  and fwhots the ring asked his client sharply  the ring isahem a combination of unprincipled but wealthy persons to defeat the ends of justice  and sure fwhots the ring to do wid me grant as that thaving mexican gave me as the collatherals for the bourd he was owin me eh mind that now  the ring my dear sir is the other side it isahem always the other side  and why the divel havent we a ring too and aint i payin ye five hundred dollarsand the divel of ring ye have at all at all fwhot am i payin ye fur eh  that a judicious expenditure of money began mr wood outside of actual disbursements may not be of infinite service to you i am not prepared to denybut  look ye mr sappy wood its the appale i want and the grant ill have more betoken as the old womans harrut and me own is set on it entoirely get me the land and ill give ye the half of itand its a bargain  but my dear sir there are some rules in our professiontechnical though they may be  the divel fly away wid yer profession sure is it better nor me own if ive risked me provisions and me whisky that cost me solid goold in frisco on that thafe garcias claim bedad the loikes of ye can risk yer law  well said wood with an awkward smile i suppose that a deed for one half on the consideration of friendship my dear sir and a dollar in hand paid by me might be reconcilable  now its talkin ye are but whos the felly were foighten thats got the ring  ah my dear sir its the united states said the lawyer with gravity  the states the government is it and ist that yere afeared of sure its the government that i fought in me own counthree it was the government that druv me to ameriky and is it now that im going back on me principles  your political sentiments do you great credit began mr wood  but fwhots the government to do wid the appale  the government said mr wood significantly will be represented by the district attorney  and whos the spalpeen  it is rumored said mr wood slowly that a new one is to be appointed i myself have had some ambition that way  his client bent a pair of cunning but not overwise grey eyes on his american lawyer but he only said ye have eh  yes said wood answering the look boldly and if i had the support of a number of your prominent countrymen who are so powerful with all partiesmen like you my dear sirwhy i think you might in time become a conservative at least more resigned to the government  then the lesser and the greater scamp looked at each other and for a moment or two felt a warm sympathetic friendly emotion for each other and quietly shook hands  depend upon it there is a great deal more kindly human sympathy between two openlyconfessed scamps than there is in that calm respectable recognition that you and i dear reader exhibit when we happen to oppose each other with our respective virtues  and yell get the appale  i will  and he did and by a singular coincidence got the district attorneyship also and with a deed for one half of the redrock rancho in his pocket sent a brother lawyer in court to appear for his client the united states as against himself roscommon garcia et al wild horses could not have torn him from this noble resolution there is an indescribable delicacy in the legal profession which we literary folk ought to imitate  the united states lost which meant ruin and destruction to the blue mass company who had bought from a paternal and beneficent government lands which didnt belong to it the mexican grant of course antedated the occupation of the mine by concho wiles pedro et al as well as by the blue mass company and the solitary partners biggs and thatcher more than that it swallowed up their improvements it made biggs and thatcher responsible to garcia for all the money the grand master of avarice had made out of it mr district attorney was apparently distressed but resigned messrs biggs and thatcher were really distressed and combative  and then to advance a few years in this chronicle began real litigation with earnestness vigor courage zeal and belief on the part of biggs and thatcher and technicalities delay equivocation and a general fabianlike policy on the part of garcia roscommon et al of all these tedious processes i note but one which for originality and audacity of conception appears to me to indicate more clearly the temper and civilization of the epoch a subordinate officer of the district court refused to obey the mandate ordering a transcript of the record to be sent up to the united states supreme court it is to be regretted that the name of this ephesian youth who thus fired the dome of our constitutional liberties should have been otherwise so unimportant as to be confined to the dusty records of that doubtful court of which he was a doubtful servitor and that his claim to immortality ceased with his doublefeed service but there still stands on record a letter by this young gentleman arraigning the legal wisdom of the land which is not entirely devoid of amusement or even instruction to young men desirous of obtaining publicity and capital howbeit the supreme court was obliged to protect itself by procuring the legislation of his functions out of his local fingers into the larger palm of its own attorney  these various processes of law and equity which when exercised practically in the affairs of ordinary business might have occupied a few months time dragged clung retrograded or advanced slowly during a period of eight or nine years but the strong arms of biggs and thatcher held possession and possibly by the same tactics employed on the other side arrested or delayed ejectment and so made and sold quicksilver while their opponents were spending gold until biggs sorely hit in the interlacings of his armor fell in the lists his cheek growing waxen and his strong arm feeble and finding himself in this sore condition and passing as it were made over his share in trust to his comrade and died whereat from that time henceforward royal thatcher reigned in his stead  and so having anticipated the legal record we will go back to the various human interests that helped to make it up  to begin with roscommon to do justice to his later conduct and expressions it must be remembered that when he accepted the claim for the redrock rancho yet unquestioned from the hands of garcia he was careless or at least unsuspicious of fraud it was not until he had experienced the intoxication of litigation that he felt somehow that he was a wronged and defrauded man but with the obstinacy of defrauded men preferred to arraign some one fact or individual as the impelling cause of his wrong rather than the various circumstances that led to it to his simple mind it was made patent that the blue mass company were making money out of a mine which he claimed and which was not yet adjudged to them every dollar they took out was a fresh count in this general indictment every delay towards this adjustment of rightsalthough made by his own lawyerwas a personal wrong the mere fact that there never was nor had been any quid pro quo for this immense propertythat it had fallen to him for a mere songonly added zest to his struggle the possibility of his losing this mere speculation affected him more strongly than if he had already paid down the million he expected to get from the mine i dont know that i have indicated as plainly as i might that universal preference on the part of mankind to get something from nothing and to acquire the largest return for the least possible expenditure but i question my right to say that roscommon was much more reprehensible than his fellows  but it told upon him as it did upon all over whom the spirit of the murdered concho broodedupon all whom avarice alternately flattered and tortured from his quiet gains in his legitimate business from the little capital accumulated through industry and economy he lavished thousands on this chimera of his fancy he grew grizzled and worn over his selfimposed delusion he no longer jested with his customers regardless of quality or station or importance he had cliques to mollify enemies to placate friends to reward the grocery suffered through giving food and lodgment to clouds of unimpeachable witnesses before the land commission and the district court mrs ros found herself losing money even the bar failed there was a party of blue mass employees who drank at the opposite fonda and cursed the roscommon claim over the liquor the calm mechanical indifference with which roscommon had served his customers was gone the towel was no longer used after its perfunctory fashion the counter remained unwiped the disks of countless glasses marked its surface and indicated other preoccupation on the part of the proprietor the keen grey eyes of the claimant of the redrock rancho were always on the lookout for friend or enemy  garcia comes next that gentlemans inborn talent for historic misrepresentation culminated unpleasantly through a defective memory a year or two after he had sworn in his application for the rancho being engaged in another case some trifling inconsistency was discovered in his statements which had the effect of throwing the weight of evidence to the party who had paid him most but was instantly detected by the weaker party garcias preeminence as a witness an expert and general historian began to decline he was obliged to be corroborated and this required a liberal outlay of his fee with the loss of his credibility as a witness bad habits supervened he was frequently drunk he lost his position he lost his house and carmen removed to san francisco supported him with her brush  and this brings us once more to that pretty painter and innocent forger whose unconscious act bore such baleful fruit on the barren hillsides of the redrock rancho and also to a later blossom of her life that opened however in kindlier sunshine   chapter ix  what the fair had to do about it   the house that royal thatcher so informally quitted in his exodus to the promised land of biggs was one of those oversized undercalculated dwellings conceived and erected in the extravagance of the san francisco builders hopes and occupied finally in his despair intended originally as the palace of some inchoate california aladdin it usually ended as a lodging house in which some helpless widow or hopeless spinster managed to combine respectability with the hard task of bread getting  thatchers landlady was one of the former class she had unfortunately survived not only her husband but his property and living in some deserted chamber had after the fashion of the italian nobility let out the rest of the ruin a tendency to dwell upon these facts gave her conversation a peculiar significance on the first of each month thatcher had noticed this with the sensitiveness of an impoverished gentleman but when a few days after her lodgers sudden disappearance a note came from him containing a draft in noble excess of all arrears and charges the widows heart was lifted and the rock smitten with the golden wand gushed beneficence that shone in a new gown for the widow and a new suit for johnny her son a new oil cloth in the hall better service to the lodgers and let us be thankful a kindlier consideration for the poor little blackeyed painter from monterey then dreadfully behind in her room rent for to tell the truth the calls upon miss de haros scant purse by her uncle had lately been frequent perjury having declined in the monterey market through excessive and injudicious supply until the line of demarcation between it and absolute verity was so finely drawn that victor garcia had remarked that he might as well tell the truth at once and save his soul since the devil was in the market  mistress plodgitt the landlady could not resist the desire to acquaint carmen de haro with her good fortune he was always a friend of yours my dearand i know him to be a gentleman that would never let a poor widow suffer and see what he says about you here she produced thatchers note and read tell my little neighbor that i shall come back soon to carry her and her sketching tools off by force and i shall not let her return until she has caught the black mountains and the red rocks she used to talk about and put the blue mass mill in the foreground of the picture i shall order  what is this little one surely carmen thou needst not blush at this thy first grand offer holy virgin is it of a necessity that thou shouldst stick the wrong end of thy brush in thy mouth and then drop it in thy lap or was it taught thee by the good sisters at the convent to stride in that boyish fashion to the side of thy elders and snatch from their hands the missive thou wouldst read more of this we would know o carmensmallest of brunettesspeak little one even in thine own melodious speech that i may commend thee and thy rare discretion to my own fair countrywomen  alas neither the present chronicler nor mistress plodgitt got any further information from the prudent carmen and must fain speculate upon certain facts that were already known  mistress carmens little room was opposite to thatchers and once or twice the doors being open thatcher had a glimpse across the passage of a blackhaired and a sturdy boyish little figure in a great blue apron perched on a stool before an easel and on the other hand carmen had often been conscious of the fumes of a tobacco pipe penetrating her cloistered seclusion and had seen across the passage vaguely enveloped in the same nicotine cloud an american olympian in a rocking chair with his feet on the mantel shelf they had once or twice met on the staircase on which occasion thatcher had greeted her with a word or two of respectful yet halfhumorous courtesya courtesy which never really offends a true woman although it often piques her selfaplomb by the slight assumption of superiority in the humorist a woman is quick to recognize the fact that the great and more dangerous passions are always serious and may be excused if in selfrespect she is often induced to try if there be not somewhere under the skin of this laughing mercutio the flesh and blood of a romeo thatcher was by nature a defender and protector weakness and weakness alone stirred the depths of his tendernessoften i fear only through its halfhumorous aspectsand on this plane he was pleased to place women and children i mention this fact for the benefit of the more youthful members of my species and am satisfied that an unconditional surrender and the complete laying down at the feet of beauty of all strong masculinity is a cheap gallicism that is untranslatable to most women worthy the winning for a woman must always look up to the man she truly loveseven if she has to go down on her knees to do it  only the masculine reader will infer from this that carmen was in love with thatcher the more critical and analytical feminine eye will see nothing herein that might not have happened consistently with friendship for thatcher was no sentimentalist he had hardly paid a compliment to the girleven in the unspoken but most delicate form of attention there were days when his room door was closed there were days succeeding these blanks when he met her as frankly and naturally as if he had seen her yesterday indeed on those days following his flight the simpleminded carmen being awareheaven knows howthat he had not opened his door during that period and fearing sickness sudden death or perhaps suicide by her appeals to the landlady assisted unwittingly in discovering his flight and defection as she was for a few moments as indignant as mrs plodgitt it is evident that she had but little sympathy with the delinquent and besides hitherto she had known only concho her earliest friend and was true to his memory as against all americanos whom she firmly believed to be his murderers  so she dismissed the offer and the man from her mind and went back to her paintinga fancy portrait of the good padre junipero serra a great missionary who haply for the integrity of his bones and character died some hundred years before the americans took possession of california the picture was fair but unsaleable and she began to think seriously of sign painting which was then much more popular and marketable an unfinished head of san juan de bautista artificially framed in clouds she disposed of to a prominent druggist for 50 where it did good service as exhibiting the effect of four bottles of joness freckle eradicator and in a pleasant and unobtrusive way revived the memory of the saint still she felt weary and was growing despondent and had a longing for the good sisters and the blameless lethargy of conventual life and then  he came  but not as the prince should come on a white charger to carry away this cruellyabused and enchanted damsel he was sunburned he was bearded like the pard he was a little careless as to his dress and preoccupied in his ways but his mouth and eyes were the same and when he repeated in his old frank halfmischievous way the invitation of his letter poor little carmen could only hesitate and blush  a thought struck him and sent the color to his face your gentleman born is always as modest as a woman he ran down stairs and seizing the widowed plodgitt said hastily  youre just killing yourself here take a change come down to monterey for a day or two with me and bring miss de haro with you for company  the old lady recognized the situation thatcher was now a man of vast possibilities in all maternal daughters of eve there is the slightest bit of the chaperone and matchmaker it is the last way of reviving the past  she consented and carmen de haro could not well refuse  the ladies found the blue mass mills very much as thatcher had previously delivered it to them a trifle rough and mannish but he made over to them the one tenement reserved for himself and slept with his men or more likely under the trees at first mrs plodgitt missed gas and running water and these several conveniences of civilization among which i fear may be mentioned sheets and pillow cases but the balsam of the mountain air soothed her neuralgia and her temper as for carmen she rioted in the unlimited license of her absolute freedom from conventional restraint and the indulgence of her childlike impulses she scoured the ledges far and wide alone she dipped into dark copses and scrambled over sterile patches of chemisal and came back laden with the spoil of buckeye blossoms manzanita berries and laurel but she would not make a sketch of the blue mass companys mills on a mercators projectionsomething that could be afterwards lithographed or chromoed with the mills turning out tons of quicksilver through the energies of a happy and picturesque assemblage of minerseven to please her padrone don royal thatcher on the contrary she made a study of the ruins of the crumbled and decayed redrock furnace with the black mountain above it and the light of a dying camp fire shining upon it and the dullred excavations in the ledge but even this did not satisfy her until she had made some alterations and when she finally brought her finished study to don royal she looked at him a little defiantly thatcher admired honestly and then criticised a little humorously and dishonestly but couldnt you for a consideration put up a signboard on that rock with the inscription road to the blue mass companys new mills to the right and combine business with art thats the fault of you geniuses but whats this blanketed figure doing here lying before the furnace you never saw one of my miners thereand a mexican too by his serape that quoth mistress carmen coolly was put in to fill up the foregroundi wanted something there to balance the picture but continued thatcher dropping into unconscious admiration again its drawn to the life tell me miss de haro before i ask the aid and counsel of mrs plodgitt who is my hated rival and your lay figure and model oh said carmen with a little sigh its only poor coucho and where is concho a little impatiently hes dead don royal dead of a verityvery deadmurdered by your countrymen i seeand you know him he was my friend  oh  truly  but wickedly isnt this a rather ghastly advertisementoutside of an illustrated newspaperof my property  ghastly don royal look you he sleeps  ay in spanish as the dead  carmen crossing herself hastily after the fashion of the dead  they were both feeling uncomfortable carmen was shivering but being a woman and tactful she recovered her head first it is a study for myself don royal i shall make you another  and she slipped away as she thought out of the subject and his presence  but she was mistaken in the evening he renewed the conversation carmen began to fence not from cowardice or deceit as the masculine reader would readily infer but from some wonderful feminine instinct that told her to be cautious but he got from her the fact to him before unknown that she was the niece of his main antagonist and being a gentleman so redoubled his attentions and his courtesy that mrs plodgitt made up her mind that it was a foregone conclusion and seriously reflected as to what she should wear on the momentous occasion but that night poor carmen cried herself to sleep resolving that she would hereafter cast aside her wicked uncle for this goodhearted americano yet never once connected her innocent penmanship with the deadly feud between them womenthe best of themare strong as to collateral facts swift of deduction but vague as children are to the exact statement or recognition of premises it is hardly necessary to say that carmen had never thought of connecting any act of hers with the claims of her uncle and the circumstance of the signature she had totally forgotten  the masculine reader will now understand carmens confusion and blushes and believe himself an ass to have thought them a confession of original affection the feminine reader will by this time become satisfied that the deceitful minxs sole idea was to gain the affections of thatcher and really i dont know who is right  nevertheless she painted a sketch of thatcherwhich now adorns the companys office in san franciscoin which the property is laid out in pleasing geometrical lines and the rosy promise of the future instinct in every touch of the brush then having earned her wage as she believed she became somewhat cold and shy to thatcher whereat that gentleman redoubled his attentions seeing only in her presence a certain meprise which concerned her more than himself the niece of his enemy meant nothing more to him than an interesting girlto be protected alwaysto be feared never but even suspicion may be insidiously placed in noble minds  mistress plodgitt thus early estopped of matchmaking of course put the blame on her own sex and went over to the stronger sidethe mans  its a great pity gals should be so curious she said sotto voce to thatcher when carmen was in one of her sullen moods yet i spose its in her blood them spaniards is always revengefullike the eyetalians  thatcher honestly looked his surprise  why dont you see shes thinking how all these lands might have been her uncles but for you and instead of trying to be sweet and here she stopped to cough  good god said thatcher in great concern i never thought of that he stopped for a moment and then added with decision i cant believe it it isnt like her  mrs p was piqued she walked away delivering however this parthian arrow well i hope taint nothing worse  thatcher chuckled then felt uneasy when he next met carmen she found his grey eyes fixed on hers with a curious halfinquisitorial look she had never noticed before this only added fuel to the fire forgetting their relations of host and guest she was absolutely rude thatcher was quiet but watchful got the plodgitt to bed early and under cover of showing a moonlight view of the lost chance mill decoyed carmen out of earshot as far as the dismantled furnace  what is the matter miss de haro have i offended you  miss carmen was not aware that anything was the matter if don royal preferred old friends whose loyalty of course he knew and who were above speaking ill against a gentleman in his adversityoh carmen fie if he preferred their company to later friendswhythe masculine reader will observe this tremendous climax and tremblewhy she didnt know why he should blame her  they turned and faced each other the conditions for a perfect misunderstanding could not have been better arranged between two people thatcher was a masculine reasoner carmen a feminine feelerif i may be pardoned the expression thatcher wanted to get at certain facts and argue therefrom carmen wanted to get at certain feelings and then fit the facts to them  but i am not blaming you miss carmen he said gravely it was stupid in me to confront you here with the property claimed by your uncle and occupied by me but it was a mistakeno he added hastily it was not a mistake you knew it and i didnt you overlooked it before you came and i was too glad to overlook it after you were here  of course said carmen pettishly i am the only one to be blamed its like you men mem she was just fifteen and uttered this awful resume of experience just as if it hadnt been taught to her in her cradle  feminine generalities always stagger a man thatcher said nothing carmen became more enraged  why did you want to take uncle victors property then she asked triumphantly  i dont know that it is your uncles property  youdontknow have you seen the application with governor micheltorenas indorsement have you heard the witnesses she said passionately  signatures may be forged and witnesses lie said thatcher quietly  what is it you call forged  thatcher instantly recalled the fact that the spanish language held no synonym for forgery the act was apparently an invention of el diablo americano so he said with a slight smile in his kindly eyes  anybody wicked enough and dexterous enough can imitate anothers handwriting when this is used to benefit fraud we call it forgery i beg your pardonmiss de haro miss carmenwhat is the matter  she had suddenly lapsed against a tree quite helpless nerveless and with staring eyes fixed on his as yet an embryo woman inexperienced and ignorant the sexs instinct was potential she had in one plunge fathomed all that his reason had been years groping for  thatcher saw only that she was pained that she was helpless that was enough it is possible that your uncle may have been deceived he began many honest men have been fooled by clever but deceitful tricksters men and women  stop madre de dios will you stop  thatcher for an instant recoiled from the flashing eyes and white face of the little figure that had with menacing and clenched baby fingers strode to his side he stopped where is this applicationthis forgery she asked show it to me  thatcher felt relieved and smiled the superior smile of our sex over feminine ignorance you could hardly expect me to be trusted with your uncles vouchers his papers of course are in the hands of his counsel  and when can i leave this place she asked passionately  if you consult my wishes you will stay if only long enough to forgive me but if i have offended you unknowingly and you are implacable  i can go tomorrow at sunrise if i like  as you will returned thatcher gravely  gracias senor  they walked slowly back to the house thatcher with a masculine sense of being unreasonably afflicted carmen with a womans instinct of being hopelessly crushed no word was spoken until they reached the door then carmen suddenly in her old impulsive way and in a childlike treble sang out merrily good night o don royal and pleasant dreams hasta manana  thatcher stood dumb and astounded at this capricious girl she saw his mystification instantly it is for the old cat she whispered jerking her thumb over her shoulder in the direction of the sleeping mrs p good nightgo  he went to give orders for a peon to attend the ladies and their equipage the next day he awoke to find miss de haro gone with her escort towards monterey and without the plodgitt  he could not conceal his surprise from the latter lady she left alonea not altogether unavailable victim to the wiles of our sexwas embarrassed but not so much that she could not say to thatcher i told you sogone to her uncle    to tell him all  all dn it what can she tell him roared thatcher stung out of his selfcontrol  nothing i hope that she should not said mrs p and chastely retired  she was right miss carmen posted to monterey running her horse nearly off its legs to do it and then sent back her beast and escort saying she would rejoin mrs plodgitt by steamer at san francisco then she went boldly to the law office of saponaceous wood district attorney and whilom solicitor of her uncle  with the majority of masculine monterey miss carmen was known and respectfully admired despite the infelix reputation of her kinsman mr wood was glad to see her and awkwardly gallant miss carmen was cool and businesslike she had come from her uncle to regard the papers in the redrock rancho case they were instantly produced carmen turned to the application for the grant her cheek paled slightly with her clear memory and wonderful fidelity of perception she could not be mistaken the signature of micheltorena was in her own handwriting  yet she looked up to the lawyer with a smile may i take these papers for an hour to my uncle  even an older and better man than the district attorney could not have resisted those drooping lids and that gentle voice  certainly  i will return them in an hour  she was as good as her word and within the hour dropped the papers and a little courtesy to her uncles legal advocate and that night took the steamer to san francisco  the next morning victor garcia a little the worse for the previous nights dissipation reeled into woods office i have fears for my niece carmen she is with the enemy he said thickly look you at this  it was an anonymous letter in mrs plodgitts own awkward fist advising him of the fact that his niece was bought by the enemy and cautioning him against her  impossible said the lawyer it was only last week she sent thee 50  victor blushed even through his ensanguined cheeks and made an impatient gesture with his hand  besides added the lawyer coolly she has been here to examine the papers at thy request and returned them of yesterday  victor gasped andyouyougave them to her  of course  all even the application and the signature  certainlyyou sent her  sent her the devils own daughter shrieked garcia no a hundred million times no quick before it is too late give to me the papers  mr wood reproduced the file garcia ran over it with trembling fingers until at last he clutched the fateful document not content with opening it and glancing at its text and signature he took it to the window  it is the same he muttered with a sigh of relief  of course it is said mr wood sharply the papers are all there youre a fool victor garcia  and so he was and for the matter of that so was mr saponaceous wood of counsel  meanwhile miss de haro returned to san francisco and resumed her work a day or two later she was joined by her landlady mrs p had too large a nature to permit an anonymous letter written by her own hand to stand between her and her demeanor to her little lodger so she coddled her and flattered her and depicted in slightly exaggerated colors the grief of don royal at her sudden departure all of which miss carmen received in a demure kittenlike way but still kept quietly at her work in due time don royals order was completed still she had leisure and inclination enough to add certain touches to her ghastly sketch of the crumbling furnace  nevertheless as don royal did not return through excess of business mrs plodgitt turned an honest penny by letting his room temporarily to two quiet mexicans who but for a beastly habit of cigarrito smoking which tainted the whole house were fair enough lodgers if they failed in making the acquaintance of their fair countrywoman miss de haro it was through the ladys preoccupation in her own work and not through their ostentatious endeavors  miss de haro is peculiar explained the politic mrs plodgitt to her guests she makes no acquaintances which i consider bad for her business if it had not been for me she would not have known royal thatcher the great quicksilver minerand had his order for a picture of his mine  the two foreign gentlemen exchanged glances one said ah god this is bad and the other it is not possible and then when the landladys back was turned introduced themselves with a skeleton key into the then vacant bedroom and studio of their fair countrywoman who was absent sketching thou observest said mr pedro refugee to miguel execclesiastic that this americano is allpowerful and that this victor drunkard as he is is right in his suspicions  of a verity yes replied miguel thou dost remember it was jovita castro who for her americano lover betrayed the sobriente claim it is only with us my pedro that the mexican spirit the real god and liberty yet lives  they shook hands nobly and with sentimental fervor and then went to work i e the rummaging over the trunks drawers and portmanteaus of the poor little painter carmen de haro and even ripped up the mattress of her virginal cot but they found not what they sought  what is that yonder on the easel covered with a cloth said miguel it is a trick of these artists to put their valuables together  pedro strode to the easel and tore away the muslin curtain that veiled it then uttered a shriek that appalled his comrade and brought him to his side  in the name of god said miguel hastily are you trying to alarm the house  the exvaquero was trembling like a child look he said hoarsely look do you see it is the hand of god and fainted on the floor  miguel looked it was carmens partlyfinished sketch of the deserted furnace the figure of concho thrown out strongly by the camp fire occupied the left foreground but to balance her picture she had evidently been obliged to introduce anotherthe face and figure of pedro on all fours creeping towards the sleeping man     part iiiin congress    chapter x  who lobbied for it   it was a midsummers day in washington even at early morning while the sun was yet level with the faces of pedestrians in its broad shadeless avenues it was insufferably hot later the avenues themselves shone like the diverging rays of another sunthe capitola thing to be feared by the naked eye later yet it grew hotter and then a mist arose from the potomac and blotted out the blazing arch above and presently piled up along the horizon delusive thunder clouds that spent their strength and substance elsewhere and left it hotter than before towards evening the sun came out invigorated having cleared the heavenly brow of perspiration but leaving its fever unabated  the city was deserted the few who remained apparently buried themselves from the garish light of day in some dim cloistered recess of shop hotel or restaurant and the perspiring stranger dazed by the outer glare who broke in upon their quiet sequestered repose confronted collarless and coatless specters of the past with fans in their hands who after dreamily going through some perfunctory business immediately retired to sleep after the stranger had gone congressmen and senators had long since returned to their several constituencies with the various information that the country was going to ruin or that the outlook never was more hopeful and cheering as the tastes of their constituency indicated a few cabinet officers still lingered having by this time become convinced that they could do nothing their own way or indeed in any way but the old way and getting gloomily resigned to their situation a body of learned cultivated men representing the highest legal tribunal in the land still lingered in a vague idea of earning the scant salary bestowed upon them by the economical founders of the government and listened patiently to the arguments of counsel whose fees for advocacy of claims before them would have paid the life income of half the bench there was mr attorneygeneral and his assistants still protecting the governments millions from rapacious hands and drawing the yearly public pittance that their wealthier private antagonists would have scarce given as a retainer to their junior counsel the little standing army of departmental employesthe helpless victims of the most senseless and idiotic form of discipline the world has knowna discipline so made up of caprice expediency cowardice and tyranny that its reform meant revolution not to be tolerated by legislators and lawgivers or a despotism in which half a dozen accidentallychosen men interpreted their prejudices or preferences as being that reform administration after administration and party after party had persisted in their desperate attempts to fit the youthful colonial garments made by our fathers after a bygone fashion over the expanded limits and generous outline of a matured nation there were patches here and there there were grievous rents and holes here and there there were ludicrous and painful exposures of growing limbs everywhere and the party in power and the party out of power could do nothing but mend and patch and revamp and cleanse and scour and occasionally in the wildness of despair suggest even the cutting off the rebellious limbs that persisted in growing beyond the swaddling clothes of its infancy  it was a capital of contradictions and inconsistencies at one end of the avenue sat the responsible high keeper of the military honor valor and warlike prestige of a great nation without the power to pay his own troops their legal dues until some selfish quarrel between party and party was settled hard by sat another secretary whose established functions seemed to be the misrepresentation of the nation abroad by the least characteristic of its classes the politiciansand only then when they had been defeated as politicians and when their constituents had declared them no longer worthy to be even their representatives this national absurdity was only equaled by another wherein an expolitician was for four years expected to uphold the honor of a flag of a great nation over an ocean he had never tempted with a discipline the rudiments of which he could scarcely acquire before he was removed or his term of office expired receiving his orders from a superior officer as ignorant of his special duties as himself and subjected to the revision of a congress cognizant of him only as a politician at the farther end of the avenue was another department so vast in its extent and so varied in its functions that few of the really great practical workers of the land would have accepted its responsibility for ten times its salary but which the most perfect constitution in the world handed over to men who were obliged to make it a stepping stone to future preferment there was another department more suggestive of its financial functions from the occasional extravagances or economies exhibited in its payrollssuccessive congresses having taken other matters out of its handspresided over by an official who bore the title and responsibility of the custodian and disburser of the nations purse and received a salary that a bankpresident would have sniffed at for it was part of this constitutional inconsistency and administrative absurdity that in the matter of honor justice fidelity to trust and even business integrity the official was always expected to be the superior of the government he represented yet the crowning inconsistency was that from time to time it was submitted to the sovereign people to declare if these various inconsistencies were not really the perfect expression of the most perfect government the world had known and it is to be recorded that the unanimous voices of representative orator and unfettered poetry were that it was  even the public press lent itself to the great inconsistency it was as clear as crystal to the journal on one side of the avenue that the country was going to the dogs unless the spirit of the fathers once more reanimated the public it was equally clear to the journal on the other side of the avenue that only a rigid adherence to the letter of the fathers would save the nation from decline it was obvious to the firstnamed journal that the letter meant government patronage to the other journal it was patent to that journal that the shekels of senator x really animated the spirit of the fathers yet all agreed it was a great and good and perfect governmentsubject only to the predatory incursions of a hydraheaded monster known as a ring the rings origin was wrapped in secrecy its fecundity was alarming but although its rapacity was preternatural its digestion was perfect and easy it circumvolved all affairs in an atmosphere of mystery it clouded all things with the dust and ashes of distrust all disappointment of place of avarice of incompetency or ambition was clearly attributable to it it even permeated private and social life there were rings in our kitchen and household service in our public schools that kept the active intelligences of our children passive there were rings of engaging handsome dissolute young fellows who kept us moral but unengaging seniors from the favors of the fair there were subtle conspiring rings among our creditors which sent us into bankruptcy and restricted our credit in fact it would not be hazardous to say that all that was calamitous in public and private experience was clearly traceable to that combination of power in a minority over weakness in a majorityknown as a ring  haply there was a body of demigods as yet uninvoked who should speedily settle all that when smith of minnesota robinson of vermont and jones of georgia returned to congress from these rural seclusions so potent with information and so freed from local prejudices it was understood vaguely that great things would be done this was always understood there never was a time in the history of american politics when to use the expression of the journals before alluded to the present session of congress did not bid fair to be the most momentous in our history and did not as far as the facts go leave a vast amount of unfinished important business lying hopelessly upon its desks having bolted the rest as rashly and with as little regard to digestion or assimilation as the american traveller has for his railway refreshment  in this capital on this languid midsummer day in an upper room of one of its secondrate hotels the honorable pratt c gashwiler sat at his writingtable there are certain large fleshy men with whom the omission of even a necktie or collar has all the effect of an indecent exposure the hon mr gashwiler in his trousers and shirt was a sight to be avoided by the modest eye there were such palpable suggestions of vast extents of unctuous flesh in the slight glimpse offered by his open throat that his dishabille should have been as private as his business nevertheless when there was a knock at his door he unhesitatingly said come inpushing away a goblet crowned with a certain aromatic herb with his right hand while he drew towards him with his left a few proof slips of his forthcoming speech the gashwiler brow became as it were intelligently abstracted  the intruder regarded gashwiler with a glance of familiar recognition from his right eye while his left took in a rapid survey of the papers on the table and gleamed sardonically  you are at work i see he said apologetically  yes replied the congressman with an air of perfunctory wearinessone of my speeches those dd printers make such a mess of it i suppose i dont write a very fine hand  if the gifted gashwiler had added that he did not write a very intelligent hand or a very grammatical hand and that his spelling was faulty he would have been truthful although the copy and proof before him might not have borne him out the near fact was that the speech was composed and written by one expectant dobbs a poor retainer of gashwiler and the honorable members labor as a proofreader was confined to the introduction of such words as anarchy oligarchy satrap palladium and arguseyed in the proof with little relevancy as to position or place and no perceptible effect as to argument  the stranger saw all this with his wicked left eye but continued to beam mildly with his right removing the coat and waistcoat of gashwiler from a chair he drew it towards the table pushing aside a portly loudticking watchthe very image of gashwilerthat lay beside him and resting his elbows on the proofs said  well  have you anything new asked the parliamentary gashwiler  much a woman replied the stranger  the astute gashwiler waiting further information concluded to receive this fact gaily and gallantly a womanmy dear mr wilesof course the dear creatures he continued with a fat offensive chuckle somehow are always making their charming presence felt ha ha a man sir in public life becomes accustomed to that sort of thing and knows when he must be agreeableagreeable sir but firm ive had my experience sirmy own experienceand the congressman leaned back in his chair not unlike a robust st anthony who had withstood one temptation to thrive on another  yes said wiles impatiently but dn it shes on the other side  the other side repeated gashwiler vacantly  yes shes a niece of garcias a little she devil  but garcias on our side rejoined gashwiler  yes but she is bought by the ring  a woman sneered mr gashwiler what can she do with men who wont be made fools of is she so handsome  i never saw any great beauty in her said wiles shortly although they say that shes rather caught that dd thatcher in spite of his coldness at any rate she is his protegee but she isnt the sort youre thinking of gashwiler they say she knows or pretends to know something about the grant she may have got hold of some of her uncles papers those greasers were always dd fools and if he did anything foolish like as not he bungled or didnt cover up his tracks and with his knowledge and facilities too why if id but here mr wiles stopped to sigh over the inequalities of fortune that wasted opportunities on the less skillful scamp  mr gashwiler became dignified she can do nothing with us he said potentially  wiles turned his wicked eye on him manuel and miguel who sold out to our man are afraid of her they were our witnesses i verily believe theyd take back everything if she got after them and as for pedro he thinks she holds the power of life and death over him  pedro life and deathwhats all this said the astonished gashwiler  wiles saw his blunder but saw also that he had gone too far to stop pedro he said was strongly suspected of having murdered concho one of the original locators  mr gashwiler turned white as a sheet and then flushed again into an apoplectic glow do you dare to say he began as soon as he could find his tongue and his legs for in the exercise of his congressional functions these extreme members supported each otherdo you mean to say he stammered in rising rage that you have dared to deceive an american lawgiver into legislating upon a measure connected with a capital offense do i understand you to say sir that murder stands upon the recordstands upon the record sirof this cause to which as a representative of remus i have lent my official aid do you mean to say that you have deceived my constituency whose sacred trust i hold in inveigling me to hiding a crime from the argus eyes of justice and mr gashwiler looked towards the bellpull as if about to summon a servant to witness this outrage against the established judiciary  the murder if it was a murder took place before garcia entered upon this claim or had a footing in this court returned wiles blandly and is no part of the record  you are sure it is not spread upon the record  i am you can judge for yourself  mr gashwiler walked to the window returned to the table finished his liquor in a single gulp and then with a slight resumption of dignity said  that alters the case  wiles glanced with his left eye at the congressman the right placidly looked out of the window presently he said quietly ive brought you the certificates of stock do you wish them made out in your own name  mr gashwiler tried hard to look as if he were trying to recall the meaning of wiless words ohahumphlet me seeoh yes the certificatescertainly of course you will make them out in the name of my secretary mr expectant dobbs they will perhaps repay him for the extra clerical labor required in the prosecution of your claim he is a worthy young man although not a public officer yet he is so near to me that perhaps i am wrong in permitting him to accept a fee for private interests an american representative cannot be too cautious mr wiles perhaps you had better have also a blank transfer the stock is i understand yet in the future mr dobbs though talented and praiseworthy is poor he may wish to realize if someahem some friendbetter circumstanced should choose to advance the cash to him and run the riskwhy it would only be an act of kindness  you are proverbially generous mr gashwiler said wiles opening and shutting his left eye like a dark lantern on the benevolent representative  youth when faithful and painstaking should be encouraged replied mr gashwiler i lately had occasion to point this out in a few remarks i had to make before the sabbath school reunion at remus thank you i will see that they areahemconveyed to him i shall give them to him with my own hand he concluded falling back in his chair as if the better to contemplate the perspective of his own generosity and condescension mr wiles took his hat and turned to go before he reached the door mr gashwiler returned to the social level with a chuckle  you say this woman this garcias niece is handsome and smart  yes  i can set another woman on the track thatll euchre her every time  mr wiles was too clever to appear to notice the sudden lapse in the congressmans dignity and only said with his right eye  can you  by gd i will or i dont know how to represent remus  mr wiles thanked him with his right eye and looked a dagger with his left good he said and added persuasively does she live here  the congressman nodded assent an awfully handsome womana particular friend of mine mr gashwiler here looked as if he would not mind to have been rallied a little over his intimacy with the fair one but the astute mr wiles was at the same moment making up his mind after interpreting the congressmans look and manner that he must know this fair incognita if he wished to sway gashwiler he determined to bide his time and withdrew  the door was scarcely closed upon him when another knock diverted mr gashwilers attention from his proofs the door opened to a young man with sandy hair and anxious face he entered the room deprecatingly as if conscious of the presence of a powerful being to be supplicated and feared mr gashwiler did not attempt to disabuse his mind busy you see he said shortly correcting your work  i hope it is acceptable said the young man timidly  wellyesit will do said gashwiler indeed i may say it is satisfactory on the whole he added with the appearance of a large generosity quite satisfactory  you have no news i suppose continued the young man with a slight flush born of pride or expectation  no nothing as yet mr gashwiler paused as if a thought had struck him  i have thought he said finally that some positionsuch as a secretaryship with mewould help you to a better appointment now supposing that i make you my private secretary giving you some important and confidential business eh  dobbs looked at his patron with a certain wistful doglike expectancy moved himself excitedly on his chair seat in a peculiar caninelike anticipation of gratitude strongly suggesting that he would have wagged his tail if he had one at which mr gashwiler became more impressive  indeed i may say i anticipated it by certain papers i have put in your charge and in your name only taking from you a transfer that might enable me to satisfy my conscience hereafter in recommending you as myahemprivate secretary perhaps as a mere form you might now while you are here put your name to these transfers and so to speak begin your duties at once  the glow of pride and hope that mantled the cheek of poor dobbs might have melted a harder heart than gashwilers but the senatorial toga had invested mr gashwiler with a more than roman stoicism towards the feelings of others and he only fell back in his chair in the pose of conscious rectitude as dobbs hurriedly signed the paper  i shall place them in my portmantell said gashwiler suiting the word to the action for safe keeping i need not inform you who are now as it were on the threshold of official life that perfect and inviolable secrecy in all affairs of statemr g here motioned toward his portmanteau as if it contained a treaty at leastis most essential and necessary  dobbs assented then my duties will keep me with you here he asked doubtfully  no no said gashwiler hastily then correcting himself he added that isfor the presentno  poor dobbss face fell the near fact was that he had lately had notice to quit his present lodgings in consequence of arrears in his rent and he had a hopeful reliance that his confidential occupation would carry bread and lodging with it but he only asked if there were any new papers to make out  ahem not at present the fact is i am obliged to give so much of my time to callersi have today been obliged to see half a dozenthat i must lock myself up and say not at home for the rest of the day feeling that this was an intimation that the interview was over the new private secretary a little dashed as to his near hopes but still sanguine of the future humbly took his leave  but here a certain providence perhaps mindful of poor dobbs threw into his simple handsto be used or not if he were worthy or capable of using ita certain power and advantage he had descended the staircase and was passing through the lower corridor when he was made the unwilling witness of a remarkable assault  it appeared that mr wiles who had quitted gashwilers presence as dobbs was announced had other business in the hotel and in pursuance of it had knocked at room no 90 in response to the gruff voice that bade him enter mr wiles opened the door and espied the figure of a tall muscular fierybearded man extended on the bed with the bedclothes carefully tucked under his chin and his arms lying flat by his side  mr wiles beamed with his right cheek and advanced to the bed as if to take the hand of the stranger who however neither by word or sign responded to his salutation  perhaps im intruding said mr wiles blandly  perhaps you are said red beard dryly  mr wiles forced a smile on his right cheek which he turned to the smiter but permitted the left to indulge in unlimited malevolence i wanted merely to know if you have looked into that matter he said meekly  ive looked into it and round it and across it and over it and through it responded the man gravely with his eyes fixed on wiles  and you have perused all the papers continued mr wiles  ive read every paper every speech every affidavit every decision every argument said the stranger as if repeating a formula  mr wiles attempted to conceal his embarrassment by an easy righthanded smile that went off sardonically on the left and continued then i hope my dear sir that having thoroughly mastered the case you are inclined to be favorable to us  the gentleman in the bed did not reply but apparently nestled more closely beneath the coverlids  i have brought the shares i spoke of continued mr wiles insinuatingly  hev you a friend within call interrupted the recumbent man gently  i dont quite understand smiled mr wiles of course any name you might suggest  hev you a friend any chap that you might waltz in here at a moments call continued the man in bed no do you know any of them waiters in the house thars a bell over yan and he motioned with his eyes towards the wall but did not otherwise move his body  no said wiles becoming slightly suspicious and wrathful  mebbe a stranger might do i reckon thars one passin in the hall call him inhell do  wiles opened the door a little impatiently yet inquisitively as dobbs passed the man in bed called out oh stranger and as dobbs stopped said come yar  dobbs entered a little timidly as was his habit with strangers  i dont know who you benor care i reckon said the stranger this yer manpointing to wilesis wiles im josh sibblee of fresno member of congress from the 4th congressional district of californy im jist lying here with a derringer into each handjist lying here kivered up and holdin in ony to keep from blowin the top o this dd skunks head off i kinder feel i cant hold in any longer what i want to say to ye stranger is that this yer skunkwhich his name is wileshez bin tryin his ddest to get a bribe onto josh and josh outo respect for his constituents is jist waitin for some stranger to waltz in and stop the ddest fight  but my dear mr sibblee there must be some mistake said wiles earnestly  mistake strip me  no no said wiles hurriedly as the simpleminded dobbs was about to draw down the coverlid  take him away said the hon mr sibblee before i disgrace my constituency they said id be in jail afore i get through the session ef youve got any humanity stranger snake him out and powful quick too  dobbs quite white and aghast looked at wiles and hesitated there was a slight movement in the bed both men started for the door and the next minute it closed very decidedly on the member from fresno   chapter xi  how it was lobbied for   the hon pratt c gashwiler mc was of course unaware of the incident described in the last chapter his secret even if it had been discovered by dobbs was safe in that gentlemans innocent and honorable hands and certainly was not of a quality that mr wiles at present would have cared to expose for in spite of mr wiless discomfiture he still had enough experience of character to know that the irate member from fresno would be satisfied with his own peculiar manner of vindicating his own personal integrity and would not make a public scandal of it again wiles was convinced that dobbs was equally implicated with gashwiler and would be silent for his own sake so that poor dobbs as is too often the fate of simple but weak natures had full credit for duplicity by every rascal in the land  from which it may be inferred that nothing occurred to disturb the security of gashwiler when the door closed upon mr wiles he indited a note which with a costly but exceedingly distasteful bouquetrearranged by his own fat fingers and discord and incongruity visible in every combination of colorhe sent off by a special messenger then he proceeded to make his toiletan operation rarely graceful or picturesque in our sex and an insult to the spectator when obesity is superadded when he had put on a clean shirt of which there was grossly too much and added a white waistcoat that seemed to accent his rotundity he completed his attire with a black frock coat of the latest style and surveyed himself complacently before a mirror it is to be recorded that however satisfactory the result might have been to mr gashwiler it was not so to the disinterested spectator there are some men on whom that deformed thief fashion avenges himself by making their clothes appear perennially new the gloss of the tailors iron never disappears the creases of the shelf perpetually rise in judgment against the wearer novelty was the general suggestion of mr gashwilers fulldressit was never his habitudeand our own make nobby and the latest style only 15 was as patent on the legislators broad back as if it still retained the shopmans ticket  thus arrayed within an hour he complacently followed the note and his floral offering the house he sought had been once the residence of a foreign ambassador who had loyally represented his government in a single unimportant treaty now forgotten and in various receptions and dinners still actively remembered by occasional visits to its salon now the average dreary american parlor dear me the fascinating mr x would say but do you know love in this very room i remember meeting the distinguished marquis of monte pio or perhaps the fashionable jones of the state department instantly crushed the decayed friend he was perfunctorily visiting by saying pon my soul you herewhy the last time i was in this room i gossiped for an hour with the countess de castenet in that very corner for with the recall of the aforesaid ambassador the mansion had become a boardingplace kept by the wife of a departmental clerk  perhaps there was nothing in the history of the house more quaint and philosophic than the story of its present occupant roger fauquier had been a departmental clerk for forty years it was at once his practical good luck and his misfortune to have been early appointed to a position which required a thorough and complete knowledge of the formulas and routine of a department that expended millions of the public funds fauquier on a poor salary diminishing instead of increasing with his service had seen successive administrations bud and blossom and decay but had kept his position through the fact that his knowledge was a necessity to the successive chiefs and employes once it was true that he had been summarily removed by a new secretary to make room for a camp follower whose exhaustive and intellectual services in a political campaign had made him eminently fit for anything but the alarming discovery that the new clerks knowledge of grammar and etymology was even worse than that of the secretary himself and that through ignorance of detail the business of that department was retarded to a damage to the government of over half a million of dollars led to the reinstatement of mr fauquierat a lower salary for it was felt that something was wrong somewhere and as it had always been the custom of congress and the administration to cut down salaries as the first step to reform they made of mr fauquier a moral example a gentleman born of somewhat expensive tastes having lived up to his former salary this change brought another breadwinner into the field mrs fauquier who tried more or less unsuccessfully to turn her old southern habits of hospitality to remunerative account but as poor fauquier could never be prevailed upon to present a bill to a gentleman sir and as some of the scions of the best southern families were still waiting for or had been recently dismissed from a position the experiment was a pecuniary failure yet the house was of excellent repute and well patronized indeed it was worth something to see old fauquier sitting at the head of his own table in something of his ancestral style relating anecdotes of great men now dead and gone interrupted only by occasional visits from importunate tradesmen  prominent among what mr fauquier called his little family was a blackeyed lady of great powers of fascination and considerable local reputation as a flirt nevertheless these social aberrations were amply condoned by a facile and complacent husband who looked with a lenient and even admiring eye upon the little ladys amusement and to a certain extent lent a tacit indorsement to her conduct nobody minded hopkinson in the blaze of mrs hopkinsons fascinations he was completely lost sight of a few married women with unduly sensitive husbands and several single ladies of the best and longest standing reflected severely on her conduct the younger men of course admired her but i think she got her chief support from old fogies like ourselves for it is your quiet selfconceited complacent philosophic broadwaisted paterfamilias who after all is the one to whom the gay and giddy of the proverbially impulsive unselfish sex owe their place in the social firmament we are never inclined to be captious we laugh at as a folly what our wives and daughters condemn as a fault our withers are unwrung yet we still confess to the fascinations of a pretty face we know bless us from dear experience the exact value of one womans opinion of another we want our brilliant little friend to shine it is only the moths who will burn their twopenny immature wings in the flame and why should they not nature has been pleased to supply more moths than candles go togive the pretty creaturebe she maid wife or widowa show and so my dear sir while materfamilias bends her black brows in disgust we smile our superior little smile and extend to mistress anonyma our gracious indorsement and if giddiness is grateful or if folly is friendlywell of course we cant help that indeed it rather proves our theory  i had intended to say something about hopkinson but really there is very little to say he was invariably good humored a few ladies once tried to show him that he really ought to feel worse than he did about the conduct of his wife and it is recorded that hopkinson in an excess of good humor and kindliness promised to do so indeed the good fellow was so accessible that it is said that young delancy of the tape department confided to hopkinson his jealousy of a rival and revealed the awful secret that he delancy had reason to expect more loyalty from his hopkinsons wife the good fellow is reported to have been very sympathetic and to have promised delaney to lend whatever influence he had with mrs hopkinson in his favor you see he said explanatorily to delancy she has a good deal to attend to lately and i suppose has got rather carelessthats womens ways but if i cant bring her round ill speak to gashwilerill get him to use his influence with mrs hop so cheer up my boy hell make it all right  the appearance of a bouquet on the table of mrs hopkinson was no rare event nevertheless mr gashwilers was not there its hideous contrasts had offended her womans eyeit is observable that good taste survives the wreck of all the other feminine virtuesand she had distributed it to make boutonnieres for other gentlemen yet when he appeared she said to him hastily putting her little hand over the cardiac region  im so glad you came but you gave me such a fright an hour ago  mr gashwiler was both pleased and astounded what have i done my dear mrs hopkinson he began  oh dont talk she said sadly what have you done indeed why you sent me that beautiful bouquet i could not mistake your taste in the arrangement of the flowersbut my husband was here you know his jealousy i was obliged to conceal it from him neverpromise me nownever do it again  mr gashwiler gallantly protested  no i am serious i was so agitated he must have seen me blush  nothing but the gross flattery to this speech could have clouded its manifest absurdity to the gashwiler consciousness but mr gashwiler had already succumbed to the girlish halftimidity with which it was uttered nevertheless he could not help saying  but why should he be so jealous now only day before yesterday i saw simpson of duluth hand you a nosegay right before him  ah returned the lady he was outwardly calm then but you know nothing of the scene that occurred between us after you left  but gasped the practical gashwiler simpson had given your husband that contracta cool fifty thousand in his pocket  mrs hopkinson looked as dignifiedly at gashwiler as was consistent with five feet three the extra three inches being a pyramidal structure of strawcolored hair a frond of faint curls a pair of laughing blue eyes and a small belted waist then she said with a casting down of her lids  you forget that my husband loves me and for once the minx appeared to look penitent it was becoming but as it had been originally practiced in a simple white dress relieved only with paleblue ribbons it was not entirely in keeping with beflounced lavender and rosecolored trimmings yet the woman who hesitates between her moral expression and the harmony of her dress is lost and mrs hopkinson was victrix by her very audacity  mr gashwiler was flattered the most dissolute man likes the appearance of virtue but graces and accomplishments like yours dear mrs hopkinson he said oleaginously belong to the whole country which with something between a courtesy and a strut he endeavored to represent and i shall want to avail myself of all he added in the matter of the castro claim a little supper at welckers a glass or two of champagne and a single flash of those bright eyes and the thing is done  but said mrs hopkinson ive promised josiah that i would give up all those frivolities and although my conscience is clear you know how people talk josiah hears it why only last night at a reception at the patagonian ministers every woman in the room gossiped about me because i led the german with him as if a married woman whose husband was interested in the government could not be civil to the representative of a friendly power  mr gashwiler did not see how mr hopkinsons late contract for supplying salt pork and canned provisions to the army of the united states should make his wife susceptible to the advances of foreign princes but he prudently kept that to himself still not being himself a diplomat he could not help saying  but i understood that mr hopkinson did not object to your interesting yourself in this claim and you know some of the stock  the lady started and said  stock dear mr gashwiler for heavens sake dont mention that hideous name to me stock i am sick of it have you gentlemen no other topic for a lady  she punctuated her sentence with a mischievous look at her interlocutor for a second time i regret to say that mr gashwiler succumbed the roman constituency at remus it is to be hoped were happily ignorant of this last defection of their great legislator mr gashwiler instantly forgot his themebegan to ply the lady with a certain bovinelike gallantry which it is to be said to her credit she parried with a playful terrierlike dexterity when the servant suddenly announced mr wiles  gashwiler started not so mrs hopkinson who however prudently and quietly removed her own chair several inches from gashwilers  do you know mr wiles she asked pleasantly  no that is iahyes i may say i have had some business relations with him responded gashwiler rising  wont you stay she added pleadingly do  mr gashwilers prudence always got the better of his gallantry not now he responded in some nervousness perhaps i had better go now in view of what you have just said about gossip you need not mention my name to thiserthismr wiles and with one eye on the door and an awkward dash of his lips at the ladys fingers he withdrew  there was no introductory formula to mr wiless interview he dashed at once in medias res gashwiler knows a woman that he says can help us against that spanish girl who is coming here with proofs prettiness fascination and what not you must find her out  why asked the lady laughingly  because i dont trust that gashwiler a woman with a pretty face and an ounce of brains could sell him out aye and us with him  oh say two ounces of brains mr wiles mr gashwiler is no fool  possibly except when your sex is concerned and it is very likely that the woman is his superior  i should think so said mrs hopkinson with a mischievous look  ah you know her then  not so well as i know him said mrs h quite seriously i wish i did  well youll find out if shes to be trusted you are laughingit is a serious matter this woman  mrs hopkinson dropped him a charming courtesy and said  cest moi   chapter xii  a race for it   royal thatcher worked hard that the boyish little painter who shared his hospitality at the blue mass mine should afterward have little part in his active life seemed not inconsistent with his habits at present the mine was his only mistress claiming his entire time exasperating him with fickleness but still requiring that supreme devotion of which his nature was capable it is possible that miss carmen saw this too and so set about with feminine tact if not to supplement at least to make her rival less pertinacious and absorbing apart from this object she zealously labored in her profession yet with small pecuniary result i fear local art was at a discount in california the scenery of the country had not yet become famous rather it was reserved for a certain eastern artist already famous to make it so and people cared little for the reproduction under their very noses of that which they saw continually with their own eyes and valued not so that little mistress carmen was fain to divert her artist soul to support her plump little material body and made divers excursions into the regions of ceramic art painting on velvet illuminating missals decorating china and the like i have in my possession some wax flowersa startling fuchsia and a bewildering dahliasold for a mere pittance by this little lady whose pictures lately took the prize at a foreign exhibition shortly after she had been half starved by a california public and claimed by a california press as its fostered child of genius  of these struggles and triumphs thatcher had no knowledge yet he was perhaps more startled than he would own to himself when one december day he received this despatch come to washington at oncecarmen de haro  carmen de haro i grieve to state that such was the preoccupation of this man elected by fate to be the hero of the solitary amatory episode of his story that for a moment he could not recall her when the honest little figure that had so manfully stood up against him and had proved her sex by afterwards running away from him came back at last to his memory he was at first mystified and then selfreproachful he had been he felt vaguely untrue to himself he had been remiss to the selfconfessed daughter of his enemy yet why should she telegraph to him and what was she doing in washington to all these speculations it is to be said to his credit that he looked for no sentimental or romantic answer royal thatcher was naturally modest and selfdepreciating in his relations to the other sex as indeed most men who are apt to be successful with women generally are despite a vast degree of superannuated bosh to the contrary to the half dozen women who are startled by sheer audacity into submission there are scores who are piqued by a selfrespectful patience and where a women has to do half the wooing she generally makes a pretty sure thing of it  in his bewilderment thatcher had overlooked a letter lying on his table it was from his washington lawyer the concluding paragraph caught his eyeperhaps it would be well if you came here yourself roscommon is here and they say there is a niece of garcias lately appeared who is likely to get up a strong social sympathy for the old mexican i dont know that they expect to prove anything by her but im told she is attractive and clever and has enlisted the sympathies of the delegation thatcher laid the letter down a little indignantly strong men are quite as liable as weak women are to sudden inconsistencies on any question they may have in common what right had this poor little bud he had cherishedhe was quite satisfied now that he had cherished her and really had suffered from her absencewhat right had she to suddenly blossom in the sunshine of power to be perhaps plucked and worn by one of his enemies he did not agree with his lawyer that she was in any way connected with his enemies he trusted to her masculine loyalty that far but here was something vaguely dangerous to the feminine mindposition flattery power he was almost as firmly satisfied now that he had been wronged and neglected as he had been positive a few moments before that he had been remiss in his attention the irritation although momentary was enough to decide this strong man he telegraphed to san francisco and having missed the steamer secured an overland passage to washington thought better of it and partly changed his mind an hour after the ticket was purchased but manlike having once made a practical step in a wrong direction he kept on rather than admit an inconsistency to himself yet he was not entirely satisfied that his journey was a business one the impulsive weak little mistress carmen had prudently scored one against the strong man  only a small part of the present great transcontinental railway at this time had been built and was but piers at either end of a desolate and wild expanse as yet unbridged when the overland traveller left the rail at reno he left as it were civilization with it and until he reached the nebraska frontier the rest of his road was only the old emigrant trail traversed by the coaches of the overland company excepting a part of devils canyon the way was unpicturesque and flat and the passage of the rocky mountains far from suggesting the alleged poetry of that region was only a reminder of those sterile distances of a level new england landscape  the journey was a dreary monotony that was scarcely enlivened by its discomforts never amounting to actual accident or incident but utterly destructive to all nervous tissue insanity often supervened on the third day out said hank monk driver speaking casually but charitably of a fareon the third day out after axing no end of questions and getting no answers he took to chewing straws that he picked outer the cushion and kussin to hisself from that very day i knew it was all over with him and i handed him over to his friends at shy ann strapped to the back seat and ravin and cussin at ben holliday the gentmanly proprietor it is presumed that the unfortunate tourists indignation was excited at the late mr benjamin holliday then the proprietor of the linean evidence of his insanity that no one who knew that largehearted fastidious and elegantlycultured californian since allied to foreign nobility will for a moment doubt  mr royal thatcher was too old and experienced a mountaineer to do aught but accept patiently and cynically his brother californians method of increasing his profits as it was generally understood that any one who came from california by that route had some dark design the victim received little sympathy thatchers equable temperament and indomitable will stood him in good stead and helped him cheerfully in this emergency he ate his scant meals and otherwise took care of the functions of his weak human nature when and where he could without grumbling and at times earned even the praise of his driver by his ability to rough it which roughing it by the way meant the ability of the passengers to accept the incompetency of the company it is true there were times when he regretted that he had not taken the steamer but then he reflected that he was one of a vigilance committee sworn to hang that admirable man the late commodore cornelius vanderbilt for certain practices and cruelties done upon the bodies of certain steerage passengers by his line and for divers irregularities in their transportation i mention this fact merely to show how so practical and stout a voyager as thatcher might have confounded the perplexities attending the administration of a great steamship company with selfish greed and brutality and that he with other californians may not have known the fact since recorded by the commodores family clergyman that the great millionaire was always true to the hymns of his childhood  nevertheless thatcher found time to be cheerful and helpful to his fellow passengers and even to be so far interesting to yuba bill the driver as to have the box seat placed at his disposal but said thatcher in some concern the box seat was purchased by that other gentleman in sacramento he paid extra for it and his names on your waybill that said yuba bill scornfully dont fetch me even ef hed chartered the whole shebang look yar do you reckon im goin to spile my temper by setting next to a man with a game eye and such an eye gewhillikins why darn my skin the other day when we war watering at websters he got down and passed in front of the offleaderthat yer pinto colt thats bin accustomed to injins grizzlies and buffalo and im bless ef when her eye tackled his ef she didnt jist git up and rar round that i reckoned id hev to go down and take them blinders off from her eyes and clap on his but he paid the money and is entitled to his seat persisted thatcher mebbe he isin the office of the kempeny growled yuba bill but its time some folks knowed that out in the plains i run this yer team myselfa fact which was selfevident to most of the passengers i suppose his authority is as absolute on this dreary waste as a ship captains in mid ocean exclaimed thatcher to the balefuleyed stranger mr wileswhom the reader has recognizedassented with the public side of his face but looked vengeance at yuba bill with the other while thatcher innocent of the presence of one of his worst enemies placated bill so far as to restore wiles to his rights wiles thanked him shall i have the pleasure of your company far wiles asked insinuatingly to washington replied thatcher frankly washington is a gay city during the session again suggested the stranger im going on business said thatcher bluntly  a trifling incident occurred at pinetree crossing which did not heighten yuba bills admiration of the stranger as bill opened the doublelocked box in the boot of the coachsacred to wells fargo  cos express and the overland companys treasuresmr wiles perceived a small black morocco portemanteau among the parcels ah you carry baggage there too he said sweetly not often responded yuba bill shortly ah this then contains valuables it belongs to that man whose seat youve got said yuba bill who for insulting purposes of his own preferred to establish the fiction that wiles was an interloper and ef he reckons in a sorter mixed kempeny like this to lock up his portmantle i dont know whos business it is who continued bill lashing himself into a simulated rage who in blank is running this yer team hey mebbe you think sittin up thar on the box seat you are mebbe you think you kin see round corners with that thar eye and kin pull up for teams round corners on down grades a mile ahead but here thatcher who with something of lancelots concern for modred had a noble pity for all infirmities interfered so sternly that yuba bill stopped  on the fourth day they struck a blinding snowstorm while ascending the dreary plateau that henceforward for six hundred miles was to be their roadbed the horses after floundering through the drift gave out completely on reaching the next station and the prospects ahead to all but the experienced eye looked doubtful a few passengers advised taking to sledges others a postponement of the journey until the weather changed yuba bill alone was for pressing forward as they were two miles more and were on the high grade whar the wind is strong enough to blow you through the windy and jist peart enough to pack away over them cliffs every inch of snow that falls ill jist skirmish round in and out o them drifts on these four wheels whar ye cant drag one o them flatbottomed drygoods boxes through a drift bill had a california whips contempt for a sledge but he was warmly seconded by thatcher who had the next best thing to experience the instinct that taught him to read character and take advantage of another mans experience them that wants to stop kin do so said bill authoritatively cutting the gordian knot them as wants to take a sledge can do sothars one in the barn them as wants to go on with me and the relay will come on mr wiles selected the sledge and a driver a few remained for the next stage and thatcher with two others decided to accompany yuba bill these changes took up some valuable time and the storm continuing the stage was run under the shed the passengers gathering around the station fire and not until after midnight did yuba bill put in the relays i wish you a good journey said wiles as he drove from the shed as bill entered bill vouchsafed no reply but addressing himself to the driver said curtly as if giving an order for the delivery of goods shove him out at rawlings and passed contemptuously around to the tail board of the sled and returned to the harnessing of his relay  the moon came out and shone high as yuba bill once more took the reins in his hands the wind which instantly attacked them as they reached the level seemed to make the drivers theory plausible and for half a mile the roadbed was swept clean and frozen hard further on a tongue of snow extending from a boulder to the right reached across their path to the height of two or three feet but yuba bill dashed through a part of it and by skillful maneuvering circumvented the rest but even as the obstacle was passed the coach dropped with an ominous lurch on one side and the off fore wheel flew off in the darkness bill threw the horses back on their haunches but before their momentum could be checked the near hind wheel slipped away the vehicle rocked violently plunged backwards and forwards and stopped  yuba bill was on the road in an instant with his lantern then followed an outbreak of profanity which i regret for artistic purposes exceeds that generous limit which a sympathizing public has already extended to me in the explication of character let me state therefore that in a very few moments he succeeded in disparaging the characters of his employers their male and female relatives the coach builder the station keeper the road on which he travelled and the travellers themselves with occasional broad expletives addressed to himself and his own relatives for the spirit of this and a more cultivated poetry of expression i beg to refer the temperate reader to the 3d chapter of job  the passengers knew bill and sat conservative patient and expectant as yet the cause of the catastrophe was not known at last thatchers voice came from the box seat  whats up bill  not a blank lynch pin in the whole blank coach was the answer  there was a dead silence yuba bill executed a wild war dance of helpless rage  blank the blank enchanted thing to blank  i beg here to refer the fastidious and cultivated reader to the only adjective i have dared transcribe of this actual oath which i once had the honor of hearing he will i trust not fail to recognize the old classic daemon in this wild western objurgation  who did it asked thatcher  yuba bill did not reply but dashed up again to the box unlocked the boot and screamed out  the man that stole your portmantlewiles  thatcher laughed  dont worry about that bill a biled shirt an extra collar and a few papers nothing more  yuba bill slowly descended when he reached the ground he plucked thatcher aside by his coat sleeve  ye dont mean to say ye had nothing in that bag ye was trying to get away with  no said the laughing thatcher frankly  and that wiles warnt one o them detectives  not to my knowledge certainly  yuba bill sighed sadly and returned to assist in the replacing of the coach on its wheels again  never mind bill said one of the passengers sympathizingly well catch that man wiles at rawlings sure and he looked around at the inchoate vigilance committee already rounding into form about him  ketch him returned yuba bill derisively why weve got to go back to the station and afore were off agin hes pinted fur clarmont on the relay we lose ketch him hlls full of such ketches  there was clearly nothing to do but to go back to the station to await the repairing of the coach while this was being done yuba bill again drew thatcher aside  i allers suspected that chaps game eye but i didnt somehow allow for anything like this i reckoned it was only the square thing to look arter things genrally and specially your traps so to purvent troubil and keep things about ekal ez he was goin away i sorter lifted this yer bag of hiz outer the tail board of his sleigh i dont know as it is any exchange or compensation but it may give ye a chance to spot him agin or him you it strikes me as bein farminded and squar and with these words he deposited at the feet of the astounded thatcher the black travelling bag of mr wiles  but billsee here i cant take this interrupted thatcher hastily you cant swear that hes taken my bagandandblank it allthis wont do you know ive no right to this mans things even if  hold your hosses said bill gravely i ondertook to take charge o your traps i didntat least that dd walleyedthars a portmantle i dont know whos it is take it  half amused half embarrassed yet still protesting thatcher took the bag in his hands  ye might open it in my presence suggested yuba bill gravely  thatcher half laughingly did so it was full of papers and semilegallooking documents thatchers own name on one of them caught his eye he opened the paper hastily and perused it the smile faded from his lips  well said yuba bill suppose we call it a fair exchange at present  thatcher was still examining the papers suddenly this cautious strongminded man looked up into yuba bills waiting face and said quietly in the despicable slang of the epoch and region  its a go suppose we do   chapter xiii  how it became famous   yuba bill was right in believing that wiles would lose no time at rawlings he left there on a fleet horse before bill had returned with the brokendown coach to the last station and distanced the telegram sent to detain him two hours leaving the stage road and its dangerous telegraphic stations he pushed southward to denver over the army trail in company with a halfbreed packer crossing the missouri before thatcher had reached julesburg when thatcher was at omaha wiles was already in st louis and as the pullman car containing the hero of the blue mass mine rolled into chicago wiles was already walking the streets of the national capital nevertheless he had time en route to sink in the waters of the north platte with many expressions of disgust the little black portmanteau belonging to thatcher containing his dressing case a few unimportant letters and an extra shirt to wonder why simple men did not travel with their important documents and valuables and to set on foot some prudent and cautious inquiries regarding his own lost carpet bag and its important contents  but for these trifles he had every reason to be satisfied with the progress of his plans its all right said mrs hopkinson merrily while you and gashwiler have been working with your stock and treating the whole world as if it could be bribed ive done more with that earnest selfbelieving selfdeceiving and perfectly pathetic roscommon than all you fellows put together why ive told his pitiful story and drawn tears from the eyes of senators and cabinet ministers more than that ive introduced him into society put him in a dress coatsuch a figureand you know how the best folk worship everything that is outre as the sincere thing ive made him a complete success why only the other night when senator misnancy and judge fitzdawdle were here after making him tell his storywhich you know i think he really believesi sang there came to the beach a poor exile of erin and my husband told me afterwards it was worth at least a dozen votes  but about this rival of yoursthis niece of garcias  another of your blunders you men know nothing of women firstly shes a swarthy little brunette with dots for eyes and strides like a man dresses like a dowdy dont wear stays and has no style then shes a single woman and alone and although she affects to be an artist and has bohemian ways dont you see she cant go into society without a chaperon or somebody to go with her nonsense  but persisted wiles she must have some power theres judge mason and senator peabody who are constantly talking about her and dinwiddie of virginia escorted her through the capitol the other day  mistress hopkinson laughed mason and peabody aspire to be thought literary and artistic and dinwiddie wanted to pique me  but thatcher is no fool  is thatcher a ladys man queried the lady suddenly  hardly i should say responded wiles he pretends to be absorbed in his swindle and devoted to his mine and i dont think that even you he stopped with a slight sneer  there you are misunderstanding me again and what is worse you are misunderstanding your case thatcher is pleased with her because he has probably seen no one else wait till he comes to washington and has an opportunity for comparison and she cast a frank glance at her mirror where wiles with a sardonic bow left her standing  mr gashwiler was quite as confident of his own success with congress we are within a few days of the end of the session we will manage to have it taken up and rushed through before that fellow thatcher knows what he is about  if it could be done before he gets here said wiles its a reasonably sure thing he is delayed two days he might have been delayed longer here mr wiles sighed if the accident had happened on a mountain road and the stage had been precipitated over the abyss what valuable time would have been saved and success become a surety but mr wiless functions as an advocate did not include murder at least he was doubtful if it could be taxed as costs  we need have no fears sir resumed mr gashwiler the matter is now in the hands of the highest tribunal of appeal in the country it will meet sir with inflexible justice i have already prepared some remarks  by the way interrupted wiles infelicitously wheres your young manyour private secretarydobbs  the congressman for a moment looked confused he is not here and i must correct your error in applying that term to him i have never put my confidence in the hands of any one  but you introduced him to me as your secretary  a mere honorary title sir a brevet rank i might it is true have thought to repose such a trust in him but i was deceived sir as i fear i am too apt to be when i permit my feelings as a man to overcome my duty as an american legislator mr dobbs enjoyed my patronage and the opportunity it gave me to introduce him into public life only to abuse it he became i fear deeply indebted his extravagance was unlimited his ambition unbounded but without sir a cash basis i advanced money to him from time to time upon the little property you so generously extended to him for his services but it was quickly dissipated yet sir such is the ingratitude of man that his family lately appealed to me for assistance i felt it was necessary to be stern and i refused i would not for the sake of his family say anything but i have missed sir books from my library on the day after he left two volumes of patent office reports and a blue book of congress purchased that day by me at a store on pennsylvania avenue were missingmissing i had difficulty sir great difficulty in keeping it from the papers  as mr wiles had heard the story already from gashwilers acquaintances with more or less free comment on the gifted legislators economy he could not help thinking that the difficulty had been great indeed but he only fixed his malevolent eye on gashwiler and said  so he is gone eh  yes  and youve made an enemy of him thats bad  mr gashwiler tried to look dignifiedly unconcerned but something in his visitors manner made him uneasy  i say it is bad if you have listen before i left here i found at a boardinghouse where he had boarded and still owed a bill a trunk which the landlord retained opening it i found some letters and papers to yours with certain memoranda of his which i thought ought to be in your possession as an alleged friend of his i redeemed the trunk by paying the amount of his bill and secured the more valuable papers  gashwiler whose face had grown apoplectically suffused as wiles went on at last gasped but you got the trunk and have the papers  unfortunately no and thats why its bad  but good god what have you done with them  ive lost them somewhere on the overland road  mr gashwiler sat for a few moments speechless vacillating between a purple rage and a pallid fear then he said hoarsely  they are all blank forgeriesevery one of them  oh no said wiles smiling blandly on his dexter side and enjoying the whole scene malevolently with his sinister eye your papers are all genuine and i wont say are not all right but unfortunately i had in the same bag some memoranda of my own for the use of my client that you understand might be put to some bad use if found by a clever man  the two rascals looked at each other there is on the whole really very little honor among thievesat least great onesand the inferior rascal succumbed at the reflection of what he might do if he were in the other rascals place see here wiles he said relaxing his dignity with the perspiration that oozed from every pore and made the collar of his shirt a mere limp rag see here wethis first use of the plural was equivalent to a confessionwe must get them papers  of course said wiles coolly if we can and if thatcher doesnt get wind of them  he cannot  he was on the coach when i lost them coming east  mr gashwiler paled again in the emergency he had recourse to the sideboard and a bottle forgetting wiles ten minutes before wiles would have remained seated but it is recorded that he rose took the bottle from the gifted gashwilers fingers helped himself first and then sat down  yes but my boy said gashwiler now rapidly changing situations with the cooler wiles yes but old fellow he added poking wiles with a fat forefinger dont you see the whole thing will be up before he gets here  yes said wiles gloomily but those lazy easy honest men have a way of popping up just at the nick of time they never need hurry all things wait for them why dont you remember that on the very day mrs hopkinson and i and you got the president to sign that patent that very day one of them dn fellows turns up from san francisco or australia having taken his own time to get heregets here about half an hour after the president had signed the patent and sent it over to the office finds the right man to introduce him to the president has a talk with him makes him sign an order countermanding its issuance and undoes all that has been done in six years in one hour  yes but congress is a tribunal that does not revoke its decrees said gashwiler with a return of his old manner at least he added observing an incredulous shrug in the shoulder of his companion at least during the session  we shall see said wiles quietly taking his hat  we shall see sir said the member from remus with dignity   chapter xiv  what culture did for it   there was at this time in the senate of the united states an eminent and respected gentleman scholarly orderly honorable and radicalthe fit representative of a scholarly orderly honorable and radical commonwealth for many years he had held his trust with conscious rectitude and a slight depreciation of other forms of merit and for as many years had been as regularly returned to his seat by his constituency with equally conscious rectitude in themselves and an equal skepticism regarding others removed by his nature beyond the reach of certain temptations and by circumstances beyond even the knowledge of others his social and political integrity was spotless an orator and practical debater his refined tastes kept him from personality and the public recognition of the complete unselfishness of his motives and the magnitude of his dogmas protected him from scurrility his principles had never been appealed to by a bribe he had rarely been approached by an emotion  a man of polished taste in art and literature and possessing the means to gratify it his luxurious home was filled with treasures he had himself collected and further enhanced by the stamp of his appreciation his library had not only the elegance of adornment that his wealth could bring and his taste approve but a certain refined negligence of habitual use and the easy disorder of the artists workshop all this was quickly noted by a young girl who stood on its threshold at the close of a dull january day  the card that had been brought to the senator bore the name of carmen de haro and modestly in the right hand corner in almost microscopic script the further description of herself as artist perhaps the picturesqueness of the name and its historic suggestion caught the scholars taste for when to his request through his servant that she would be kind enough to state her business she replied as frankly that her business was personal to himself he directed that she should be admitted then entrenching himself behind his library table overlooking a bastion of books and a glacis of pamphlets and papers and throwing into his forehead and eyes an expression of utter disqualification for anything but the business before him he calmly awaited the intruder  she came and for an instant stood hesitatingly framing herself as a picture in the door mrs hopkinson was rightshe had no style unless an original and halfforeign quaintness could be called so there was a desperate attempt visible to combine an american shawl with the habits of a mantilla and it was always slipping from one shoulder that was so supple and vivacious as to betray the deficiencies of an education in stays there was a cluster of black curls around her low forehead fitting her so closely as to seem to be a part of the sealskin cap she wore  once from the force of habit she attempted to put her shawl over her head and talk through the folds gathered under her chin but an astonished look from the senator checked her nevertheless he felt relieved and rising motioned her to a chair with a heartiness he would have scarcely shown to a parisian toilleta and when with two or three quick long steps she reached his side and showed a frank innocent but strong and determined little face feminine only in its flash of eye and beauty of lip and chin curves he put down the pamphlet he had taken up somewhat ostentatiously and gently begged to know her business  i think i have once before spoken of her voicean organ more often cultivated by my fair countrywomen for singing than for speaking which considering that much of our practical relations with the sex are carried on without the aid of an opera score seems a mistaken notion of theirsand of its sweetness gentle inflexion and musical emphasis she had the advantage of having been trained in a musical language and came of a race with whom catarrhs and sore throats were rare so that in a few brief phrases she sang the senator into acquiescence as she imparted the plain libretto of her businessnamely a desire to see some of his rare engravings  now the engravings in question were certain etchings of the early great apprentices of the art and were i am happy to believe extremely rare from my unprofessional view they were exceedingly badshowing the mere genesis of something since perfected but dear of course to the true collectors soul i dont believe that carmen really admired them either but the minx knew that the senator prided himself on having the only pothooks of the great a or the first artistic efforts of bi leave the real names to be filled in by the connoisseurand the senator became interested for the last year two or three of these abominations had been hanging in his study utterly ignored by the casual visitor but here was appreciation she was she added only a poor young artist unable to purchase such treasures but equally unable to resist the opportunity afforded her even at the risk of seeming bold or of obtruding upon a great mans privacy c c  this flattery which if offered in the usual legal tender of the country would have been looked upon as counterfeit delivered here in a foreign accent with a slightly tropical warmth was accepted by the senator as genuine these children of the sun are so impulsive we of course feel a little pity for the person who thus transcends our standard of good taste and violates our conventional canonbut they are always sincere the cold new englander saw nothing wrong in one or two direct and extravagant compliments that would have insured his visitors early dismissal if tendered in the clipped metallic phrases of the commonwealth he represented  so that in a few moments the black curly head of the little artist and the white flowing locks of the senator were close together bending over the rack that contained the engravings it was then that carmen listening to a graphic description of the early rise of art in the netherlands forgot herself and put her shawl around her head holding its folds in her little brown hand in this situation they were at different times during the next two hours interrupted by five congressmen three senators a cabinet officer and a judge of the supreme bencheach of whom was quickly but courteously dismissed popular sentiment however broke out in the hall  well im blanked but this gets me the speaker was a territorial delegate  at his time o life too lookin over pictures with a gal young enough to be his grandchild this from a venerable official since suspected of various erotic irregularities  she dont handsome any the honorable member from dakota  this accounts for his protracted silence during the sessions a serious colleague from the senators own state  oh blank it all omnes  four went home to tell their wives there are few things more touching in the matrimonial compact than the superb frankness with which each confides to each the various irregularities of their friends it is upon these sacred confidences that the firm foundations of marriage rest unshaken  of course the objects of this comment at least one of them were quite oblivious i trust said carmen timidly when they had for the fourth time regarded in rapt admiration an abominable something by some dutch woodchopper i trust i am not keeping you from your great friendsher pretty eyelids were cast down in tremulous distressi should never forgive myself perhaps it is important business of the state  oh dear no they will come againits their business  the senator meant it kindly it was as near the perilous edge of a compliment as your average cultivated boston man ever ventures and carmen picked it up femininely by its sentimental end and i suppose i shall not trouble you again  i shall always be proud to place the portfolio at your disposal command me at any time said the senator with dignity  you are kind you are good said carmen and iim butlook youonly a poor girl from california that you know not  pardon me i know your country well and indeed he could have told her the exact number of bushels of wheat to the acre in her own county of monterey its voting population its political bias yet of the more important product before him after the manner of bookread men he knew nothing  carmen was astonished but respectful it transpired presently that she was not aware of the rapid growth of the silk worm in her own district knew nothing of the chinese question and very little of the american mining laws upon these questions the senator enlightened her fully your name is historic by the way he said pleasantly there was a knight of alcantara a de haro one of the emigrants with las casas  carmen nodded her head quickly yes my greatgreatgreatgreat grandfather  the senator stared  oh yes i am the niece of victor castro who married my fathers sister  the victor castro of the blue mass mine asked the senator abruptly  yes she said quietly  had the senator been of the gashwiler type he would have expressed himself after the average masculine fashion by a longdrawn whistle but his only perceptible appreciation of a sudden astonishment and suspicion in his mind was a lowering of the social thermometer of the room so decided that poor carmen looked up innocently chilled and drew her shawl closer around her shoulders  i have something more to ask said carmen hanging her headit is a great oh a very great favor  the senator had retreated behind his bastion of books again and was visibly preparing for an assault he saw it all now he had been in some vague way deluded he had given confidential audience to the niece of one of the great claimants before congress the inevitable axe had come to the grindstone what might not this woman dare ask of him he was the more implacable that he felt he had already been prepossessedand honestly prepossessedin her favor he was angry with her for having pleased him under the icy polish of his manner there were certain puritan callosities caused by early straightlacing he was not yet quite free from his ancestors cheerful ethics that nature as represented by an impulse was as much to be restrained as order represented by a quaker  without apparently noticing his manner carmen went on with a certain potential freedom of style gesture and manner scarcely to be indicated in her mere words you know then i am of spanish blood and that what was my adopted country our motto was god and liberty it was of you sirthe great emancipatorthe apostle of that libertythe friend of the downtrodden and oppressedthat i as a child first knew in the histories of this great country i have read of you i have learned your orations i have longed to hear you in your own pulpit deliver the creed of my ancestors to hear you of yourself speak ah madre de dios what shall i sayspeak the oration eloquentto make thewhat you callthe debate that is what i have for so long hoped eh pardonyou are thinking me foolishwild eha small childeh  becoming more and more dialectical as she went on she said suddenly i have you of myself offended you are mad of me as a bold bad child it is so  the senator as visibly becoming limp and weak again behind his entrenchments managed to say oh no then really and finally thaanks  i am here but for a day i return to california in a day as it were tomorrow i shall never never hear you speak in your place in the capitol of this great country  the senator said hastily that he fearedhe in fact was convincedthat his duty during this session was required more at his desk in the committee work than in speaking c c  ah said carmen sadly it is true then all this that i have heard it is true that what they have told methat you have given up the great partythat your voice is not longer heard in the oldwhat you call thisehthe old issues  if any one has told you that miss de haro responded the senator sharply he has spoken foolishly you have been misinformed may i ask who  ah said carmen i know not it is in the air i am a stranger perhaps i am deceived but it is of all i say to them when shall i hear him speak i go day after day to the capitol i watch himthe great emancipatorbut it is of business ehit is the claim of that one it is the tax eh it is the impost it is the postoffice but it is the great speech of human rightsnever never i say how arrives all this and some say and shake their heads never again he speaks he is what you call playedyes it is so ehplayed out i know it notit is a word from boston perhaps they say he haseh i speak not the english wellthe party he has shaken shookyeshe has the party shaken eh it is rightit is the language of boston eh  permit me to say miss de haro returned the senator rising with some asperity that you seem to have been unfortunate in your selection of acquaintances and still more so in your ideas of the derivations of the english tongue theertheerexpressions you have quoted are not common to boston but emanate i believe from the west  carmen de haro contritely buried everything but her black eyes in her shawl  no one he continued more gently sitting down again has the right to forecast from my past what i intend to do in the future or designate the means i may choose to serve the principles i hold or the party i represent those are my functions at the same time should occasionor opportunityfor we are within a day or two of the close of the session  yes interrupted carmen sadly i seeit will be some business some claim something for somebodyah madre de diosyou will not speak and i  when do you think of returning asked the senator with grave politeness when are we to lose you  i shall stay to the lastto the end of the session said carmen and now i shall go she got up and pulled her shawl viciously over her shoulders with a pretty pettishness perhaps the most feminine thing she had done that evening possibly the most genuine  the senator smiled affably you do not deserve to be disappointed in either case but it is later than you imagine let me help you on the shorter distance in my carriage it is at the door  he accompanied her gravely to the carriage as it rolled away she buried her little figure in its ample cushions and chuckled to herself albeit a little hysterically when she had reached her destination she found herself crying and hastily and somewhat angrily dried her eyes as she drew up at the door of her lodgings  how have you prospered asked mr harlowe of counsel for royal thatcher as he gallantly assisted her from the carriage i have been waiting here for two hours your interview must have been prolongedthat was a good sign  dont ask me now said carmen a little savagely im worn out and tired  mr harlowe bowed i trust you will be better tomorrow for we expect our friend mr thatcher  carmens brown cheek flushed slightly he should have been here before where is he what was he doing  he was snowed up on the plains he is coming as fast as steam can carry him but he may be too late  carmen did not reply  the lawyer lingered how did you find the great newengland senator he asked with a slight professional levity  carmen was tired carmen was worried carmen was a little selfreproachful and she kindled easily consequently she said icily  i found him a gentleman   chapter xv  how it became unfinished business   the closing of the  congress was not unlike the closing of the several preceding congresses there was the same unbusinesslike impractical haste the same hurried unjust and utterly inadequate adjustment of unfinished illdigested business that would not have been tolerated for a moment by the sovereign people in any private interest they controlled there were frauds rushed through there were longsuffering righteous demands shelved there were honest unpaid debts dishonored by scant appropriations there were closing scenes which only the saving sense of american humor kept from being utterly vile the actors the legislators themselves knew it and laughed at it the commentators the press knew it and laughed at it the audience the great american people knew it and laughed at it and nobody for an instant conceived that it ever under any circumstances might be otherwise  the claim of roscommon was among the unfinished business the claimant himself haggard pathetic importunate and obstinate was among the unfinished business various congressmen more or less interested in the success of the claim were among the unfinished business the member from fresno who had changed his derringer for a speech against the claimant was among the unfinished business the gifted gashwiler uneasy in his soul over certain other unfinished business in the shape of his missing letters but dropping oil and honey as he mingled with his brothers was king of misrule and lord of the unfinished business pretty mrs hopkinson prudently escorted by her husband but imprudently ogled by admiring congressmen lent the charm of her presence to the finishing of unfinished business one or two editors who had dreams of a finished financial business arising out of unfinished business were there also like ancient bards to record with paean or threnody the completion of unfinished business various unclean birds scenting carrion in unfinished business hovered in the halls or roosted in the lobby  the lower house under the tutelage of the gifted gashwiler drank deeply of roscommon and his intoxicating claim and passed the halfempty bottle to the senate as unfinished business but alas in the very rush and storm and tempest of the unfinishing business an unlookedfor interruption arose in the person of a great senator whose power none could oppose whose right to free and extended utterance at all times none could gainsay a claim for poultry violently seized by the army of sherman during his march through georgia from the hencoop of an alleged loyal irishman opened a constitutional question and with it the lips of the great senator  for seven hours he spoke eloquently earnestly convincingly for seven hours the old issues of party and policy were severally taken up and dismissed in the old forcible rhetoric that had early made him famous interruptions from other senators now forgetful of unfinished business and wild with reanimated party zeal interruptions from certain senators mindful of unfinished business and unable to pass the roscommon bottle only spurred him to fresh exertion the tocsin sounded in the senate was heard in the lower house highlyexcited members congregated at the doors of the senate and left unfinished business to take care of itself  left to itself for seven hours unfinished business gnashed its false teeth and tore its wig in impotent fury in corridor and hall for seven hours the gifted gashwiler had continued the manufacture of oil and honey whose sweetness however was slowly palling upon the congressional lip for seven hours roscommon and friends beat with impatient feet the lobby and shook fists more or less discolored at the distinguished senator for seven hours the one or two editors were obliged to sit and calmly compliment the great speech which that night flashed over the wires of a continent with the old electric thrill and worse than all they were obliged to record with it the closing of the  congress with more than the usual amount of unfinished business  a little group of friends surrounded the great senator with hymns of praise and congratulations old adversaries saluted him courteously as they passed by with the respect of strong men a little woman with a shawl drawn over her shoulders and held with one small brown hand approached him timidly  i speak not the english well she said gently but i have read much i have read in the plays of your shakspeare i would like to say to you the words of rosalind to orlando when he did fight sir you have wrestled well and have overthrown more than your enemies and with these words she was gone  yet not so quickly but that pretty mrs hopkinson comingas victrix always comes to victor to thank the great senator albeit the faces of her escorts were shrouded in gloomsaw the shawled figure disappear  there she said pinching wiles mischievously there thats the woman you were afraid of look at her look at that dress ah heavens look at that shawl didnt i tell you she had no style  who is she said wiles sullenly  carmen de haro of course said the lady vivaciously what are you hurrying away so for youre absolutely pulling me along  mr wiles had just caught sight of the travelworn face of royal thatcher among the crowd that thronged the staircase thatcher appeared pale and distrait mr harlowe his counsel at his side rallied him  no one would think you had just got a new lease of your property and escaped a great swindle whats the matter with you miss de haro passed us just now it was she who spoke to the senator why did you not recognize her  i was thinking said thatcher gloomily  well you take things coolly and certainly you are not very demonstrative towards the woman who saved you today for as sure as you live it was she who drew that speech out of the senator  thatcher did not reply but moved away he had noticed carmen de haro and was about to greet her with mingled pleasure and embarrassment but he had heard her compliment to the senator and this strong preoccupied automatic man who only ten days before had no thought beyond his property was now thinking more of that compliment to another than of his success and was beginning to hate the senator who had saved him the lawyer who stood beside him and even the little figure that had tripped down the steps unconscious of him   chapter xvi  and who forgot it   it was somewhat inconsistent with royal thatchers embarrassment and sensitiveness that he should on leaving the capitol order a carriage and drive directly to the lodgings of miss de haro that on finding she was not at home he should become again sulky and suspicious and even be ashamed of the honest impulse that led him there was i suppose manlike and natural he felt that he had done all the courtesy required he had promptly answered her dispatch with his presence if she chose to be absent at such a moment he had at least done his duty in short there was scarcely any absurdity of the imagination which this once practical man did not permit himself to indulge in yet always with a certain consciousness that he was allowing his feelings to run away with hima fact that did not tend to make him better humored and rather inclined him to place the responsibility of the elopement on somebody else if miss de haro had been home c c and not going into ecstasies over speeches c c and had attended to her business i e being exactly what he had supposed her to beall this would not have happened  i am aware that this will not heighten the readers respect for my hero but i fancy that the imperceptible progress of a sincere passion in the matured strong man is apt to be marked with even more than the usual haste and absurdity of callous youth  the fever that runs riot in the veins of the robust is apt to pass your ailing weakling by possibly there may be some immunity in inoculation it is lothario who is always selfpossessed and does and says the right thing while poor honest coelebs becomes ridiculous with genuine emotion  he rejoined his lawyer in no very gracious mood the chambers occupied by mr harlowe were in the basement of a private dwelling once occupied and made historic by an honorable somebody who however was remembered only by the landlord and the last tenant there were various shelves in the walls divided into compartments sarcastically known as pigeon holes in which the dove of peace had never rested but which still perpetuated in their legends the feuds and animosities of suitors now but common dust together there was a portrait apparently of a cherub which on nearer inspection turned out to be a famous english lord chancellor in his flowing wig  there were books with dreary unenlivening titlesegotistic always as recording smiths opinions on this and joness commentaries on that there was a hand bill tacked on the wall which at first offered hilarious suggestions of a circus or a steamboat excursion but which turned out only to be a sheriffs sale there were several oddlyshaped packages in newspaper wrappings mysterious and awful in dark corners that might have contained forgotten law papers or the previous weeks washing of the eminent counsel there were one or two newspapers which at first offered entertaining prospects to the waiting client but always proved to be a law record or a supreme court decision there was the bust of a late distinguished jurist which apparently had never been dusted since he himself became dust and had already grown a perceptibly dusty moustache on his severelyjudicial upper lip it was a cheerless place in the sunshine of day at night when it ought by every suggestion of its dusty past to have been left to the vengeful ghosts the greater part of whose hopes and passions were recorded and gathered there when in the dark the dead hands of forgotten men were stretched from their dusty graves to fumble once more for their old title deeds at night when it was lit up by flaring gaslight the hollow mockery of this dissipation was so apparent that people in the streets looking through the illuminated windows felt as if the privacy of a family vault had been intruded upon by bodysnatchers  royal thatcher glanced around the room took in all its dreary suggestions in a halfweary halfindifferent sort of way and dropped into the lawyers own revolving chair as that gentleman entered from the adjacent room  well you got back soon i see said harlowe briskly  yes said his client without looking up and with this notable distinction between himself and all other previous clients that he seemed absolutely less interested than the lawyer yes im here and upon my soul i dont exactly know why  you told me of certain papers you had discovered said the lawyer suggestively  oh yes returned thatcher with a slight yawn ive got here some papers somewherehe began to feel in his coat pocket languidlybut by the way this is a rather dreary and godforsaken sort of place lets go up to welkers and you can look at them over a bottle of champagne  after ive looked at them ive something to show you myself said harlowe and as for the champagne well have that in the other room by and by at present i want to have my head clear and yours tooif youll oblige me by becoming sufficiently interested in your own affairs to talk to me about them  thatcher was gazing abstractedly at the fire he started i dare say he began im not very interesting yet its possible that my affairs have taken up a little too much of my time however he stopped took from his pocket an envelope and threw it on the deskthere are some papers i dont know what value they may be that is for you to determine i dont know that ive any legal right to their possessionthat is for you to say too they came to me in a queer way on the overland journey here i lost my bag containing my few traps and some letters and papers of no value as the advertisements say to any but the owner well the bag was lost but the stage driver declares that it was stolen by a fellowpassengera man by the name of giles or stiles or piles  wiles said harlowe earnestly  yes continued thatcher suppressing a yawn yes i guess youre rightwiles well the stage driver finally believing this goes to work and quietly and unostentatiously stealsi say have you got a cigar  ill get you one  harlowe disappeared in the adjoining room thatcher dragged harlowes heavy revolving desk chair which never before had been removed from its sacred position to the fire and began to poke the coals abstractedly  harlowe reappeared with cigars and matches thatcher lit one mechanically and said between the pulls  do youevertalkto yourself  nowhy  i thought i heard your voice just now in the other room anyhow this is an awful spooky place if i stayed here alone half an hour id fancy that the lord chancellor up there would step down in his robes out of his frame to keep me company  nonsense when im busy i often sit here and write until after midnight its so quiet  dmnably so  well to go back to the papers somebody stole your bag or you lost it you stole  the driver stole suggested thatcher so languidly that it could hardly be called an interruption  well well say the driver stole and passed over to you as his accomplice confederate or receiver certain papers belonging  see here harlowe i dont feel like joking in a ghostly law office after midnight here are your facts yuba bill the driver stole a bag from this passenger wiles or smiles and handed it to me to insure the return of my own i found in it some papers concerning my case there they are do with them what you like  thatcher turned his eyes again abstractedly to the fire  harlowe took out the first paper  aw this seems to be a telegram yes eh come to washington at oncecarmen de haro  thatcher started blushed like a girl and hurriedly reached for the paper  nonsense thats a mistake a dispatch i mislaid in the envelope  i see said the lawyer dryly  i thought i had torn it up continued thatcher after an awkward pause i regret to say that here that usually truthful man elaborated a fiction he had consulted it a dozen times a day on the journey and it was quite worn in its enfoldings harlowes quick eye had noticed this but he speedily became interested and absorbed in the other papers thatcher lapsed into contemplation of the fire  well said harlowe finally turning to his client heres enough to unseat gashwiler or close his mouth as to the rest its good readingbut i neednt tell youno legal evidence but its proof enough to stop them from ever trying it againwhen the existence of this record is made known bribery is a hard thing to fix on a man the only witness is naturally particeps criminisbut it would not be easy for them to explain away this rascals record one or two things i dont understand whats this opposite the hon xs name took the medicine nicely and feels better and here just in the margin after ys must be labored with  i suppose our california slang borrows largely from the medical and spiritual profession returned thatcher but isnt it odd that a man should keep a conscientious record of his own villainy  harlowe a little abashed at his want of knowledge of american metaphor now felt himself at home well no its not unusual in one of those books yonder there is the record of a case where a man who had committed a series of nameless atrocities extending over a period of years absolutely kept a memorandum of them in his pocket diary it was produced in court why my dear fellow one half our business arises from the fact that men and women are in the habit of keeping letters and documents that they mighti dont say you know that they ought thats a question of sentiment or ethicsbut that they might destroy  thatcher halfmechanically took the telegram of poor carmen and threw it in the fire harlowe noticed the act and smiled  ill venture to say however that theres nothing in the bag that you lost that need give you a moments uneasiness its only your rascal or fool who carries with him that which makes him his own detective  i had a friend continued harlowe a clever fellow enough but who was so foolish as to seriously complicate himself with a woman he was himself the soul of honor and at the beginning of their correspondence he proposed that they should each return the others letters with their answer they did so for years but it cost him ten thousand dollars and no end of trouble after all  why asked thatcher simply  because he was such an egotistical ass as to keep the letter proposing it which she had duly returned among his papers as a sentimental record of course somebody eventually found it  good night said thatcher rising abruptly if i stayed here much longer i should begin to disbelieve my own mother  i have known of such hereditary traits returned harlowe with a laugh but come you must not go without the champagne he led the way to the adjacent room which proved to be only the antechamber of another on the threshold of which thatcher stopped with genuine surprise it was an elegantly furnished library  sybarite why was i never here before  because you came as a client tonight you are my guest all who enter here leave their business with their hats in the hall look there isnt a law book on those shelves that table never was defaced by a title deed or parchment you look puzzled well it was a whim of mine to put my residence and my workshop under the same roof yet so distinct that they would never interfere with each other you know the house above is let out to lodgers i occupy the first floor with my mother and sister and this is my parlor i do my work in that severe room that fronts the street here is where i play a man must have something else in life than mere business i find it less harmful and expensive to have my pleasure here  thatcher had sunk moodily in the embracing arms of an easy chair he was thinking deeply he was fond of books too and like all men who have fared hard and led wandering lives he knew the value of cultivated repose like all men who have been obliged to sleep under blankets and in the open air he appreciated the luxuries of linen sheets and a frescoed roof it is by the way only your sick city clerk or your dyspeptic clergyman who fancy that they have found in the bad bread fried steaks and frowzy flannels of mountain picknicking the true art of living and it is a somewhat notable fact that your true mountaineer or your gentleman who has been obliged to honestly rough it does not as a general thing write books about its advantages or implore their fellow mortals to come and share their solitude and their discomforts  thoroughly appreciating the taste and comfort of harlowes library yet halfenvious of its owner and halfsuspicious that his own earnest life for the past few years might have been different thatcher suddenly started from his seat and walked towards a parlor easel whereon stood a picture it was carmen de haros first sketch of the furnace and the mine  i see you are taken with that picture said harlowe pausing with the champagne bottle in his hand you show your good taste its been much admired observe how splendidly that firelight plays over the sleeping face of that figure yet brings out by very contrast its almost deathlike repose those rocks are powerfully handled what a suggestion of mystery in those shadows you know the painter  thatcher murmured miss de haro with a new and rather odd selfconsciousness in speaking her name  yes and you know the story of the picture of course  thatcher thought he didnt well no in fact he did not remember  why this recumbent figure was an old spanish lover of hers whom she believed to have been murdered there its a ghastly fancy isnt it  two things annoyed thatcher first the epithet lover as applied to concho by another man second that the picture belonged to him and what the dl did she mean by  yes he broke out finally but how did you get it  oh i bought it of her ive been a sort of patron of her ever since i found out how she stood towards us as she was quite alone here in washington my mother and sister have taken her up and have been doing the social thing  how long since asked thatcher  oh not long the day she telegraphed you she came here to know what she could do for us and when i said nothing could be done except to keep congress off why she went and did it for she and she alone got that speech out of the senator but he added a little mischievously you seem to know very little about her  noithat isive been very busy lately returned thatcher staring at the picture does she come here often  yes lately quite often she was here this evening with mother was here i think when you came  thatcher looked intently at harlowe but that gentlemans face betrayed no confusion thatcher refilled his glass a little awkwardly tossed off the liquor at a draught and rose to his feet  come old fellow youre not going now i shant permit it said harlowe laying his hand kindly on his clients shoulder youre out of sorts stay here with me tonight our accommodations are not large but are elastic i can bestow you comfortably until morning wait here a moment while i give the necessary orders  thatcher was not sorry to be left alone in the last half hour he had become convinced that his love for carmen de haro had been in some way most dreadfully abused while he was hard at work in california she was being introduced in washington society by parties with eligible brothers who bought her paintings it is a relief to the truly jealous mind to indulge in plurals thatcher liked to think that she was already beset by hundreds of brothers  he still kept staring at the picture by and by it faded away in part and a very vivid recollection of the misty midnight moonlit walk he had once taken with her came back and refilled the canvas with its magic he saw the ruined furnace the dark overhanging masses of rock the trembling intricacies of foliage and above all the flash of dark eyes under a mantilla at his shoulder what a fool he had been had he not really been as senseless and stupid as this very concho lying here like a log and she had loved that man what a fool she must have thought him that evening what a snob she must think him now  he was startled by a slight rustling in the passage that ceased almost as he turned thatcher looked towards the door of the outer office as if half expecting that the lord chancellor like the commander in don juan might have accepted his thoughtless invitation he listened again everything was still he was conscious of feeling ill at ease and a trifle nervous what a long time harlowe took to make his preparations he would look out in the hall to do this it was necessary to turn up the gas he did so and in his confusion turned it out  where were the matches he remembered that there was a bronze something on the table that in the irony of modern decorative taste might hold ashes or matches or anything of an unpicturesque character he knocked something over evidently the inksomething elsethis time a champagne glass becoming reckless and now groping at random in the ruins he overturned the bronze mercury on the center table and then sat down hopelessly in his chair and then a pair of velvet fingers slid into his with the matches and this audible musical statement  it is a match you are seeking here is of them  thatcher flushed embarrassed nervousfeeling the ridiculousness of saying thank you to a dark somebodystruck the match beheld by its brief uncertain glimmer carmen de haro beside him burned his fingers coughed dropped the match and was cast again into outer darkness  let me try  carmen struck a match jumped briskly on the chair lit the gas jumped lightly down again and said you do like to sit in the darkeh so am isometimesalone  miss de haro said thatcher with sudden honest earnestness advancing with outstretched hands believe me i am sincerely delighted overjoyed again to meet  she had however quickly retreated as he approached ensconcing herself behind the high back of a large antique chair on the cushion of which she knelt i regret to add also that she slapped his outstretched fingers a little sharply with her inevitable black fan as he still advanced  we are not in california it is washington it is after midnight i am a poor girl and i have to losewhat you calla character you shall sit over thereshe pointed to the sofaand i shall sit here she rested her boyish head on the top of the chair and we shall talk for i have to speak to you don royal  thatcher took the seat indicated contritely humbly submissively carmens little heart was touched but she still went on over the back of the chair  don royal she said emphasizing each word at him with her fan before i saw youever knew of youi was a child yes i was but a child i was a bold bad childand i was what you call aaforgaire  a what asked thatcher hesitating between a smile and a sigh  a forgaire continued carmen demurely i did of myself write the names of ozzer peoples when carmen was excited she lost the control of the english tongue i did write just to please myselfit was my onkle that did make of it moneyyou understand eh shall you not speak must i again hit you  go on said thatcher laughing  i did find out when i came to you at the mine that i had forged against you the name of micheltorena i to the lawyer went and found that it was soof a verityso so all the time look at me not now don royalit is a forgaire you stare at  carmen  hoosh shall i have to hit you again i did overlook all the papers i found the application it was written by me there  she tossed over the back of her chair an envelope to thatcher he opened it  i see he said gently you repossessed yourself of it  what is thatrrrepossess  whythatcher hesitatedyou got possession of this paperthis innocent forgeryagain  oh you think me a thief as well as a forgaire go away get up get out  my dear girl  look at the paper will you oh you silly  thatcher looked at the paper in paper handwriting age and stamp it was identical with the formal clerical application of garcia for the grant the indorsement of micheltorena was unquestionably genuine but the application was made for royal thatcher and his own signature was imitated to the life  i had but one letter of yours wiz your name said carmen apologetically and it was the best poor me could do  why you blessed little goose and angel said thatcher with the bold mixed metaphor of amatory genius dont you see  ah you dont like itit is not good  my darling  hoosh there is also an old cat up stairs and now i have here a character will you sit down is it of a necessity that up and down you should walk and awaken the whole house thereshe had given him a vicious dab with her fan as he passed he sat down  and you have not seen me nor written to me for a year  carmen  sit down you bold bad boy dont you see it is of business that you and i talk down here and it is of business that ozzer people up stairs are thinking eh  dn business see here carmen my darling tell mei regret to say he had by this time got hold of the back of carmens chairtell me my own little girlaboutabout that senator you remember what you said to him  oh the old man oh that was business and you say of business dn  carmen  don royal    although miss carmen had recourse to her fan frequently during this interview the air must have been chilly for a moment later on his way down stairs poor harlowe a sufferer from bronchitis was attacked with a violent fit of coughing which troubled him all the way down  well he said as he entered the room i see you have found mr thatcher and shown those papers i trust you have for youve certainly had time enough i am sent by mother to dismiss you all to bed  carmen still in the arm chair covered with her mantilla did not speak  i suppose you are by this time lawyer enough to know continued harlowe that miss de haros papers though ingenious are not legally available unless  i chose to make her a witness harlowe youre a good fellow i dont mind saying to you that these are papers i prefer that my wife should not use well leave it for the presentunfinished business   they did but one evening our hero brought mrs royal thatcher a paper containing a touching and beautiful tribute to the dead senator  there carmen love read that dont you feel a little ashamed of youryouryour lobbying  no said carmen promptly it was businessand if all lobbying business was as honestwell
