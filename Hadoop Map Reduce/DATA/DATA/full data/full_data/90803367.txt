90803367	thomas henry huxley  collected essays  18931894  vol ii  darwiniana   edition published in 1893     preface   i have entitled this volume darwiniana because the pieces republished in it either treat of the ancient doctrine of evolution rehabilitated and placed upon a sound scientific foundation since and in consequence of the publication of the origin of species or they attempt to meet the more weighty of the unsparing criticisms with which that great work was visited for several years after its appearance or they record the impression left by the personality of mr darwin on one who had the privilege and the happiness of enjoying his friendship for some thirty years or they endeavour to sum up his work and indicate its enduring influence on the course of scientific thought  those who take the trouble to read the first two essays published in 1859 and 1860 will i think do me the justice to admit that my zeal to secure fair play for mr darwin did not drive me into the position of a mere advocate and that while doing justice to the greatness of the argument i did not fail to indicate its weak points i have never seen any reason for departing from the position which i took up in these two essays and the assertion which i sometimes meet with nowadays that i have recanted or changed my opinions about mr darwins views is quite unintelligible to me  as i have said in the seventh essay the fact of evolution is to my mind sufficiently evidenced by palaeontology and i remain of the opinion expressed in the second that until selective breeding is definitely proved to give rise to varieties infertile with one another the logical foundation of the theory of natural selection is incomplete we still remain very much in the dark about the causes of variation the apparent inheritance of acquired characters in some cases and the struggle for existence within the organism which probably lies at the bottom of both of these phenomena  some apology is due to the reader for the reproduction of the lectures to working men in their original state they were taken down in shorthand by mr j aldous mays who requested me to allow him to print them i was very much pressed with work at the time and as i could not revise the reports which i imagined moreover would be of little or no interest to any but my auditors i stipulated that a notice should be prefixed to that effect this was done but it did not prevent a considerable diffusion of the little book in this country and in the united states nor its translation into more than one foreign language moreover mr darwin often urged me to revise and expand the lectures into a systematic popular exposition of the topics of which they treat i have more than once set about the task but the proverb about spoiling a horn and not making a spoon is particularly applicable to attempts to remodel a piece of work which may have served its immediate purpose well enough  so i have reprinted the lectures as they stand with all their imperfections on their heads it would seem that many people must have found them useful thirty years ago and though the sixties appear now to be reckoned by many of the rising generation as a part of the dark ages i am not without some grounds for suspecting that there yet remains a fair sprinkling even of philosophic thinkers to whom it may be a profitable perhaps even a novel task to descend from the heights of speculation and go over the a b c of the great biological problem as it was set before a body of shrewd artisans at that remote epoch  t h h  hodeslea

six lectures to working men on our knowledge of the causes of the       phenomena of organic nature 1863     i  the darwinian hypothesis  1859   the hypothesis of which the present work of mr darwin is but the preliminary outline may be stated in his own language as follows species originated by means of natural selection or through the preservation of the favoured races in the struggle for life to render this thesis intelligible it is necessary to interpret its terms in the first place what is a species the question is a simple one but the right answer to it is hard to find even if we appeal to those who should know most about it it is all those animals or plants which have descended from a single pair of parents it is the smallest distinctly definable group of living organisms it is an eternal and immutable entity it is a mere abstraction of the human intellect having no existence in nature such are a few of the significations attached to this simple word which may be culled from authoritative sources and if leaving terms and theoretical subtleties aside we turn to facts and endeavour to gather a meaning for ourselves by studying the things to which in practice the name of species is applied it profits us little for practice varies as much as theory let two botanists or two zoologists examine and describe the productions of a country and one will pretty certainly disagree with the other as to the number limits and definitions of the species into which he groups the very same things in these islands we are in the habit of regarding mankind as of one species but a fortnights steam will land us in a country where divines and savants for once in agreement vie with one another in loudness of assertion if not in cogency of proof that men are of different species and more particularly that the species negro is so distinct from our own that the ten commandments have actually no reference to him even in the calm region of entomology where if anywhere in this sinful world passion and prejudice should fail to stir the mind one learned coleopterist will fill ten attractive volumes with descriptions of species of beetles ninetenths of which are immediately declared by his brother beetlemongers to be no species at all  the truth is that the number of distinguishable living creatures almost surpasses imagination at least 100000 such kinds of insects alone have been described and may be identified in collections and the number of separable kinds of living things is underestimated at half a million seeing that most of these obvious kinds have their accidental varieties and that they often shade into others by imperceptible degrees it may well be imagined that the task of distinguishing between what is permanent and what fleeting what is a species and what a mere variety is sufficiently formidable  but is it not possible to apply a test whereby a true species may be known from a mere variety is there no criterion of species great authorities affirm that there isthat the unions of members of the same species are always fertile while those of distinct species are either sterile or their offspring called hybrids are so it is affirmed not only that this is an experimental fact but that it is a provision for the preservation of the purity of species such a criterion as this would be invaluable but unfortunately not only is it not obvious how to apply it in the great majority of cases in which its aid is needed but its general validity is stoutly denied the hon and rev mr herbert a most trustworthy authority not only asserts as the result of his own observations and experiments that many hybrids are quite as fertile as the parent species but he goes so far as to assert that the particular plant crinum capense is much more fertile when crossed by a distinct species than when fertilised by its proper pollen on the other hand the famous gaertner though he took the greatest pains to cross the primrose and the cowslip succeeded only once or twice in several years and yet it is a wellestablished fact that the primrose and the cowslip are only varieties of the same kind of plant again such cases as the following are well established the female of species a if crossed with the male of species b is fertile but if the female of b is crossed with the male of a she remains barren facts of this kind destroy the value of the supposed criterion  if weary of the endless difficulties involved in the determination of species the investigator contenting himself with the rough practical distinction of separable kinds endeavours to study them as they occur in natureto ascertain their relations to the conditions which surround them their mutual harmonies and discordancies of structure the bond of union of their present and their past history he finds himself according to the received notions in a mighty maze and with at most the dimmest adumbration of a plan if he starts with any one clear conviction it is that every part of a living creature is cunningly adapted to some special use in its life has not his paley told him that that seemingly useless organ the spleen is beautifully adjusted as so much packing between the other organs and yet at the outset of his studies he finds that no adaptive reason whatsoever can be given for onehalf of the peculiarities of vegetable structure he also discovers rudimentary teeth which are never used in the gums of the young calf and in those of the foetal whale insects which never bite have rudimental jaws and others which never fly have rudimental wings naturally blind creatures have rudimental eyes and the halt have rudimentary limbs so again no animal or plant puts on its perfect form at once but all have to start from the same point however various the course which each has to pursue not only men and horses and cats and dogs lobsters and beetles periwinkles and mussels but even the very sponges and animalcules commence their existence under forms which are essentially undistinguishable and this is true of all the infinite variety of plants nay more all living beings march side by side along the high road of development and separate the later the more like they are like people leaving church who all go down the aisle but having reached the door some turn into the parsonage others go down the village and others part only in the next parish a man in his development runs for a little while parallel with though never passing through the form of the meanest worm then travels for a space beside the fish then journeys along with the bird and the reptile for his fellow travellers and only at last after a brief companionship with the highest of the fourfooted and fourhanded world rises into the dignity of pure manhood no competent thinker of the present day dreams of explaining these indubitable facts by the notion of the existence of unknown and undiscoverable adaptations to purpose and we would remind those who ignorant of the facts must be moved by authority that no one has asserted the incompetence of the doctrine of final causes in its application to physiology and anatomy more strongly than our own eminent anatomist professor owen who speaking of such cases says on the nature of limbs pp 39 40i think it will be obvious that the principle of final adaptations fails to satisfy all the conditions of the problem  but if the doctrine of final causes will not help us to comprehend the anomalies of living structure the principle of adaptation must surely lead us to understand why certain living beings are found in certain regions of the world and not in others the palm as we know will not grow in our climate nor the oak in greenland the white bear cannot live where the tiger thrives nor vice versâ and the more the natural habits of animal and vegetable species are examined the more do they seem on the whole limited to particular provinces but when we look into the facts established by the study of the geographical distribution of animals and plants it seems utterly hopeless to attempt to understand the strange and apparently capricious relations which they exhibit one would be inclined to suppose à priori that every country must be naturally peopled by those animals that are fittest to live and thrive in it and yet how on this hypothesis are we to account for the absence of cattle in the pampas of south america when those parts of the new world were discovered it is not that they were unfit for cattle for millions of cattle now run wild there and the like holds good of australia and new zealand it is a curious circumstance in fact that the animals and plants of the northern hemisphere are not only as well adapted to live in the southern hemisphere as its own autochthones but are in many cases absolutely better adapted and so overrun and extirpate the aborigines clearly therefore the species which naturally inhabit a country are not necessarily the best adapted to its climate and other conditions the inhabitants of islands are often distinct from any other known species of animal or plants witness our recent examples from the work of sir emerson tennent on ceylon and yet they have almost always a sort of general family resemblance to the animals and plants of the nearest mainland on the other hand there is hardly a species of fish shell or crab common to the opposite sides of the narrow isthmus of panama  footnote see page 60 note  wherever we look then living nature offers us riddles of difficult solution if we suppose that what we see is all that can be known of it  but our knowledge of life is not confined to the existing world whatever their minor differences geologists are agreed as to the vast thickness of the accumulated strata which compose the visible part of our earth and the inconceivable immensity of the time the lapse of which they are the imperfect but the only accessible witnesses now throughout the greater part of this long series of stratified rocks are scattered sometimes very abundantly multitudes of organic remains the fossilised exuviæ of animals and plants which lived and died while the mud of which the rocks are formed was yet soft ooze and could receive and bury them it would be a great error to suppose that these organic remains were fragmentary relics our museums exhibit fossil shells of immeasurable antiquity as perfect as the day they were formed whole skeletons without a limb disturbed nay the changed flesh the developing embryos and even the very footsteps of primæval organisms thus the naturalist finds in the bowels of the earth species as well defined as and in some groups of animals more numerous than those which breathe the upper air but singularly enough the majority of these entombed species are wholly distinct from those that now live nor is this unlikeness without its rule and order as a broad fact the further we go back in time the less the buried species are like existing forms and the further apart the sets of extinct creatures are the less they are like one another in other words there has been a regular succession of living beings each younger set being in a very broad and general sense somewhat more like those which now live  it was once supposed that this succession had been the result of vast successive catastrophes destructions and recreations en masse but catastrophes are now almost eliminated from geological or at least palæontological speculation and it is admitted on all hands that the seeming breaks in the chain of being are not absolute but only relative to our imperfect knowledge that species have replaced species not in assemblages but one by one and that if it were possible to have all the phenomena of the past presented to us the convenient epochs and formations of the geologist though having a certain distinctness would fade into one another with limits as undefinable as those of the distinct and yet separable colours of the solar spectrum  such is a brief summary of the main truths which have been established concerning species are these truths ultimate and irresolvable facts or are their complexities and perplexities the mere expressions of a higher law  a large number of persons practically assume the former position to be correct they believe that the writer of the pentateuch was empowered and commissioned to teach us scientific as well as other truth that the account we find there of the creation of living things is simply and literally correct and that anything which seems to contradict it is by the nature of the case false all the phenomena which have been detailed are on this view the immediate product of a creative fiat and consequently are out of the domain of science altogether  whether this view prove ultimately to be true or false it is at any rate not at present supported by what is commonly regarded as logical proof even if it be capable of discussion by reason and hence we consider ourselves at liberty to pass it by and to turn to those views which profess to rest on a scientific basis only and therefore admit of being argued to their consequences and we do this with the less hesitation as it so happens that those persons who are practically conversant with the facts of the case plainly a considerable advantage have always thought fit to range themselves under the latter category  the majority of these competent persons have up to the present time maintained two positionsthe first that every species is within certain defined limits fixed and incapable of modification the second that every species was originally produced by a distinct creative act the second position is obviously incapable of proof or disproof the direct operations of the creator not being subjects of science and it must therefore be regarded as a corollary from the first the truth or falsehood of which is a matter of evidence most persons imagine that the arguments in favour of it are overwhelming but to some few minds and these it must be confessed intellects of no small power and grasp of knowledge they have not brought conviction among these minds that of the famous naturalist lamarck who possessed a greater acquaintance with the lower forms of life than any man of his day cuvier not excepted and was a good botanist to boot occupies a prominent place  two facts appear to have strongly affected the course of thought of this remarkable manthe one that finer or stronger links of affinity connect all living beings with one another and that thus the highest creature grades by multitudinous steps into the lowest the other that an organ may be developed in particular directions by exerting itself in particular ways and that modifications once induced may be transmitted and become hereditary putting these facts together lamarck endeavoured to account for the first by the operation of the second place an animal in new circumstances says he and its needs will be altered the new needs will create new desires and the attempt to gratify such desires will result in an appropriate modification of the organs exerted make a man a blacksmith and his brachial muscles will develop in accordance with the demands made upon them and in like manner says lamarck the efforts of some shortnecked bird to catch fish without wetting himself have with time and perseverance given rise to all our herons and longnecked waders  the lamarckian hypothesis has long since been justly condemned and it is the established practice for every tyro to raise his heel against the carcase of the dead lion but it is rarely either wise or instructive to treat even the errors of a really great man with mere ridicule and in the present case the logical form of the doctrine stands on a very different footing from its substance  if species have really arisen by the operation of natural conditions we ought to be able to find those conditions now at work we ought to be able to discover in nature some power adequate to modify any given kind of animal or plant in such a manner as to give rise to another kind which would be admitted by naturalists as a distinct species lamarck imagined that he had discovered this vera causa in the admitted facts that some organs may be modified by exercise and that modifications once produced are capable of hereditary transmission it does not seem to have occurred to him to inquire whether there is any reason to believe that there are any limits to the amount of modification producible or to ask how long an animal is likely to endeavour to gratify an impossible desire the bird in our example would surely have renounced fish dinners long before it had produced the least effect on leg or neck  since lamarcks time almost all competent naturalists have left speculations on the origin of species to such dreamers as the author of the vestiges by whose wellintentioned efforts the lamarckian theory received its final condemnation in the minds of all sound thinkers notwithstanding this silence however the transmutation theory as it has been called has been a skeleton in the closet to many an honest zoologist and botanist who had a soul above the mere naming of dried plants and skins surely has such an one thought nature is a mighty and consistent whole and the providential order established in the world of life must if we could only see it rightly be consistent with that dominant over the multiform shapes of brute matter but what is the history of astronomy of all the branches of physics of chemistry of medicine but a narration of the steps by which the human mind has been compelled often sorely against its will to recognise the operation of secondary causes in events where ignorance beheld an immediate intervention of a higher power and when we know that living things are formed of the same elements as the inorganic world that they act and react upon it bound by a thousand ties of natural piety is it probable nay is it possible that they and they alone should have no order in their seeming disorder no unity in their seeming multiplicity should suffer no explanation by the discovery of some central and sublime law of mutual connection  questions of this kind have assuredly often arisen but it might have been long before they received such expression as would have commanded the respect and attention of the scientific world had it not been for the publication of the work which prompted this article its author mr darwin inheritor of a once celebrated name won his spurs in science when most of those now distinguished were young men and has for the last twenty years held a place in the front ranks of british philosophers after a circumnavigatory voyage undertaken solely for the love of his science mr darwin published a series of researches which at once arrested the attention of naturalists and geologists his generalisations have since received ample confirmation and now command universal assent nor is it questionable that they have had the most important influence on the progress of science more recently mr darwin with a versatility which is among the rarest of gifts turned his attention to a most difficult question of zoology and minute anatomy and no living naturalist and anatomist has published a better monograph than that which resulted from his labours such a man at all events has not entered the sanctuary with unwashed hands and when he lays before us the results of twenty years investigation and reflection we must listen even though we be disposed to strike but in reading his work it must be confessed that the attention which might at first be dutifully soon becomes willingly given so clear is the authors thought so outspoken his conviction so honest and fair the candid expression of his doubts those who would judge the book must read it we shall endeavour only to make its line of argument and its philosophical position intelligible to the general reader in our own way  the baker street bazaar has just been exhibiting its familiar annual spectacle straightbacked smallheaded bigbarrelled oxen as dissimilar from any wild species as can well be imagined contended for attention and praise with sheep of halfadozen different breeds and styes of bloated preposterous pigs no more like a wild boar or sow than a city alderman is like an ourangoutang the cattle show has been and perhaps may again be succeeded by a poultry show of whose crowing and clucking prodigies it can only be certainly predicated that they will be very unlike the aboriginal phasianus gallus if the seeker after animal anomalies is not satisfied a turn or two in seven dials will convince him that the breeds of pigeons are quite as extraordinary and unlike one another and their parent stock while the horticultural society will provide him with any number of corresponding vegetable aberrations from natures types he will learn with no little surprise too in the course of his travels that the proprietors and producers of these animal and vegetable anomalies regard them as distinct species with a firm belief the strength of which is exactly proportioned to their ignorance of scientific biology and which is the more remarkable as they are all proud of their skill in originating such species  on careful inquiry it is found that all these and the many other artificial breeds or races of animals and plants have been produced by one method the breederand a skilful one must be a person of much sagacity and natural or acquired perceptive facultynotes some slight difference arising he knows not how in some individuals of his stock if he wish to perpetuate the difference to form a breed with the peculiarity in question strongly marked he selects such male and female individuals as exhibit the desired character and breeds from them their offspring are then carefully examined and those which exhibit the peculiarity the most distinctly are selected for breeding and this operation is repeated until the desired amount of divergence from the primitive stock is reached it is then found that by continuing the process of selectionalways breeding that is from wellmarked forms and allowing no impure crosses to interferea race may be formed the tendency of which to reproduce itself is exceedingly strong nor is the limit to the amount of divergence which may be thus produced known but one thing is certain that if certain breeds of dogs or of pigeons or of horses were known only in a fossil state no naturalist would hesitate in regarding them as distinct species  but in all these cases we have human interference without the breeder there would be no selection and without the selection no race before admitting the possibility of natural species having originated in any similar way it must be proved that there is in nature some power which takes the place of man and performs a selection suâ sponte it is the claim of mr darwin that he professes to have discovered the existence and the modus operandi of this natural selection as he terms it and if he be right the process is perfectly simple and comprehensible and irresistibly deducible from very familiar but well nigh forgotten facts  who for instance has duly reflected upon all the consequences of the marvellous struggle for existence which is daily and hourly going on among living beings not only does every animal live at the expense of some other animal or plant but the very plants are at war the ground is full of seeds that cannot rise into seedlings the seedlings rob one another of air light and water the strongest robber winning the day and extinguishing his competitors year after year the wild animals with which man never interferes are on the average neither more nor less numerous than they were and yet we know that the annual produce of every pair is from one to perhaps a million young so that it is mathematically certain that on the average as many are killed by natural causes as are born every year and those only escape which happen to be a little better fitted to resist destruction than those which die the individuals of a species are like the crew of a foundered ship and none but good swimmers have a chance of reaching the land  such being unquestionably the necessary conditions under which living creatures exist mr darwin discovers in them the instrument of natural selection suppose that in the midst of this incessant competition some individuals of a species a present accidental variations which happen to fit them a little better than their fellows for the struggle in which they are engaged then the chances are in favour not only of these individuals being better nourished than the others but of their predominating over their fellows in other ways and of having a better chance of leaving offspring which will of course tend to reproduce the peculiarities of their parents their offspring will by a parity of reasoning tend to predominate over their contemporaries and there being suppose no room for more than one species such as a the weaker variety will eventually be destroyed by the new destructive influence which is thrown into the scale and the stronger will take its place surrounding conditions remaining unchanged the new variety which we may call bsupposed for arguments sake to be the best adapted for these conditions which can be got out of the original stockwill remain unchanged all accidental deviations from the type becoming at once extinguished as less fit for their post than b itself the tendency of b to persist will grow with its persistence through successive generations and it will acquire all the characters of a new species  but on the other hand if the conditions of life change in any degree however slight b may no longer be that form which is best adapted to withstand their destructive and profit by their sustaining influence in which case if it should give rise to a more competent variety c this will take its place and become a new species and thus by natural selection the species b and c will be successively derived from a  that this most ingenious hypothesis enables us to give a reason for many apparent anomalies in the distribution of living beings in time and space and that it is not contradicted by the main phenomena of life and organisation appear to us to be unquestionable and so far it must be admitted to have an immense advantage over any of its predecessors but it is quite another matter to affirm absolutely either the truth or falsehood of mr darwins views at the present stage of the inquiry goethe has an excellent aphorism defining that state of mind which he calls thätige skepsisactive doubt it is doubt which so loves truth that it neither dares rest in doubting nor extinguish itself by unjustified belief and we commend this state of mind to students of species with respect to mr darwins or any other hypothesis as to their origin the combined investigations of another twenty years may perhaps enable naturalists to say whether the modifying causes and the selective power which mr darwin has satisfactorily shown to exist in nature are competent to produce all the effects he ascribes to them or whether on the other hand he has been led to overestimate the value of the principle of natural selection as greatly as lamarck overestimated his vera causa of modification by exercise  but there is at all events one advantage possessed by the more recent writer over his predecessor mr darwin abhors mere speculation as nature abhors a vacuum he is as greedy of cases and precedents as any constitutional lawyer and all the principles he lays down are capable of being brought to the test of observation and experiment the path he bids us follow professes to be not a mere airy track fabricated of ideal cobwebs but a solid and broad bridge of facts if it be so it will carry us safely over many a chasm in our knowledge and lead us to a region free from the snares of those fascinating but barren virgins the final causes against whom a high authority has so justly warned us my sons dig in the vineyard were the last words of the old man in the fable and though the sons found no treasure they made their fortunes by the grapes     ii  the origin of species  1860   mr darwins longstanding and wellearned scientific eminence probably renders him indifferent to that social notoriety which passes by the name of success but if the calm spirit of the philosopher have not yet wholly superseded the ambition and the vanity of the carnal man within him he must be well satisfied with the results of his venture in publishing the origin of species overflowing the narrow bounds of purely scientific circles the species question divides with italy and the volunteers the attention of general society everybody has read mr darwins book or at least has given an opinion upon its merits or demerits pietists whether lay or ecclesiastic decry it with the mild railing which sounds so charitable bigots denounce it with ignorant invective old ladies of both sexes consider it a decidedly dangerous book and even savants who have no better mud to throw quote antiquated writers to show that its author is no better than an ape himself while every philosophical thinker hails it as a veritable whitworth gun in the armoury of liberalism and all competent naturalists and physiologists whatever their opinions as to the ultimate fate of the doctrines put forth acknowledge that the work in which they are embodied is a solid contribution to knowledge and inaugurates a new epoch in natural history  nor has the discussion of the subject been restrained within the limits of conversation when the public is eager and interested reviewers must minister to its wants and the genuine littérateur is too much in the habit of acquiring his knowledge from the book he judgesas the abyssinian is said to provide himself with steaks from the ox which carries himto be withheld from criticism of a profound scientific work by the mere want of the requisite preliminary scientific acquirement while on the other hand the men of science who wish well to the new views no less than those who dispute their validity have naturally sought opportunities of expressing their opinions hence it is not surprising that almost all the critical journals have noticed mr darwins work at greater or less length and so many disquisitions of every degree of excellence from the poor product of ignorance too often stimulated by prejudice to the fair and thoughtful essay of the candid student of nature have appeared that it seems an almost hopeless task to attempt to say anything new upon the question  but it may be doubted if the knowledge and acumen of prejudged scientific opponents and the subtlety of orthodox special pleaders have yet exerted their full force in mystifying the real issues of the great controversy which has been set afoot and whose end is hardly likely to be seen by this generation so that at this eleventh hour and even failing anything new it may be useful to state afresh that which is true and to put the fundamental positions advocated by mr darwin in such a form that they may be grasped by those whose special studies lie in other directions and the adoption of this course may be the more advisable because notwithstanding its great deserts and indeed partly on account of them the origin of species is by no means an easy book to readif by reading is implied the full comprehension of an authors meaning  we do not speak jestingly in saying that it is mr darwins misfortune to know more about the question he has taken up than any man living personally and practically exercised in zoology in minute anatomy in geology a student of geographical distribution not on maps and in museums only but by long voyages and laborious collection having largely advanced each of these branches of science and having spent many years in gathering and sifting materials for his present work the store of accurately registered facts upon which the author of the origin of species is able to draw at will is prodigious  but this very superabundance of matter must have been embarrassing to a writer who for the present can only put forward an abstract of his views and thence it arises perhaps that notwithstanding the clearness of the style those who attempt fairly to digest the book find much of it a sort of intellectual pemmicana mass of facts crushed and pounded into shape rather than held together by the ordinary medium of an obvious logical bond due attention will without doubt discover this bond but it is often hard to find  again from sheer want of room much has to be taken for granted which might readily enough be proved and hence while the adept who can supply the missing links in the evidence from his own knowledge discovers fresh proof of the singular thoroughness with which all difficulties have been considered and all unjustifiable suppositions avoided at every reperusal of mr darwins pregnant paragraphs the novice in biology is apt to complain of the frequency of what he fancies is gratuitous assumption  thus while it may be doubted if for some years any one is likely to be competent to pronounce judgment on all the issues raised by mr darwin there is assuredly abundant room for him who assuming the humbler though perhaps as useful office of an interpreter between the origin of species and the public contents himself with endeavouring to point out the nature of the problems which it discusses to distinguish between the ascertained facts and the theoretical views which it contains and finally to show the extent to which the explanation it offers satisfies the requirements of scientific logic at any rate it is this office which we purpose to undertake in the following pages  it may be safely assumed that our readers have a general conception of the nature of the objects to which the word species is applied but it has perhaps occurred to a few even to those who are naturalists ex professo to reflect that as commonly employed the term has a double sense and denotes two very different orders of relations when we call a group of animals or of plants a species we may imply thereby either that all these animals or plants have some common peculiarity of form or structure or we may mean that they possess some common functional character that part of biological science which deals with form and structure is called morphologythat which concerns itself with function physiologyso that we may conveniently speak of these two senses or aspects of speciesthe one as morphological the other as physiological regarded from the former point of view a species is nothing more than a kind of animal or plant which is distinctly definable from all others by certain constant and not merely sexual morphological peculiarities thus horses form a species because the group of animals to which that name is applied is distinguished from all others in the world by the following constantly associated characters they have1 a vertebral column 2 mammae 3 a placental embryo 4 four legs 5 a single welldeveloped toe in each foot provided with a hoof 6 a bushy tail and 7 callosities on the inner sides of both the fore and the hind legs the asses again form a distinct species because with the same characters as far as the fifth in the above list all asses have tufted tails and have callosities only on the inner side of the forelegs if animals were discovered having the general characters of the horse but sometimes with callosities only on the forelegs and more or less tufted tails or animals having the general characters of the ass but with more or less bushy tails and sometimes with callosities on both pairs of legs besides being intermediate in other respectsthe two species would have to be merged into one they could no longer be regarded as morphologically distinct species for they would not be distinctly definable one from the other  however bare and simple this definition of species may appear to be we confidently appeal to all practical naturalists whether zoologists botanists or palaeontologists to say if in the vast majority of cases they know or mean to affirm anything more of the group of animals or plants they so denominate than what has just been stated even the most decided advocates of the received doctrines respecting species admit this  i apprehend says professor owen footnote on the osteology of the chimpanzees and orangs transactions of the zoological society 1858 that few naturalists nowadays in describing and proposing a name for what they call a new species use that term to signify what was meant by it twenty or thirty years ago that is an originally distinct creation maintaining its primitive distinction by obstructive generative peculiarities the proposer of the new species now intends to state no more than he actually knows as for example that the differences on which he founds the specific character are constant in individuals of both sexes so far as observation has reached and that they are not due to domestication or to artificially superinduced external circumstances or to any outward influence within his cognizance that the species is wild or is such as it appears by nature  if we consider in fact that by far the largest proportion of recorded existing species are known only by the study of their skins or bones or other lifeless exuviae that we are acquainted with none or next to none of their physiological peculiarities beyond those which can be deduced from their structure or are open to cursory observation and that we cannot hope to learn more of any of those extinct forms of life which now constitute no inconsiderable proportion of the known flora and fauna of the world it is obvious that the definitions of these species can be only of a purely structural or morphological character it is probable that naturalists would have avoided much confusion of ideas if they had more frequently borne the necessary limitations of our knowledge in mind but while it may safely be admitted that we are acquainted with only the morphological characters of the vast majority of speciesthe functional or physiological peculiarities of a few have been carefully investigated and the result of that study forms a large and most interesting portion of the physiology of reproduction  the student of nature wonders the more and is astonished the less the more conversant he becomes with her operations but of all the perennial miracles she offers to his inspection perhaps the most worthy of admiration is the development of a plant or of an animal from its embryo examine the recently laid egg of some common animal such as a salamander or newt it is a minute spheroid in which the best microscope will reveal nothing but a structureless sac enclosing a glairy fluid holding granules in suspension footnote when this sentence was written it was generally believed that the original nucleus of the egg the germinal vesicle disappeared 1893 but strange possibilities lie dormant in that semifluid globule let a moderate supply of warmth reach its watery cradle and the plastic matter undergoes changes so rapid yet so steady and purposelike in their succession that one can only compare them to those operated by a skilled modeller upon a formless lump of clay as with an invisible trowel the mass is divided and subdivided into smaller and smaller portions until it is reduced to an aggregation of granules not too large to build withal the finest fabrics of the nascent organism and then it is as if a delicate finger traced out the line to be occupied by the spinal column and moulded the contour of the body pinching up the head at one end the tail at the other and fashioning flank and limb into due salamandrine proportions in so artistic a way that after watching the process hour by hour one is almost involuntarily possessed by the notion that some more subtle aid to vision than an achromatic would show the hidden artist with his plan before him striving with skilful manipulation to perfect his work  as life advances and the young amphibian ranges the waters the terror of his insect contemporaries not only are the nutritious particles supplied by its prey by the addition of which to its frame growth takes place laid down each in its proper spot and in such due proportion to the rest as to reproduce the form the colour and the size characteristic of the parental stock but even the wonderful powers of reproducing lost parts possessed by these animals are controlled by the same governing tendency cut off the legs the tail the jaws separately or all together and as spallanzani showed long ago these parts not only grow again but the redintegrated limb is formed on the same type as those which were lost the new jaw or leg is a newts and never by any accident more like that of a frog what is true of the newt is true of every animal and of every plant the acorn tends to build itself up again into a woodland giant such as that from whose twig it fell the spore of the humblest lichen reproduces the green or brown incrustation which gave it birth and at the other end of the scale of life the child that resembled neither the paternal nor the maternal side of the house would be regarded as a kind of monster  so that the one end to which in all living beings the formative impulse is tendingthe one scheme which the archæus of the old speculators strives to carry out seems to be to mould the offspring into the likeness of the parent it is the first great law of reproduction that the offspring tends to resemble its parent or parents more closely than anything else  science will some day show us how this law is a necessary consequence of the more general laws which govern matter but for the present more can hardly be said than that it appears to be in harmony with them we know that the phænomena of vitality are not something apart from other physical phænomena but one with them and matter and force are the two names of the one artist who fashions the living as well as the lifeless hence living bodies should obey the same great laws as other matternor throughout nature is there a law of wider application than this that a body impelled by two forces takes the direction of their resultant but living bodies may be regarded as nothing but extremely complex bundles of forces held in a mass of matter as the complex forces of a magnet are held in the steel by its coercive force and since the differences of sex are comparatively slight or in other words the sum of the forces in each has a very similar tendency their resultant the offspring may reasonably be expected to deviate but little from a course parallel to either or to both  represent the reason of the law to ourselves by what physical metaphor or analogy we will however the great matter is to apprehend its existence and the importance of the consequences deducible from it for things which are like to the same are like to one another and if in a great series of generations every offspring is like its parent it follows that all the offspring and all the parents must be like one another and that given an original parental stock with the opportunity of undisturbed multiplication the law in question necessitates the production in course of time of an indefinitely large group the whole of the members of which are at once very similar and are blood relations having descended from the same parent or pair of parents the proof that all the members of any given group of animals or plants had thus descended would be ordinarily considered sufficient to entitle them to the rank of physiological species for most physiologists consider species to be definable as the offspring of a single primitive stock  but though it is quite true that all those groups we call species may according to the known laws of reproduction have descended from a single stock and though it is very likely they really have done so yet this conclusion rests on deduction and can hardly hope to establish itself upon a basis of observation and the primitiveness of the supposed single stock which after all is the essential part of the matter is not only a hypothesis but one which has not a shadow of foundation if by primitive be meant independent of any other living being a scientific definition of which an unwarrantable hypothesis forms an essential part carries its condemnation within itself but even supposing such a definition were in form tenable the physiologist who should attempt to apply it in nature would soon find himself involved in great if not inextricable difficulties as we have said it is indubitable that offspring tend to resemble the parental organism but it is equally true that the similarity attained never amounts to identity either in form or in structure there is always a certain amount of deviation not only from the precise characters of a single parent but when as in most animals and many plants the sexes are lodged in distinct individuals from an exact mean between the two parents and indeed on general principles this slight deviation seems as intelligible as the general similarity if we reflect how complex the cooperating bundles of forces are and how improbable it is that in any case their true resultant shall coincide with any mean between the more obvious characters of the two parents whatever be its cause however the coexistence of this tendency to minor variation with the tendency to general similarity is of vast importance in its bearing on the question of the origin of species  as a general rule the extent to which an offspring differs from its parent is slight enough but occasionally the amount of difference is much more strongly marked and then the divergent offspring receives the name of a variety multitudes of what there is every reason to believe are such varieties are known but the origin of very few has been accurately recorded and of these we will select two as more especially illustrative of the main features of variation the first of them is that of the ancon or otter sheep of which a careful account is given by colonel david humphreys frs in a letter to sir joseph banks published in the philosophical transactions for 1813 it appears that one seth wright the proprietor of a farm on the banks of the charles river in massachusetts possessed a flock of fifteen ewes and a ram of the ordinary kind in the year 1791 one of the ewes presented her owner with a male lamb differing for no assignable reason from its parents by a proportionally long body and short bandy legs whence it was unable to emulate its relatives in those sportive leaps over the neighbours fences in which they were in the habit of indulging much to the good farmers vexation  the second case is that detailed by a no less unexceptionable authority than réaumur in his art de faire éclore les poulets a maltese couple named kelleia whose hands and feet were constructed upon the ordinary human model had born to them a son gratio who possessed six perfectly movable fingers on each hand and six toes not quite so well formed on each foot no cause could be assigned for the appearance of this unusual variety of the human species  two circumstances are well worthy of remark in both these cases in each the variety appears to have arisen in full force and as it were per saltum a wide and definite difference appearing at once between the ancon ram and the ordinary sheep between the sixfingered and sixtoed gratio kelleia and ordinary men in neither case is it possible to point out any obvious reason for the appearance of the variety doubtless there were determining causes for these as for all other phenomena but they do not appear and we can be tolerably certain that what are ordinarily understood as changes in physical conditions as in climate in food or the like did not take place and had nothing to do with the matter it was no case of what is commonly called adaptation to circumstances but to use a conveniently erroneous phrase the variations arose spontaneously the fruitless search after final causes leads their pursuers a long way but even those hardy teleologists who are ready to break through all the laws of physics in chase of their favourite willothewisp may be puzzled to discover what purpose could be attained by the stunted legs of seth wrights ram or the hexadactyle members of gratio kelleia  varieties then arise we know not why and it is more than probable that the majority of varieties have arisen in this spontaneous manner though we are of course far from denying that they may be traced in some cases to distinct external influences which are assuredly competent to alter the character of the tegumentary covering to change colour to increase or diminish the size of muscles to modify constitution and among plants to give rise to the metamorphosis of stamens into petals and so forth but however they may have arisen what especially interests us at present is to remark that once in existence many varieties obey the fundamental law of reproduction that like tends to produce like and their offspring exemplify it by tending to exhibit the same deviation from the parental stock as themselves indeed there seems to be in many instances a prepotent influence about a newlyarisen variety which gives it what one may call an unfair advantage over the normal descendants from the same stock this is strikingly exemplified by the case of gratio kelleia who married a woman with the ordinary pentadactyle extremities and had by her four children salvator george andré and marie of these children salvator the eldest boy had six fingers and six toes like his father the second and third also boys had five fingers and five toes like their mother though the hands and feet of george were slightly deformed the last a girl had five fingers and five toes but the thumbs were slightly deformed the variety thus reproduced itself purely in the eldest while the normal type reproduced itself purely in the third and almost purely in the second and last so that it would seem at first as if the normal type were more powerful than the variety but all these children grew up and intermarried with normal wives and husband and then note what took place salvator had four children three of whom exhibited the hexadactyle members of their grandfather and father while the youngest had the pentadactyle limbs of the mother and grandmother so that here notwithstanding a double pentadactyle dilution of the blood the hexadactyle variety had the best of it the same prepotency of the variety was still more markedly exemplified in the progeny of two of the other children marie and george marie whose thumbs only were deformed gave birth to a boy with six toes and three other normally formed children but george who was not quite so pure a pentadactyle begot first two girls each of whom had six fingers and toes then a girl with six fingers on each hand and six toes on the right foot but only five toes on the left and lastly a boy with only five fingers and toes in these instances therefore the variety as it were leaped over one generation to reproduce itself in full force in the next finally the purely pentadactyle andré was the father of many children not one of whom departed from the normal parental type  if a variation which approaches the nature of a monstrosity can strive thus forcibly to reproduce itself it is not wonderful that less aberrant modifications should tend to be preserved even more strongly and the history of the ancon sheep is in this respect particularly instructive with the cuteness characteristic of their nation the neighbours of the massachusetts farmer imagined it would be an excellent thing if all his sheep were imbued with the stayathome tendencies enforced by nature upon the newlyarrived ram and they advised wright to kill the old patriarch of his fold and install the ancon ram in his place the result justified their sagacious anticipations and coincided very nearly with what occurred to the progeny of gratio kelleia the young lambs were almost always either pure ancons or pure ordinary sheepfootnote colonel humphreys statements are exceedingly explicit on this point when an ancon ewe is impregnated by a common ram the increase resembles wholly either the ewe or the ram the increase of the common ewe impregnated by an ancon ram follows entirely the one or the other without blending any of the distinguishing and essential peculiarities of both frequent instances have happened where common ewes have had twins by ancon rams when one exhibited the complete marks and features of the ewe the other of the ram the contrast has been rendered singularly striking when one shortlegged and one longlegged lamb produced at a birth have been seen sucking the dam at the same timephilosophical transactions 1813 ft i pp 89 90 but when sufficient ancon sheep were obtained to interbreed with one another it was found that the offspring was always pure ancon colonel humphreys in fact states that he was acquainted with only one questionable case of a contrary nature here then is a remarkable and wellestablished instance not only of a very distinct race being established per saltum but of that race breeding true at once and showing no mixed forms even when crossed with another breed  by taking care to select ancons of both sexes for breeding from it thus became easy to establish an extremely wellmarked race so peculiar that even when herded with other sheep it was noted that the ancons kept together and there is every reason to believe that the existence of this breed might have been indefinitely protracted but the introduction of the merino sheep which were not only very superior to the ancons in wool and meat but quite as quiet and orderly led to the complete neglect of the new breed so that in 1813 colonel humphreys found it difficult to obtain the specimen the skeleton of which was presented to sir joseph banks we believe that for many years no remnant of it has existed in the united states  gratio kelleia was not the progenitor of a race of sixfingered men as seth wrights ram became a nation of ancon sheep though the tendency of the variety to perpetuate itself appears to have been fully as strong in the one case as in the other and the reason of the difference is not far to seek seth wright took care not to weaken the ancon blood by matching his ancon ewes with any but males of the same variety while gratio kelleias sons were too far removed from the patriarchal times to intermarry with their sisters and his grandchildren seem not to have been attracted by their sixfingered cousins in other words in the one example a race was produced because for several generations care was taken to select both parents of the breeding stock from animals exhibiting a tendency to vary in the same direction while in the other no race was evolved because no such selection was exercised a race is a propagated variety and as by the laws of reproduction offspring tend to assume the parental forms they will be more likely to propagate a variation exhibited by both parents than that possessed by only one  there is no organ of the body of an animal which may not and does not occasionally vary more or less from the normal type and there is no variation which may not be transmitted and which if selectively transmitted may not become the foundation of a race this great truth sometimes forgotten by philosophers has long been familiar to practical agriculturists and breeders and upon it rest all the methods of improving the breeds of domestic animals which for the last century have been followed with so much success in england colour form size texture of hair or wool proportions of various parts strength or weakness of constitution tendency to fatten or to remain lean to give much or little milk speed strength temper intelligence special instincts there is not one of these characters the transmission of which is not an everyday occurrence within the experience of cattlebreeders stockfarmers horsedealers and dog and poultry fanciers nay it is only the other day that an eminent physiologist dr brownséquard communicated to the royal society his discovery that epilepsy artificially produced in guineapigs by a means which he has discovered is transmitted to their offspring footnote compare weismanns essays upon heredity p 310 et seq 1893  but a race once produced is no more a fixed and immutable entity than the stock whence it sprang variations arise among its members and as these variations are transmitted like any others new races may be developed out of the preexisting one ad infinitum or at least within any limit at present determined given sufficient time and sufficiently careful selection and the multitude of races which may arise from a common stock is as astonishing as are the extreme structural differences which they may present a remarkable example of this is to be found in the rockpigeon which mr darwin has in our opinion satisfactorily demonstrated to be the progenitor of all our domestic pigeons of which there are certainly more than a hundred wellmarked races the most noteworthy of these races are the four great stocks known to the fancy as tumblers pouters carriers and fantails birds which not only differ most singularly in size colour and habits but in the form of the beak and of the skull in the proportions of the beak to the skull in the number of tailfeathers in the absolute and relative size of the feet in the presence or absence of the uropygial gland in the number of vertebræ in the back in short in precisely those characters in which the genera and species of birds differ from one another  and it is most remarkable and instructive to observe that none of these races can be shown to have been originated by the action of changes in what are commonly called external circumstances upon the wild rockpigeon on the contrary from time immemorial pigeonfanciers have had essentially similar methods of treating their pets which have been housed fed protected and cared for in much the same way in all pigeonries in fact there is no case better adapted than that of the pigeons to refute the doctrine which one sees put forth on high authority that no other characters than those founded on the development of bone for the attachment of muscles are capable of variation in precise contradiction of this hasty assertion mr darwins researches prove that the skeleton of the wings in domestic pigeons has hardly varied at all from that of the wild type while on the other hand it is in exactly those respects such as the relative length of the beak and skull the number of the vertebrae and the number of the tailfeathers in which muscular exertion can have no important influence that the utmost amount of variation has taken place  we have said that the following out of the properties exhibited by physiological species would lead us into difficulties and at this point they begin to be obvious for if as the result of spontaneous variation and of selective breeding the progeny of a common stock may become separated into groups distinguished from one another by constant not sexual morphological characters it is clear that the physiological definition of species is likely to clash with the morphological definition no one would hesitate to describe the pouter and the tumbler as distinct species if they were found fossil or if their skins and skeletons were imported as those of exotic wild birds commonly areand without doubt if considered alone they are good and distinct morphological species on the other hand they are not physiological species for they are descended from a common stock the rockpigeon  under these circumstances as it is admitted on all sides that races occur in nature how are we to know whether any apparently distinct animals are really of different physiological species or not seeing that the amount of morphological difference is no safe guide is there any test of a physiological species the usual answer of physiologists is in the affirmative it is said that such a test is to be found in the phænomena of hybridisationin the results of crossing races as compared with the results of crossing species  so far as the evidence goes at present individuals of what are certainly known to be mere races produced by selection however distinct they may appear to be not only breed freely together but the offspring of such crossed races are perfectly fertile with one another thus the spaniel and the greyhound the drayhorse and the arab the pouter and the tumbler breed together with perfect freedom and their mongrels if matched with other mongrels of the same kind are equally fertile  on the other hand there can be no doubt that the individuals of many natural species are either absolutely infertile if crossed with individuals of other species or if they give rise to hybrid offspring the hybrids so produced are infertile when paired together the horse and the ass for instance if so crossed give rise to the mule and there is no certain evidence of offspring ever having been produced by a male and female mule the unions of the rockpigeon and the ringpigeon appear to be equally barren of result here then says the physiologist we have a means of distinguishing any two true species from any two varieties if a male and a female selected from each group produce offspring and that offspring is fertile with others produced in the same way the groups are races and not species if on the other hand no result ensues or if the offspring are infertile with others produced in the same way they are true physiological species the test would be an admirable one if in the first place it were always practicable to apply it and if in the second it always yielded results susceptible of a definite interpretation unfortunately in the great majority of cases this touchstone for species is wholly inapplicable  the constitution of many wild animals is so altered by confinement that they will not breed even with their own females so that the negative results obtained from crosses are of no value and the antipathy of wild animals of different species for one another or even of wild and tame members of the same species is ordinarily so great that it is hopeless to look for such unions in nature the hermaphrodism of most plants the difficulty in the way of insuring the absence of their own or the proper working of other pollen are obstacles of no less magnitude in applying the test to them and in both animals and plants is superadded the further difficulty that experiments must be continued over a long time for the purpose of ascertaining the fertility of the mongrel or hybrid progeny as well as of the first crosses from which they spring  not only do these great practical difficulties lie in the way of applying the hybridisation test but even when this oracle can be questioned its replies are sometimes as doubtful as those of delphi for example cases are cited by mr darwin of plants which are more fertile with the pollen of another species than with their own and there are others such as certain fuci the male element of which will fertilise the ovule of a plant of distinct species while the males of the latter species are ineffective with the females of the first so that in the lastnamed instance a physiologist who should cross the two species in one way would decide that they were true species while another who should cross them in the reverse way would with equal justice according to the rule pronounce them to be mere races several plants which there is great reason to believe are mere varieties are almost sterile when crossed while both animals and plants which have always been regarded by naturalists as of distinct species turn out when the test is applied to be perfectly fertile again the sterility or fertility of crosses seems to bear no relation to the structural resemblances or differences of the members of any two groups  mr darwin has discussed this question with singular ability and circumspection and his conclusions are summed up as follows at page 276 of his work  first crosses between forms sufficiently distinct to be ranked as species and their hybrids are very generally but not universally sterile the sterility is of all degrees and is often so slight that the two most careful experimentalists who have ever lived have come to diametrically opposite conclusions in ranking forms by this test the sterility is innately variable in individuals of the same species and is eminently susceptible of favourable and unfavourable conditions the degree of sterility does not strictly follow systematic affinity but is governed by several curious and complex laws it is generally different and sometimes widely different in reciprocal crosses between the same two species it is not always equal in degree in a first cross and in the hybrid produced from this cross  in the same manner as in grafting trees the capacity of one species or variety to take on another is incidental on generally unknown differences in their vegetative systems so in crossing the greater or less facility of one species to unite with another is incidental on unknown differences in their reproductive systems there is no more reason to think that species have been specially endowed with various degrees of sterility to prevent them crossing and breeding in nature than to think that trees have been specially endowed with various and somewhat analogous degrees of difficulty in being grafted together in order to prevent them becoming inarched in our forests  the sterility of first crosses between pure species which have their reproductive systems perfect seems to depend on several circumstances in some cases largely on the early death of the embryo the sterility of hybrids which have their reproductive systems imperfect and which have had this system and their whole organisation disturbed by being compounded of two distinct species seems closely allied to that sterility which so frequently affects pure species when their natural conditions of life have been disturbed this view is supported by a parallelism of another kind namely that the crossing of forms only slightly different is favourable to the vigour and fertility of the offspring and that slight changes in the conditions of life are apparently favourable to the vigour and fertility of all organic beings it is not surprising that the degree of difficulty in uniting two species and the degree of sterility of their hybrid offspring should generally correspond though due to distinct causes for both depend on the amount of difference of some kind between the species which are crossed nor is it surprising that the facility of effecting a first cross the fertility of hybrids produced from it and the capacity of being grafted togetherthough this latter capacity evidently depends on widely different circumstancesshould all run to a certain extent parallel with the systematic affinity of the forms which are subjected to experiment for systematic affinity attempts to express all kinds of resemblance between all species  first crosses between forms known to be varieties or sufficiently alike to be considered as varieties and their mongrel offspring are very generally but not quite universally fertile nor is this nearly general and perfect fertility surprising when we remember how liable we are to argue in a circle with respect to varieties in a state of nature and when we remember that the greater number of varieties have been produced under domestication by the selection of mere external differences and not of differences in the reproductive system in all other respects excluding fertility there is a close general resemblance between hybrids and mongrelspp 2768  we fully agree with the general tenor of this weighty passage but forcible as are these arguments and little as the value of fertility or infertility as a test of species may be it must not be forgotten that the really important fact so far as the inquiry into the origin of species goes is that there are such things in nature as groups of animals and of plants the members of which are incapable of fertile union with those of other groups and that there are such things as hybrids which are absolutely sterile when crossed with other hybrids for if such phænomena as these were exhibited by only two of those assemblages of living objects to which the name of species whether it be used in its physiological or in its morphological sense is given it would have to be accounted for by any theory of the origin of species and every theory which could not account for it would be so far imperfect  up to this point we have been dealing with matters of fact and the statements which we have laid before the reader would to the best of our knowledge be admitted to contain a fair exposition of what is at present known respecting the essential properties of species by all who have studied the question and whatever may be his theoretical views no naturalist will probably be disposed to demur to the following summary of that exposition  living beings whether animals or plants are divisible into multitudes of distinctly definable kinds which are morphological species they are also divisible into groups of individuals which breed freely together tending to reproduce their like and are physiological species normally resembling their parents the offspring of members of these species are still liable to vary and the variation may be perpetuated by selection as a race which race in many cases presents all the characteristics of a morphological species but it is not as yet proved that a race ever exhibits when crossed with another race of the same species those phænomena of hybridisation which are exhibited by many species when crossed with other species on the other hand not only is it not proved that all species give rise to hybrids infertile inter se but there is much reason to believe that in crossing species exhibit every gradation from perfect sterility to perfect fertility  such are the most essential characteristics of species even were man not one of thema member of the same system and subject to the same lawsthe question of their origin their causal connexion that is with the other phænomena of the universe must have attracted his attention as soon as his intelligence had raised itself above the level of his daily wants  indeed history relates that such was the case and has embalmed for us the speculations upon the origin of living beings which were among the earliest products of the dawning intellectual activity of man in those early days positive knowledge was not to be had but the craving after it needed at all hazards to be satisfied and according to the country or the turn of thought of the speculator the suggestion that all living things arose from the mud of the nile from a primeval egg or from some more anthropomorphic agency afforded a sufficient restingplace for his curiosity the myths of paganism are as dead as osiris or zeus and the man who should revive them in opposition to the knowledge of our time would be justly laughed to scorn but the coeval imaginations current among the rude inhabitants of palestine recorded by writers whose very name and age are admitted by every scholar to be unknown have unfortunately not yet shared their fate but even at this day are regarded by ninetenths of the civilised world as the authoritative standard of fact and the criterion of the justice of scientific conclusions in all that relates to the origin of things and among them of species in this nineteenth century as at the dawn of modern physical science the cosmogony of the semibarbarous hebrew is the incubus of the philosopher and the opprobrium of the orthodox who shall number the patient and earnest seekers after truth from the days of galileo until now whose lives have been embittered and their good name blasted by the mistaken zeal of bibliolaters who shall count the host of weaker men whose sense of truth has been destroyed in the effort to harmonise impossibilitieswhose life has been wasted in the attempt to force the generous new wine of science into the old bottles of judaism compelled by the outcry of the same strong party  it is true that if philosophers have suffered their cause has been amply avenged extinguished theologians lie about the cradle of every science as the strangled snakes beside that of hercules and history records that whenever science and orthodoxy have been fairly opposed the latter has been forced to retire from the lists bleeding and crushed if not annihilated scotched if not slain but orthodoxy is the bourbon of the world of thought it learns not neither can it forget and though at present bewildered and afraid to move it is as willing as ever to insist that the first chapter of genesis contains the beginning and the end of sound science and to visit with such petty thunderbolts as its halfparalysed hands can hurl those who refuse to degrade nature to the level of primitive judaism  philosophers on the other hand have no such aggressive tendencies with eyes fixed on the noble goal to which per aspera et ardua they tend they may now and then be stirred to momentary wrath by the unnecessary obstacles with which the ignorant or the malicious encumber if they cannot bar the difficult path but why should their souls be deeply vexed the majesty of fact is on their side and the elemental forces of nature are working for them not a star comes to the meridian at its calculated time but testifies to the justice of their methodstheir beliefs are one with the falling rain and with the growing corn by doubt they are established and open inquiry is their bosom friend such men have no fear of traditions however venerable and no respect for them when they become mischievous and obstructive but they have better than mere antiquarian business in hand and if dogmas which ought to be fossil but are not are not forced upon their notice they are too happy to treat them as nonexistent                                       the hypotheses respecting the origin of species which profess to stand upon a scientific basis and as such alone demand serious attention are of two kinds the one the special creation hypothesis presumes every species to have originated from one or more stocks these not being the result of the modification of any other form of living matteror arising by natural agenciesbut being produced as such by a supernatural creative act  the other the socalled transmutation hypothesis considers that all existing species are the result of the modification of preexisting species and those of their predecessors by agencies similar to those which at the present day produce varieties and races and therefore in an altogether natural way and it is a probable though not a necessary consequence of this hypothesis that all living beings have arisen from a single stock with respect to the origin of this primitive stock or stocks the doctrine of the origin of species is obviously not necessarily concerned the transmutation hypothesis for example is perfectly consistent either with the conception of a special creation of the primitive germ or with the supposition of its having arisen as a modification of inorganic matter by natural causes  the doctrine of special creation owes its existence very largely to the supposed necessity of making science accord with the hebrew cosmogony but it is curious to observe that as the doctrine is at present maintained by men of science it is as hopelessly inconsistent with the hebrew view as any other hypothesis  if there be any result which has come more clearly out of geological investigation than another it is that the vast series of extinct animals and plants is not divisible as it was once supposed to be into distinct groups separated by sharplymarked boundaries there are no great gulfs between epochs and formationsno successive periods marked by the appearance of plants of water animals and of land animals en masse every year adds to the list of links between what the older geologists supposed to be widely separated epochs witness the crags linking the drift with older tertiaries the maestricht beds linking the tertiaries with the chalk the st cassian beds exhibiting an abundant fauna of mixed mesozoic and palaeozoic types in rocks of an epoch once supposed to be eminently poor in life witness lastly the incessant disputes as to whether a given stratum shall be reckoned devonian or carboniferous silurian or devonian cambrian or silurian  this truth is further illustrated in a most interesting manner by the impartial and highly competent testimony of m pictet from whose calculations of what percentage of the genera of animals existing in any formation lived during the preceding formation it results that in no case is the proportion less than onethird or 33 per cent it is the triassic formation or the commencement of the mesozoic epoch which has received the smallest inheritance from preceding ages the other formations not uncommonly exhibit 60 80 or even 94 per cent of genera in common with those whose remains are imbedded in their predecessor not only is this true but the subdivisions of each formation exhibit new species characteristic of and found only in them and in many cases as in the lias for example the separate beds of these subdivisions are distinguished by wellmarked and peculiar forms of life a section a hundred feet thick will exhibit at different heights a dozen species of ammonite none of which passes beyond its particular zone of limestone or clay into the zone below it or into that above it so that those who adopt the doctrine of special creation must be prepared to admit that at intervals of time corresponding with the thickness of these beds the creator thought fit to interfere with the natural course of events for the purpose of making a new ammonite it is not easy to transplant oneself into the frame of mind of those who can accept such a conclusion as this on any evidence short of absolute demonstration and it is difficult to see what is to be gained by so doing since as we have said it is obvious that such a view of the origin of living beings is utterly opposed to the hebrew cosmogony deserving no aid from the powerful arm of bibliolatry then does the received form of the hypothesis of special creation derive any support from science or sound logic assuredly not much the arguments brought forward in its favour all take one form if species were not supernaturally created we cannot understand the facts x or y or z we cannot understand the structure of animals or plants unless we suppose they were contrived for special ends we cannot understand the structure of the eye except by supposing it to have been made to see with we cannot understand instincts unless we suppose animals to have been miraculously endowed with them  as a question of dialectics it must be admitted that this sort of reasoning is not very formidable to those who are not to be frightened by consequences it is an argumentum ad ignorantiamtake this explanation or be ignorant but suppose we prefer to admit our ignorance rather than adopt a hypothesis at variance with all the teachings of nature or suppose for a moment we admit the explanation and then seriously ask ourselves how much the wiser are we what does the explanation explain is it any more than a grandiloquent way of announcing the fact that we really know nothing about the matter a phenomenon is explained when it is shown to be a case of some general law of nature but the supernatural interposition of the creator can by the nature of the case exemplify no law and if species have really arisen in this way it is absurd to attempt to discuss their origin  or lastly let us ask ourselves whether any amount of evidence which the nature of our faculties permits us to attain can justify us in asserting that any phenomenon is out of the reach of natural causation to this end it is obviously necessary that we should know all the consequences to which all possible combinations continued through unlimited time can give rise if we knew these and found none competent to originate species we should have good ground for denying their origin by natural causation till we know them any hypothesis is better than one which involves us in such miserable presumption  but the hypothesis of special creation is not only a mere specious mask for our ignorance its existence in biology marks the youth and imperfection of the science for what is the history of every science but the history of the elimination of the notion of creative or other interferences with the natural order of the phænomena which are the subjectmatter of that science when astronomy was young the morning stars sang together for joy and the planets were guided in their courses by celestial hands now the harmony of the stars has resolved itself into gravitation according to the inverse squares of the distances and the orbits of the planets are deducible from the laws of the forces which allow a schoolboys stone to break a window the lightning was the angel of the lord but it has pleased providence in these modern times that science should make it the humble messenger of man and we know that every flash that shimmers about the horizon on a summers evening is determined by ascertainable conditions and that its direction and brightness might if our knowledge of these were great enough have been calculated  the solvency of great mercantile companies rests on the validity of the laws which have been ascertained to govern the seeming irregularity of that human life which the moralist bewails as the most uncertain of things plague pestilence and famine are admitted by all but fools to be the natural result of causes for the most part fully within human control and not the unavoidable tortures inflicted by wrathful omnipotence upon his helpless handiwork  harmonious order governing eternally continuous progressthe web and woof of matter and force interweaving by slow degrees without a broken thread that veil which lies between us and the infinitethat universe which alone we know or can know such is the picture which science draws of the world and in proportion as any part of that picture is in unison with the rest so may we feel sure that it is rightly painted shall biology alone remain out of harmony with her sister sciences  such arguments against the hypothesis of the direct creation of species as these are plainly enough deducible from general considerations but there are in addition phenomena exhibited by species themselves and yet not so much a part of their very essence as to have required earlier mention which are in the highest degree perplexing if we adopt the popularly accepted hypothesis such are the facts of distribution in space and in time the singular phenomena brought to light by the study of development the structural relations of species upon which our systems of classification are founded the great doctrines of philosophical anatomy such as that of homology or of the community of structural plan exhibited by large groups of species differing very widely in their habits and functions  the species of animals which inhabit the sea on opposite sides of the isthmus of panama are wholly distinctfootnote recent investigations tend to show that this statement is not strictly accurate1870 the animals and plants which inhabit islands are commonly distinct from those of the neighbouring mainlands and yet have a similarity of aspect the mammals of the latest tertiary epoch in the old and new worlds belong to the same genera or family groups as those which now inhabit the same great geographical area the crocodilian reptiles which existed in the earliest secondary epoch were similar in general structure to those now living but exhibit slight differences in their vertebræ nasal passages and one or two other points the guineapig has teeth which are shed before it is born and hence can never subserve the masticatory purpose for which they seem contrived and in like manner the female dugong has tusks which never cut the gum all the members of the same great group run through similar conditions in their development and all their parts in the adult state are arranged according to the same plan man is more like a gorilla than a gorilla is like a lemur such are a few taken at random among the multitudes of similar facts which modern research has established but when the student seeks for an explanation of them from the supporters of the received hypothesis of the origin of species the reply he receives is in substance of oriental simplicity and brevitymashallah it so pleases god there are different species on opposite sides of the isthmus of panama because they were created different on the two sides the pliocene mammals are like the existing ones because such was the plan of creation and we find rudimental organs and similarity of plan because it has pleased the creator to set before himself a divine exemplar or archetype and to copy it in his works and somewhat ill those who hold this view imply in some of them that such verbal hocuspocus should be received as science will one day be regarded as evidence of the low state of intelligence in the nineteenth century just as we amuse ourselves with the phraseology about natures abhorrence of a vacuum wherewith torricellis compatriots were satisfied to explain the rise of water in a pump and be it recollected that this sort of satisfaction works not only negative but positive ill by discouraging inquiry and so depriving man of the usufruct of one of the most fertile fields of his great patrimony nature  the objections to the doctrine of the origin of species by special creation which have been detailed must have occurred with more or less force to the mind of every one who has seriously and independently considered the subject it is therefore no wonder that from time to time this hypothesis should have been met by counter hypotheses all as well and some better founded than itself and it is curious to remark that the inventors of the opposing views seem to have been led into them as much by their knowledge of geology as by their acquaintance with biology in fact when the mind has once admitted the conception of the gradual production of the present physical state of our globe by natural causes operating through long ages of time it will be little disposed to allow that living beings have made their appearance in another way and the speculations of de maillet and his successors are the natural complement of scillas demonstration of the true nature of fossils  a contemporary of newton and of leibnitz sharing therefore in the intellectual activity of the remarkable age which witnessed the birth of modern physical science benoît de maillet spent a long life as a consular agent of the french government in various mediterranean ports for sixteen years in fact he held the office of consulgeneral in egypt and the wonderful phenomena offered by the valley of the nile appear to have strongly impressed his mind to have directed his attention to all facts of a similar order which came within his observation and to have led him to speculate on the origin of the present condition of our globe and of its inhabitants but with all his ardour for science de maillet seems to have hesitated to publish views which notwithstanding the ingenious attempts to reconcile them with the hebrew hypothesis contained in the preface to telliamed were hardly likely to be received with favour by his contemporaries  but a short time had elapsed since more than one of the great anatomists and physicists of the italian school had paid dearly for their endeavours to dissipate some of the prevalent errors and their illustrious pupil harvey the founder of modern physiology had not fared so well in a country less oppressed by the benumbing influences of theology as to tempt any man to follow his example probably not uninfluenced by these considerations his catholic majestys consulgeneral for egypt kept his theories to himself throughout a long life for telliamed the only scientific work which is known to have proceeded from his pen was not printed till 1735 when its author had reached the ripe age of seventynine and though de maillet lived three years longer his book was not given to the world before 1748 even then it was anonymous to those who were not in the secret of the anagrammatic character of its title and the preface and dedication are so worded as in case of necessity to give the printer a fair chance of falling back on the excuse that the work was intended for a mere jeu desprit  the speculations of the suppositious indian sage though quite as sound as those of many a mosaic geology which sells exceedingly well have no great value if we consider them by the light of modern science the waters are supposed to have originally covered the whole globe to have deposited the rocky masses which compose its mountains by processes comparable to those which are now forming mud sand and shingle and then to have gradually lowered their level leaving the spoils of their animal and vegetable inhabitants embedded in the strata as the dry land appeared certain of the aquatic animals are supposed to have taken to it and to have become gradually adapted to terrestrial and aërial modes of existence but if we regard the general tenor and style of the reasoning in relation to the state of knowledge of the day two circumstances appear very well worthy of remark the first that de maillet had a notion of the modifiability of living forms though without any precise information on the subject and how such modifiability might account for the origin of species the second that he very clearly apprehended the great modern geological doctrine so strongly insisted upon by hutton and so ably and comprehensively expounded by lyell that we must look to existing causes for the explanation of past geological events indeed the following passage of the preface in which de maillet is supposed to speak of the indian philosopher telliamed his alter ego might have been written by the most philosophical uniformitarian of the present day  ce quil y a détonnant est que pour arriver à ces connaissances il semble avoir perverti lordre naturel puisquau lieu de sattacher dabord à rechercher lorigine de notre globe il a commence par travailler à sinstruire de la nature mais à lentendre ce renversement de lordre a été pour lui leffet dun génie favorable qui la conduit pas à pas et comme par la main aux découvertes les plus sublimes cest en décomposant la substance de ce globe par

lesprit de comparaison toujours nécessaire à quiconque entreprend de percer les voiles dont la nature aime à se cacher ont servi de guide à notre philosophe pour parvenir à des connoissances plus intéressantes par la matière et larrangement de ces compositions il prétend avoir reconnu quelle est la véritable origine de ce globe que nous habitons comment et par qui il a été formépp xix xx  but de maillet was before his age and as could hardly fail to happen to one who speculated on a zoological and botanical question before linnæus and on a physiological problem before haller he fell into great errors here and there and hence perhaps the general neglect of his work robinets speculations are rather behind than in advance of those of de maillet and though linnæus may have played with the hypothesis of transmutation it obtained no serious support until lamarck adopted it and advocated it with great ability in his philosophie zoologique  impelled towards the hypothesis of the transmutation of species partly by his general cosmological and geological views partly by the conception of a graduated though irregularly branching scale of being which had arisen out of his profound study of plants and of the lower forms of animal life lamarck whose general line of thought often closely resembles that of de maillet made a great advance upon the crude and merely speculative manner in which that writer deals with the question of the origin of living beings by endeavouring to find physical causes competent to effect that change of one species into another which de maillet had only supposed to occur and lamarck conceived that he had found in nature such causes amply sufficient for the purpose in view it is a physiological fact he says that organs are increased in size by action atrophied by inaction it is another physiological fact that modifications produced are transmissible to offspring change the actions of an animal therefore and you will change its structure by increasing the development of the parts newly brought into use and by the diminution of those less used but by altering the circumstances which surround it you will alter its actions and hence in the long run change of circumstance must produce change of organisation all the species of animals therefore are in lamarcks view the result of the indirect action of changes of circumstance upon those primitive germs which he considered to have originally arisen by spontaneous generation within the waters of the globe it is curious however that lamarck should insist so strongly footnote see phil zoologique vol i p 222 et seq as he has done that circumstances never in any degree directly modify the form or the organisation of animals but only operate by changing their wants and consequently their actions for he thereby brings upon himself the obvious question how then do plants which cannot be said to have wants or actions become modified to this he replies that they are modified by the changes in their nutritive processes which are effected by changing circumstances and it does not seem to have occurred to him that such changes might be as well supposed to take place among animals  when we have said that lamarck felt that mere speculation was not the way to arrive at the origin of species but that it was necessary in order to the establishment of any sound theory on the subject to discover by observation or otherwise some vera causa competent to give rise to them that he affirmed the true order of classification to coincide with the order of their development one from another that he insisted on the necessity of allowing sufficient time very strongly and that all the varieties of instinct and reason were traced back by him to the same cause as that which has given rise to species we have enumerated his chief contributions to the advance of the question on the other hand from his ignorance of any power in nature competent to modify the structure of animals except the development of parts or atrophy of them in consequence of a change of needs lamarck was led to attach infinitely greater weight than it deserves to this agency and the absurdities into which he was led have met with deserved condemnation of the struggle for existence on which as we shall see mr darwin lays such great stress he had no conception indeed he doubts whether there really are such things as extinct species unless they be such large animals as may have met their death at the hands of man and so little does he dream of there being any other destructive causes at work that in discussing the possible existence of fossil shells he asks pourquoi dailleurs seroientils perdues dès que lhomme na pu opérer leur destruction phil zool vol i p 77 of the influence of selection lamarck has as little notion and he makes no use of the wonderful phenomena which are exhibited by domesticated animals and illustrate its powers the vast influence of cuvier was employed against the lamarckian views and as the untenability of some of his conclusions was easily shown his doctrines sank under the opprobrium of scientific as well as of theological heterodoxy nor have the efforts made of late years to revive them tended to reestablish their credit in the minds of sound thinkers acquainted with the facts of the case indeed it may be doubted whether lamarck has not suffered more from his friends than from his foes  two years ago in fact though we venture to question if even the strongest supporters of the special creation hypothesis had not now and then an uneasy consciousness that all was not right their position seemed more impregnable than ever if not by its own inherent strength at any rate by the obvious failure of all the attempts which had been made to carry it on the other hand however much the few who thought deeply on the question of species might be repelled by the generally received dogmas they saw no way of escaping from them save by the adoption of suppositions so little justified by experiment or by observation as to be at least equally distasteful  the choice lay between two absurdities and a middle condition of uneasy scepticism which last however unpleasant and unsatisfactory was obviously the only justifiable state of mind under the circumstances  such being the general ferment in the minds of naturalists it is no wonder that they mustered strong in the rooms of the linnæan society on the 1st of july of the year 1858 to hear two papers by authors living on opposite sides of the globe working out their results independently and yet professing to have discovered one and the same solution of all the problems connected with species the one of these authors was an able naturalist mr wallace who had been employed for some years in studying the productions of the islands of the indian archipelago and who had forwarded a memoir embodying his views to mr darwin for communication to the linnæan society on perusing the essay mr darwin was not a little surprised to find that it embodied some of the leading ideas of a great work which he had been preparing for twenty years and parts of which containing a development of the very same views had been perused by his private friends fifteen or sixteen years before perplexed in what manner to do full justice both to his friend and to himself mr darwin placed the matter in the hands of dr hooker and sir charles lyell by whose advice he communicated a brief abstract of his own views to the linnæan society at the same time that mr wallaces paper was read of that abstract the work on the origin of species is an enlargement but a complete statement of mr darwins doctrine is looked for in the large and wellillustrated work which he is said to be preparing for publication  the darwinian hypothesis has the merit of being eminently simple and comprehensible in principle and its essential positions may be stated in a very few words all species have been produced by the development of varieties from common stocks by the conversion of these first into permanent races and then into new species by the process of natural selection which process is essentially identical with that artificial selection by which man has originated the races of domestic animalsthe struggle for existence taking the place of man and exerting in the case of natural selection that selective action which he performs in artificial selection  the evidence brought forward by mr darwin in support of his hypothesis is of three kinds first he endeavours to prove that species may be originated by selection secondly he attempts to show that natural causes are competent to exert selection and thirdly he tries to prove that the most remarkable and apparently anomalous phænomena exhibited by the distribution development and mutual relations of species can be shown to be deducible from the general doctrine of their origin which he propounds combined with the known facts of geological change and that even if all these phænomena are not at present explicable by it none are necessarily inconsistent with it  there cannot be a doubt that the method of inquiry which mr darwin has adopted is not only rigorously in accordance with the canons of scientific logic but that it is the only adequate method critics exclusively trained in classics or in mathematics who have never determined a scientific fact in their lives by induction from experiment or observation prate learnedly about mr darwins method which is not inductive enough not baconian enough forsooth for them but even if practical acquaintance with the process of scientific investigation is denied them they may learn by the perusal of mr mills admirable chapter on the deductive method that there are multitudes of scientific inquiries in which the method of pure induction helps the investigator but a very little way  the mode of investigation says mr mill which from the proved inapplicability of direct methods of observation and experiment remains to us as the main source of the knowledge we possess or can acquire respecting the conditions and laws of recurrence of the more complex phænomena is called in its most general expression the deductive method and consists of three operations the first one of direct induction the second of ratiocination and the third of verification  now the conditions which have determined the existence of species are not only exceedingly complex but so far as the great majority of them are concerned are necessarily beyond our cognisance but what mr darwin has attempted to do is in exact accordance with the rule laid down by mr mill he has endeavoured to determine certain great facts inductively by observation and experiment he has then reasoned from the data thus furnished and lastly he has tested the validity of his ratiocination by comparing his deductions with the observed facts of nature inductively mr darwin endeavours to prove that species arise in a given way deductively he desires to show that if they arise in that way the facts of distribution development classification c may be accounted for ie may be deduced from their mode of origin combined with admitted changes in physical geography and climate during an indefinite period and this explanation or coincidence of observed with deduced facts is so far as it extends a verification of the darwinian view  there is no fault to be found with mr darwins method then but it is another question whether he has fulfilled all the conditions imposed by that method is it satisfactorily proved in fact that species may be originated by selection that there is such a thing as natural selection that none of the phænomena exhibited by species are inconsistent with the origin of species in this way if these questions can be answered in the affirmative mr darwins view steps out of the rank of hypotheses into those of proved theories but so long as the evidence at present adduced falls short of enforcing that affirmation so long to our minds must the new doctrine be content to remain among the formeran extremely valuable and in the highest degree probable doctrine indeed the only extant hypothesis which is worth anything in a scientific point of view but still a hypothesis and not yet the theory of species  after much consideration and with assuredly no bias against mr darwins views it is our clear conviction that as the evidence stands it is not absolutely proven that a group of animals having all the characters exhibited by species in nature has ever been originated by selection whether artificial or natural groups having the morphological character of speciesdistinct and permanent races in facthave been so produced over and over again but there is no positive evidence at present that any group of animals has by variation and selective breeding given rise to another group which was even in the least degree infertile with the first mr darwin is perfectly aware of this weak point and brings forward a multitude of ingenious and important arguments to diminish the force of the objection we admit the value of these arguments to their fullest extent nay we will go so far as to express our belief that experiments conducted by a skilful physiologist would very probably obtain the desired production of mutually more or less infertile breeds from a common stock in a comparatively few years but still as the case stands at present this little rift within the lute is not to be disguised nor overlooked  in the remainder of mr darwins argument our own private ingenuity has not hitherto enabled us to pick holes of any great importance and judging by what we hear and read other adventurers in the same field do not seem to have been much more fortunate it has been urged for instance that in his chapters on the struggle for existence and on natural selection mr darwin does not so much prove that natural selection does occur as that it must occur but in fact no other sort of demonstration is attainable a race does not attract our attention in nature until it has in all probability existed for a considerable time and then it is too late to inquire into the conditions of its origin again it is said that there is no real analogy between the selection which takes place under domestication by human influence and any operation which can be effected by nature for man interferes intelligently reduced to its elements this argument implies that an effect produced with trouble by an intelligent agent must à fortiori be more troublesome if not impossible to an unintelligent agent even putting aside the question whether nature acting as she does according to definite and invariable laws can be rightly called an unintelligent agent such a position as this is wholly untenable mix salt and sand and it shall puzzle the wisest of men with his mere natural appliances to separate all the grains of sand from all the grains of salt but a shower of rain will effect the same object in ten minutes and so while man may find it tax all his intelligence to separate any variety which arises and to breed selectively from it the destructive agencies incessantly at work in nature if they find one variety to be more soluble in circumstances than the other will inevitably in the long run eliminate it  a frequent and a just objection to the lamarckian hypothesis of the transmutation of species is based upon the absence of transitional forms between many species but against the darwinian hypothesis this argument has no force indeed one of the most valuable and suggestive parts of mr darwins work is that in which he proves that the frequent absence of transitions is a necessary consequence of his doctrine and that the stock whence two or more species have sprung need in no respect be intermediate between these species if any two species have arisen from a common stock in the same way as the carrier and the pouter say have arisen from the rockpigeon then the common stock of these two species need be no more intermediate between the two than the rockpigeon is between the carrier and pouter clearly appreciate the force of this analogy and all the arguments against the origin of species by selection based on the absence of transitional forms fall to the ground and mr darwins position might we think have been even stronger than it is if he had not embarrassed himself with the aphorism natura non facit saltum which turns up so often in his pages we believe as we have said above that nature does make jumps now and then and a recognition of the fact is of no small importance in disposing of many minor objections to the doctrine of transmutation  but we must pause the discussion of mr darwins arguments in detail would lead us far beyond the limits within which we proposed at starting to confine this article our object has been attained if we have given an intelligible however brief account of the established facts connected with species and of the relation of the explanation of those facts offered by mr darwin to the theoretical views held by his predecessors and his contemporaries and above all to the requirements of scientific logic we have ventured to point out that it does not as yet satisfy all those requirements but we do not hesitate to assert that it is as superior to any preceding or contemporary hypothesis in the extent of observational and experimental basis on which it rests in its rigorously scientific method and in its power of explaining biological phenomena as was the hypothesis of copernicus to the speculations of ptolemy but the planetary orbits turned out to be not quite circular after all and grand as was the service copernicus rendered to science kepler and newton had to come after him what if the orbit of darwinism should be a little too circular what if species should offer residual phænomena here and there not explicable by natural selection twenty years hence naturalists may be in a position to say whether this is or is not the case but in either event they will owe the author of the origin of species an immense debt of gratitude we should leave a very wrong impression on the readers mind if we permitted him to suppose that the value of that work depends wholly on the ultimate justification of the theoretical views which it contains on the contrary if they were disproved tomorrow the book would still be the best of its kindthe most compendious statement of wellsifted facts bearing on the doctrine of species that has ever appeared the chapters on variation on the struggle for existence on instinct on hybridism on the imperfection of the geological record on geographical distribution have not only no equals but so far as our knowledge goes no competitors within the range of biological literature and viewed as a whole we do not believe that since the publication of von baers researches on development thirty years ago any work has appeared calculated to exert so large an influence not only on the future of biology but in extending the domination of science over regions of thought into which she has as yet hardly penetrated     iii  criticisms on the origin of species  1864   1 ueber die darwinsche schÖpfungstheorie ein vortrag von a kÖlliker leipzig 1864  2 examination du livre de m darwin sur lorigine des espÈces par p flourens paris 1864  in the course of the present year several foreign commentaries upon mr darwins great work have made their appearance those who have perused that remarkable chapter of the antiquity of man in which sir charles lyell draws a parallel between the development of species and that of languages will be glad to hear that one of the most eminent philologers of germany professor schleicher has independently published a most instructive and philosophical pamphlet an excellent notice of which is to be found in the reader for february 27th of this year supporting similar views with all the weight of his special knowledge and established authority as a linguist professor haeckel to whom schleicher addresses himself previously took occasion in his splendid monograph on the radiolariafootnote die radiolarien eine monographie p 231 to express his high appreciation of and general concordance with mr darwins views  but the most elaborate criticisms of the origin of species which have appeared are two works of very widely different merit the one by professor kölliker the wellknown anatomist and histologist of würzburg the other by m flourens perpetual secretary of the french academy of sciences  professor köllikers critical essay upon the darwinian theory is like all that proceeds from the pen of that thoughtful and accomplished writer worthy of the most careful consideration it comprises a brief but clear sketch of darwins views followed by an enumeration of the leading difficulties in the way of their acceptance difficulties which would appear to be insurmountable to professor kölliker inasmuch as he proposes to replace mr darwins theory by one which he terms the theory of heterogeneous generation we shall proceed to consider first the destructive and secondly the constructive portion of the essay  we regret to find ourselves compelled to dissent very widely from many of professor köllikers remarks and from none more thoroughly than from those in which he seeks to define what we may term the philosophical position of darwinism  darwin says professor kölliker is in the fullest sense of the word a teleologist he says quite distinctly first edition pp 199 200 that every particular in the structure of an animal has been created for its benefit and he regards the whole series of animal forms only from this point of view  and again  7 the teleological general conception adopted by darwin is a mistaken one  varieties arise irrespectively of the notion of purpose or of utility according to general laws of nature and may be either useful or hurtful or indifferent  the assumption that an organism exists only on account of some definite end in view and represents something more than the incorporation of a general idea or law implies a onesided conception of the universe assuredly every organ has and every organism fulfils its end but its purpose is not the condition of its existence every organism is also sufficiently perfect for the purpose it serves and in that at least it is useless to seek for a cause of its improvement  it is singular how differently one and the same book will impress different minds that which struck the present writer most forcibly on his first perusal of the origin of species was the conviction that teleology as commonly understood had received its deathblow at mr darwins hands for the teleological argument runs thus an organ or organism a is precisely fitted to perform a function or purpose b therefore it was specially constructed to perform that function in paleys famous illustration the adaptation of all the parts of the watch to the function or purpose of showing the time is held to be evidence that the watch was specially contrived to that end on the ground that the only cause we know of competent to produce such an effect as a watch which shall keep time is a contriving intelligence adapting the means directly to that end  suppose however that any one had been able to show that the watch had not been made directly by any person but that it was the result of the modification of another watch which kept time but poorly and that this again had proceeded from a structure which could hardly be called a watch at allseeing that it had no figures on the dial and the hands were rudimentary and that going back and back in time we came at last to a revolving barrel as the earliest traceable rudiment of the whole fabric and imagine that it had been possible to show that all these changes had resulted first from a tendency of the structure to vary indefinitely and secondly from something in the surrounding world which helped all variations in the direction of an accurate timekeeper and checked all those in other directions then it is obvious that the force of paleys argument would be gone for it would be demonstrated that an apparatus thoroughly well adapted to a particular purpose might be the result of a method of trial and error worked by unintelligent agents as well as of the direct application of the means appropriate to that end by an intelligent agent  now it appears to us that what we have here for illustrations sake supposed to be done with the watch is exactly what the establishment of darwins theory will do for the organic world for the notion that every organism has been created as it is and launched straight at a purpose mr darwin substitutes the conception of something which may fairly be termed a method of trial and error organisms vary incessantly of these variations the few meet with surrounding conditions which suit them and thrive the many are unsuited and become extinguished  according to teleology each organism is like a rifle bullet fired straight at a mark according to darwin organisms are like grapeshot of which one hits something and the rest fall wide  for the teleologist an organism exists because it was made for the conditions in which it is found for the darwinian an organism exists because out of many of its kind it is the only one which has been able to persist in the conditions in which it is found  teleology implies that the organs of every organism are perfect and cannot be improved the darwinian theory simply affirms that they work well enough to enable the organism to hold its own against such competitors as it has met with but admits the possibility of indefinite improvement but an example may bring into clearer light the profound opposition between the ordinary teleological and the darwinian conception  cats catch mice small birds and the like very well teleology tells us that they do so because they were expressly constructed for so doingthat they are perfect mousing apparatuses so perfect and so delicately adjusted that no one of their organs could be altered without the change involving the alteration of all the rest darwinism affirms on the contrary that there was no express construction concerned in the matter but that among the multitudinous variations of the feline stock many of which died out from want of power to resist opposing influences some the cats were better fitted to catch mice than others whence they throve and persisted in proportion to the advantage over their fellows thus offered to them  far from imagining that cats exist in order to catch mice well darwinism supposes that cats exist because they catch mice wellmousing being not the end but the condition of their existence and if the cat type has long persisted as we know it the interpretation of the fact upon darwinian principles would be not that the cats have remained invariable but that such varieties as have incessantly occurred have been on the whole less fitted to get on in the world than the existing stock  if we apprehend the spirit of the origin of species rightly then nothing can be more entirely and absolutely opposed to teleology as it is commonly understood than the darwinian theory so far from being a teleologist in the fullest sense of the word we should deny that he is a teleologist in the ordinary sense at all and we should say that apart from his merits as a naturalist he has rendered a most remarkable service to philosophical thought by enabling the student of nature to recognise to their fullest extent those adaptations to purpose which are so striking in the organic world and which teleology has done good service in keeping before our minds without being false to the fundamental principles of a scientific conception of the universe the apparently diverging teachings of the teleologist and of the morphologist are reconciled by the darwinian hypothesis  but leaving our own impressions of the origin of species and turning to those passages especially cited by professor kölliker we cannot admit that they bear the interpretation he puts upon them darwin if we read him rightly does not affirm that every detail in the structure of an animal has been created for its benefit his words are p 199  the foregoing remarks lead me to say a few words on the protest lately made by some naturalists against the utilitarian doctrine that every detail of structure has been produced for the good of its possessor they believe that very many structures have been created for beauty in the eyes of man or for mere variety this doctrine if true would be absolutely fatal to my theoryyet i fully admit that many structures are of no direct use to their possessor  and after sundry illustrations and qualifications he concludes p 200  hence every detail of structure in every living creature making some little allowance for the direct action of physical conditions may be viewed either as having been of special use to some ancestral form or as being now of special use to the descendants of this formeither directly or indirectly through the complex laws of growth  but it is one thing to say darwinically that every detail observed in an animals structure is of use to it or has been of use to its ancestors and quite another to affirm teleologically that every detail of an animals structure has been created for its benefit on the former hypothesis for example the teeth of the foetal baltæna have a meaning on the latter none so far as we are aware there is not a phrase in the origin of species inconsistent with professor köllikers position that varieties arise irrespectively of the notion of purpose or of utility according to general laws of nature and may be either useful or hurtful or indifferent  on the contrary mr darwin writes summary of chap v  our ignorance of the laws of variation is profound not in one case out of a hundred can we pretend to assign any reason why this or that part varies more or less from the same part in the parents the external conditions of life as climate and food c seem to have induced some slight modifications habit in producing constitutional differences and use in strengthening and disuse in weakening and diminishing organs seem to have been more potent in their effects  and finally as if to prevent all possible misconception mr darwin concludes his chapter on variation with these pregnant words  whatever the cause may be of each slight difference in the offspring from their parentsand a cause for each must existit is the steady accumulation through natural selection of such differences when beneficial to the individual that gives rise to all the more important modifications of structure by which the innumerable beings on the face of the earth are enabled to struggle with each other and the best adapted to survive  we have dwelt at length upon this subject because of its great general importance and because we believe that professor köllikers criticisms on this head are based upon a misapprehension of mr darwins viewssubstantially they appear to us to coincide with his own the other objections which professor kölliker enumerates and discusses are the following footnote space will not allow us to give professor köllikers arguments in detail our readers will find a full and accurate version of them in the reader for august 13th and 20th 1864  1 no transitional forms between existing species are known and known varieties whether selected or spontaneous never go so far as to establish new species  to this professor kölliker appears to attach some weight he makes the suggestion that the shortfaced tumbler pigeon may be a pathological product  2 no transitional forms of animals are met with among the organic remains of earlier epochs  upon this professor kölliker remarks that the absence of transitional forms in the fossil world though not necessarily fatal to darwins views weakens his case  3 the struggle for existence does not take place  to this objection urged by pelzeln kölliker very justly attaches no weight  4 a tendency of organisms to give rise to useful varieties and a natural selection do not exist  the varieties which are found arise in consequence of manifold external influences and it is not obvious why they all or partially should be particularly useful each animal suffices for its own ends is perfect of its kind and needs no further development should however a variety be useful and even maintain itself there is no obvious reason why it should change any further the whole conception of the imperfection of organisms and the necessity of their becoming perfected is plainly the weakest side of darwins theory and a pis aller nothbehelf because darwin could think of no other principle by which to explain the metamorphoses which as i also believe have occurred  here again we must venture to dissent completely from professor köllikers conception of mr darwins hypothesis it appears to us to be one of the many peculiar merits of that hypothesis that it involves no belief in a necessary and continual progress of organisms  again mr darwin if we read him aright assumes no special tendency of organisms to give rise to useful varieties and knows nothing of needs of development or necessity of perfection what he says is in substance all organisms vary it is in the highest degree improbable that any given variety should have exactly the same relations to surrounding conditions as the parent stock in that case it is either better fitted when the variation may be called useful or worse fitted to cope with them if better it will tend to supplant the parent stock if worse it will tend to be extinguished by the parent stock  if as is hardly conceivable the new variety is so perfectly adapted to the conditions that no improvement upon it is possibleit will persist because though it does not cease to vary the varieties will be inferior to itself  if as is more probable the new variety is by no means perfectly adapted to its conditions but only fairly well adapted to them it will persist so long as none of the varieties which it throws off are better adapted than itself  on the other hand as soon as it varies in a useful way ie when the variation is such as to adapt it more perfectly to its conditions the fresh variety will tend to supplant the former  so far from a gradual progress towards perfection forming any necessary part of the darwinian creed it appears to us that it is perfectly consistent with indefinite persistence in one state or with a gradual retrogression suppose for example a return of the glacial epoch and a spread of polar climatal conditions over the whole globe the operation of natural selection under these circumstances would tend on the whole to the weeding out of the higher organisms and the cherishing of the lower forms of life cryptogamic vegetation would have the advantage over phanerogamic hydrozoa over corals crustacea over insecta and amphipoda and isopoda over the higher crustacea cetaceans and seals over the primates the civilisation of the esquimaux over that of the european  5 pelzeln has also objected that if the later organisms have proceeded from the earlier the whole developmental series from the simplest to the highest could not now exist in such a case the simpler organisms must have disappeared  to this professor kölliker replies with perfect justice that the conclusion drawn by pelzeln does not really follow from darwins premises and that if we take the facts of paleontology as they stand they rather support than oppose darwins theory  6 great weight must be attached to the objection brought forward by huxley otherwise a warm supporter of darwins hypothesis that we know of no varieties which are sterile with one another as is the rule among sharply distinguished animal forms  if darwin is right it must be demonstrated that forms may be produced by selection which like the present sharply distinguished animal forms are infertile when coupled with one another and this has not been done  the weight of this objection is obvious but our ignorance of the conditions of fertility and sterility the want of carefully conducted experiments extending over long series of years and the strange anomalies presented by the results of the crossfertilisation of many plants should all as mr darwin has urged be taken into account in considering it  the seventh objection is that we have already discussed supra p 82  the eighth and last stands as follows  8 the developmental theory of darwin is not needed to enable us to understand the regular harmonious progress of the complete series of organic forms from the simpler to the more perfect  the existence of general laws of nature explains this harmony even if we assume that all beings have arisen separately and independent of one another darwin forgets that inorganic nature in which there can be no thought of genetic connexion of forms exhibits the same regular plan the same harmony as the organic world and that to cite only one example there is as much a natural system of minerals as of plants and animals  we do not feel quite sure that we seize professor köllikers meaning here but he appears to suggest that the observation of the general order and harmony which pervade inorganic nature would lead us to anticipate a similar order and harmony in the organic world and this is no doubt true but it by no means follows that the particular order and harmony observed among them should be that which we see surely the stripes of dun horses and the teeth of the foetal balæna are not explained by the existence of general laws of nature mr darwin endeavours to explain the exact order of organic nature which exists not the mere fact that there is some order  and with regard to the existence of a natural system of minerals the obvious reply is that there may be a natural classification of any objectsof stones on a seabeach or of works of art a natural classification being simply an assemblage of objects in groups so as to express their most important and fundamental resemblances and differences no doubt mr darwin believes that those resemblances and differences upon which our natural systems or classifications of animals and plants are based are resemblances and differences which have been produced genetically but we can discover no reason for supposing that he denies the existence of natural classifications of other kinds  and after all is it quite so certain that a genetic relation may not underlie the classification of minerals the inorganic world has not always been what we see it it has certainly had its metamorphoses and very probably a long entwickelungsgeschichte out of a nebular blastema who knows how far that amount of likeness among sets of minerals in virtue of which they are now grouped into families and orders may not be the expression of the common conditions to which that particular patch of nebulous fog which may have been constituted by their atoms and of which they may be in the strictest sense the descendants was subjected  it will be obvious from what has preceded that we do not agree with professor kölliker in thinking the objections which he brings forward so weighty as to be fatal to darwins view but even if the case were otherwise we should be unable to accept the theory of heterogeneous generation which is offered as a substitute that theory is thus stated  the fundamental conception of this hypothesis is that under the influence of a general law of development the germs of organisms produce others different from themselves this might happen 1 by the fecundated ova passing in the course of their development under particular circumstances into higher forms 2 by the primitive and later organisms producing other organisms without fecundation out of germs or eggs parthenogenesis  in favour of this hypothesis professor kölliker adduces the wellknown facts of agamogenesis or alternate generation the extreme dissimilarity of the males and females of many animals and of the males females and neuters of those insects which live in colonies and he defines its relations to the darwinian theory as follows  it is obvious that my hypothesis is apparently very similar to darwins inasmuch as i also consider that the various forms of animals have proceeded directly from one another my hypothesis of the creation of organisms by heterogeneous generation however is distinguished very essentially from darwins by the entire absence of the principle of useful variations and their natural selection and my fundamental conception is this that a great plan of development lies at the foundation of the origin of the whole organic world impelling the simpler forms to more and more complex developments how this law operates what influences determine the development of the eggs and germs and impel them to assume constantly new forms i naturally cannot pretend to say but i can at least adduce the great analogy of the alternation of generations if a bipinnaria a brachiolaria a pluteus is competent to produce the echinoderm which is so widely different from it if a hydroid polype can produce the higher medusa if the vermiform trematode nurse can develop within itself the very unlike cercaria it will not appear impossible that the egg or ciliated embryo of a sponge for once under special conditions might become a hydroid polype or the embryo of a medusa an echinoderm  it is obvious from these extracts that professor köllikers hypothesis is based upon the supposed existence of a close analogy between the phænomena of agamogenesis and the production of new species from preexisting ones but is the analogy a real one we think that it is not and by the hypothesis cannot be  for what are the phænomena of agamogenesis stated generally an impregnated egg develops into a sexless form a this gives rise nonsexually to a second form or forms b more or less different from a b may multiply nonsexually again in the simpler cases however it does not but acquiring sexual characters produces impregnated eggs from whence a once more arises  no case of agamogenesis is known in which when a differs widely from b it is itself capable of sexual propagation no case whatever is known in which the progeny of b by sexual generation is other than a reproduction of a  but if this be a true statement of the nature of the process of agamogenesis how can it enable us to comprehend the production of new species from already existing ones let us suppose hyænas to have preceded dogs and to have produced the latter in this way then the hyæna will represent a and the dog b the first difficulty that presents itself is that the hyæna must be nonsexual or the process will be wholly without analogy in the world of agamogenesis but passing over this difficulty and supposing a male and female dog to be produced at the same time from the hyæna stock the progeny of the pair if the analogy of the simpler kinds of agamogenesis footnote if on the contrary we follow the analogy of the more complex forms of agamogenesis such as that exhibited by some trematoda and by the aphides the hyæna must produce nonsexually a brood of sexless dogs from which other sexless dogs must proceed at the end of a certain number of terms of the series the dogs would acquire sexes and generate young but these young would be not dogs but hyænas in fact we have demonstrated in agamogenetic phænomena that inevitable recurrence to the original type which is asserted to be true of variations in general by mr darwins opponents and which if the assertion could be changed into a demonstration would in fact be fatal to his hypothesis is to be followed should be a litter not of puppies but of young hyænas for the agamogenetic series is always as we have seen abab c whereas for the production of a new species the series must be abbb c the production of new species or genera is the extreme permanent divergence from the primitive stock all known agamogenetic processes on the other hand end in a complete return to the primitive stock how then is the production of new species to be rendered intelligible by the analogy of agamogenesis  the other alternative put by professor köllikerthe passage of fecundated ova in the course of their development into higher formswould if it occurred be merely an extreme case of variation in the darwinian sense greater in degree than but perfectly similar in kind to that which occurred when the wellknown ancon ram was developed from an ordinary ewes ovum indeed we have always thought that mr darwin has unnecessarily hampered himself by adhering so strictly to his favourite natura non facit saltum we greatly suspect that she does make considerable jumps in the way of variation now and then and that these saltations give rise to some of the gaps which appear to exist in the series of known forms  strongly and freely as we have ventured to disagree with professor kölliker we have always done so with regret and we trust without violating that respect which is due not only to his scientific eminence and to the careful study which he has devoted to the subject but to the perfect fairness of his argumentation and the generous appreciation of the worth of mr darwins labours which he always displays it would be satisfactory to be able to say as much for m flourens  but the perpetual secretary of the french academy of sciences deals with mr darwin as the first napoleon would have treated an idéologue and while displaying a painful weakness of logic and shallowness of information assumes a tone of authority which always touches upon the ludicrous and sometimes passes the limits of good breeding  for example p 56  m darwin continue aucune distinction absolue na été et ne peut être établie entre les espèces et les variétés je vous ai déjà dit que vous vous trompiez une distinction absolue sépare les variétés davec les espèces  je vous ai déjà dit moi m le secrétaire perpétuel de lacadémie des sciences et vous     qui nêtes rien    pas même académicien  what do you mean by asserting the contrary being devoid of the blessings of an academy in england we are unaccustomed to see our ablest men treated in this fashion even by a perpetual secretary  or again considering that if there is any one quality of mr darwins work to which friends and foes have alike borne witness it is his candour and fairness in admitting and discussing objections what is to be thought of m flourens assertion that  m darwin ne cite que les auteurs qui partagent ses opinions p 40  once more p 65  enfin louvrage de m darwin a paru on ne peut quêtre frappé du talent de lauteur mais quo didées obscures que didées fausses quel jargon métaphysique jeté mal à propos dans lhistoire naturelle qui tombe dans le galimatias dès quelle sort des idées claires des idées justes quel langage prétentieux et vide quelles personnifications puériles et surannées o lucidité 0 solidité de lesprit français que devenezvous  obscure ideas metaphysical jargon pretentious and empty language puerile and superannuated personifications mr darwin has many and hot opponents on this side of the channel and in germany but we do not recollect to have found precisely these sins in the long catalogue of those hitherto laid to his charge it is worth while therefore to examine into these discoveries effected solely by the aid of the lucidity and solidity of the mind of m flourens  according to m flourens mr darwins great error is that he has personified nature p 10 and further that he has  imagined a natural selection he imagines afterwards that this power of selecting pouvoir délire which he gives to nature is similar to the power of man these two suppositions admitted nothing stops him he plays with nature as he likes and makes her do all he pleases p 6  and this is the way m flourens extinguishes natural selection  voyons donc encore une fois ce quil peut y avoir de fondé dans ce quon nomme élection naturelle  lélection naturelle nest sous un autre nom que la nature pour un être organisé la nature nest que lorganisation ni plus ni moins  il faudra donc aussi personnifier lorganisation et dire que lorganisation choisit lorganisation lélection naturelle est cette forme substantielle dont on jouait autrefois avec tant de facilité aristote disait que si lart de bâtir était dans le bois cet art agirait comme la nature a la place de lart de bâtir m darwin met lélection naturelle et cest tout un lun nest pas plus chimérique que lautre p 31  and this is really all that m flourens can make of natural selection we have given the original in fear lest a translation should be regarded as a travesty but with the original before the reader we may try to analyse the passage for an organised being nature is only organisation neither more nor less  organised beings then have absolutely no relation to inorganic nature a plant does not depend on soil or sunshine climate depth in the ocean height above it the quantity of saline matters in water have no influence upon animal life the substitution of carbonic acid for oxygen in our atmosphere would hurt nobody that these are absurdities no one should know better than m flourens but they are logical deductions from the assertion just quoted and from the further statement that natural selection means only that organisation chooses and selects organisation  for if it be once admitted what no sane man denies that the chances of life of any given organism are increased by certain conditions a and diminished by their opposites b then it is mathematically certain that any change of conditions in the direction of a will exercise a selective influence in favour of that organism tending to its increase and multiplication while any change in the direction of b will exercise a selective influence against that organism tending to its decrease and extinction  or on the other hand conditions remaining the same let a given organism vary and no one doubts that they do vary in two directions into one form a better fitted to cope with these conditions than the original stock and a second b less well adapted to them then it is no less certain that the conditions in question must exercise a selective influence in favour of a and against b so that a will tend to predominance and b to extirpation  that m flourens should be unable to perceive the logical necessity of these simple arguments which lie at the foundation of all mr darwins reasoning that he should confound an irrefragable deduction from the observed relations of organisms to the conditions which lie around them with a metaphysical forme substantielle or a chimerical personification of the powers of nature would be incredible were it not that other passages of his work leave no room for doubt upon the subject  on imagine une élection naturelle que pour plus de ménagement on me dit être inconsciente sans sapercevoir que le contresens littéral est précisément là élection inconsciente p 52  jai déjà dit ce quil faut penser de lélection naturelle ou lélection naturelle nest rien ou cest la nature mais la nature douée délection mais la nature personnifiée dernière erreur du dernier siècle le xixe ne fait plus de personnifications p 53  m flourens cannot imagine an unconscious selectionit is for him a contradiction in terms did m flourens ever visit one of the prettiest wateringplaces of la belle france the baie darcachon if so he will probably have passed through the district of the landes and will have had an opportunity of observing the formation of dunes on a grand scale what are these dunes the winds and waves of the bay of biscay have not much consciousness and yet they have with great care selected from among an infinity of masses of silex of all shapes and sizes which have been submitted to their action all the grains of sand below a certain size and have heaped them by themselves over a great area this sand has been unconsciously selected from amidst the gravel in which it first lay with as much precision as if man had consciously selected it by the aid of a sieve physical geology is full of such selectionsof the picking out of the soft from the hard of the soluble from the insoluble of the fusible from the infusible by natural agencies to which we are certainly not in the habit of ascribing consciousness  but that which wind and sea are to a sandy beach the sum of influences which we term the conditions of existence is to living organisms the weak are sifted out from the strong a frosty night selects the hardy plants in a plantation from among the tender ones as effectually as if it were the wind and they the sand and pebbles of our illustration or on the other hand as if the intelligence of a gardener had been operative in cutting the weaker organisms down the thistle which has spread over the pampas to the destruction of native plants has been more effectually selected by the unconscious operation of natural conditions than if a thousand agriculturists had spent their time in sowing it  it is one of mr darwins many great services to biological science that he has demonstrated the significance of these facts he has shown that given variation and given change of conditions the inevitable result is the exercise of such an influence upon organisms that one is helped and another is impeded one tends to predominate another to disappear and thus the living world bears within itself and is surrounded by impulses towards incessant change  but the truths just stated are as certain as any other physical laws quite independently of the truth or falsehood of the hypothesis which mr darwin has based upon them and that mr flourens missing the substance and grasping at a shadow should be blind to the admirable exposition of them which mr darwin has given and see nothing there but a dernière erreur du dernier sièclea personification of natureleads us indeed to cry with him o lucidité o solidité de lesprit français que devenezvous  m flourens has in fact utterly failed to comprehend the first principles of the doctrine which he assails so rudely his objections to details are of the old sort so battered and hackneyed on this side of the channel that not even a quarterly reviewer could be induced to pick them up for the purpose of pelting mr darwin over again we have cuvier and the mummies m roulin and the domesticated animals of america the difficulties presented by hybridism and by palæontology darwinism a rifacciamento of de maillet and lamarck darwinism a system without a commencement and its author bound to believe in m pouchet c c how one knows it all by heart and with what relief one reads at p 65  je laisse m darwin  but we cannot leave m flourens without calling our readers attention to his wonderful tenth chapter de la préexistence des germes et de lepigénèse which opens thus  spontaneous generation is only a chimaera this point established two hypotheses remain that of preexistence and that of epigenesis the one of these hypotheses has as little foundation as the other p 163  the doctrine of epigenesis is derived from harvey following by ocular inspection the development of the new being in the windsor does he saw each part appear successively and taking the moment of appearance for the moment of formation he imagined epigenesis p 165  on the contrary says m flourens p 167  the new being is formed at a stroke tout dun coup as a whole instantaneously it is not formed part by part and at different times it is formed at once at the single individual moment at which the conjunction of the male and female elements takes place  it will be observed that m flourens uses language which cannot be mistaken for him the labours of von baer of rathke of coste and their contemporaries and successors in germany france and england are nonexistent and as darwin imagina natural selection so harvey imagina that doctrine which gives him an even greater claim to the veneration of posterity than his better known discovery of the circulation of the blood  language such as that we have quoted is in fact so preposterous so utterly incompatible with anything but absolute ignorance of some of the best established facts that we should have passed it over in silence had it not appeared to afford some clue to m flourens unhesitating  à priori repudiation of all forms of the doctrine of progressive modification of living beings he whose mind remains uninfluenced by an acquaintance with the phænomena of development must indeed lack one of the chief motives towards the endeavour to trace a genetic relation between the different existing forms of life those who are ignorant of geology find no difficulty in believing that the world was made as it is and the shepherd untutored in history sees no reason to regard the green mounds which indicate the site of a roman camp as aught but part and parcel of the primæval hillside so m flourens who believes that embryos are formed tout dun coup naturally finds no difficulty in conceiving that species came into existence in the same way     iv  the genealogy of animals footnote the natural history of creation by dr ernst haeckel natürliche schöpfungsgeschichtevon dr ernst haeckel professor an der universität jena berlin 1868  1869   considering that germany now takes the lead of the world in scientific investigation and particularly in biology mr darwin must be well pleased at the rapid spread of his views among some of the ablest and most laborious of german naturalists  among these professor haeckel of jena is the coryphæus i know of no more solid and important contributions to biology in the past seven years than haeckels work on the radiolaria and the researches of his distinguished colleague gegenbaur in vertebrate anatomy while in haeckels generelle morphologie there is all the force suggestiveness and what i may term the systematising power of oken without his extravagance the generelle morphologie is in fact an attempt to put the doctrine of evolution so far as it applies to the living world into a logical form and to work out its practical applications to their final results the work before us again may be said to be an exposition of the generelle morphologie for an educated public consisting as it does of the substance of a series of lectures delivered before a mixed audience at jena in the session 18678  the natural history of creationor as professor haeckel admits it would have been better to call his work the history of the development or evolution of naturedeals in the first six lectures with the general and historical aspects of the question and contains a very interesting and lucid account of the views of linnæus cuvier agassiz goethe oken kant lamarck lyell and darwin and of the historical filiation of these philosophers  the next six lectures are occupied by a welldigested statement of mr darwins views the thirteenth lecture discusses two topics which are not touched by mr darwin namely the origin of the present form of the solar system and that of living matter full justice is done to kant as the originator of that cosmic gas theory as the germans somewhat quaintly call it which is commonly ascribed to laplace with respect to spontaneous generation while admitting that there is no experimental evidence in its favour professor haeckel denies the possibility of disproving it and points out that the assumption that it has occurred is a necessary part of the doctrine of evolution the fourteenth lecture on schöpfungsperioden und schöpfungsurkunden answers pretty much to the famous disquisition on the imperfection of the geological record in the origin of species  the following five lectures contain the most original matter of any being devoted to phylogeny or the working out of the details of the process of evolution in the animal and vegetable kingdoms so as to prove the line of descent of each group of living beings and to furnish it with its proper genealogical tree or phylum  the last lecture considers objections and sums up the evidence in favour of biological evolution  i shall best testify to my sense of the value of the work thus briefly analysed if i now proceed to note down some of the more important criticisms which have been suggested to me by its perusal  i in more than one place professor haeckel enlarges upon the service which the origin of species has done in favouring what he terms the causal or mechanical view of living nature as opposed to the teleological or vitalistic view and no doubt it is quite true that the doctrine of evolution is the most formidable opponent of all the commoner and coarser forms of teleology but perhaps the most remarkable service to the philosophy of biology rendered by mr darwin is the reconciliation of teleology and morphology and the explanation of the facts of both which his views offer  the teleology which supposes that the eye such as we see it in man or one of the higher vertebrata was made with the precise structure which it exhibits for the purpose of enabling the animal which possesses it to see has undoubtedly received its deathblow nevertheless it is necessary to remember that there is a wider teleology which is not touched by the doctrine of evolution but is actually based upon the fundamental proposition of evolution that proposition is that the whole world living and not living in the result of the mutual interaction according to definite laws of the forces possessed by the molecules of which the primitive nebulosity of the universe was composed if this be true it is no less certain that the existing world lay potentially in the cosmic vapour and that a sufficient intelligence could from a knowledge of the properties of the molecules of that vapour have predicted say the state of the fauna of britain in 1869 with as much certainty as one can say what will happen to the vapour of the breath in a cold winters day  consider a kitchen clock which ticks loudly shows the hours minutes and seconds strikes cries cuckoo and perhaps shows the phases of the moon when the clock is wound up all the phenomena which it exhibits are potentially contained in its mechanism and a clever clockmaker could predict all it will do after an examination of its structure  if the evolution theory is correct the molecular structure of the cosmic gas stands in the same relation to the phenomena of the world as the structure of the clock to its phenomena  now let us suppose a deathwatch living in the clockcase to be a learned and intelligent student of its works he might say i find here nothing but matter and force and pure mechanism from beginning to end and he would be quite right but if he drew the conclusion that the clock was not contrived for a purpose he would be quite wrong on the other hand imagine another deathwatch of a different turn of mind he listening to the monotonous tick tick so exactly like his own might arrive at the conclusion that the clock was itself a monstrous sort of deathwatch and that its final cause and purpose was to tick how easy to point to the clear relation of the whole mechanism to the pendulum to the fact that the one thing the clock did always and without intermission was to tick and that all the rest of its phenomena were intermittent and subordinate to ticking for all this it is certain that kitchen clocks are not contrived for the purpose of making a ticking noise  thus the teleological theorist would be as wrong as the mechanical theorist among our deathwatches and probably the only deathwatch who would be right would be the one who should maintain that the sole thing deathwatches could be sure about was the nature of the clockworks and the way they move and that the purpose of the clock lay wholly beyond the purview of beetle faculties  substitute cosmic vapour for clock and molecules for works and the application of the argument is obvious the teleological and the mechanical views of nature are not necessarily mutually exclusive on the contrary the more purely a mechanist the speculator is the more firmly does he assume a primordial molecular arrangement of which all the phenomena of the universe are the consequences and the more completely is he thereby at the mercy of the teleologist who can always defy him to disprove that this primordial molecular arrangement was not intended to evolve the phenomena of the universe on the other hand if the teleologist assert that this that or the other result of the working of any part of the mechanism of the universe is its purpose and final cause the mechanist can always inquire how he knows that it is more than an unessential incidentthe mere ticking of the clock which he mistakes for its function and there seems to be no reply to this inquiry any more than to the further not irrational question why trouble ones self about matters which are out of reach when the working of the mechanism itself which is of infinite practical importance affords scope for all our energies  professor haeckel has invented a new and convenient name dysteleology for the study of the purposelessnesses which are observable in living organismssuch as the multitudinous cases of rudimentary and apparently useless structures i confess however that it has often appeared to me that the facts of dysteleology cut two ways if we are to assume as evolutionists in general do that useless organs atrophy such cases as the existence of lateral rudiments of toes in the foot of a horse place us in a dilemma for either these rudiments are of no use to the animal in which case considering that the horse has existed in its present form since the pliocene epoch they surely ought to have disappeared or they are of some use to the animal in which case they are of no use as arguments against teleology a similar but still stronger argument may be based upon the existence of teats and even functional mammary glands in male mammals numerous cases of gynæcomasty or functionally active breasts in men are on record though there is no mammalian species whatever in which the male normally suckles the young thus there can be little doubt that the mammary gland was as apparently useless in the remotest male mammalian ancestor of man as in living men and yet it has not disappeared is it then still profitable to the male organism to retain it possibly but in that case its dysteleological value is gone footnote the recent discovery of the important part played by the thyroid gland should be a warning to all speculators about useless organs 1893  ii professor haeckel looks upon the causes which have led to the present diversity of living nature as twofold living matter he tells us is urged by two impulses a centripetal which tends to preserve and transmit the specific form and which he identifies with heredity and a centrifugal which results from the tendency of external conditions to modify the organism and effect its adaptation to themselves the internal impulse is conservative and tends to the preservation of specific or individual form the external impulse is metamorphic and tends to the modification of specific or individual form  in developing his views upon this subject professor haeckel introduces qualifications which disarm some of the criticisms i should have been disposed to offer but i think that his method of stating the case has the inconvenience of tending to leave out of sight the important factwhich is a cardinal point in the darwinian hypothesisthat the tendency to vary in a given organism may have nothing to do with the external conditions to which that individual organism is exposed but may depend wholly upon internal conditions no one i imagine would dream of seeking for the cause of the development of the sixth finger and toe in the famous maltese in the direct influence of the external conditions of his life  i conceive that both hereditary transmission and adaptation need to be analysed into their constituent conditions by the further application of the doctrine of the struggle for existence it is a probable hypothesis that what the world is to organisms in general each organism is to the molecules of which it is composed multitudes of these having diverse tendencies are competing with one another for opportunity to exist and multiply and the organism as a whole is as much the product of the molecules which are victorious as the fauna or flora of a country is the product of the victorious organic beings in it  on this hypothesis hereditary transmission is the result of the victory of particular molecules contained in the impregnated germ adaptation to conditions is the result of the favouring of the multiplication of those molecules whose organising tendencies are most in harmony with such conditions in this view of the matter conditions are not actively productive but are passively permissive they do not cause variation in any given direction but they permit and favour a tendency in that direction which already exists  it is true that in the long run the origin of the organic molecules themselves and of their tendencies is to be sought in the external world but if we carry our inquiries as far back as this the distinction between internal and external impulses vanishes on the other hand if we confine ourselves to the consideration of a single organism i think it must be admitted that the existence of an internal metamorphic tendency must be as distinctly recognised as that of an internal conservative tendency and that the influence of conditions is mainly if not wholly the result of the extent to which they favour the one or the other of these tendencies  iii there is only one point upon which i fundamentally and entirely disagree with professor haeckel but that is the very important one of his conception of geological time and of the meaning of the stratified rocks as records and indications of that time conceiving that the stratified rocks of an epoch indicate a period of depression and that the intervals between the epochs correspond with periods of elevation of which we have no record he intercalates between the different epochs or periods intervals which he terms anteperiods thus instead of considering the triassic jurassic cretaceous and eocene periods as continuously successive he interposes a period before each as an antetriaszeit antejurazeit antecretazeit anteocenzeit c and he conceives that the abrupt changes between the faunæ of the different formations are due to the lapse of time of which we have no organic record during their anteperiods  the frequent occurrence of strata containing assemblages of organic forms which are intermediate between those of adjacent formations is to my mind fatal to this view in the wellknown st cassian beds for example palaeozoic and mesozoic forms are commingled and between the cretaceous and the eocene formations there are similar transitional beds on the other hand in the middle of the silurian series extensive unconformity of the strata indicates the lapse of vast intervals of time between the deposit of successive beds without any corresponding change in the fauna  professor haeckel will i fear think me unreasonable if i say that he seems to be still overshadowed by geological superstitions and that he will have to believe in the completeness of the geological record far less than he does at present he assumes for example that there was no dry land nor any terrestrial life before the end of the silurian epoch simply because up to the present time no indications of fresh water or terrestrial organisms have been found in rocks of older date and in speculating upon the origin of a given group he rarely goes further back than the anteperiod which precedes that in which the remains of animals belonging to that group are found thus as fossil remains of the majority of the groups of reptilia are first found in the trias they are assumed to have originated in the antetriassic period or between the permian and triassic epochs  i confess this is wholly incredible to me the permian and the triassic deposits pass completely into one another there is no sort of discontinuity answering to an unrecorded antetrias and what is more we have evidence of immensely extensive dry land during the formation of these deposits we know that the dry land of the trias absolutely teemed with reptiles of all groups except pterodactyles snakes and perhaps tortoises there is every probability that true birds existed and mammalia certainly did of the inhabitants of the permian dry land on the contrary all that have left a record are a few lizards is it conceivable that these last should really represent the whole terrestrial population of that time and that the development of mammals of birds and of the highest forms of reptiles should have been crowded into the time during which the permian conditions quietly passed away and the triassic conditions began does not any such supposition become in the highest degree improbable when in the terrestrial or freshwater labyrinthodonts which lived on the land of the carboniferous epoch as well as on that of the trias we have evidence that one form of terrestrial life persisted throughout all these ages with no important modification for my part having regard to the small amount of modification except in the way of extinction which the crocodilian lacertilian and chelonian reptilia have undergone from the older mesozoic times to the present day i cannot but put the existence of the common stock from which they sprang far back in the palæozoic epoch and i should apply a similar argumentation to all other groups of animals  the remainder of this essay contains a discussion of questions of taxonomy and phylogeny which is now antiquated i have reprinted the considerations about the reconciliation of teleology with morphology about dysteleology and about the struggle for existence within the organism because it has happened to me to be charged with overlooking them  in discussing teleology i ought to have pointed out as i have done elsewhere life and letters of charles darwin vol ii p 202 that paley proleptically accepted the modern doctrine of evolution natural theology chap xxiii 1893     v  mr darwins critics footnote contributions to the theory of natural selection by a r wallace 18702 the genesis of species by st george mivart frs second edition 18713 darwins descent of man quarterly review july 1871  1871   the gradual lapse of time has now separated us by more than a decade from the date of the publication of the origin of speciesand whatever may be thought or said about mr darwins doctrines or the manner in which he has propounded them this much is certain that in a dozen years the origin of species has worked as complete a revolution in biological science as the principia did in astronomyand it has done so because in the words of helmholtz it contains an essentially new creative thought footnote helmholtz ueber das ziel und die fortschritte der naturwissenschaft eröffnungsrede für die naturforscherversammlung zu innsbruck 1869 and as time has slipped by a happy change has come over mr darwins critics the mixture of ignorance and insolence which at first characterised a large proportion of the attacks with which he was assailed is no longer the sad distinction of antidarwinian criticism instead of abusive nonsense which merely discredited its writers we read essays which are at worst more or less intelligent and appreciative while sometimes like that which appeared in the north british review for 1867 they have a real and permanent value  the several publications of mr wallace and mr mivart contain discussions of some of mr darwins views which are worthy of particular attention not only on account of the acknowledged scientific competence of these writers but because they exhibit an attention to those philosophical questions which underlie all physical science which is as rare as it is needful and the same may be said of an article in the quarterly review for july 1871 the comparison of which with an article in the same review for july 1860 is perhaps the best evidence which can be brought forward of the change which has taken place in public opinion on darwinism  the quarterly reviewer admits the certainty of the action of natural selection p 49 and further allows that there is an à priori probability in favour of the evolution of man from some lower animal form if these lower animal forms themselves have arisen by evolution  mr wallace and mr mivart go much further than this they are as stout believers in evolution as mr darwin himself but mr wallace denies that man can have been evolved from a lower animal by that process of natural selection which he with mr darwin holds to have been sufficient for the evolution of all animals below man while mr mivart admitting that natural selection has been one of the conditions of the evolution of the animals below man maintains that natural selection must even in their case have been supplemented by some other causeof the nature of which unfortunately he does not give us any idea thus mr mivart is less of a darwinian than mr wallace for he has less faith in the power of natural selection but he is more of an evolutionist than mr wallace because mr wallace thinks it necessary to call in an intelligent agenta sort of supernatural sir john sebrightto produce even the animal frame of man while mr mivart requires no divine assistance till he comes to mans soul  thus there is a considerable divergence between mr wallace and mr mivart on the other hand there are some curious similarities between mr mivart and the quarterly reviewer and these are sometimes so close that if mr mivart thought it worth while i think he might make out a good case of plagiarism against the reviewer who studiously abstains from quoting him  both the reviewer and mr mivart reproach mr darwin with being like so many other physicists entangled in a radically false metaphysical system and with setting at nought the first principles of both philosophy and religion both enlarge upon the necessity of a sound philosophical basis and both i venture to add make a conspicuous exhibition of its absence the quarterly reviewer believes that man differs more from an elephant or a gorilla than do these from the dust of the earth on which they tread and mr mivart has expressed the opinion that there is more difference between man and an ape than there is between an ape and a piece of granite footnote see the tablet for march 11 1871  and even when mr mivart p 86 trips in a matter of anatomy and creates a difficulty for mr darwin out of a supposed close similarity between the eyes of fishes and cephalopods which as gegenbaur and others have clearly shown does not exist the quarterly reviewer adopts the argument without hesitation p 66  there is another important point however in which it is hard to say whether mr mivart diverges from the quarterly reviewer or not  the reviewer declares that mr darwin has with needless opposition set at nought the first principles of both philosophy and religion p 90  it looks at first as if this meant that mr darwins views being false the opposition to religion which flows from them must be needless but i suspect this is not the right view of the meaning of the passage as mr mivart from whom the quarterly reviewer plainly draws so much inspiration tells us that the consequences which have been drawn from evolution whether exclusively darwinian or not to the prejudice of religion by no means follow from it and are in fact illegitimate p 5  i may assume then that the quarterly reviewer and mr mivart admit that there is no necessary opposition between evolution whether exclusively darwinian or not and religion but then what do they mean by this last muchabused term on this point the quarterly reviewer is silent mr mivart on the contrary is perfectly explicit and the whole tenor of his remarks leaves no doubt that by religion he means theology and by theology that particular variety of the great proteus which is expounded by the doctors of the roman catholic church and held by the members of that religious community to be the sole form of absolute truth and of saving faith  according to mr mivart the greatest and most orthodox authorities upon matters of catholic doctrine agree in distinctly asserting derivative creation or evolution and thus their teachings harmonise with all that modern science can possibly require p 305  i confess that this bold assertion interested me more than anything else in mr mivarts book what little knowledge i possessed of catholic doctrine and of the influence exerted by catholic authority in former times had not led me to expect that modern science was likely to find a warm welcome within the pale of the greatest and most consistent of theological organisations  and my astonishment reached its climax when i found mr mivart citing father suarez as his chief witness in favour of the scientific freedom enjoyed by catholicsthe popular repute of that learned theologian and subtle casuist not being such as to make his works a likely place of refuge for liberality of thought but in these days when judas iscariot and robespierre henry viii and catiline have all been shown to be men of admirable virtue far in advance of their age and consequently the victims of vulgar prejudice it was obviously possible that jesuit suarez might be in like case and spurred by mr mivarts unhesitating declaration i hastened to acquaint myself with such of the works of the great catholic divine as bore upon the question hoping not merely to acquaint myself with the true teachings of the infallible church and free myself of an unjust prejudice but haply to enable myself at a pinch to put some protestant bibliolater to shame by the bright example of catholic freedom from the trammels of verbal inspiration  i regret to say that my anticipations have been cruelly disappointed but the extent to which my hopes have been crushed can only be fully appreciated by citing in the first place those passages of mr mivarts work by which they were excited in his introductory chapter i find the following passages  the prevalence of this theory of evolution need alarm no one for it is without any doubt perfectly consistent with the strictest and most orthodox christian footnote it should be observed that mr mivart employs the term christian as if it were the equivalent of catholic theology p 5  mr darwin and others may perhaps be excused if they have not devoted much time to the study of christian philosophy but they have no right to assume or accept without careful examination as an unquestioned fact that in that philosophy there is a necessary antagonism between the two ideas creation and evolution as applied to organic forms  it is notorious and patent to all who choose to seek that many distinguished christian thinkers have accepted and do accept both ideas ie both creation and evolution  as much as ten years ago an eminently christian writer observed the creationist theory does not necessitate the perpetual search after manifestations of miraculous power and perpetual catastrophes creation is not a miraculous interference with the laws of nature but the very institution of those laws law and regularity not arbitrary intervention was the patristic ideal of creation with this notion they admitted without difficulty the most surprising origin of living creatures provided it took place by law they held that when god said let the waters produce let the earth produce he conferred forces on the elements of earth and water which enabled them naturally to produce the various species of organic beings this power they thought remains attached to the elements throughout all time the same writer quotes st augustin and st thomas aquinas to the effect that in the institution of nature we do not look for miracles but for the laws of nature and again st basil speaks of the continued operation of natural laws in the production of all organisms  so much for the writers of early and mediæval times as to the present day the author can confidently affirm that there are many as well versed in theology as mr darwin is in his own department of natural knowledge who would not be disturbed by the thorough demonstration of his theory nay they would not even be in the least painfully affected at witnessing the generation of animals of complex organisation by the skilful artificial arrangement of natural forces and the production in the future of a fish by means analogous to those by which we now produce urea  and this because they know that the possibility of such phenomena though by no means actually foreseen has yet been fully provided for in the old philosophy centuries before darwin or even centuries before bacon and that their place in the system can be at once assigned them without even disturbing its order or marring its harmony  moreover the old tradition in this respect has never been abandoned however much it may have been ignored or neglected by some modern writers in proof of this it may be observed that perhaps no postmediæval theologian has a wider reception amongst christians throughout the world than suarez who has a separate section footnote suarez metaphysica edition vivés paris 1868 vol i disput xv § 2 in opposition to those who maintain the distinct creation of the various kindsor substantial formsof organic life pp 1921  still more distinctly does mr mivart express himself in the same sense in his last chapter entitled theology and evolution pp 3025  it appears then that christian thinkers are perfectly free to accept the general evolution theory but are there any theological authorities to justify this view of the matter  now considering how extremely recent are these biological speculations it might hardly be expected à priori that writers of earlier ages should have given expression to doctrines harmonising in any degree with such very modern views nevertheless this is certainly the case and it would be easy to give numerous examples it will be better however to cite one or two authorities of weight perhaps no writer of the earlier christian ages could be quoted whose authority is more generally recognised than that of st augustin the same may be said of the mediæval period for st thomas aquinas and since the movement of luther suarez may be taken as an authority widely venerated and one whose orthodoxy has never been questioned  it must be borne in mind that for a considerable time even after the last of these writers no one had disputed the generally received belief as to the small age of the world or at least of the kinds of animals and plants inhabiting it it becomes therefore much more striking if views formed under such a condition of opinion are found to harmonise with modern ideas concerning creation and organic life  now st augustin insists in a very remarkable manner on the merely derivative sense in which gods creation of organic forms is to be understood that is that god created them by conferring on the material world the power to evolve them under suitable conditions  mr mivart then cites certain passages from st augustin st thomas aquinas and cornelius à lapide and finally adds  as to suarez it will be enough to refer to disp xv sec 2 no 9 p 508 t i edition vivés paris also nos 1315 many other references to the same effect could easily be given but these may suffice  it is then evident that ancient and most venerable theological authorities distinctly assert derivative creation and thus their teachings harmonise with all that modern science can possibly require  it will be observed that mr mivart refers solely to suarezs fifteenth disputation though he adds many other references to the same effect could easily be given i shall look anxiously for these references in the third edition of the genesis of species for the present all i can say is that i have sought in vain either in the fifteenth disputation or elsewhere for any passage in suarezs writings which in the slightest degree bears out mr mivarts views as to his opinions footnote the edition of suarezs disputationes from which the following citations are given is birckmanns in two volumes folio and is dated 1680  the title of this fifteenth disputation is de causa formali substantiali and the second section of that disputation to which mr mivart refers is headed quomodo possit forma substantialis fieri in materia et ex materia  the problem which suarez discusses in this place may be popularly stated thus according to the scholastic philosophy every natural body has two componentsthe one its matter materia prima the other its substantial form forma substantialis of these the matter is everywhere the same the matter of one body being indistinguishable from the matter of any other body that which differentiates any one natural body from all others is its substantial form which inheres in the matter of that body as the human soul inheres in the matter of the frame of man and is the source of all the activities and other properties of the body  thus says suarez if water is heated and the source of heat is then removed it cools again the reason of this is that there is a certain intimius principium in the water which brings it back to the cool condition when the external impediment to the existence of that condition is removed this intimius principium is the substantial form of the water and the substantial form of the water is not only the cause radix of the coolness of the water but also of its moisture of its density and of all its other properties  it will thus be seen that substantial forms play nearly the same part in the scholastic philosophy as forces do in modern science the general tendency of modern thought being to conceive all bodies as resolvable into material particles and forces in virtue of which last these particles assume those dispositions and exercise those powers which are characteristic of each particular kind of matter  but the schoolmen distinguished two kinds of substantial forms the one spiritual and the other material the former division is represented by the human soul the anima rationalis and they affirm as a matter not merely of reason but of faith that every human soul is created out of nothing and by this act of creation is endowed with the power of existing for all eternity apart from the materia prima of which the corporeal frame of man is composed and the anima rationalis once united with the materia prima of the body becomes its substantial form and is the source of all the powers and faculties of manof all the vital and sensitive phenomena which he exhibitsjust as the substantial form of water is the source of all its qualities  the material substantial forms are those which inform all other natural bodies except that of man and the object of suarez in the present disputation is to show that the axiom ex nihilo nihil fit though not true of the substantial form of man is true of the substantial forms of all other bodies the endless mutations of which constitute the ordinary course of nature the origin of the difficulty which he discusses is easily comprehensible suppose a piece of bright iron to be exposed to the air the existence of the iron depends on the presence within it of a substantial form which is the cause of its properties eg brightness hardness weight but by degrees the iron becomes converted into a mass of rust which is dull and soft and light and in all other respects is quite different from the iron as in the scholastic view this difference is due to the rust being informed by a new substantial form the grave problem arises how did this new substantial form come into being has it been created or has it arisen by the power of natural causation if the former hypothesis is correct then the axiom ex nihilo nihil fit is false even in relation to the ordinary course of nature seeing that such mutations of matter as imply the continual origin of new substantial forms are occurring every moment but the harmonisation of aristotle with theology was as dear to the schoolmen as the smoothing down the differences between moses and science is to our broad churchmen and they were proportionably unwilling to contradict one of aristotles fundamental propositions nor was their objection to flying in the face of the stagirite likely to be lessened by the fact that such flight landed them in flat pantheism  so father suarez fights stoutly for the second hypothesis and i quote the principal part of his argumentation as an exquisite specimen of that speech which is a darkening of counsel  13 secundo de omnibus aliis formis substantialibus sc materialibus dicendum est non fieri proprie ex nihilo sed ex potentia præjacentis materiæ educi ideoque in effectione harum

vim finitam naturaliam agentium non vero posterior  14 ex his etiam constat proprie de his formis dici non creari sed educi de potentia materiæ footnote suarez loc cit disput xv § ii  if i may venture to interpret these hard sayings suarez conceives that the evolution of substantial forms in the ordinary course of nature is conditioned not only by the existence of the materia prima but also by a certain concurrence and influence which that materia exerts and every new substantial form being thus conditioned and in part at any rate caused by a preexisting something cannot be said to be created out of nothing  but as the whole tenor of the context shows suarez applies this argumentation merely to the evolution of material substantial forms in the ordinary course of nature how the substantial forms of animals and plants primarily originated is a question to which so far as i am able to discover he does not so much as allude in his metaphysical disputations nor was there any necessity that he should do so inasmuch as he has devoted a separate treatise of considerable bulk to the discussion of all the problems which arise out of the account of the creation which is given in the book of genesis and it is a matter of wonderment to me that mr mivart who somewhat sharply reproves mr darwin and others for not acquainting themselves with the true teachings of his church should allow himself to be indebted to a heretic like myself for a knowledge of the existence of that tractatus de opere sex dierum footnote tractatus de opere sex dierum seu de universi creatione quatenus sex diebus perfecta esse in libro genesis cap i refertur et praesertim de productione hominis in statu innocentiae ed birckmann 1622 in which the learned father of whom he justly speaks as an authority widely venerated and whose orthodoxy has never been questioned directly opposes all those opinions for which mr mivart claims the shelter of his authority  in the tenth and eleventh chapters of the first book of this treatise suarez inquires in what sense the word day as employed in the first chapter of genesis is to be taken he discusses the views of philo and of augustin on this question and rejects them he suggests that the approval of their allegorising interpretations by st thomas aquinas merely arose out of st thomass modesty and his desire not to seem openly to controvert st augustinvoluisse divus thomas pro sua modestia subterfugere vim argumenti potius quam aperte augustinum inconstantiæ arguere  finally suarez decides that the writer of genesis meant that the term day should be taken in its natural sense and he winds up the discussion with the very just and natural remark that it is not probable that god in inspiring moses to write a history of the creation which was to be believed by ordinary people would have made him use language the true meaning of which it is hard to discover and still harder to believe footnote propter hæc ergo sententia illa augustini et propter nimiam obscuritatem et subtilitatem ejus difficilis creditu est quia verisimile non est deum inspirasse moysi ut historiam de creatione mundi ad fidem totius populi adeo necessariam per

significationem diei naturalis est illa communis quod verba scripturæ non sunt ad metaphoras transferenda nisi vel necessitas cogit vel ex ipsa scriptura constet et maximè in historica narratione et

colligi potest tum ex æquiparatione nam cum dicitur sex diebus operabis propriissimè intelligitur tum quia non est verisimile potuisse populum intelligere verba illa in alio sensu et è contrario incredibile est deum in suis præceptis tradendis illis verbis ad populum fuisse loquutum quibus deciperetur falsum sensum concipiendo si deus non per sex veros dies opera sua fecisset  these passages leave no doubt that this great doctor of the catholic church of unchallenged authority and unspotted orthodoxy not only declares it to be catholic doctrine that the work of creation took place in the space of six natural days but that he warmly repudiates as inconsistent with our knowledge of the divine attributes the supposition that the language which catholic faith requires the believer to hold that god inspired was used in any other sense than that which he knew it would convey to the minds of those to whom it was addressed  and i think that in this repudiation father suarez will have the sympathy of every man of common uprightness to whom it is certainly incredible that the almighty should have acted in a manner which he would esteem dishonest and base in a man  but the belief that the universe was created in six natural days is hopelessly inconsistent with the doctrine of evolution in so far as it applies to the stars and planetary bodies and it can be made to agree with a belief in the evolution of living beings only by the supposition that the plants and animals which are said to have been created on the third fifth and sixth days were merely the primordial forms or rudiments out of which existing plants and animals have been evolved so that on these days plants and animals were not created actually but only potentially  the latter view is that held by mr mivart who follows st augustin and implies that he has the sanction of suarez but in point of fact the latter great light of orthodoxy takes no small pains to give the most explicit and direct contradiction to all such imaginations as the following passages prove in the first place as regards plants suarez discusses the problem  quomodo herba virens et cætera vegetabilia hoc tertio die fuerint producta footnote loc cit lib ii cap vii et viii 1 32 35  præcipua enim difficultas hîc est quam attingit div thomas 1 par qu 69 art 2 an hæc productio plantarum hoc die facta intelligenda sit de productione

reverentiam ejus quasi problematicè semper procedat denique idem sentiunt omnes qui in his operibus veram successionem et temporalem distinctionem agnoscant  secondly with respect to animals suarez is no less decided  de animalium ratione carentium productione quinto et sexto die facta footnote loc cit lib ii cap vii et viii 1 32 35  32 primo ergo nobis certum sit hæc animantia non in virtute tantum aut in semine sed actu et in seipsis facta fuisse his diebus in quibus facta narrantur quanquam augustinus lib 3 gen ad liter cap 5 in sua persistens sententia contrarium sentire videatur  but suarez proceeds to refute augustins opinions at great length and his final judgment may be gathered from the following passage  35 tertio dicendum est hæc animalia omnia his diebus producta esse in perfecto statu in singulis individuis seu speciebus suis juxta uniuscujusque naturam itaque fuerunt omnia creata integra et omnibus suis membris perfecta  as regards the creation of animals and plants therefore it is clear that suarez so far from distinctly asserting derivative creating denies it as distinctly and positively as he can that he is at much pains to refute st augustins opinions that he does not hesitate to regard the faint acquiescence of st thomas aquinas in the views of his brother saint as a kindly subterfuge on the part of divus thomas and that he affirms his own view to be that which is supported by the authority of the fathers of the church so that when mr mivart tells us that catholic theology is in harmony with all that modern science can possibly require that to the general theory of evolution and to the special darwinian form of it no exception  need be taken on the ground of orthodoxy and that law and regularity not arbitrary intervention was the patristic ideal of creation we have to choose between his dictum as a theologian and that of a great light of his church whom he himself declares to be widely venerated as an authority and whose orthodoxy has never been questioned  but mr mivart does not hesitate to push his attempt to harmonise science with catholic orthodoxy to its utmost limit and while assuming that the soul of man arises from immediate and direct creation he supposes that his body was formed at first as now in each separate individual by derivative or secondary creation through natural laws p 331  this means i presume that an animal having the corporeal form and bodily powers of man may have been developed out of some lower form of life by a process of evolution and that after this anthropoid animal had existed for a longer or shorter time god made a soul by direct creation and put it into the manlike body which heretofore had been devoid of that anima rationalis which is supposed to be mans distinctive character  this hypothesis is incapable of either proof or disproof and therefore may be true but if suarez is any authority it is not catholic doctrine nulla est in homine forma educta de potentia materiæ footnote disput xv § x no 27 is a dictum which is absolutely inconsistent with the doctrine of the natural evolution of any vital manifestation of the human body  moreover if man existed as an animal before he was provided with a rational soul he must in accordance with the elementary requirements of the philosophy in which mr mivart delights have possessed a distinct sensitive and vegetative soul or souls hence when the breath of life was breathed into the manlike animals nostrils he must have already been a living and feeling creature but suarez particularly discusses this point and not only rejects mr mivarts view but adopts language of very theological strength regarding it  possent præterea his adjungi argumenta theologica ut est illud quod sumitur ex illis verbis genes 2 formavit deus

doctrine according to suarez is that woman was in the strictest and most literal sense of the words made out of the rib of man  nihilominus sententia catholica est verba illa scripturæ esse ad literam intelligenda ac proinde vere ac realiter tulisse deum costam adamÆ et ex illa corpus evÆ formasse footnote tractatus de opere lib iii de hominis creatione cap ii no 3  nor is there any escape in the supposition that some woman existed before eve after the fashion of the lilith of the rabbis since suarez qualifies that notion along with some other judaic imaginations as simply damnabilis footnote ibid lib iii cap iv nos 8 and 9  after the perusal of the tractatus de opere it is in fact impossible to admit that suarez held any opinion respecting the origin of species except such as is consistent with the strictest and most literal interpretation of the words of genesis for suarez it is catholic doctrine that the world was made in six natural days on the first of these days the materia prima was made out of nothing to receive afterwards those substantial forms which moulded it into the universe of things on the third day the ancestors of all living plants suddenly came into being fullgrown perfect and possessed of all the properties which now distinguish them while on the fifth and sixth days the ancestors of all existing animals were similarly caused to exist in their complete and perfect state by the infusion of their appropriate material substantial forms into the matter which had already been created finally on the sixth day the anima rationalisthat rational and immortal substantial form which is peculiar to manwas created out of nothing and breathed into a mass of matter which till then was mere dust of the earth and so man arose but the species man was represented by a solitary male individual until the creator took out one of his ribs and fashioned it into a female  this is the view of the genesis of species held by suarez to be the only one consistent with catholic faith it is because he holds this view to be catholic that he does not hesitate to declare st augustin unsound and st thomas aquinas guilty of weakness when the one swerved from this view and the other tolerated the deviation and until responsible catholic authoritysay for example the archbishop of westminsterformally declares that suarez was wrong and that catholic priests are free to teach their flocks that the world was not made in six natural days and that plants and animals were not created in their perfect and complete state but have been evolved by natural processes through long ages from certain germs in which they were potentially contained i for one shall feel bound to believe that the doctrines of suarez are the only ones which are sanctioned by infallible authority as represented by the holy father and the catholic church  i need hardly add that they are as absolutely denied and repudiated by scientific authority as represented by reason and fact the question whether the earth and the immediate progenitors of its present living population were made in six natural days or not is no longer one upon which two opinions can be held  the fact that it did not so come into being stands upon as sound a basis as any fact of history whatever it is not true that existing plants and animals came into being within three days of the creation of the earth out of nothing for it is certain that innumerable generations of other plants and animals lived upon the earth before its present population and when sunday after sunday men who profess to be our instructors in righteousness read out the statement in six days the lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that in them is in innumerable churches they are either propagating what they may easily know and therefore are bound to know to be falsities or if they use the words in some nonnatural sense they fall below the moral standard of the muchabused jesuit  thus far the contradiction between catholic verity and scientific verity is complete and absolute quite independently of the truth or falsehood of the doctrine of evolution but for those who hold the doctrine of evolution all the catholic verities about the creation of living beings must be no less false for them the assertion that the progenitors of all existing plants were made on the third day of animals on the fifth and sixth days in the forms they now present is simply false nor can they admit that man was made suddenly out of the dust of the earth while it would be an insult to ask an evolutionist whether he credits the preposterous fable respecting the fabrication of woman to which suarez pins his faith if suarez has rightly stated catholic doctrine then is evolution utter heresy and such i believe it to be in addition to the truth of the doctrine of evolution indeed one of its greatest merits in my eyes is the fact that it occupies a position of complete and irreconcilable antagonism to that vigorous and consistent enemy of the highest intellectual moral and social life of mankindthe catholic church no doubt mr mivart like other putters of new wine into old bottles is actuated by motives which are worthy of respect and even of sympathy but his attempt has met with the fate which the scripture prophesies for all such  catholic theology like all theologies which are based upon the assumption of the truth of the account of the origin of things given in the book of genesis being utterly irreconcilable with the doctrine of evolution the student of science who is satisfied that the evidence upon which the doctrine of evolution rests is incomparably stronger and better than that upon which the supposed authority of the book of genesis rests will not trouble himself further with these theologies but will confine his attention to such arguments against the view he holds as are based upon purely scientific dataand by scientific data i do not merely mean the truths of physical mathematical or logical science but those of moral and metaphysical science for by science i understand all knowledge which rests upon evidence and reasoning of a like character to that which claims our assent to ordinary scientific propositions and if any one is able to make good the assertion that his theology rests upon valid evidence and sound reasoning then it appears to me that such theology will take its place as a part of science  the present antagonism between theology and science does not arise from any assumption by the men of science that all theology must necessarily be excluded from science but simply because they are unable to allow that reason and morality have two weights and two measures and that the belief in a proposition because authority tells you it is true or because you wish to believe it which is a high crime and misdemeanour when the subject matter of reasoning is of one kind becomes under the alias of faith the greatest of all virtues when the subject matter of reasoning is of another kind  the bishop of brechin said well the other dayliberality in religioni do not mean tender and generous allowances for the mistakes of othersis only unfaithfulness to truth footnote charge at the diocesan synod of brechin scotsman sept 14 1871 and with the same qualification i venture to paraphrase the bishops dictum ecclesiasticism in science is only unfaithfulness to truth  elijahs great question will you serve god or baal choose ye is uttered audibly enough in the ears of every one of us as we come to manhood let every man who tries to answer it seriously ask himself whether he can be satisfied with the baal of authority and with all the good things his worshippers are promised in this world and the next if he can let him if he be so inclined amuse himself with such scientific implements as authority tells him are safe and will not cut his fingers but let him not imagine he is or can be both a true son of the church and a loyal soldier of science  and on the other hand if the blind acceptance of authority appears to him in its true colours as mere private judgment in excelsis and if he have the courage to stand alone face to face with the abyss of the eternal and unknowable let him be content once for all not only to renounce the good things promised by infallibility but even to bear the bad things which it prophesies content to follow reason and fact in singleness and honesty of purpose wherever they may lead in the sure faith that a hell of honest men will to him be more endurable than a paradise full of angelic shams  mr mivart asserts that without a belief in a personal god there is no religion worthy of the name this is a matter of opinion but it may be asserted with less reason to fear contradiction that the worship of a personal god who on mr mivarts hypothesis must have used language studiously calculated to deceive his creatures and worshippers is no religion worthy of the name incredible est deum illis verbis ad populum fuisse locutum quibus deciperetur is a verdict in which for once jesuit casuistry concurs with the healthy moral sense of all mankind  having happily got quit of the theological aspect of evolution the supporter of that great truth who turns to the scientific objections which are brought against it by recent criticism finds to his relief that the work before him is greatly lightened by the spontaneous retreat of the enemy from ninetenths of the territory which he occupied ten years ago even the quarterly reviewer not only abstains from venturing to deny that evolution has taken place but he openly admits that mr darwin has forced on mens minds a recognition of the probability if not more of evolution and of the certainty of the action of natural selection p 49  i do not quite see myself how if the action of natural selection is certain the occurrence of evolution is only probable inasmuch as the development of a new species by natural selection is so far as it goes evolution however it is not worth while to quarrel with the precise terms of a sentence which shows that the high water mark of intelligence among those most respectable of britons the readers of the quarterly review has now reached such a level that the next tide may lift them easily and pleasantly on the oncedreaded shore of evolution nor having got there do they seem likely to stop until they have reached the inmost heart of that great region and accepted the ape ancestry of at any rate the body of man for the reviewer admits that mr darwin can be said to have established  that if the various kinds of lower animals have been evolved one from the other by a process of natural generation or evolution then it becomes highly probable a priori that mans body has been similarly evolved but this in such a case becomes equally probable from the admitted fact that he is an animal at all p 65  from the principles laid down in the last sentence it would follow that if man were constructed upon a plan as different from that of any other animal as that of a seaurchin is from that of a whale it would be equally probable that he had been developed from some other animal as it is now when we know that for every bone muscle tooth and even pattern of tooth in man there is a corresponding bone muscle tooth and pattern of tooth in an ape and this shows one of two thingseither that the quarterly reviewers notions of probability are peculiar to himself or that he has such an overpowering faith in the truth of evolution that no extent of structural break between one animal and another is sufficient to destroy his conviction that evolution has taken place  but this by the way the importance of the admission that there is nothing in mans physical structure to interfere with his having been evolved from an ape is not lessened because it is grudgingly made and inconsistently qualified and instead of jubilating over the extent of the enemys retreat it will be more worth while to lay siege to his last strongholdthe position that there is a distinction in kind between the mental faculties of man and those of brutes and that in consequence of this distinction in kind no gradual progress from the mental faculties of the one to those of the other can have taken place  the quarterly reviewer entrenches himself within formidablelooking psychological outworks and there is no getting at him without attacking them one by one  he begins by laying down the following proposition sensation is not thought and no amount of the former would constitute the most rudimentary condition of the latter though sensations supply the conditions for the existence of thought or knowledge p 67  this proposition is true or not according to the sense in which the word thought is employed thought is not uncommonly used in a sense coextensive with consciousness and especially with those states of consciousness we call memory if i recall the impression made by a colour or an odour and distinctly remember blueness or muskiness i may say with perfect propriety that i think of blue or musk and so long as the thought lasts it is simply a faint reproduction of the state of consciousness to which i gave the name in question when it first became known to me as a sensation  now if that faint reproduction of a sensation which we call the memory of it is properly termed a thought it seems to me to be a somewhat forced proceeding to draw a hard and fast line of demarcation between thoughts and sensations if sensations are not rudimentary thoughts it may be said that some thoughts are rudimentary sensations no amount of sound constitutes an echo but for all that no one would pretend that an echo is something of totally different nature from a sound again nothing can be looser or more inaccurate than the assertion that sensations supply the conditions for the existence of thought or knowledge if this implies that sensations supply the conditions for the existence of our memory of sensations or of our thoughts about sensations it is a truism which it is hardly worth while to state so solemnly if it implies that sensations supply anything else it is obviously erroneous and if it means as the context would seem to show it does that sensations are the subjectmatter of all thought or knowledge then it is no less contrary to fact inasmuch as our emotions which constitute a large part of the subjectmatter of thought or of knowledge are not sensations  more eccentric still is the quarterly reviewers next piece of psychology  altogether we may clearly distinguish at least six kinds of action to which the nervous system ministers  i that in which impressions received result in appropriate movements without the intervention of sensation or thought as in the cases of injury above giventhis is the reflex action of the nervous system  ii that in which stimuli from without result in sensations through the agency of which their due effects are wrought outsensation  iii that in which impressions received result in sensations which give rise to the observation of sensible objectssensible perception  iv that in which sensations and perceptions continue to coalesce agglutinate and combine in more or less complex aggregations according to the laws of the association of sensible perceptionsassociation  the above four groups contain only indeliberate operations consisting as they do at the best but of mere presentative sensible ideas in no way implying any reflective or representative faculty such actions minister to and form instinct besides these we may distinguish two other kinds of mental action namely  v that in which sensations and sensible perceptions are reflected on by thought and recognised as our own and we ourselves recognised by ourselves as affected and perceivingselfconsciousness  vi that in which we reflect upon our sensations or perceptions and ask what they are and why they arereason  these two latter kinds of action are deliberate operations performed as they are by means of representative ideas implying the use of a reflective representative faculty such actions distinguish the intellect or rational faculty now we assert that possession in perfection of all the first four presentative kinds of action by no means implies the possession of the last two representative kinds all persons we think must admit the truth of the following proposition  two faculties are distinct not in degree but in kind if we may possess the one in perfection without that fact implying that we possess the other also still more will this be the case if the two faculties tend to increase in an inverse ratio yet this is the distinction between the instinctive and the intellectual parts of mans nature  as to animals we fully admit that they may possess all the first four groups of actionsthat they may have so to speak mental images of sensible objects combined in all degrees of complexity as governed by the laws of association we deny to them on the other hand the possession of the last two kinds of mental action we deny them that is the power of reflecting on their own existences or of inquiring into the nature of objects and their causes we deny that they know that they know or know themselves in knowing in other words we deny them reason the possession of the presentative faculty as above explained in no way implies that of the reflective faculty nor does any amount of direct operation imply the power of asking the reflective question before mentioned as to what and why loc cit pp 67 68  sundry points are worthy of notice in this remarkable account of the intellectual powers in the first place the reviewer ignores emotion and volition though they are no inconsiderable kinds of action to which the nervous system ministers and memory has a place in his classification only by implication secondly we are told that the second kind of action to which the nervous system ministers is that in which stimuli from without result in sensations through the agency of which their due effects are wrought outsensation does this really mean that in the writers opinion sensation is the agent by which the due effect of the stimulus which gives rise to sensation is wrought out suppose somebody runs a pin into me the due effect of that particular stimulus will probably be threefold namely a sensation of pain a start and an interjectional expletive does the quarterly reviewer really think that the sensation is the agent by which the other two phenomena are wrought out  but these matters are of little moment to anyone but the reviewer and those persons who may incautiously take their physiology or psychology from him the really interesting point is this that when he fully admits that animals may possess all the first four groups of actions he grants all that is necessary for the purposes of the evolutionist for he hereby admits that in animals impressions received result in sensations which give rise to the observation of sensible objects and that they have what he calls sensible perception nor was it possible to help the admission for we have as much reason to ascribe to animals as we have to attribute to our fellowmen the power not only of perceiving external objects as external and thus practically recognizing the difference between the self and the notself but that of distinguishing between like and unlike and between simultaneous and successive things when a gamekeeper goes out coursing with a greyhound in leash and a hare crosses the field of vision he becomes the subject of those states of consciousness we call visual sensation and that is all he receives from without sensation as such tells him nothing whatever about the cause of these states of consciousness but the thinking faculty instantly goes to work upon the raw material of sensation furnished to it through the eye and gives rise to a train of thoughts first comes the thought that there is an object at a certain distance then arises another thoughtthe perception of the likeness between the states of consciousness awakened by this object to those presented by memory as on some former occasion called up by a hare this is succeeded by another thought of the nature of an emotionnamely the desire to possess the hare then follows a longer or shorter train of other thoughts which end in a volition and an actthe loosing of the greyhound from the leash these several thoughts are the concomitants of a process which goes on in the nervous system of the man unless the nerveelements of the retina of the optic nerve of the brain of the spinal cord and of the nerves of the arms went through certain physical changes in due order and correlation the various states of consciousness which have been enumerated would not make their appearance so that in this as in all other intellectual operations we have to distinguish two sets of successive changesone in the physical basis of consciousness and the other in consciousness itself one set which may and doubtless will in course of time be followed through all their complexities by the anatomist and the physicist and one of which only the man himself can have immediate knowledge  as it is very necessary to keep up a clear distinction between these two processes let the one be called neurosis and the other psychosis when the gamekeeper was first trained to his work every step in the process of neurosis was accompanied by a corresponding step in that of psychosis or nearly so he was conscious of seeing something conscious of making sure it was a hare conscious of desiring to catch it and therefore to loose the greyhound at the right time conscious of the acts by which he let the dog out of the leash but with practice though the various steps of the neurosis remainfor otherwise the impression on the retina would not result in the loosing of the dogthe great majority of the steps of the psychosis vanish and the loosing of the dog follows unconsciously or as we say without thinking about it upon the sight of the hare no one will deny that the series of acts which originally intervened between the sensation and the letting go of the dog were in the strictest sense intellectual and rational operations do they cease to be so when the man ceases to be conscious of them that depends upon what is the essence and what the accident of those operations which taken together constitute ratiocination  now ratiocination is resolvable into predication and predication consists in marking in some way the existence the coexistence the succession the likeness and unlikeness of things or their ideas whatever does this reasons and if a machine produces the effects of reason i see no more ground for denying to it the reasoning power because it is unconscious than i see for refusing to mr babbages engine the title of a calculating machine on the same grounds  thus it seems to me that a gamekeeper reasons whether he is conscious or unconscious whether his reasoning is carried on by neurosis alone or whether it involves more or less psychosis and if this is true of the gamekeeper it is also true of the greyhound the essential resemblances in all points of structure and function so far as they can be studied between the nervous system of the man and that of the dog leave no reasonable doubt that the processes which go on in the one are just like those which take place in the other in the dog there can be no doubt that the nervous matter which lies between the retina and the muscles undergoes a series of changes precisely analogous to those which in the man give rise to sensation a train of thought and volition  whether this neurosis is accompanied by such psychosis as ours it is impossible to say but those who deny that the nervous changes which in the dog correspond with those which underlie thought in a man are accompanied by consciousness are equally bound to maintain that those nervous changes in the dog which correspond with those which underlie sensation in a man are also unaccompanied by consciousness in other words if there is no ground for believing that a dog thinks neither is there any for believing that he feels  as is well known descartes boldly faced this dilemma and maintained that all animals were mere machines and entirely devoid of consciousness but he did not deny nor can anyone deny that in this case they are reasoning machines capable of performing all those operations which are performed by the nervous system of man when he reasons for even supposing that in man and in man only psychosis is superadded to neurosisthe neurosis which is common to both man and animal gives their reasoning processes a fundamental unity but descartes position is open to very serious objections if the evidence that animals feel is insufficient to prove that they really do so what is the value of the evidence which leads one to believe that ones fellowman feels the only evidence in this argument of analogy is the similarity of his structure and of his actions to ones own and if that is good enough to prove that ones fellowman feels surely it is good enough to prove that an ape feels for the differences of structure and function between men and apes are utterly insufficient to warrant the assumption that while men have those states of consciousness we call sensations apes have nothing of the kind moreover we have as good evidence that apes are capable of emotion and volition as we have that men other than ourselves are but if apes possess three out of the four kinds of states of consciousness which we discover in ourselves what possible reason is there for denying them the fourth if they are capable of sensation emotion and volition why are they to be denied thought in the sense of predication  no answer has ever been given to these questions and as the law of continuity is as much opposed as is the common sense of mankind to the notion that all animals are unconscious machines it may safely be assumed that no sufficient answer ever will be given to them  there is every reason to believe that consciousness is a function of nervous matter when that nervous matter has attained a certain degree of organisation just as we know the other actions to which the nervous system ministers such as reflex action and the like to be as i have ventured to state my view of the matter elsewhere our thoughts are the expression of molecular changes in that matter of life which is the source of our other vital phenomena  mr wallace objects to this statement in the following terms  not having been able to find any clue in professor huxleys writings to the steps by which he passes from those vital phenomena which consist only in their last analysis of movements by particles of matter to those other phenomena which we term thought sensation or consciousness but knowing that so positive an expression of opinion from him will have great weight with many persons i shall endeavour to show with as much brevity as is compatible with clearness that this theory is not only incapable of proof but is also as it appears to me inconsistent with accurate conceptions of molecular physics  with all respect for mr wallace it appears to me that his remarks are entirely beside the question i really know nothing whatever and never hope to know anything of the steps by which the passage from molecular movement to states of consciousness is effected and i entirely agree with the sense of the passage which he quotes from professor tyndall apparently imagining that it is in opposition to the view i hold  all that i have to say is that in my belief consciousness and molecular action are capable of being expressed by one another just as heat and mechanical action are capable of being expressed in terms of one another whether we shall ever be able to express consciousness in footpounds or not is more than i will venture to say but that there is evidence of the existence of some correlation between mechanical motion and consciousness is as plain as anything can be suppose the poles of an electric battery to be connected by a platinum wire a certain intensity of the current gives rise in the mind of a bystander to that state of consciousness we call a dull red lighta little greater intensity to another which we call a bright red light increase the intensity and the light becomes white and finally it dazzles and a new state of consciousness arises which we term pain given the same wire and the same nervous apparatus and the amount of electric force required to give rise to these several states of consciousness will be the same however often the experiment is repeated and as the electric force the light waves and the nervevibrations caused by the impact of the lightwaves on the retina are all expressions of the molecular changes which are taking place in the elements of the battery so consciousness is in the same sense an expression of the molecular changes which take place in that nervous matter which is the organ of consciousness  and since this and any number of similar examples that may be required prove that one form of consciousness at any rate is in the strictest sense the expression of molecular change it really is not worth while to pursue the inquiry whether a fact so easily established is consistent with any particular system of molecular physics or not  mr wallace in fact appears to me to have mixed up two very distinct propositions the one the indisputable truth that consciousness is correlated with molecular changes in the organ of consciousness the other that the nature of that correlation is known or can be conceived which is quite another matter mr wallace presumably believes in that correlation of phenomena which we call cause and effect as firmly as i do but if he has ever been able to form the faintest notion how a cause gives rise to its effect all i can say is that i envy him take the simplest case imaginablesuppose a ball in motion to impinge upon another ball at rest i know very well as a matter of fact that the ball in motion will communicate some of its motion to the ball at rest and that the motion of the two balls after collision is precisely correlated with the masses of both balls and the amount of motion of the first but how does this come about in what manner can we conceive that the vis viva of the first ball passes into the second i confess i can no more form any conception of what happens in this case than i can of what takes place when the motion of particles of my nervous matter caused by the impact of a similar ball gives rise to the state of consciousness i call pain in ultimate analysis everything is incomprehensible and the whole object of science is simply to reduce the fundamental incomprehensibilities to the smallest possible number  but to return to the quarterly reviewer he admits that animals have mental images of sensible objects combined in all degrees of complexity as governed by the laws of association presumably by this confused and imperfect statement the reviewer means to admit more than the words imply for mental images of sensible objects even though combined in all degrees of complexity are and can be nothing more than mental images of sensible objects but judgments emotions and volitions cannot by any possibility be included under the head of mental images of sensible objects if the greyhound had no better mental endowment than the reviewer allows him he might have the mental image of the sensible objectthe hareand that might be combined with the mental images of other sensible objects to any degree of complexity but he would have no power of judging it to be at a certain distance from him no power of perceiving its similarity to his memory of a hare and no desire to get at it consequently he would stand stock still and the noble art of coursing would have no existence on the other hand as that art is largely practised it follows that greyhounds alone possess a number of mental powers the existence of which in any animal is absolutely denied by the quarterly reviewer  finally what are the mental powers which he reserves as the especial prerogative of man they are two first the recognition of ourselves by ourselves as affected and perceivingselfconsciousness  secondly the reflection upon our sensations and perceptions and asking what they are and why they arereason  to the faculty defined in the last sentence the reviewer without assigning the least ground for thus departing from both common usage and technical propriety applies the name of reason but if man is not to be considered a reasoning being unless he asks what his sensations and perceptions are and why they are what is a hottentot or an australian blackfellow or what the swinked hedger of an ordinary agricultural district nay what becomes of an average country squire or parson how many of these worthy persons who as their wont is read the quarterly review would do other than stand agape if you asked them whether they had ever reflected what their sensations and perceptions are and why they are  so that if the reviewers new definition of reason be correct the majority of men even among the most civilised nations are devoid of that supreme characteristic of manhood and if it be as absurd as i believe it to be then as reason is certainly not selfconsciousness and since it as certainly is one of the actions to which the nervous system ministers we must if the reviewers classification is to be adopted seek it among those four faculties which he allows animals to possess and thus for the second time he really surrenders while seeming to defend his position  the quarterly reviewer as we have seen lectures the evolutionists upon their want of knowledge of philosophy altogether mr mivart is not less pained at mr darwins ignorance of moral science it is grievous to him that mr darwin and nous autres should not have grasped the elementary distinction between material and formal morality and he lays down as an axiom of which no tyro ought to be ignorant the position that acts unaccompanied by mental acts of conscious will directed towards the fulfilment of duty are absolutely destitute of the most incipient degree of real or formal goodness  now this may be mr mivarts opinion but it is a proposition which really does not stand on the footing of an undisputed axiom mr mill denies it in his work on utilitarianism the most influential writer of a totally opposed school mr carlyle is never weary of denying it and upholding the merit of that virtue which is unconscious nay it is to my understanding extremely hard to reconcile mr mivarts dictum with that noble summary of the whole duty of manthou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself according to mr mivarts definition the man who loves god and his neighbour and out of sheer love and affection for both does all he can to please them is nevertheless destitute of a particle of real goodness  and it further happens that mr darwin who is charged by mr mivart with being ignorant of the distinction between material and formal goodness discusses the very question at issue in a passage which is well worth reading vol i p 87 and also comes to a conclusion opposed to mr mivarts axiom a proposition which has been so much disputed and repudiated should under no circumstances have been thus confidently assumed to be true for myself i utterly reject it inasmuch as the logical consequence of the adoption of any such principle is the denial of all moral value to sympathy and affection according to mr mivarts axiom the man who seeing another struggling in the water leaps in at the risk of his own life to save him does that which is destitute of the most incipient degree of real goodness unless as he strips off his coat he says to himself now mind i am going to do this because it is my duty and for no other reason and the most beautiful character to which humanity can attain that of the man who does good without thinking about it because he loves justice and mercy and is repelled by evil has no claim on our moral approbation the denial that a man acts morally because he does not think whether he does so or not may be put upon the same footing as the denial of the title of an arithmetician to the calculating boy because he did not know how he worked his sums if mankind ever generally accept and act upon mr mivarts axiom they will simply become a set of most unendurable prigs but they never have accepted it and i venture to hope that evolution has nothing so terrible in store for the human race  but if an action the motive of which is nothing but affection or sympathy may be deserving of moral approbation and really good who that has ever had a dog of his own will deny that animals are capable of such actions mr mivart indeed saysit may be safely affirmed however that there is no trace in brutes of any actions simulating morality which are not explicable by the fear of punishment by the hope of pleasure or by personal affection p 221 but it may be affirmed with equal truth that there is no trace in men of any actions which are not traceable to the same motives if a man does anything he does it either because he fears to be punished if he does not do it or because he hopes to obtain pleasure by doing it or because he gratifies his affections footnote in separating pleasure and the gratification of affection i simply follow mr mivart without admitting the justice of the separation by doing it  assuming the position of the absolute moralists let it be granted that there is a perception of right and wrong innate in every man this means simply that when certain ideas are presented to his mind the feeling of approbation arises and when certain others the feeling of disapprobation to do your duty is to earn the approbation of your conscience or moral sense to fail in your duty is to feel its disapprobation as we all say now is approbation a pleasure or a pain surely a pleasure and is disapprobation a pleasure or a pain surely a pain consequently all that is really meant by the absolute moralists is that there is in the very nature of man something which enables him to be conscious of these particular pleasures and pains and when they talk of immutable and eternal principles of morality the only intelligible sense which i can put upon the words is that the nature of man being what it is he always has been and always will be capable of feeling these particular pleasures and pains À priori i have nothing to say against this proposition admitting its truth i do not see how the moral faculty is on a different footing from any of the other faculties of man if i choose to say that it is an immutable and eternal law of human nature that ginger is hot in the mouth the assertion has as much foundation of truth as the other though i think it would be expressed in needlessly pompous language i must confess that i have never been able to understand why there should be such a bitter quarrel between the intuitionists and the utilitarians the intuitionist is after all only a utilitarian who believes that a particular class of pleasures and pains has an especial importance by reason of its foundation in the nature of man and its inseparable connection with his very existence as a thinking being and as regards the motive of personal affection love as spinoza profoundly says is the association of pleasure with that which is loved footnote nempe amor nihil aliud est quam lætitia concomitante idea causæ externæethices iii xiii or to put it to the common sense of mankind is the gratification of affection a pleasure or a pain surely a pleasure so that whether the motive which leads us to perform an action is the love of our neighbour or the love of god it is undeniable that pleasure enters into that motive  thus much in reply to mr mivarts arguments i cannot but think that it is to be regretted that he ekes them out by ascribing to the doctrines of the philosophers with whom he does not agree logical consequences which have been over and over again proved not to flow from them and when reason fails him tries the effect of an injurious nickname according to the views of mr spencer mr mill and mr darwin mr mivart tells us virtue is a mere kind of retrieving and that we may not miss the point of the joke he puts it in italics but what if it is does that make it less virtue suppose i say that sculpture is a mere way of stonecutting and painting a mere way of daubing canvas and music a mere way of making a noise the statements are quite true but they only show that i see no other method of depreciating some of the noblest aspects of humanity than that of using language in an inadequate and misleading sense about them and the peculiar inappropriateness of this particular nickname to the views in question arises from the circumstance which mr mivart would doubtless have recollected if his wish to ridicule had not for the moment obscured his judgmentthat whether the law of evolution applies to man or not that of hereditary transmission certainly does mr mivart will hardly deny that a man owes a large share of the moral tendencies which he exhibits to his ancestors and the man who inherits a desire to steal from a kleptomaniac or a tendency to benevolence from a howard is so far as he illustrates hereditary transmission comparable to the dog who inherits the desire to fetch a duck out of the water from his retrieving sire so that evolution or no evolution moral qualities are comparable to a kind of retrieving though the comparison if meant for the purposes of casting obloquy on evolution does not say much for the fairness of those who make it  the quarterly reviewer and mr mivart base their objections to the evolution of the mental faculties of man from those of some lower animal form upon what they maintain to be a difference in kind between the mental and moral faculties of men and brutes and i have endeavoured to show by exposing the utter unsoundness of their philosophical basis that these objections are devoid of importance  the objections which mr wallace brings forward to the doctrine of the evolution of the mental faculties of man from those of brutes by natural causes are of a different order and require separate consideration  if i understand him rightly he by no means doubts that both the bodily and the mental faculties of man have been evolved from those of some lower animal but he is of opinion that some agency beyond that which has been concerned in the evolution of ordinary animals has been operative in the case of man a superior intelligence has guided the development of man in a definite direction and for a special purpose just as man guides the development of many animal and vegetable forms footnote the limits of natural selection as applied to man loc cit p 359 i understand this to mean that just as the rockpigeon has been produced by natural causes while the evolution of the tumbler from the blue rock has required the special intervention of the intelligence of man so some anthropoid form may have been evolved by variation and natural selection but it could never have given rise to man unless some superior intelligence had played the part of the pigeonfancier  according to mr wallace whether we compare the savage with the higher developments of man or with the brutes around him we are alike driven to the conclusion that in his large and welldeveloped brain he possesses an organ quite disproportioned to his requirements p 343 and he asks what is there in the life of the savage but the satisfying of the cravings of appetite in the simplest and easiest way what thoughts idea or actions are there that raise him many grades above the elephant or the ape p 342 i answer mr wallace by citing a remarkable passage which occurs in his instructive paper on instinct in man and animals  savages make long journeys in many directions and their whole faculties being directed to the subject they gain a wide and accurate knowledge of the topography not only of their own district but of all the regions round about every one who has travelled in a new direction communicates his knowledge to those who have travelled less and descriptions of routes and localities and minute incidents of travel form one of the main staples of conversation around the evening fire every wanderer or captive from another tribe adds to the store of information and as the very existence of individuals and of whole families and tribes depends upon the completeness of this knowledge all the acute perceptive faculties of the adult savage are directed to acquiring and perfecting it the good hunter or warrior thus comes to know the bearing of every hill and mountain range the directions and junctions of all the streams the situation of each tract characterised by peculiar vegetation not only within the area he has himself traversed but perhaps for a hundred miles around it his acute observation enables him to detect the slightest undulations of the surface the various changes of subsoil and alterations in the character of the vegetation that would be quite imperceptible to a stranger his eye is always open to the direction in which he is going the mossy side of trees the presence of certain plants under the shade of rocks the morning and evening flight of birds are to him indications of direction almost as sure as the sun in the heavens pp 207 208  i have seen enough of savages to be able to declare that nothing can be more admirable than this description of what a savage has to learn but it is incomplete add to all this the knowledge which a savage is obliged to gain of the properties of plants of the characters and habits of animals and of the minute indications by which their course is discoverable consider that even an australian can make excellent baskets and nets and neatly fitted and beautifully balanced spears that he learns to use these so as to be able to transfix a quartern loaf at sixty yards and that very often as in the case of the american indians the language of a savage exhibits complexities which a welltrained european finds it difficult to master consider that every time a savage tracks his game he employs a minuteness of observation and an accuracy of inductive and deductive reasoning which applied to other matters would assure some reputation to a man of science and i think we need ask no further why he possesses such a fair supply of brains in complexity and difficulty i should say that the intellectual labour of a good hunter or warrior considerably exceeds that of an ordinary englishman the civil service examiners are held in great terror by young englishmen but even their ferocity never tempted them to require a candidate to possess such a knowledge of a parish as mr wallace justly points out savages may possess of an area a hundred miles or more in diameter  but suppose for the sake of argument that a savage has more brains than seems proportioned to his wants all that can be said is that the objection to natural selection if it be one applies quite as strongly to the lower animals the brain of a porpoise is quite wonderful for its mass and for the development of the cerebral convolutions and yet since we have ceased to credit the story of arion it is hard to believe that porpoises are much troubled with intellect and still more difficult is it to imagine that their big brains are only a preparation for the advent of some accomplished cetacean of the future surely again a wolf must have too much brains or else how is it that a dog with only the same quantity and form of brain is able to develop such singular intelligence the wolf stands to the dog in the same relation as the savage to the man and therefore if mr wallaces doctrine holds good a higher power must have superintended the breeding up of wolves from some inferior stock in order to prepare them to become dogs  mr wallace further maintains that the origin of some of mans mental faculties by the preservation of useful variations is not possible such for example are the capacity to form ideal conceptions of space and time of eternity and infinity the capacity for intense artistic feelings of pleasure in form colour and composition and for those abstract notions of form and number which render geometry and arithmetic possible how he asks were all or any of these faculties first developed when they could have been of no possible use to man in his early stages of barbarism  surely the answer is not far to seek the lowest savages are as devoid of any such conceptions as the brutes themselves what sort of conceptions of space and time of form and number can be possessed by a savage who has not got so far as to be able to count beyond five or six who does not know how to draw a triangle or a circle and has not the remotest notion of separating the particular quality we call form from the other qualities of bodies none of these capacities are exhibited by men unless they form part of a tolerably advanced society and in such a society there are abundant conditions by which a selective influence is exerted in favour of those persons who exhibit an approximation towards the possession of these capacities  the savage who can amuse his fellows by telling a good story over the nightly fire is held by them in esteem and rewarded in one way or another for so doingin other words it is an advantage to him to possess this power he who can carve a paddle or the figurehead of a canoe better similarly profits beyond his duller neighbour he who counts a little better than others gets most yams when barter is going on and forms the shrewdest estimate of the numbers of an opposing tribe the experience of daily life shows that the conditions of our present social existence exercise the most extraordinarily powerful selective influence in favour of novelists artists and strong intellects of all kinds and it seems unquestionable that all forms of social existence must have had the same tendency if we consider the indisputable facts that even animals possess the power of distinguishing form and number and that they are capable of deriving pleasure from particular forms and sounds if we admit as mr wallace does that the lowest savages are not raised many grades above the elephant and the ape and if we further admit as i contend must be admitted that the conditions of social life tend powerfully to give an advantage to those individuals who vary in the direction of intellectual or æsthetic excellence what is there to interfere with the belief that these higher faculties like the rest owe their development to natural selection  finally with respect to the development of the moral sense out of the simple feelings of pleasure and pain liking and disliking with which the lower animals are provided i can find nothing in mr wallaces reasonings which has not already been met by mr mill mr spencer or mr darwin  i do not propose to follow the quarterly reviewer and mr mivart through the long string of objections in matters of detail which they bring against mr darwins views every one who has considered the matter carefully will be able to ferret out as many more difficulties but he will also i believe fail as completely as they appear to me to have done in bringing forward any fact which is really contradictory of mr darwins views occasionally too their objections and criticisms are based upon errors of their own as for example when mr mivart and the quarterly reviewer insist upon the resemblances between the eyes of cephalopoda and vertebrata quite forgetting that there are striking and altogether fundamental differences between them or when the quarterly reviewer corrects mr darwin for saying that the gibbons without having been taught can walk or run upright with tolerable quickness though they move awkwardly and much less securely than man the quarterly reviewer says this is a little misleading inasmuch as it is not stated that this upright progression is effected by placing the enormously long arms behind the head or holding them out backwards as a balance in progression  now before carping at a small statement like this the quarterly reviewer should have made sure that he was quite right but he happens to be quite wrong i suspect he got his notion of the manner in which a gibbon walks from a citation in mans place in nature but at that time i had not seen a gibbon walk since then i have and i can testify that nothing can be more precise than mr darwins statement the gibbon i saw walked without either putting his arms behind his head or holding them out backwards all he did was to touch the ground with the outstretched fingers of his long arms now and then just as one sees a man who carries a stick but does not need one touch the ground with it as he walks along  again a large number of the objections brought forward by mr mivart and the quarterly reviewer apply to evolution in general quite as much as to the particular form of that doctrine advocated by mr darwin or to their notions of mr darwins views and not to what they really are an excellent example of this class of difficulties is to be found in mr mivarts chapter on independent similarities of structure mr mivart says that these cannot be explained by an absolute and pure darwinian but that an innate power and evolutionary law aided by the corrective action of natural selection should have furnished like needs with like aids is not at all improbable p 82  i do not exactly know what mr mivart means by an absolute and pure darwinian indeed mr mivart makes that creature hold so many singular opinions that i doubt if i can ever have seen one alive but i find nothing in his statement of the view which he imagines to be originated by himself which is really inconsistent with what i understand to be mr darwins views  i apprehend that the foundation of the theory of natural selection is the fact that living bodies tend incessantly to vary this variation is neither indefinite nor fortuitous nor does it take place in all directions in the strict sense of these words  accurately speaking it is not indefinite nor does it take place in all directions because it is limited by the general characters of the type to which the organism exhibiting the variation belongs a whale does not tend to vary in the direction of producing feathers nor a bird in the direction of developing whalebone in popular language there is no harm in saying that the waves which break upon the seashore are indefinite fortuitous and break in all directions in scientific language on the contrary such a statement would be a gross error inasmuch as every particle of foam is the result of perfectly definite forces operating according to no less definite laws in like manner every variation of a living form however minute however apparently accidental is inconceivable except as the expression of the operation of molecular forces or powers resident within the organism and as these forces certainly operate according to definite laws their general result is doubtless in accordance with some general law which subsumes them all and there appears to be no objection to call this an evolutionary law but nobody is the wiser for doing so or has thereby contributed in the least degree to the advance of the doctrine of evolution the great need of which is a theory of variation  when mr mivart tells us that his aim has been to support the doctrine that these species have been evolved by ordinary natural laws for the most part unknown aided by the subordinate action of natural selection pp 3323 he seems to be of opinion that his enterprise has the merit of novelty all i can say is that i have never had the slightest notion that mr darwins aim is in any way different from this if i affirm that species have been evolved by variation footnote including under this head hereditary transmission a natural process the laws of which are for the most part unknown aided by the subordinate action of natural selection it seems to me that i enunciate a proposition which constitutes the very pith and marrow of the first edition of the origin of species and what the evolutionist stands in need of just now is not an iteration of the fundamental principle of darwinism but some light upon the questions what are the limits of variation and if a variety has arisen can that variety be perpetuated or even intensified when selective conditions are indifferent or perhaps unfavourable to its existence i cannot find that mr darwin has ever been very dogmatic in answering these questions formerly he seems to have inclined to reply to them in the negative while now his inclination is the other way leaving aside those broad questions of theology philosophy and ethics by the discussion of which neither the quarterly reviewer nor mr mivart can be said to have damaged darwinismwhatever else they have injuredthis is what their criticisms come to they confound a struggle for some riflepits with an assault on the fortress  in some respects finally i can only characterise the quarterly reviewers treatment of mr darwin as alike unjust and unbecoming language of this strength requires justification and on that ground i add the remarks which follow  the quarterly reviewer opens his essay by a careful enumeration of all those points upon which during the course of thirteen years of incessant labour mr darwin has modified his opinions it has often and justly been remarked that what strikes a candid student of mr darwins works is not so much his industry his knowledge or even the surprising fertility of his inventive genius but that unswerving truthfulness and honesty which never permit him to hide a weak place or gloss over a difficulty but lead him on all occasions to point out the weak places in his own armour and even sometimes it appears to me to make admissions against himself which are quite unnecessary a critic who desires to attack mr darwin has only to read his works with a desire to observe not their merits but their defects and he will find ready to hand more adverse suggestions than are likely ever to have suggested themselves to his own sharpness without mr darwins selfdenying aid  now this quality of scientific candour is not so common that it needs to be discouraged and it appears to me to deserve other treatment than that adopted by the quarterly reviewer who deals with mr darwin as an old bailey barrister deals with a man against whom he wishes to obtain a conviction per fas aut nefas and opens his case by endeavouring to create a prejudice against the prisoner in the minds of the jury in his eagerness to carry out this laudable design the quarterly reviewer cannot even state the history of the doctrine of natural selection without an oblique and entirely unjustifiable attempt to depreciate mr darwin to mr darwin says he and through mr wallaces reticence to mr darwin alone is due the credit of having first brought it prominently forward and demonstrated its truth no one can less desire than i do to throw a doubt upon mr wallaces originality or to question his claim to the honour of being one of the originators of the doctrine of natural selection but the statement that mr darwin has the sole credit of originating the doctrine because of mr wallaces reticence is simply ridiculous the proof of this is in the first place afforded by mr wallace himself whose noble freedom from petty jealousy in this matter smaller folk would do well to imitate and who writes thusi have felt all my life and i still feel the most sincere satisfaction that mr darwin had been at work long before me and that it was not left for me to attempt to write the origin of species i have long since measured my own strength and know well that it would be quite unequal to that task so that if there was any reticence at all in the matter it was mr darwins reticence during the long twenty years of study which intervened between the conception and the publication of his theory which gave mr wallace the chance of being an independent discoverer of the importance of natural selection and finally if it be recollected that mr darwins and mr wallaces essays were published simultaneously in the journal of the linnæan society for 1858 it follows that the reviewer while obliquely depreciating mr darwins deserts has in reality awarded to him a priority which in legal strictness does not exist  mr mivart whose opinions so often concur with those of the quarterly reviewer puts the case in a way which i much regret to be obliged to say is in my judgment quite as incorrect though the injustice may be less glaring he says that the theory of natural selection is in general exclusively associated with the name of mr darwin on account of the noble selfabnegation of mr wallace as i have said no one can honour mr wallace more than i do both for what he has done and for what he has not done in his relation to mr darwin and perhaps nothing is more creditable to him than his frank declaration that he could not have written such a work as the origin of species but by this declaration the person most directly interested in the matter repudiates by anticipation mr mivarts suggestion that mr darwins eminence is more or less due to mr wallaces modesty     vi  evolution in biology  1878   in the former half of the eighteenth century the term evolution was introduced into biological writings in order to denote the mode in which some of the most eminent physiologists of that time conceived that the generations of living things took place in opposition to the hypothesis advocated in the preceding century by harvey in that remarkable work footnote the exercitationes de generatione animalium which dr george ent extracted from him and published in 1651 which would give him a claim to rank among the founders of biological science even had he not been the discoverer of the circulation of the blood  one of harveys prime objects is to defend and establish on the basis of direct observation the opinion already held by aristotle that in the higher animals at any rate the formation of the new organism by the process of generation takes place not suddenly by simultaneous accretion of rudiments of all or of the most important of the organs of the adult nor by sudden metamorphosis of a formative substance into a miniature of the whole which subsequently grows but by epigenesis or successive differentiation of a relatively homogeneous rudiment into the parts and structures which are characteristic of the adult  et primò quidem quoniam per epigenesin sive partium superexorientium additamentum pullum fabricari certum est quænam pars ante alias omnes exstruatur et quid de illa ejusque generandi modo observandum veniat dispiciemus ratum sane est et in ovo manifestè apparet quod aristoteles de perfectorum animalium generatione enuntiat nimirum non omnes partes simul fieri sed ordine aliam post aliam primùmque existere particulam genitalem cujus virtute postea tanquam ex principio quodam reliquæ omnes partes prosiliant qualem in plantarum seminibus fabis putà aut glandibus gemmam sive apicem protuberantem cernimus totius futuræ arboris principium estque hæc particula velut filius emancipatus

primario inest sensus motusque et totius vitæ auctor et principium exercitatio 51  harvey proceeds to contrast this view with that of the medici or followers of hippocrates and galen who badly philosophising imagined that the brain the heart and the liver were simultaneously first generated in the form of vesicles and at the same time while expressing his agreement with aristotle in the principle of epigenesis he maintains that it is the blood which is the primal generative part and not as aristotle thought the heart  in the latter part of the seventeenth century the doctrine of epigenesis thus advocated by harvey was controverted on the ground of direct observation by malpighi who affirmed that the body of the chick is to be seen in the egg before the punctum sanguineum makes it appearance but from this perfectly correct observation a conclusion which is by no means warranted was drawn namely that the chick as a whole really exists in the egg antecedently to incubation and that what happens in the course of the latter process is no addition of new parts alias post alias natas as harvey puts it but a simple expansion or unfolding of the organs which already exist though they are too small and inconspicuous to be discovered the weight of malpighis observations therefore fell into the scale of that doctrine which harvey terms metamorphosis in contradistinction to epigenesis  the views of malpighi were warmly welcomed on philosophical grounds by leibnitz footnote cependant pour revenir aux formes ordinaires ou aux âmes matérielles cette durée quil leur faut attribuer à la place de celle quon avoit attribuée aux atomes pourroit faire douter si elles ne vont pas de corps en corps ce qui seroit la métempsychose à peu près comme quelques

while in the middle of the eighteenth century not only speculative considerations but a great number of new and interesting observations on the phenomena of generation led the ingenious bonnet and haller footnote the writer is indebted to dr allen thomson for reference to the evidence contained in a note to hallers edition of boerhaaves prælectiones academicæ vol v pt ii p 497 published in 1744 that haller originally advocated epigenesis the first physiologist of the age to adopt advocate and extend them  bonnet affirms that before fecundation the hens egg contains an excessively minute but complete chick and that fecundation and incubation simply cause this germ to absorb nutritious matters which are deposited in the interstices of the elementary structures of which the miniature chick or germ is made up the consequence of this intussusceptive growth is the development or evolution of the germ into the visible bird thus an organised individual tout organisé is a composite body consisting of the original or elementary parts and of the matters which have been associated with them by the aid of nutrition so that if these matters could be extracted from the individual tout it would so to speak become concentrated in a point and would thus be restored to its primitive condition of a germ just as by extracting from a bone the calcareous substance which is the source of its hardness it is reduced to its primitive state of gristle or membrane footnote considérations sur les corps organisés chap x evolution and development are for bonnet synonymous terms and since by evolution he means simply the expansion of that which was invisible into visibility he was naturally led to the conclusion at which leibnitz had arrived by a different line of reasoning that no such thing as generation in the proper sense of the word exists in nature the growth of an organic being is simply a process of enlargement as a particle of dry gelatine may be swelled up by the intussusception of water its death is a shrinkage such as the swelled jelly might undergo on desiccation nothing really new is produced in the living world but the germs which develop have existed since the beginning of things and nothing really dies but when what we call death takes place the living thing shrinks back into its germ state footnote bonnet had the courage of his opinions and in the palingénésie philosophique part vi chap iv he develops a hypothesis which he terms évolution naturelle and which making allowance for his peculiar views of the nature of generation bears no small resemblance to what is understood by evolution at the present day  si la volonté divine a créé par un seul acte luniversalité des êtres doù venoient ces plantes et ces animaux dont moyse nous decrit la production au troisieme et au cinquieme jour du renouvellement de notre monde  abuseroisje de la liberté de conjectures si je disois que les plantes et les animaux qui existent aujourdhui sont

naturaliste qui auroit été placé dans ce premier monde y auroit entièrement méconnu nos plantes et nos animaux  the two parts of bonnets hypothesis namely the doctrine that all living things proceed from preexisting germs and that these contain one inclosed within the other the germs of all future living things which is the hypothesis of emboîtement and the doctrine that every germ contains in miniature all the organs of the adult which is the hypothesis of evolution or development in the primary senses of these words must be carefully distinguished in fact while holding firmly by the former bonnet more or less modified the latter in his later writings and at length he admits that a germ need not be an actual miniature of the organism but that it may be merely an original preformation capable of producing the latter footnote ce mot germe ne désignera pas seulement un corps organisé réduit en petit il désignera encore toute espèce de préformation originelle dont un tout organique peut résulter comme de son principe immédiatpalingénésie philosophique part x chap ii  but thus defined the germ is neither more nor less than the particula genitalis of aristotle or the primordium vegetale or ovum of harvey and the evolution of such a germ would not be distinguishable from epigenesis  supported by the great authority of haller the doctrine of evolution or development prevailed throughout the whole of the eighteenth century and cuvier appears to have substantially adopted bonnets later views though probably he would not have gone all lengths in the direction of emboîtement in a wellknown note to laurillards Éloge prefixed to the last edition of the ossemens fossiles the radical de lêtre is much the same thing as aristotles particula genitalis and harveys ovum footnote m cuvier considérant que tous les êtres organisés sont dérivés de parens et ne voyant dans la nature aucune force capable de produire lorganisation croyait à la préexistence des germes

du radical de lêtre radical qui existe avant que la série des évolutions ne commence et qui remonte certainement suivant la belle observation de bonnet à plusieurs generationslaurillard Éloge de cuvier note 12  bonnets eminent contemporary buffon held nearly the same views with respect to the nature of the germ and expresses them even more confidently  ceux qui ont cru que le coeur étoit le premier formé se sont trompés ceux qui disent que cest le sang se trompent aussi tout est formé en même temps si lon ne consulte que lobservation le poulet se voit dans loeuf avant quil ait été couvé

and is thus the equivalent of bonnets germ footnote see particularly buffon l c p 41 as defined in the passage cited above but buffon further imagined that innumerable molecules organiques are dispersed throughout the world and that alimentation consists in the appropriation by the parts of an organism of those molecules which are analogous to them growth therefore was on this hypothesis a process partly of simple evolution and partly of what has been termed syngenesis buffons opinion is in fact a sort of combination of views essentially similar to those of bonnet with others somewhat similar to those of the medici whom harvey condemns the molecules organiques are physical equivalents of leibnitzs monads  it is a striking example of the difficulty of getting people to use their own powers of investigation accurately that this form of the doctrine of evolution should have held its ground so long for it was thoroughly and completely exploded not long after its enunciation by casper friederich wolff who in his theoria generationis published in 1759 placed the opposite theory of epigenesis upon the secure foundation of fact from which it has never been displaced but wolff had no immediate successors the school of cuvier was lamentably deficient in embryologists and it was only in the course of the first thirty years of the present century that prévost and dumas in france and later on döllinger pander von bär rathke and remak in germany founded modern embryology while at the same time they proved the utter incompatibility of the hypothesis of evolution as formulated by bonnet and haller with easily demonstrable facts  nevertheless though the conceptions originally denoted by evolution and development were shown to be untenable the words retained their application to the process by which the embryos of living beings gradually make their appearance and the terms development entwickelung and evolutio are now indiscriminately used for the series of genetic changes exhibited by living beings by writers who would emphatically deny that development or entwickelung or evolutio in the sense in which these words were usually employed by bonnet or by haller ever occurs  evolution or development is in fact at present employed in biology as a general name for the history of the steps by which any living being has acquired the morphological and the physiological characters which distinguish it as civil history may be divided into biography which is the history of individuals and universal history which is the history of the human race so evolution falls naturally into two categoriesthe evolution of the individual and the evolution of the sum of living beings it will be convenient to deal with the modern doctrine of evolution under these two heads  i the evolution of the individual  no exception is at this time known to the general law established upon an immense multitude of direct observations that every living thing is evolved from a particle of matter in which no trace of the distinctive characters of the adult form of that living thing is discernible this particle is termed a germ harvey footnote execitationes de generatione ex 62 ovum esse primordium commune omnibus animalibus says  omnibus viventibus primordium insit ex quo et a quo proveniant liceat hoc nobis primordium vegetale nominare nempe substantiam quandam corpoream vitam habentem potentiâ vel quoddam per se existens quod aptum sit in vegetativam formam ab interno principio operante mutari quale nempe primordium ovum est et plantarum semen tale etiam viviparorum conceptus et insectorum vermis ab aristotele dictus diversa scilicet diversorum viventium primordia  the definition of a germ as matter potentially alive and having within itself the tendency to assume a definite living form appears to meet all the requirements of modern science for notwithstanding it might be justly questioned whether a germ is not merely potentially but rather actually alive though its vital manifestations are reduced to a minimum the term potential may fairly be used in a sense broad enough to escape the objection and the qualification of potential has the advantage of reminding us that the great characteristic of the germ is not so much what it is but what it may under suitable conditions become harvey shared the belief of aristotlewhose writings he so often quotes and of whom he speaks as his precursor and model with the generous respect with which one genuine worker should regard anotherthat such germs may arise by a process of equivocal generation out of notliving matter and the aphorism so commonly ascribed to him omne vivum ex ovo and which is indeed a fair summary of his reiterated assertions though incessantly employed against the modern advocates of spontaneous generation can be honestly so used only by those who have never read a score of pages of the exercitationes harvey in fact believed as implicitly as aristotle did in the equivocal generation of the lower animals but while the course of modern investigation has only brought out into greater prominence the accuracy of harveys conception of the nature and mode of development of germs it has as distinctly tended to disprove the occurrence of equivocal generation or abiogenesis in the present course of nature in the immense majority of both plants and animals it is certain that the germ is not merely a body in which life is dormant or potential but that it is itself simply a detached portion of the substance of a preexisting living body and the evidence has yet to be adduced which will satisfy any cautious reasoner that omne vivum ex vivo is not as wellestablished a law of the existing course of nature as omne vivum ex ovo  in all instances which have yet been investigated the substance of this germ has a peculiar chemical composition consisting of at fewest four elementary bodies viz carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen united into the illdefined compound known as protein and associated with much water and very generally if not always with sulphur and phosphorus in minute proportions moreover up to the present time protein is known only as a product and constituent of living matter again a true germ is either devoid of any structure discernible by optical means or at most it is a simple nucleated cell footnote in some cases of sexless multiplication the germ is a cellaggregateif we call germ only that which is already detached from the parent organism  in all cases the process of evolution consists in a succession of changes of the form structure and functions of the germ by which it passes step by step from an extreme simplicity or relative homogeneity of visible structure to a greater or less degree of complexity or heterogeneity and the course of progressive differentiation is usually accompanied by growth which is effected by intussusception this intussusception however is a very different process from that imagined either by buffon or by bonnet the substance by the addition of which the germ is enlarged is in no case simply absorbed readymade from the notliving world and packed between the elementary constituents of the germ as bonnet imagined still less does it consist of the molecules organiques of buffon the new material is in great measure not only absorbed but assimilated so that it becomes part and parcel of the molecular structure of the living body into which it enters and so far from the fully developed organism being simply the germ plus the nutriment which it has absorbed it is probable that the adult contains neither in form nor in substance more than an inappreciable fraction of the constituents of the germ and that it is almost if not wholly made up of assimilated and metamorphosed nutriment in the great majority of cases at any rate the fullgrown organism becomes what it is by the absorption of notliving matter and its conversion into living matter of a specific type as harvey says ex 45 all parts of the body are nourished ab eodem succo alibili aliter aliterque cambiato ut plantæ omnes ex eodem communi nutrimento sive rore seu terræ humore  in all animals and plants above the lowest the germ is a nucleated cell using that term in its broadest sense and the first step in the process of the evolution of the individual is the division of this cell into two or more portions the process of division is repeated until the organism from being unicellular becomes multicellular the single cell becomes a cellaggregate and it is to the growth and metamorphosis of the cells of the cellaggregate thus produced that all the organs and tissues of the adult owe their origin  in certain animals belonging to every one of the chief groups into which the metazoa are divisible the cells of the cellaggregate which results from the process of yelkdivision and which is termed a morula diverge from one another in such a manner as to give rise to a central space around which they dispose themselves as a coat or envelope and thus the morula becomes a vesicle filled with fluid the planula the wall of the planula is next pushed in on one side or invaginated whereby it is converted into a doublewalled sac with an opening the blastopore which leads into the cavity lined by the inner wall this cavity is the primitive alimentary cavity or archenteron the inner or invaginated layer is the hypoblast the outer the epiblast and the embryo in this stage is termed a gastrula in all the higher animals a layer of cells makes its appearance between the hypoblast and the epiblast and is termed the mesoblast in the further course of development the epiblast becomes the ectoderm or epidermic layer of the body the hypoblast becomes the epithelium of the middle portion of the alimentary canal and the mesoblast gives rise to all the other tissues except the central nervous system which originates from an ingrowth of the epiblast  with more or less modification in detail the embryo has been observed to pass through these successive evolutional stages in sundry sponges coelenterates worms echinoderms tunicates arthropods mollusks and vertebrates and there are valid reasons for the belief that all animals of higher organisation than the protozoa agree in the general character of the early stages of their individual evolution each starting from the condition of a simple nucleated cell becomes a cellaggregate and this passes through a condition which represents the gastrula stage before taking on the features distinctive of the group to which it belongs stated in this form the gastræa theory of haeckel appears to the present writer to be one of most important and best founded of recent generalisations so far as individual plants and animals are concerned therefore evolution is not a speculation but a fact and it takes place by epigenesis  animalper epigenesin procreatur materiam simul attrahit parat concoquit et eâdem utitur formatur simul et augetur  primum futuri corporis concrementum  prout augetur dividitur sensim et distinguitur in partes non simul omnes sed alias post alias natas et ordine quasque suo emergentes footnote harvey exercitationes de generatione ex 45 quænam sit pulli materia et quomodo fiat in ovo in these words by the divination of genius harvey in the seventeenth century summed up the outcome of the work of all those who with appliances he could not dream of are continuing his labours in the nineteenth century  nevertheless though the doctrine of epigenesis as understood by harvey has definitively triumphed over the doctrine of evolution as understood by his opponents of the eighteenth century it is not impossible that when the analysis of the process of development is carried still further and the origin of the molecular components of the physically gross though sensibly minute bodies which we term germs is traced the theory of development will approach more nearly to metamorphosis than to epigenesis harvey thought that impregnation influenced the female organism as a contagion and that the blood which he conceived to be the first rudiment of the germ arose in the clear fluid of the colliquamentum of the ovum by a process of concrescence as a sort of living precipitate we now know on the contrary that the female germ or ovum in all the higher animals and plants is a body which possesses the structure of a nucleated cell that impregnation consists in the fusion of the substance footnote at any rate of the nuclei of the two germcells 1893 of another more or less modified nucleated cell the male germ with the ovum and that the structural components of the body of the embryo are all derived by a process of division from the coalesced male and female germs hence it is conceivable and indeed probable that every part of the adult contains molecules derived both from the male and from the female parent and that regarded as a mass of molecules the entire organism may he compared to a web of which the warp is derived from the female and the woof from the male and each of these may constitute one individuality in the same sense as the whole organism is one individual although the matter of the organism has been constantly changing the primitive male and female molecules may play the part of buffons moules organiques and mould the assimilated nutriment each according to its own type into innumerable new molecules from this point of view the process which in its superficial aspect is epigenesis appears in essence to be evolution in the modified sense adopted in bonnets later writings and development is merely the expansion of a potential organism or original preformation according to fixed laws  ii the evolution of the sum of living beings  the notion that all the kinds of animals and plants may have come into existence by the growth and modification of primordial germs is as old as speculative thought but the modern scientific form of the doctrine can be traced historically to the influence of several converging lines of philosophical speculation and of physical observation none of which go farther back than the seventeenth century these are  1 the enunciation by descartes of the conception that the physical universe whether living or not living is a mechanism and that as such it is explicable on physical principles  2 the observation of the gradations of structure from extreme simplicity to very great complexity presented by living things and of the relation of these graduated forms to one another  3 the observation of the existence of an analogy between the series of gradations presented by the species which compose any great group of animals or plants and the series of embryonic conditions of the highest members of that group  4 the observation that large groups of species of widely different habits present the same fundamental plan of structure and that parts of the same animal or plant the functions of which are very different likewise exhibit modifications of a common plan  5 the observation of the existence of structures in a rudimentary and apparently useless condition in one species of a group which are fully developed and have definite functions in other species of the same group  6 the observation of the effects of varying conditions in modifying living organisms  7 the observation of the facts of geographical distribution  8 the observation of the facts of the geological succession of the forms of life  1 notwithstanding the elaborate disguise which fear of the powers that were led descartes to throw over his real opinions it is impossible to read the principes de la philosophie without acquiring the conviction that this great philosopher held that the physical world and all things in it whether living or not living have originated by a process of evolution due to the continuous operation of purely physical causes out of a primitive relatively formless matter footnote as buffon has well saidlidée de ramener lexplication de tous les phénomènes à des principes mecaniques est assurement grande et belle ce pas est le plus hardi quon peut faire en philosophie et cest descartes qui la faitl c p 50  the following passage is especially instructive  et tant sen faut que je veuille que lon croie toutes les choses que jécrirai que même je pretends en proposer ici quelques unes que je crois absolument être fausses à savoir je ne doute point quo le monde nait été créé au commencement avec autant de perfection quil eu a en sorte que le soleil la terre la lune et les étoiles ont été dès lors et que la terre na pas eu seulement en soi les semences des plantes mais que les plantes même en ont couvert une partie et qu adam et eve nont pas été créés enfans mais en âge dhommes parfaits la religion chrétienne veut que nous le croyons ainsi et la raison naturelle nous persuade entièrement cette vérité car si nous considérons la toute puissance de dieu nous devons juger que tout ce quil a fait a eu dès le commencement toute la perfection quil devoit avoir mais néanmoins comme on connôitroit beaucoup mieux quelle a été la nature dadam et celle des arbres de paradis si on avoit examiné comment les enfants se forment peu à peu dans le ventre de leurs mères et comment les plantes sortent de leurs semences que si on avoit seulement considéré quels ils ont été quand dieu les a créés tout de même nous ferons mieux entendre quelle est généralement la nature de toutes les choses qui sont au monde si nous pouvons imaginer quelques principes qui soient fort intelligibles et fort simples desquels nous puissions voir clairement que les astres et la terre et enfin tout ce monde visible auroit pu être produit ainsi que de quelques semences bien que nous sachions quil na pas été produit en cette façon que si nous la decrivions seulement comme il est ou bien comme nous croyons quil a été créé et parceque je pense avoir trouvé des principes qui sont tels je tacherai ici de les expliquer footnote principes de la philosophie troisième partie § 45  if we read between the lines of this singular exhibition of force of one kind and weakness of another it is clear that descartes believed that he had divined the mode in which the physical universe had been evolved and the traité de lhomme and the essay sur les passions afford abundant additional evidence that he sought for and thought he had found an explanation of the phenomena of physical life by deduction from purely physical laws  spinoza abounds in the same sense and is as usual perfectly candid  naturæ leges et regulæ secundum quas omnia fiunt et ex unis formis in alias mutantur sunt ubique et semper eadem footnote ethices pars tertia præfatio leibnitzs doctrine of continuity necessarily led him in the same direction and of the infinite multitude of monads with which he peopled the world each is supposed to be the focus of an endless process of evolution and involution in the protogæa xxvi leibnitz distinctly suggests the mutability of species  alii mirantur in saxis passim species videri quas vel in orbe cognito vel saltem in vicinis locis frustra quæras ita cornua ammonis quæ ex nautilorum numero habeantur passim et forma et magnitudine nam et pedali diametro aliquando reperiuntur ab omnibus illis naturis discrepare dicunt quas præbet mare sed quis absconditos ejus recessus aut subterraneas abyssos pervestigavit quam multa nobis animalia antea ignota offert novus orbis et credibile est per magnas illas conversiones etiam animalium species plurimum immutatas  thus in the end of the seventeenth century the seed was sown which has at intervals brought forth recurrent crops of evolutional hypotheses based more or less completely on general reasonings  among the earliest of these speculations is that put forward by benoit de maillet in his telliamed which though printed in 1735 was not published until twentythree years later considering that this book was written before the time of haller or bonnet or linnæus or hutton it surely deserves more respectful consideration than it usually receives for de maillet not only has a definite conception of the plasticity of living things and of the production of existing species by the modification of their predecessors but he clearly apprehends the cardinal maxim of modern geological science that the explanation of the structure of the globe is to be sought in the deductive application to geological phenomena of the principles established inductively by the study of the present course of nature somewhat later maupertuis footnote système de la nature essai sur la formation des corps organisés 1751 xiv suggested a curious hypothesis as to the causes of variation which he thinks may be sufficient to account for the origin of all animals from a single pair robinet footnote considérations philosophiques sur la gradation naturelle des formes de lêtre ou les essais de la nature qui apprend a faire lhomme 1768 followed out much the same line of thought as de maillet but less soberly and bonnets speculations in the palingénésie which appeared in 1769 have already been mentioned buffon 17531778 at first a partisan of the absolute immutability of species subsequently appears to have believed that larger or smaller groups of species have been produced by the modification of a primitive stock but he contributed nothing to the general doctrine of evolution  erasmus darwin zoonomia 1794 though a zealous evolutionist can hardly be said to have made any real advance on his predecessors and notwithstanding that goethe 17914 had the advantage of a wide knowledge of morphological facts and a true insight into their signification while he threw all the power of a great poet into the expression of his conceptions it may be questioned whether he supplied the doctrine of evolution with a firmer scientific basis than it already possessed moreover whatever the value of goethes labours in that field they were not published before 1820 long after evolutionism had taken a new departure from the works of treviranus and lamarckthe first of its advocates who were equipped for their task with the needful large and accurate knowledge of the phenomena of life as a whole it is remarkable that each of these writers seems to have been led independently and contemporaneously to invent the same name of biology for the science of the phenomena of life and thus following buffon to have recognised the essential unity of these phenomena and their contradistinction from those of inanimate nature and it is hard to say whether lamarck or treviranus has the priority in propounding the main thesis of the doctrine of evolution for though the first volume of treviranuss biologie appeared only in 1802 he says in the preface to his later work the erscheinungen und gesetze des organischen lebens dated 1831 that he wrote the first volume of the biologie nearly fiveandthirty years ago or about 1796  now in 1794 there is evidence that lamarck held doctrines which present a striking contrast to those which are to be found in the philosophie zoologique as the following passages show  685 quoique mon unique objet dans cet article nait été que de traiter de la cause physique de lentretien de la vie des êtres organiques malgré cela jai osé avancer en débutant que lexistence de ces êtres étonnants nappartiennent nullement à la nature que tout ce quon peut entendre par le mot nature ne pouvoit donner la vie cestàdire que toutes les qualités de la matière jointes à toutes les circonstances possibles et même à lactivité répandue dans lunivers ne pouvaient point produire un être muni du mouvement organique capable de reproduire son semblable et sujet à la mort  686 tous les individus de cette nature qui existent proviennent dindividus semblables qui tous ensemble constituent lespèce entière or je crois quil est aussi impossible à lhomme de connôitre la cause physique du premier individu de chaque espèce que dassigner aussi physiquement la cause de lexistence de la matière ou de lunivers entier cest au moins ce que le résultat de mes connaissances et de mes réflexions me portent à penser sil existe beaucoup de variétés produites par leffet des circonstances ces variétés ne denaturent point les espèces mais on se trompe sans doute souvent en indiquant comme espèce ce qui nest que variété et alors je sens que cette erreur peut tirer à conséquence dans les raisonnements que lon fait sur cette matière footnote recherches sur les causes des principaux faits physiques par jb lamarck paris seconde année de la république in the preface lamarck says that the work was written in 1776 and presented to the academy in 1780 but it was not published before 17994 and at that time it presumably expressed lamarcks mature views it would be interesting to know what brought about the change of opinion manifested in the recherches sur lorganisation des corps vivants published only seven years later  the first three volumes of treviranuss biologie which contain his general views of evolution appeared between 1802 and 1805 the recherches sur lorganisation des corps vivants in which the outlines of lamarcks doctrines are given was published in 1802 but the full development of his views in the philosophie zoologique did not take place until 1809  the biologie and the philosophie zoologique are both very remarkable productions and are still worthy of attentive study but they fell upon evil times the vast authority of cuvier was employed in support of the traditionally respectable hypotheses of special creation and of catastrophism and the wild speculations of the discours sur les révolutions de la surface du globe were held to be models of sound scientific thinking while the really much more sober and philosophical hypotheses of the hydrogeologie were scouted for many years it was the fashion to speak of lamarck with ridicule while treviranus was altogether ignored  nevertheless the work had been done the conception of evolution was henceforward irrepressible and it incessantly reappears in one shape or another footnote see the historical sketch prefixed to the last edition of the origin of species up to the year 1858 when mr darwin and mr wallace published their theory of natural selection the origin of species appeared in 1859 and it is within the knowledge of all whose memories go back to that time that henceforward the doctrine of evolution has assumed a position and acquired an importance which it never before possessed in the origin of species and in his other numerous and important contributions to the solution of the problem of biological evolution mr darwin confines himself to the discussion of the causes which have brought about the present condition of living matter assuming such matter to have once come into existence on the other hand mr spencer footnote first principles and principles of biology 18601864 and professor haeckel footnote generelle marphologie 1866 have dealt with the whole problem of evolution the profound and vigorous writings of mr spencer embody the spirit of descartes in the knowledge of our own day and may be regarded as the principes de la philosophie of the nineteenth century while whatever hesitation may not unfrequently be felt by less daring minds in following haeckel in many of his speculations his attempt to systematise the doctrine of evolution and to exhibit its influence as the central thought of modern biology cannot fail to have a farreaching influence on the progress of science  if we seek for the reason of the difference between the scientific position of the doctrine of evolution a century ago and that which it occupies now we shall find it in the great accumulation of facts the several classes of which have been enumerated above under the second to the eighth heads for those which are grouped under the second to the seventh of these classes respectively have a clear significance on the hypothesis of evolution while they are unintelligible if that hypothesis be denied and those of the eighth group are not only unintelligible without the assumption of evolution but can be proved never to be discordant with that hypothesis while in some cases they are exactly such as the hypothesis requires the demonstration of these assertions would require a volume but the general nature of the evidence on which they rest may be briefly indicated  2 the accurate investigation of the lowest forms of animal life commenced by leeuwenhoek and swammerdam and continued by the remarkable labours of reaumur trembley bonnet and a host of other observers in the latter part of the seventeenth and the first half of the eighteenth centuries drew the attention of biologists to the gradation in the complexity of organisation which is presented by living beings and culminated in the doctrine of the échelle des êtres so powerfully and clearly stated by bonnet and before him adumbrated by locke and by leibnitz in the then state of knowledge it appeared that all the species of animals and plants could be arranged in one series in such a manner that by insensible gradations the mineral passed into the plant the plant into the polype the polype into the worm and so through gradually higher forms of life to man at the summit of the animated world  but as knowledge advanced this conception ceased to be tenable in the crude form in which it was first put forward taking into account existing animals and plants alone it became obvious that they fell into groups which were more or less sharply separated from one another and moreover that even the species of a genus can hardly ever be arranged in linear series their natural resemblances and differences are only to be expressed by disposing them as if they were branches springing from a common hypothetical centre  lamarck while affirming the verbal proposition that animals form a single series was forced by his vast acquaintance with the details of zoology to limit the assertion to such a series as may be formed out of the abstractions constituted by the common characters of each group footnote il sagit donc de prouver que la série qui constitue léchelle animale réside essentiellement dans la distribution des masses principales qui la composent et non dans celle des espèces ni même toujours dans celle des genresphilosophie zoologique chap v  cuvier on anatomical and von baer on embryological grounds made the further step of proving that even in this limited sense animals cannot be arranged in a single series but that there are several distinct plans of organisation to be observed among them no one of which in its highest and most complicated modification leads to any of the others  the conclusions enunciated by cuvier and von baer have been confirmed in principle by all subsequent research into the structure of animals and plants but the effect of the adoption of these conclusions has been rather to substitute a new metaphor for that of bonnet than to abolish the conception expressed by it instead of regarding living things as capable of arrangement in one series like the steps of a ladder the results of modern investigation compel us to dispose them as if they were the twigs and branches of a tree the ends of the twigs represent individuals the smallest groups of twigs species larger groups genera and so on until we arrive at the source of all these ramifications of the main branch which is represented by a common plan of structure at the present moment it is impossible to draw up any definition based on broad anatomical or developmental characters by which any one of cuviers great groups shall be separated from all the rest on the contrary the lower members of each tend to converge towards the lower members of all the others the same may be said of the vegetable world the apparently clear distinction between flowering and flowerless plants has been broken down by the series of gradations between the two exhibited by the lycopodiaceæ rhizocarpeæ and gymnospermeæ the groups of fungi lichenes and algæ have completely run into one another and when the lowest forms of each are alone considered even the animal and vegetable kingdoms cease to have a definite frontier  if it is permissible to speak of the relations of living forms to one another metaphorically the similitude chosen must undoubtedly be that of a common root whence two main trunks one representing the vegetable and one the animal world spring and each dividing into a few main branches these subdivide into multitudes of branchlets and these into smaller groups of twigs  as lamarck has well saidfootnote philosophie zoologique première partie chap iii il ny a que ceux qui se sont longtemps et fortement occupés de la détermination des espèces et qui ont consulté de riches collections qui peuvent savoir jusquà quel point les espèces parmi les corps vivants se fondent les unes dans les autres et qui ont pu se convaincre que dans les parties où nous voyons des espèces isolès cela nest ainsi que parcequil nous en manque dautres qui en sont plus voisines et que nous navons pas encore recueillies  je ne veux pas dire pour cela que les animaux qui existent forment une série trèssimple et partout également nuancée mais je dis quils forment une série ramense irréguliérement graduée et qui na point de discontinuité dans ses parties ou qui du moins nen a toujours pas eu sil est vrai que par suite de quelques espèces perdues il sen trouve quelque part il en resulte que les espèces qui terminent chaque rameau de la série générale tiennent au moins dun côté à dautres espèces voisines qui se nuancent avec elles voilà ce que létat bien connu des choses me met maintenant à portée de demontrer je nai besoin daucune hypothèse ni daucune supposition pour cela jen atteste tous les naturalistes observateurs  3 in a remarkable essay footnote entwurf einer darstellung der zwischen dem embryozustände der höheren thiere und dem permanenten der niederen stattfindenden parallele beyträge zur vergleichenden anatomie bd ii 1811 meckel remarks  there is no good physiologist who has not been struck by the observation that the original form of all organisms is one and the same and that out of this one form all the lowest as well as the highest are developed in such a manner that the latter pass through the permanent forms of the former as transitory stages aristotle haller harvey kielmeyer autenrieth and many others have either made this observation incidentally or especially the latter have drawn particular attention to it and deduced therefrom results of permanent importance for physiology  meckel proceeds to exemplify the thesis that the lower forms of animals represent stages in the course of the development of the higher with a large series of illustrations  after comparing the salamanders and the perennibranchiate urodela with the tadpoles and the frogs and enunciating the law that the more highly any animal is organised the more quickly does it pass through the lower stages meckel goes on to say  from these lowest vertebrata to the highest and to the highest forms among these the comparison between the embryonic conditions of the higher animals and the adult states of the lower can be more completely and thoroughly instituted than if the survey is extended to the invertebrata inasmuch as the latter are in many respects constructed upon an altogether too dissimilar type indeed they often differ from one another far more than the lowest vertebrate does from the highest mammal yet the following pages will show that the comparison may also be extended to them with interest in fact there is a period when as aristotle long ago said the embryo of the highest animal has the form of a mere worm and devoid of internal and external organisation is merely an almost structureless lump of polype substance notwithstanding the origin of organs it still for a certain time by reason of its want of an internal bony skeleton remains worm and mollusk and only later enters into the series of the vertebrata although traces of the vertebral column even in the earliest periods testify its claim to a place in that seriesop cit pp 4 5  if meckels proposition is so far qualified that the comparison of adult with embryonic forms is restricted within the limits of one type of organisation and if it is further recollected that the resemblance between the permanent lower form and the embryonic stage of a higher form is not special but general it is in entire accordance with modern embryology although there is no branch of biology which has grown so largely and improved its methods so much since meckels time as this in its original form the doctrine of arrest of development as advocated by geoffroy sainthilaire and serres was no doubt an overstatement of the case it is not true for example that a fish is a reptile arrested in its development or that a reptile was ever a fish but it is true that the reptile embryo at one stage of its development is an organism which if it had an independent existence must be classified among fishes and all the organs of the reptile pass in the course of their development through conditions which are closely analogous to those which are permanent in some fishes  4 that branch of biology which is termed morphology is a commentary upon and expansion of the proposition that widely different animals or plants and widely different parts of animals or plants are constructed upon the same plan from the rough comparison of the skeleton of a bird with that of a man by belon in the sixteenth century to go no farther back down to the theory of the limbs and the theory of the skull at the present day or from the first demonstration of the homologies of the parts of a flower by c f wolff to the present elaborate analysis of the floral organs morphology exhibits a continual advance towards the demonstration of a fundamental unity among the seeming diversities of living structures and this demonstration has been completed by the final establishment of the cell theory which involves the admission of a primitive conformity not only of all the elementary structures in animals and plants respectively but of those in the one of these great divisions of living things with those in the other no à priori difficulty can be said to stand in the way of evolution when it can be shown that all animals and all plants proceed by modes of development which are similar in principle from a fundamental protoplasmic material  5 the innumerable cases of structures which are rudimentary and apparently useless in species the close allies of which possess welldeveloped and functionally important homologous structures are readily intelligible on the theory of evolution while it is hard to conceive their raison dêtre on any other hypothesis however a cautious reasoner will probably rather explain such cases deductively from the doctrine of evolution than endeavour to support the doctrine of evolution by them for it is almost impossible to prove that any structure however rudimentary is uselessthat is to say that it plays no part whatever in the economy and if it is in the slightest degree useful there is no reason why on the hypothesis of direct creation it should not have been created nevertheless doubleedged as is the argument from rudimentary organs there is probably none which has produced a greater effect in promoting the general acceptance of the theory of evolution  6 the older advocates of evolution sought for the causes of the process exclusively in the influence of varying conditions such as climate and station or hybridisation upon living forms even treviranus has got no farther than this point lamarck introduced the conception of the action of an animal on itself as a factor in producing modification starting from the wellknown fact that the habitual use of a limb tends to develop the muscles of the limb and to produce a greater and greater facility in using it he made the general assumption that the effort of an animal to exert an organ in a given direction tends to develop the organ in that direction but a little consideration showed that though lamarck had seized what as far it goes is a true cause of modification it is a cause the actual effects of which are wholly inadequate to account for any considerable modification in animals and which can have no influence at all in the vegetable world and probably nothing contributed so much to discredit evolution in the early part of this century as the floods of easy ridicule which were poured upon this part of lamarcks speculation the theory of natural selection or survival of the fittest was suggested by wells in 1813 and further elaborated by matthew in 1831 but the pregnant suggestions of these writers remained practically unnoticed and forgotten until the theory was independently devised and promulgated by darwin and wallace in 1858 and the effect of its publication was immediate and profound  those who were unwilling to accept evolution without better grounds than such as are offered by lamarck or the author of that particularly unsatisfactory book the vestiges of the natural history of the creation and who therefore preferred to suspend their judgment on the question found in the principle of selective breeding pursued in all its applications with marvellous knowledge and skill by mr darwin a valid explanation of the occurrence of varieties and races and they saw clearly that if the explanation would apply to species it would not only solve the problem of their evolution but that it would account for the facts of teleology as well as for those of morphology and for the persistence of some forms of life unchanged through long epochs of time while others undergo comparatively rapid metamorphosis  how far natural selection suffices for the production of species remains to be seen few can doubt that if not the whole cause it is a very important factor in that operation and that it must play a great part in the sorting out of varieties into those which are transitory and those which are permanent  but the causes and conditions of variation have yet to be thoroughly explored and the importance of natural selection will not be impaired even if further inquiries should prove that variability is definite and is determined in certain directions rather than in others by conditions inherent in that which varies it is quite conceivable that every species tends to produce varieties of a limited number and kind and that the effect of natural selection is to favour the development of some of these while it opposes the development of others along their predetermined lines of modification  7 no truths brought to light by biological investigation were better calculated to inspire distrust of the dogmas intruded upon science in the name of theology than those which relate to the distribution of animals and plants on the surface of the earth very skilful accommodation was needful if the limitation of sloths to south america and of the ornithorhynchus to australia was to be reconciled with the literal interpretation of the history of the deluge and with the establishment of the existence of distinct provinces of distribution any serious belief in the peopling of the world by migration from mount ararat came to an end  under these circumstances only one alternative was left for those who denied the occurrence of evolutionnamely the supposition that the characteristic animals and plants of each great province were created as such within the limits in which we find them and as the hypothesis of specific centres thus formulated was heterodox from the theological point of view and unintelligible under its scientific aspect it may be passed over without further notice as a phase of transition from the creational to the evolutional hypothesis  8 in fact the strongest and most conclusive arguments in favour of evolution are those which are based upon the facts of geographical taken in conjunction with those of geological distribution  both mr darwin and mr wallace lay great stress on the close relation which obtains between the existing fauna of any region and that of the immediately antecedent geological epoch in the same region and rightly for it is in truth inconceivable that there should be no genetic connection between the two it is possible to put into words the proposition that all the animals and plants of each geological epoch were annihilated and that a new set of very similar forms was created for the next epoch but it may be doubted if any one who ever tried to form a distinct mental image of this process of spontaneous generation on the grandest scale ever really succeeded in realising it  within the last twenty years the attention of the best palæontologists has been withdrawn from the hodmans work of making new species of fossils to the scientific task of completing our knowledge of individual species and tracing out the succession of the forms presented by any given type in time  those who desire to inform themselves of the nature and extent of the evidence bearing on these questions may consult the works of rütimeyer gaudry kowalewsky marsh and the writer of the present article it must suffice in this place to say that the successive forms of the equine type have been fully worked out while those of nearly all the other existing types of ungulate mammals and of the carnivora have been almost as closely followed through the tertiary deposits the gradations between birds and reptiles have been traced and the modifications undergone by the crocodilia from the triassic epoch to the present day have been demonstrated on the evidence of palæontology the evolution of many existing forms of animal life from their predecessors is no longer an hypothesis but an historical fact it is only the nature of the physiological factors to which that evolution is due which is still open to discussion  at page 209 the reference to erasmus darwin does not do justice to that ingenious writer who in the 39th section of the zoonomia clearly and repeatedly enunciates the theory of the inheritance of acquired modifications for example from their first rudiment or primordium to the termination of their lives all animals undergo perpetual transformations which are in part produced by their own exertions in consequence of their desires and aversions of their pleasures and their pains or of irritation or of associations and many of these acquired forms or propensities are transmitted to their posterity zoonomia i p 506 1893    vii  the coming of age of the origin of species  1880   many of you will be familiar with the aspect of this small greencovered book it is a copy of the first edition of the origin of species and bears the date of its productionthe 1st of october 1859 only a few months therefore are needed to complete the full tale of twentyone years since its birthday  those whose memories carry them back to this time will remember that the infant was remarkably lively and that a great number of excellent persons mistook its manifestations of a vigorous individuality for mere naughtiness in fact there was a very pretty turmoil about its cradle my recollections of the period are particularly vivid for having conceived a tender affection for a child of what appeared to me to be such remarkable promise i acted for some time in the capacity of a sort of undernurse and thus came in for my share of the storms which threatened the very life of the young creature for some years it was undoubtedly warm work but considering how exceedingly unpleasant the apparition of the newcomer must have been to those who did not fall in love with him at first sight i think it is to the credit of our age that the war was not fiercer and that the more bitter and unscrupulous forms of opposition died away as soon as they did  i speak of this period as of something past and gone possessing merely an historical i had almost said an antiquarian interest for during the second decade of the existence of the origin of species opposition though by no means dead assumed a different aspect on the part of all those who had any reason to respect themselves it assumed a thoroughly respectful character by this time the dullest began to perceive that the child was not likely to perish of any congenital weakness or infantile disorder but was growing into a stalwart personage upon whom mere goody scoldings and threatenings with the birchrod were quite thrown away  in fact those who have watched the progress of science within the last ten years will bear me out to the full when i assert that there is no field of biological inquiry in which the influence of the origin of species is not traceable the foremost men of science in every country are either avowed champions of its leading doctrines or at any rate abstain from opposing them a host of young and ardent investigators seek for and find inspiration and guidance in mr darwins great work and the general doctrine of evolution to one side of which it gives expression obtains in the phenomena of biology a firm base of operations whence it may conduct its conquest of the whole realm of nature  history warns us however that it is the customary fate of new truths to begin as heresies and to end as superstitions and as matters now stand it is hardly rash to anticipate that in another twenty years the new generation educated under the influences of the present day will be in danger of accepting the main doctrines of the origin of species with as little reflection and it may be with as little justification as so many of our contemporaries twenty years ago rejected them  against any such a consummation let us all devoutly pray for the scientific spirit is of more value than its products and irrationally held truths may be more harmful than reasoned errors now the essence of the scientific spirit is criticism it tells us that whenever a doctrine claims our assent we should reply take it if you can compel it the struggle for existence holds as much in the intellectual as in the physical world a theory is a species of thinking and its right to exist is coextensive with its power of resisting extinction by its rivals  from this point of view it appears to me that it would be but a poor way of celebrating the coming of age of the origin of species were i merely to dwell upon the facts undoubted and remarkable as they are of its farreaching influence and of the great following of ardent disciples who are occupied in spreading and developing its doctrines mere insanities and inanities have before now swollen to portentous size in the course of twenty years let us rather ask this prodigious change in opinion to justify itself let us inquire whether anything has happened since 1859 which will explain on rational grounds why so many are worshipping that which they burned and burning that which they worshipped it is only in this way that we shall acquire the means of judging whether the movement we have witnessed is a mere eddy of fashion or truly one with the irreversible current of intellectual progress and like it safe from retrogressive reaction  every belief is the product of two factors the first is the state of the mind to which the evidence in favour of that belief is presented and the second is the logical cogency of the evidence itself in both these respects the history of biological science during the last twenty years appears to me to afford an ample explanation of the change which has taken place and a brief consideration of the salient events of that history will enable us to understand why if the origin of species appeared now it would meet with a very different reception from that which greeted it in 1859  oneandtwenty years ago in spite of the work commenced by hutton and continued with rare skill and patience by lyell the dominant view of the past history of the earth was catastrophic great and sudden physical revolutions wholesale creations and extinctions of living beings were the ordinary machinery of the geological epic brought into fashion by the misapplied genius of cuvier it was gravely maintained and taught that the end of every geological epoch was signalised by a cataclysm by which every living being on the globe was swept away to be replaced by a brandnew creation when the world returned to quiescence a scheme of nature which appeared to be modelled on the likeness of a succession of rubbers of whist at the end of each of which the players upset the table and called for a new pack did not seem to shock anybody  i may be wrong but i doubt if at the present time there is a single responsible representative of these opinions left the progress of scientific geology has elevated the fundamental principle of uniformitarianism that the explanation of the past is to be sought in the study of the present into the position of an axiom and the wild speculations of the catastrophists to which we all listened with respect a quarter of a century ago would hardly find a single patient hearer at the present day no physical geologist now dreams of seeking outside the range of known natural causes for the explanation of anything that happened millions of years ago any more than he would be guilty of the like absurdity in regard to current events  the effect of this change of opinion upon biological speculation is obvious for if there have been no periodical general physical catastrophes what brought about the assumed general extinctions and recreations of life which are the corresponding biological catastrophes and if no such interruptions of the ordinary course of nature have taken place in the organic any more than in the inorganic world what alternative is there to the admission of evolution  the doctrine of evolution in biology is the necessary result of the logical application of the principles of uniformitarianism to the phenomena of life darwin is the natural successor of hutton and lyell and the origin of species the logical sequence of the principles of geology  the fundamental doctrine of the origin of species as of all forms of the theory of evolution applied to biology is that the innumerable species genera and families of organic beings with which the world is peopled have all descended each within its own class or group from common parents and have all been modified in the course of descent footnote origin of species ed i p 457  and in view of the facts of geology it follows that all living animals and plants are the lineal descendants of those which lived long before the silurian epoch footnote origin of species p 458  it is an obvious consequence of this theory of descent with modification as it is sometimes called that all plants and animals however different they may now be must at one time or other have been connected by direct or indirect intermediate gradations and that the appearance of isolation presented by various groups of organic beings must be unreal  no part of mr darwins work ran more directly counter to the prepossessions of naturalists twenty years ago than this and such prepossessions were very excusable for there was undoubtedly a great deal to be said at that time in favour of the fixity of species and of the existence of great breaks which there was no obvious or probable means of filling up between various groups of organic beings  for various reasons scientific and unscientific much had been made of the hiatus between man and the rest of the higher mammalia and it is no wonder that issue was first joined on this part of the controversy i have no wish to revive past and happily forgotten controversies but i must state the simple fact that the distinctions in the cerebral and other characters which were so hotly affirmed to separate man from all other animals in 1860 have all been demonstrated to be nonexistent and that the contrary doctrine is now universally accepted and taught  but there were other cases in which the wide structural gaps asserted to exist between one group of animals and another were by no means fictitious and when such structural breaks were real mr darwin could account for them only by supposing that the intermediate forms which once existed had become extinct in a remarkable passage he says  we may thus account even for the distinctness of whole classes from each otherfor instance of birds from all other vertebrate animalsby the belief that many animal forms of life have been utterly lost through which the early progenitors of birds were formerly connected with the early progenitors of the other vertebrate classes footnote origin of species p 431 adverse criticism made merry over such suggestions as these of course it was easy to get out of the difficulty by supposing extinction but where was the slightest evidence that such intermediate forms between birds and reptiles as the hypothesis required ever existed and then probably followed a tirade upon this terrible forsaking of the paths of baconian induction  but the progress of knowledge has justified mr darwin to an extent which could hardly have been anticipated in 1862 the specimen of archæopteryx which until the last two or three years has remained unique was discovered and it is an animal which in its feathers and the greater part of its organisation is a veritable bird while in other parts it is as distinctly reptilian  in 1868 i had the honour of bringing under your notice in this theatre the results of investigations made up to that time into the anatomical characters of certain ancient reptiles which showed the nature of the modifications in virtue of which the type of the quadrupedal reptile passed into that of a bipedal bird and abundant confirmatory evidence of the justice of the conclusions which i then laid before you has since come to light  in 1875 the discovery of the toothed birds of the cretaceous formation in north america by professor marsh completed the series of transitional forms between birds and reptiles and removed mr darwins proposition that many animal forms of life have been utterly lost through which the early progenitors of birds were formerly connected with the early progenitors of the other vertebrate classes from the region of hypothesis to that of demonstrable fact  in 1859 there appeared to be a very sharp and clear hiatus between vertebrated and invertebrated animals not only in their structure but what was more important in their development i do not think that we even yet know the precise links of connection between the two but the investigations of kowalewsky and others upon the development of amphioxus and of the tunicata prove beyond a doubt that the differences which were supposed to constitute a barrier between the two are nonexistent there is no longer any difficulty in understanding how the vertebrate type may have arisen from the invertebrate though the full proof of the manner in which the transition was actually effected may still be lacking  again in 1859 there appeared to be a no less sharp separation between the two great groups of flowering and flowerless plants it is only subsequently that the series of remarkable investigations inaugurated by hofmeister has brought to light the extraordinary and altogether unexpected modifications of the reproductive apparatus in the lycopodiaceæ the rhizocarpeæ and the gymnospermeæ by which the ferns and the mosses are gradually connected with the phanerogamic division of the vegetable world  so again it is only since 1859 that we have acquired that wealth of knowledge of the lowest forms of life which demonstrates the futility of any attempt to separate the lowest plants from the lowest animals and shows that the two kingdoms of living nature have a common borderland which belongs to both or to neither  thus it will be observed that the whole tendency of biological investigation since 1859 has been in the direction of removing the difficulties which the apparent breaks in the series created at that time and the recognition of gradation is the first step towards the acceptance of evolution  as another great factor in bringing about the change of opinion which has taken place among naturalists i count the astonishing progress which has been made in the study of embryology twenty years ago not only were we devoid of any accurate knowledge of the mode of development of many groups of animals and plants but the methods of investigation were rude and imperfect at the present time there is no important group of organic beings the development of which has not been carefully studied and the modern methods of hardening and sectionmaking enable the embryologist to determine the nature of the process in each case with a degree of minuteness and accuracy which is truly astonishing to those whose memories carry them back to the beginnings of modern histology and the results of these embryological investigations are in complete harmony with the requirements of the doctrine of evolution the first beginnings of all the higher forms of animal life are similar and however diverse their adult conditions they start from a common foundation moreover the process of development of the animal or the plant from its primary egg or germ is a true process of evolutiona progress from almost formless to more or less highly organised matter in virtue of the properties inherent in that matter  to those who are familiar with the process of development all a priori objections to the doctrine of biological evolution appear childish any one who has watched the gradual formation of a complicated animal from the protoplasmic mass which constitutes the essential element of a frogs or a hens egg has had under his eyes sufficient evidence that a similar evolution of the whole animal world from the like foundation is at any rate possible  yet another product of investigation has largely contributed to the removal of the objections to the doctrine of evolution current in 1859 it is the proof afforded by successive discoveries that mr darwin did not overestimate the imperfection of the geological record no more striking illustration of this is needed than a comparison of our knowledge of the mammalian fauna of the tertiary epoch in 1859 with its present condition m gaudrys researches on the fossils of pikermi were published in 1868 those of messrs leidy marsh and cope on the fossils of the western territories of america have appeared almost wholly since 1870 those of m filhol on the phosphorites of quercy in 1878 the general effect of these investigations has been to introduce to us a multitude of extinct animals the existence of which was previously hardly suspected just as if zoologists were to become acquainted with a country hitherto unknown as rich in novel forms of life as brazil or south africa once were to europeans indeed the fossil fauna of the western territories of america bid fair to exceed in interest and importance all other known tertiary deposits put together and yet with the exception of the case of the american tertiaries these investigations have extended over very limited areas and at pikermi were confined to an extremely small space  such appear to me to be the chief events in the history of the progress of knowledge during the last twenty years which account for the changed feeling with which the doctrine of evolution is at present regarded by those who have followed the advance of biological science in respect of those problems which bear indirectly upon that doctrine  but all this remains mere secondary evidence it may remove dissent but it does not compel assent primary and direct evidence in favour of evolution can be furnished only by palæontology the geological record so soon as it approaches completeness must when properly questioned yield either an affirmative or a negative answer if evolution has taken place there will its mark be left if it has not taken place there will lie its refutation  what was the state of matters in 1859 let us hear mr darwin who may be trusted always to state the case against himself as strongly as possible  on this doctrine of the extermination of an infinitude of connecting links between the living and extinct inhabitants of the world and at each successive period between the extinct and still older species why is not every geological formation charged with such links why does not every collection of fossil remains afford plain evidence of the gradation and mutation of the forms of life we meet with no such evidence and this is the most obvious and plausible of the many objections which may be urged against my theory footnote origin of species ed 1 p 463  nothing could have been more useful to the opposition than this characteristically candid avowal twisted as it immediately was into an admission that the writers views were contradicted by the facts of palæontology but in fact mr darwin made no such admission what he says in effect is not that palæontological evidence is against him but that it is not distinctly in his favour and without attempting to attenuate the fact he accounts for it by the scantiness and the imperfection of that evidence  what is the state of the case now when as we have seen the amount of our knowledge respecting the mammalia of the tertiary epoch is increased fiftyfold and in some directions even approaches completeness  simply this that if the doctrine of evolution had not existed palaeontologists must have invented it so irresistibly is it forced upon the mind by the study of the remains of the tertiary mammalia which have been brought to light since 1859  among the fossils of pikermi gaudry found the successive stages by which the ancient civets passed into the more modern hyænas through the tertiary deposits of western america marsh tracked the successive forms by which the ancient stock of the horse has passed into its present form and innumerable less complete indications of the mode of evolution of other groups of the higher mammalia have been obtained in the remarkable memoir on the phosphorites of quercy to which i have referred m filhol describes no fewer than seventeen varieties of the genus cynodictis which fill up all the interval between the viverine animals and the bearlike dog amphicyon nor do i know any solid ground of objection to the supposition that in this cynodictisamphicyon group we have the stock whence all the viveridæ felidæ hyænidæ canidæ and perhaps the procyonidæ and ursidæ of the present fauna have been evolved on the contrary there is a great deal to be said in favour  in the course of summing up his results m filhol observes  during the epoch of the phosphorites great changes took place in animal forms and almost the same types as those which now exist became defined from one another  under the influence of natural conditions of which we have no exact knowledge though traces of them are discoverable species have been modified in a thousand ways races have arisen which becoming fixed have thus produced a corresponding number of secondary species  in 1859 language of which this is an unintentional paraphrase occurring in the origin of species was scouted as wild speculation at present it is a sober statement of the conclusions to which an acute and criticallyminded investigator is led by large and patient study of the facts of palæontology i venture to repeat what i have said before that so far as the animal world is concerned evolution is no longer a speculation but a statement of historical fact it takes its place alongside of those accepted truths which must be reckoned with by philosophers of all schools  thus when on the first day of october next the origin of species comes of age the promise of its youth will be amply fulfilled and we shall be prepared to congratulate the venerated author of the book not only that the greatness of his achievement and its enduring influence upon the progress of knowledge have won him a place beside our harvey but still more that like harvey he has lived long enough to outlast detraction and opposition and to see the stone that the builders rejected become the headstone of the corner     viii  charles darwin  nature april 27th 1882   very few even among those who have taken the keenest interest in the progress of the revolution in natural knowledge set afoot by the publication of the origin of species and who have watched not without astonishment the rapid and complete change which has been effected both inside and outside the boundaries of the scientific world in the attitude of mens minds towards the doctrines which are expounded in that great work can have been prepared for the extraordinary manifestation of affectionate regard for the man and of profound reverence for the philosopher which followed the announcement on thursday last of the death of mr darwin  not only in these islands where so many have felt the fascination of personal contact with an intellect which had no superior and with a character which was even nobler than the intellect but in all parts of the civilised world it would seem that those whose business it is to feel the pulse of nations and to know what interests the masses of mankind were well aware that thousands of their readers would think the world the poorer for darwins death and would dwell with eager interest upon every incident of his history in france in germany in austrohungary in italy in the united states writers of all shades of opinion for once unanimous have paid a willing tribute to the worth of our great countryman ignored in life by the official representatives of the kingdom but laid in death among his peers in westminster abbey by the will of the intelligence of the nation  it is not for us to allude to the sacred sorrows of the bereaved home at down but it is no secret that outside that domestic group there are many to whom mr darwins death is a wholly irreparable loss and this not merely because of his wonderfully genial simple and generous nature his cheerful and animated conversation and the infinite variety and accuracy of his information but because the more one knew of him the more he seemed the incorporated ideal of a man of science acute as were his reasoning powers vast as was his knowledge marvellous as was his tenacious industry under physical difficulties which would have converted nine men out of ten into aimless invalids it was not these qualities great as they were which impressed those who were admitted to his intimacy with involuntary veneration but a certain intense and almost passionate honesty by which all his thoughts and actions were irradiated as by a central fire  it was this rarest and greatest of endowments which kept his vivid imagination and great speculative powers within due bounds which compelled him to undertake the prodigious labours of original investigation and of reading upon which his published works are based which made him accept criticisms and suggestions from anybody and everybody not only without impatience but with expressions of gratitude sometimes almost comically in excess of their value which led him to allow neither himself nor others to be deceived by phrases and to spare neither time nor pains in order to obtain clear and distinct ideas upon every topic with which he occupied himself  one could not converse with darwin without being reminded of socrates there was the same desire to find some one wiser than himself the same belief in the sovereignty of reason the same ready humour the same sympathetic interest in all the ways and works of men but instead of turning away from the problems of nature as hopelessly insoluble our modern philosopher devoted his whole life to attacking them in the spirit of heraclitus and of democritus with results which are the substance of which their speculations were anticipatory shadows  the due appreciation or even enumeration of these results is neither practicable nor desirable at this moment there is a time for all thingsa time for glorying in our everextending conquests over the realm of nature and a time for mourning over the heroes who have led us to victory  none have fought better and none have been more fortunate than charles darwin he found a great truth trodden underfoot reviled by bigots and ridiculed by all the world he lived long enough to see it chiefly by his own efforts irrefragably established in science inseparably incorporated with the common thoughts of men and only hated and feared by those who would revile but dare not what shall a man desire more than this once more the image of socrates rises unbidden and the noble peroration of the apology rings in our ears as if it were charles darwins farewell  the hour of departure has arrived and we go our waysi to die and you to live which is the better god only knows     ix  the darwin memorial  june 9th 1885   address by the president of the royal society in the name of the memorial committee on handing over the statue of darwin to hrh the prince of wales as representative of the trustees of the british museum  your royal highnessit is now three years since the announcement of the death of our famous countryman charles darwin gave rise to a manifestation of public feeling not only in these realms but throughout the civilised world which if i mistake not is without precedent in the modest annals of scientific biography  the causes of this deep and wide outburst of emotion are not far to seek we had lost one of these rare ministers and interpreters of nature whose names mark epochs in the advance of natural knowledge for whatever be the ultimate verdict of posterity upon this or that opinion which mr darwin has propounded whatever adumbrations or anticipations of his doctrines may be found in the writings of his predecessors the broad fact remains that since the publication and by reason of the publication of the origin of species the fundamental conceptions and the aims of the students of living nature have been completely changed from that work has sprung a great renewal a true instauratio magna of the zoological and botanical sciences  but the impulse thus given to scientific thought rapidly spread beyond the ordinarily recognised limits of biology psychology ethics cosmology were stirred to their foundations and the origin of species proved itself to be the fixed point which the general doctrine of evolution needed in order to move the world darwinism in one form or another sometimes strangely distorted and mutilated became an everyday topic of mens speech the object of an abundance both of vituperation and of praise more often than of serious study  it is curious now to remember how largely at first the objectors predominated but considering the usual fate of new views it is still more curious to consider for how short a time the phase of vehement opposition lasted before twenty years had passed not only had the importance of mr darwins work been fully recognised but the world had discerned the simple earnest generous character of the man that shone through every page of his writings  i imagine that reflections such as these swept through the minds alike of loving friends and of honourable antagonists when mr darwin died and that they were at one in the desire to honour the memory of the man who without fear and without reproach had successfully fought the hardest intellectual battle of these days  it was in satisfaction of these just and generous impulses that our great naturalists remains were deposited in westminster abbey and that immediately afterwards a public meeting presided over by my lamented predecessor mr spottiswoode was held in the rooms of the royal society for the purpose of considering what further step should be taken towards the same end  it was resolved to invite subscriptions with the view of erecting a statue of mr darwin in some suitable locality and to devote any surplus to the advancement of the biological sciences  contributions at once flowed in from austria belgium brazil denmark france germany holland italy norway portugal russia spain sweden switzerland the united states and the british colonies no less than from all parts of the three kingdoms and they came from all classes of the community to mention one interesting case sweden sent in 2296 subscriptions from all sorts of people as the distinguished man of science who transmitted them wrote from the bishop to the seamstress and in sums from five pounds to two pence  the executive committee has thus been enabled to carry out the objects proposed a darwin fund has been created which is to be held in trust by the royal society and is to be employed in the promotion of biological research  the execution of the statue was entrusted to mr boehm and i think that those who had the good fortune to know mr darwin personally will admire the power of artistic divination which has enabled the sculptor to place before us so very characteristic a likeness of one whom he had not seen  it appeared to the committee that whether they regarded mr darwins career or the requirements of a work of art no site could be so appropriate as this great hall and they applied to the trustees of the british museum for permission to erect it in its present position  that permission was most cordially granted and i am desired to tender the best thanks of the committee to the trustees for their willingness to accede to our wishes  i also beg leave to offer the expression of our gratitude to your royal highness for kindly consenting to represent the trustees today it only remains for me your royal highness my lords and gentlemen trustees of the british museum in the name of the darwin memorial committee to request you to accept this statue of charles darwin  we do not make this request for the mere sake of perpetuating a memory for so long as men occupy themselves with the pursuit of truth the name of darwin runs no more risk of oblivion than does that of copernicus or that of harvey  nor most assuredly do we ask you to preserve the statue in its cynosural position in this entrancehall of our national museum of natural history as evidence that mr darwins views have received your official sanction for science does not recognise such sanctions and commits suicide when it adopts a creed  no we beg you to cherish this memorial as a symbol by which as generation after generation of students of nature enter yonder door they shall be reminded of the ideal according to which they must shape their lives if they would turn to the best account the opportunities offered by the great institution under your charge     x  obituary footnote from the obituary notices of the proceedings of the royal society vol 44  1888   charles robert darwin was the fifth child and second son of robert waring darwin and susannah wedgwood and was born on the 12th february 1809 at shrewsbury where his father was a physician in large practice  mrs robert darwin died when her son charles was only eight years old and he hardly remembered her a daughter of the famous josiah wedgwood who created a new branch of the potters art and established the great works of etruria could hardly fail to transmit important mental and moral qualities to her children and there is a solitary record of her direct influence in the story told by a schoolfellow who remembers charles darwin bringing a flower to school and saying that his mother had taught him how by looking at the inside of the blossom the name of the plant could be discovered i p 28 footnote the references throughout this notice are to the life and letters unless the contrary is expressly stated  the theory that men of genius derive their qualities from their mothers however can hardly derive support from charles darwins case in the face of the patent influence of his paternal forefathers dr darwin indeed though a man of marked individuality of character a quick and acute observer with much practical sagacity is said not to have had a scientific mind but when his son adds that his father formed a theory for almost everything that occurred i p 20 he indicates a highly probable source for that inability to refrain from forming an hypothesis on every subject which he confesses to be one of the leading characteristics of his own mind some pages further on i p 103 dr r w darwin again was the third son of erasmus darwin also a physician of great repute who shared the intimacy of watt and priestley and was widely known as the author of zoonomia and other voluminous poetical and prose works which had a great vogue in the latter half of the eighteenth century the celebrity which they enjoyed was in part due to the attractive style at least according to the taste of that day in which the authors extensive though not very profound acquaintance with natural phenomena was set forth but in a still greater degree probably to the boldness of the speculative views always ingenious and sometimes fantastic in which he indulged the conception of evolution set afoot by de maillet and others in the early part of the century not only found a vigorous champion in erasmus darwin but he propounded an hypothesis as to the manner in which the species of animals and plants have acquired their characters which is identical in principle with that subsequently rendered famous by lamarck  that charles darwins chief intellectual inheritance came to him from the paternal side then is hardly doubtful but there is nothing to show that he was to any sensible extent directly influenced by his grandfathers biological work he tells us that a perusal of the zoonomia in early life produced no effect upon him although he greatly admired it and that on reading it again ten or fifteen years afterwards he was much disappointed the proportion of speculation being so large to the facts given but with his usual anxious candour he adds nevertheless it is probable that the hearing rather early in life such views maintained and praised may have favoured my upholding them in a different form in my origin of species i p 38 erasmus darwin was in fact an anticipator of lamarck and not of charles darwin there is no trace in his works of the conceptions by the addition of which his grandson metamorphosed the theory of evolution as applied to living things and gave it a new foundation  charles darwins childhood and youth afforded no intimation that he would he or do anything out of the common run in fact the prognostications of the educational authorities into whose hands he first fell were most distinctly unfavourable and they counted the only boy of original genius who is known to have come under their hands as no better than a dunce the history of the educational experiments to which darwin was subjected is curious and not without a moral for the present generation there were four of them and three were failures yet it cannot be said that the materials on which the pedagogic powers operated were other than good in his boyhood darwin was strong wellgrown and active taking the keen delight in field sports and in every description of hard physical exercise which is natural to an english countrybred lad and in respect of things of the mind he was neither apathetic nor idle nor onesided the autobiography tells us that he had much zeal for whatever interested him and he was interested in many and very diverse topics he could work hard and liked a complex subject better than an easy one the clear geometrical proofs of euclid delighted him his interest in practical chemistry carried out in an extemporised laboratory in which he was permitted to assist by his elder brother kept him late at work and earned him the nickname of gas among his schoolfellows and there could have been no insensibility to literature in one who as a boy could sit for hours reading shakespeare milton scott and byron who greatly admired some of the odes of horace and who in later years on board the beagle when only one book could be carried on an expedition chose a volume of milton for his companion  industry intellectual interests the capacity for taking pleasure in deductive reasoning in observation in experiment no less than in the highest works of imagination where these qualities are present any rational system of education should surely be able to make something of them unfortunately for darwin the shrewsbury grammar school though good of its kind was an institution of a type universally prevalent in this country half a century ago and by no means extinct at the present day the education given was strictly classical especial attention being paid to versemaking while all other subjects except a little ancient geography and history were ignored whether as in some famous english schools at that date and much later elementary arithmetic was also left out of sight does not appear but the instruction in euclid which gave charles darwin so much satisfaction was certainly supplied by a private tutor that a boy even in his leisure hours should permit himself to be interested in any but booklearning seems to have been regarded as little better than an outrage by the head master who thought it his duty to administer a public rebuke to young darwin for wasting his time on such a contemptible subject as chemistry english composition and literature modern languages modern history modern geography appear to have been considered to be as despicable as chemistry  for seven long years darwin got through his appointed tasks construed without cribs learned by rote whatever was demanded and concocted his verses in approved schoolboy fashion and the result as it appeared to his mature judgment was simply negative the school as a means of education to me was simply a blank i p 32 on the other hand the extraneous chemical exercises which the head master treated so contumeliously are gratefully spoken of as the best part of his education while at school such is the judgment of the scholar on the school as might be expected it has its counterpart in the judgment of the school on the scholar the collective intelligence of the staff of shrewsbury school could find nothing but dull mediocrity in charles darwin the mind that found satisfaction in knowledge but very little in mere learning that could appreciate literature but had no particular aptitude for grammatical exercises appeared to the strictly classical pedagogue to be no mind at all as a matter of fact darwins school education left him ignorant of almost all the things which it would have been well for him to know and untrained in all the things it would have been useful for him to be able to do in after life drawing practice in english composition and instruction in the elements of the physical sciences would not only have been infinitely valuable to him in reference to his future career but would have furnished the discipline suited to his faculties whatever that career might be and a knowledge of french and german especially the latter would have removed from his path obstacles which he never fully overcame  thus starved and stunted on the intellectual side it is not surprising that charles darwins energies were directed towards athletic amusements and sport to such an extent that even his kind and sagacious father could be exasperated into telling him that he cared for nothing but shooting dogs and ratcatching i p 32 it would be unfair to expect even the wisest of fathers to have foreseen that the shooting and the ratcatching as training in the ways of quick observation and in physical endurance would prove more valuable than the construing and versemaking to his son whose attempt at a later period of his life to persuade himself that shooting was almost an intellectual employment it required so much skill to judge where to find most game and to hunt the dogs well i p 43 was by no means so sophistical as he seems to have been ready to admit  in 1825 dr darwin came to the very just conclusion that his son charles would do no good by remaining at shrewsbury school and sent him to join his elder brother erasmus who was studying medicine at edinburgh with the intention that the younger son should also become a medical practitioner both sons however were well aware that their inheritance would relieve them from the urgency of the struggle for existence which most professional men have to face and they seemed to have allowed their tastes rather than the medical curriculum to have guided their studies erasmus darwin was debarred by constant illhealth from seeking the public distinction which his high intelligence and extensive knowledge would under ordinary circumstances have insured he took no great interest in biological subjects but his companionship must have had its influence on his brother still more was exerted by friends like coldstream and grant both subsequently wellknown zoologists and the latter an enthusiastic lamarckian by whom darwin was induced to interest himself in marine zoology a notice of the ciliated germs of flustra communicated to the plinian society in 1826 was the first fruits of darwins half century of scientific work occasional attendance at the wernerian society brought him into relation with that excellent ornithologist the elder macgillivray and enabled him to see and hear audubon moreover he got lessons in birdstuffing from a negro who had accompanied the eccentric traveller waterton in his wanderings before settling in edinburgh  no doubt darwin picked up a great deal of valuable knowledge during his two years residence in scotland but it is equally clear that next to none of it came through the regular channels of academic education indeed the influence of the edinburgh professoriate appears to have been mainly negative and in some cases deterrent creating in his mind not only a very low estimate of the value of lectures but an antipathy to the subjects which had been the occasion of the boredom inflicted upon him by their instrumentality with the exception of hope the professor of chemistry darwin found them all intolerably dull forty years afterwards he writes of the lectures of the professor of materia medica that they were fearful to remember the professor of anatomy made his lectures as dull as he was himself and he must have been very dull to have wrung from his victim the sharpest personal remark recorded as his but the climax seems to have been attained by the professor of geology and zoology whose prælections were so incredibly dull that they produced in their hearer the somewhat rash determination never to read a book on geology or in any way to study the science so long as he lived i p 41  there is much reason to believe that the lectures in question were eminently qualified to produce the impression which they made and there can be little doubt that darwins conclusion that his time was better employed in reading than in listening to such lectures was a sound one but it was particularly unfortunate that the personal and professorial dulness of the professor of anatomy combined with darwins sensitiveness to the disagreeable concomitants of anatomical work drove him away from the dissecting room in after life he justly recognised that this was an irremediable evil in reference to the pursuits he eventually adopted indeed it is marvellous that he succeeded in making up for his lack of anatomical discipline so far as his work on the cirripedes shows he did and the neglect of anatomy had the further unfortunate result that it excluded him from the best opportunity of bringing himself into direct contact with the facts of nature which the university had to offer in those days almost the only practical scientific work accessible to students was anatomical and the only laboratory at their disposal the dissecting room  we may now console ourselves with the reflection that the partial evil was the general good darwin had already shown an aptitude for practical medicine i p 37 and his subsequent career proved that he had the making of an excellent anatomist thus though his horror of operations would probably have shut him off from surgery there was nothing to prevent him any more than the same peculiarity prevented his father from passing successfully through the medical curriculum and becoming like his father and grandfather a successful physician in which case the origin of species would not have been written darwin has jestingly alluded to the fact that the shape of his nose to which captain fitzroy objected nearly prevented his embarkation in the beagle it may be that the sensitiveness of that organ secured him for science  at the end of two years residence in edinburgh it hardly needed dr darwins sagacity to conclude that a young man who found nothing but dulness in professorial lucubrations could not bring himself to endure a dissecting room fled from operations and did not need a profession as a means of livelihood was hardly likely to distinguish himself as a student of medicine he therefore made a new suggestion proposing that his son should enter an english university and qualify for the ministry of the church charles darwin found the proposal agreeable none the less probably that a good deal of natural history and a little shooting were by no means held at that time to be incompatible with the conscientious performance of the duties of a country clergyman but it is characteristic of the man that he asked time for consideration in order that he might satisfy himself that he could sign the thirtynine articles with a clear conscience however the study of pearson on the creeds and a few other books of divinity soon assured him that his religious opinions left nothing to be desired on the score of orthodoxy and he acceded to his fathers proposition  the english university selected was cambridge but an unexpected obstacle arose from the fact that within the two years which had elapsed since the young man who had enjoyed seven years of the benefit of a strictly classical education had left school he had forgotten almost everything he had learned there even to some few of the greek letters i p 46 three months with a tutor however brought him back to the point of translating homer and the greek testament with moderate facility and charles darwin commenced the third educational experiment of which he was the subject and was entered on the books of christs college in october 1827 so far as the direct results of the academic training thus received are concerned the english university was not more successful than the scottish during the three years which i spent at cambridge my time was wasted as far as the academical studies were concerned as completely as at edinburgh and as at school i p 46 and yet as before there is ample evidence that this negative result cannot be put down to any native defect on the part of the scholar idle and dull young men or even young men who being neither idle nor dull are incapable of caring for anything but some hobby do not devote themselves to the thorough study of paleys moral philosophy and evidences of christianity nor are their reminiscences of this particular portion of their studies expressed in terms such as the following the logic of this book the evidences and as i may add of his natural theology gave me as much delight as did euclid i p 47  the collectors instinct strong in darwin from his childhood as is usually the case in great naturalists turned itself in the direction of insects during his residence at cambridge in childhood it had been damped by the moral scruples of a sister as to the propriety of catching and killing insects for the mere sake of possessing them but now it broke out afresh and darwin became an enthusiastic beetle collector oddly enough he took no scientific interest in beetles not even troubling himself to make out their names his delight lay in the capture of a species which turned out to be rare or new and still more in finding his name as captor recorded in print evidently this beetlehunting hobby had little to do with science but was mainly a new phase of the old and undiminished love of sport in the intervals of beetlecatching when shooting and hunting were not to be had riding across country answered the purpose these tastes naturally threw the young undergraduate among a set of men who preferred hard riding to hard reading and wasted the midnight oil upon other pursuits than that of academic distinction a superficial observer might have had some grounds to fear that dr darwins wrathful prognosis might yet be verified but if the eminently social tendencies of a vigorous and genial nature sought an outlet among a set of jovial sporting friends there were other and no less strong proclivities which brought him into relation with associates of a very different stamp  though almost without ear and with a very defective memory for music darwin was so strongly and pleasurably affected by it that he became a member of a musical society and an equal lack of natural capacity for drawing did not prevent him from studying good works of art with much care  an acquaintance with even the rudiments of physical science was no part of the requirements for the ordinary cambridge degree but there were professors both of geology and of botany whose lectures were accessible to those who chose to attend them the occupants of these chairs in darwins time were eminent men and also admirable lecturers in their widely different styles the horror of geological lectures which darwin had acquired at edinburgh unfortunately prevented him from going within reach of the fervid eloquence of sedgwick but he attended the botanical course and though he paid no serious attention to the subject he took great delight in the country excursions which henslow so well knew how to make both pleasant and instructive the botanical professor was in fact a man of rare character and singularly extensive acquirements in all branches of natural history it was his greatest pleasure to place his stores of knowledge at the disposal of the young men who gathered about him and who found in him not merely an encyclopedic teacher but a wise counsellor and in case of worthiness a warm friend darwins acquaintance with him soon ripened into a friendship which was terminated only by henslows death in 1861 when his quondam pupil gave touching expression to his sense of what he owed to one whom he calls in one of his letters his dear old master in natural history ii p 217 it was by henslows advice that darwin was led to break the vow he had registered against making an acquaintance with geology and it was through henslows good offices with sedgwick that he obtained the opportunity of accompanying the geological professor on one of his excursions in wales he then received a certain amount of practical instruction in geology the value of which he subsequently warmly acknowledged i p 237 in another direction henslow did him an immense though not altogether intentional service by recommending him to buy and study the recently published first volume of lyells principles as an orthodox geologist of the then dominant catastrophic school henslow accompanied his recommendation with the admonition on no account to adopt lyells general views but the warning fell on deaf ears and it is hardly too much to say that darwins greatest work is the outcome of the unflinching application to biology of the leading idea and the method applied in the principles to geology footnote after my return to england it appeared to me that by following the example of lyell in geology and by collecting all facts which bore in any way on the variation of animals and plants under domestication and nature some light might perhaps be thrown on the whole subject of the origin of species i p 83 see also the dedication of the second edition of the journal of a naturalist  finally it was through henslow and at his suggestion that darwin was offered the appointment to the beagle as naturalist  during the latter part of darwins residence at cambridge the prospect of entering the church though the plan was never formally renounced seems to have grown very shadowy humboldts personal narrative and herschels introduction to the study of natural philosophy fell in his way and revealed to him his real vocation the impression made by the former work was very strong my whole course of life says darwin in sending a message to humboldt is due to having read and reread as a youth his personal narrative i p 336 the description of teneriffe inspired darwin with such a strong desire to visit the island that he took some steps towards going thereinquiring about ships and so on  but while this project was fermenting henslow who had been asked to recommend a naturalist for captain fitzroys projected expedition at once thought of his pupil in his letter of the 24th august 1831 he says i have stated that i consider you to be the best qualified person i know of who is likely to undertake such a situation i state thisnot on the supposition of your being a finished naturalist but as amply qualified for collecting observing and noting anything worthy to be noted in natural history the voyage is to last two years and if you take plenty of books with you anything you please may be done i p 193 the state of the case could not have been better put assuredly the young naturalists theoretical and practical scientific training had gone no further than might suffice for the outfit of an intelligent collector and notetaker he was fully conscious of the fact and his ambition hardly rose above the hope that he should bring back materials for the scientific lions at home of sufficient excellence to prevent them from turning and rending him i p 248  but a fourth educational experiment was to be tried this time nature took him in hand herself and showed him the way by which to borrow henslows prophetic phrase anything he pleased might be done  the conditions of life presented by a shipofwar of only 242 tons burthen would not primâ facie appear to be so favourable to intellectual development as those offered by the cloistered retirement of christs college darwin had not even a cabin to himself while in addition to the hindrances and interruptions incidental to sealife which can be appreciated only by those who have had experience of them seasickness came on whenever the little ship was lively and considering the circumstances of the cruise that must have been her normal state nevertheless darwin found on board the beagle that which neither the pedagogues of shrewsbury nor the professoriate of edinburgh nor the tutors of cambridge had managed to give him i have always felt that i owe to the voyage the first real training or education of my mind i p 61 and in a letter written as he was leaving england he calls the voyage on which he was starting with just insight his second life i p 214 happily for darwins education the school time of the beagle lasted five years instead of two and the countries which the ship visited were singularly well fitted to provide him with objectlessons on the nature of things of the greatest value  while at sea he diligently collected studied and made copious notes upon the surface fauna but with no previous training in dissection hardly any power of drawing and next to no knowledge of comparative anatomy his occupation with work of this kindnotwithstanding all his zeal and industryresulted for the most part in a vast accumulation of useless manuscript some acquaintance with the marine crustacea observations on planariæ and on the ubiquitous sagitta seem to have been the chief results of a great amount of labour in this direction  it was otherwise with the terrestrial phenomena which came under the voyagers notice and geology very soon took her revenge for the scorn which the muchbored edinburgh student had poured upon her three weeks after leaving england the ship touched land for the first time at st jago in the cape de verd islands and darwin found his attention vividly engaged by the volcanic phenomena and the signs of upheaval which the island presented his geological studies had already indicated the direction in which a great deal might be done beyond collecting and it was while sitting beneath a low lava cliff on the shore of this island that a sense of his real capability first dawned upon darwin and prompted the ambition to write a book on the geology of the various countries visited i p 66 even at this early date darwin must have thought much on geological topics for he was already convinced of the superiority of lyells views to those entertained by the catastrophists footnote i had brought with me the first volume of lyells principles of geology which i studied attentively and the book was of the highest service to me in many ways the very first place which i examined namely st jago in the cape de verd islands showed me clearly the wonderful superiority of lyells manner of treating geology compared with that of any other author whose works i had with me or ever afterwards read i p 62 and his subsequent study of the tertiary deposits and of the terraced gravel beds of south america was eminently fitted to strengthen that conviction the letters from south america contain little reference to any scientific topic except geology and even the theory of the formation of coral reefs was prompted by the evidence of extensive and gradual changes of level afforded by the geology of south america no other work of mine he says was begun in so deductive a spirit as this for the whole theory was thought out on the west coast of south america before i had seen a true coral reef i had therefore only to verify and extend my views by a careful examination of living reefs i p 70 in 1835 when starting from lima for the galapagos he recommends his friend w d fox to take up geologythere is so much larger a field for thought than in the other branches of natural history i am become a zealous disciple of mr lyells views as made known in his admirable book geologising in south america i am tempted to carry parts to a greater extent even than he does geology is a capital science to begin with as it requires nothing but a little reading thinking and hammering i p 263 the truth of the last statement when it was written is a curious mark of the subsequent progress of geology even so late as 1836 darwin speaks of being much more inclined for geology than the other branches of natural history i p 275  at the end of the letter to mr fox however a little doubt is expressed whether zoological studies might not after all have been more profitable and an interesting passage in the autobiography enables us to understand the origin of this hesitation  during the voyage of the beagle i had been deeply impressed by discovering in the pampean formation great fossil animals covered with armour like that on the existing armadillos secondly by the manner in which closelyallied animals replace one another in proceeding southwards over the continent and thirdly by the south american character of most of the productions of the galapagos archipelago and more especially by the manner in which they differ slightly on each island of the group some of the islands appearing to be very ancient in a geological sense  it was evident that such facts as these as well as many others could only be explained on the supposition that species gradually become modified and the subject haunted me but it was equally evident that neither the action of the surrounding conditions nor the will of the organisms especially in the case of plants could account for the innumerable cases in which organisms of every kind are beautifully adapted to their habits of life for instance a woodpecker or a treefrog to climb trees or a seed for dispersal by hooks or plumes i had always been much struck by such adaptations and until these could be explained it seemed to me almost useless to endeavour to prove by indirect evidence that species have been modified i p 82  the facts to which reference is here made were without doubt eminently fitted to attract the attention of a philosophical thinker but until the relations of the existing with the extinct species and of the species of the different geographical areas with one another were determined with some exactness they afforded but an unsafe foundation for speculation it was not possible that this determination should have been effected before the return of the beagle to england and thus the date which darwin writing in 1837 assigns to the dawn of the new light which was rising in his mind becomes intelligible footnote i am indebted to mr f darwin for the knowledge of a letter addressed by his father to dr otto zacharias in 1877 which contains the following paragraph confirmatory of the view expressed above when i was on board the beagle i believed in the permanence of species but as far as i can remember vague doubts occasionally flitted across my mind on my return home in the autumn of 1836 i immediately began to prepare my journal for publication and then saw how many facts indicated the common descent of species so that in july 1837 i opened a notebook to record any facts which might bear on the question but i did not become convinced that species were mutable until i think two or three years had elapsed  in july opened first notebook on transmutation of species had been greatly struck from about the month of previous march on character of south american fossils and species on galapagos archipelago these facts especially latter origin of all my views i p 276  from march 1837 then darwin not without many misgivings and fluctuations of opinion inclined towards transmutation as a provisional hypothesis three months afterwards he is hard at work collecting facts for the purpose of testing the hypothesis and an almost apologetic passage in a letter to lyell shows that already the attractions of biology are beginning to predominate over those of geology  i have lately been sadly tempted to be idlefootnote darwin generally uses the word idle in a peculiar sense he means by it working hard at something he likes when he ought to be occupied with a less attractive subject though it sounds paradoxical there is a good deal to be said in favour of this view of pleasant workthat is as far as pure geology is concernedby the delightful number of new views which have been coming in thickly and steadilyon the classification and affinities and instincts of animalsbearing on the question of species notebook after notebook has been filled with facts which begin to group themselves clearly under sublaws i p 298  the problem which was to be darwins chief subject of occupation for the rest of his life thus presented itself at first mainly under its distributional aspect why do species present certain relations in space and in time why are the animals and plants of the galapagos archipelago so like those of south america and yet different from them why are those of the several islets more or less different from one another why are the animals of the latest geological epoch in south america similar in facies to those which exist in the same region at the present day and yet specifically or generically different  the reply to these questions which was almost universally received fifty years ago was that animals and plants were created such as they are and that their present distribution at any rate so far as terrestrial organisms are concerned has been effected by the migration of their ancestors from the region in which the ark stranded after the subsidence of the deluge it is true that the geologists had drawn attention to a good many tolerably serious difficulties in the way of the diluvial part of this hypothesis no less than to the supposition that the work of creation had occupied only a brief space of time but even those such as lyell who most strenuously argued in favour of the sufficiency of natural causes for the production of the phenomena of the inorganic world held stoutly by the hypothesis of creation in the case of those of the world of life  for persons who were unable to feel satisfied with the fashionable doctrine there remained only two alternativesthe hypothesis of spontaneous generation and that of descent with modification the former was simply the creative hypothesis with the creator left out the latter had already been propounded by de maillet and erasmus darwin among others and later systematically expounded by lamarck but in the eyes of the naturalist of the beagle and probably in those of most sober thinkers the advocates of transmutation had done the doctrine they expounded more harm than good  darwins opinion of the scientific value of the zoonomia has already been mentioned his verdict on lamarck is given in the following passage of a letter to lyell march 1863  lastly you refer repeatedly to my view as a modification of lamarcks doctrine of development and progression if this is your deliberate opinion there is nothing to be said but it does not seem so to me plato buffon my grandfather before lamarck and others propounded the obvious view that if species were not created separately they must have descended from other species and i can see nothing else in common between the origin and lamarck i believe this way of putting the case is very injurious to its acceptance as it implies necessary progression and closely connects wallaces and my views with what i consider after two deliberate readings as a wretched book and one from which i well remember to my surprise i gained nothing  but adds darwin with a little touch of banter i know you rank it higher which is curious as it did not in the least shake your belief iii p 14 see also p 16 to me it was an absolutely useless book  unable to find any satisfactory theory of the process of descent with modification in the works of his predecessors darwin proceeded to lay the foundations of his own views independently and he naturally turned in the first place to the only certainly known examples of descent with modification namely those which are presented by domestic animals and cultivated plants he devoted himself to the study of these cases with a thoroughness to which none of his predecessors even remotely approximated and he very soon had his reward in the discovery that selection was the keystone of mans success in making useful races of animals and plants i p 83  this was the first step in darwins progress though its immediate result was to bring him face to face with a great difficulty but how selection could be applied to organisms living in a state of nature remained for some time a mystery to me i p 83  the key to this mystery was furnished by the accidental perusal of the famous essay of malthus on population in the autumn of 1838 the necessary result of unrestricted multiplication is competition for the means of existence the success of one competitor involves the failure of the rest that is their extinction and this selection is dependent on the better adaptation of the successful competitor to the conditions of the competition variation occurs under natural no less than under artificial conditions unrestricted multiplication implies the competition of varieties and the selection of those which are relatively best adapted to the conditions  neither erasmus darwin nor lamarck had any inkling of the possibility of this process of natural selection and though it had been foreshadowed by wells in 1813 and more fully stated by matthew in 1831 the speculations of the latter writer remained unknown to naturalists until after the publication of the origin of species  darwin found in the doctrine of the selection of favourable variations by natural causes which thus presented itself to his mind not merely a probable theory of the origin of the diverse species of living forms but that explanation of the phenomena of adaptation which previous speculations had utterly failed to give the process of natural selection is in fact dependent on adaptationit is all one whether one says that the competitor which survives is the fittest or the best adapted and it was a perfectly fair deduction that even the most complicated adaptations might result from the summation of a long series of simple favourable variations  darwin notes as a serious defect in the first sketch of his theory that he had omitted to consider one very important problem the solution of which did not occur to him till some time afterwards this problem is the tendency in organic beings descended from the same stock to diverge in character as they become modified the solution as i believe is that the modified offspring of all dominant and increasing forms tend to become adapted to many and highly diversified places in the economy of nature i p 84  it is curious that so much importance should be attached to this supplementary idea it seems obvious that the theory of the origin of species by natural selection necessarily involves the divergence of the forms selected an individual which varies ipso facto diverges from the type of its species and its progeny in which the variation becomes intensified by selection must diverge still more not only from the parent stock but from any other race of that stock starting from a variation of a different character the selective process could not take place unless the selected variety was either better adapted to the conditions than the original stock or adapted to other conditions than the original stock in the first case the original stock would be sooner or later extirpated in the second the type as represented by the original stock and the variety would occupy more diversified stations than it did before  the theory essentially such as it was published fourteen years later was written out in 1844 and darwin was so fully convinced of the importance of his work as it then stood that he made special arrangements for its publication in case of his death but it is a singular example of reticent fortitude that although for the next fourteen years the subject never left his mind and during the latter half of that period he was constantly engaged in amassing facts bearing upon it from wide reading a colossal correspondence and a long series of experiments only two or three friends were cognisant of his views to the outside world he seemed to have his hands quite sufficiently full of other matters in 1844 he published his observations on the volcanic islands visited during the voyage of the beagle in 1845 a largely remodelled edition of his journal made its appearance and immediately won as it has ever since held the favour of both the scientific and the unscientific public in 1846 the geological observations in south america came out and this book was no sooner finished than darwin set to work upon the cirripedes he was led to undertake this long and heavy task partly by his desire to make out the relations of a very anomalous form which he had discovered on the coast of chili and partly by a sense of presumption in accumulating facts and speculating on the subject of variation without having worked out my due share of species ii p 31 the eight or nine years of labour which resulted in a monograph of firstrate importance in systematic zoology to say nothing of such novel points as the discovery of complemental males left darwin no room to reproach himself on this score and few will share his doubt whether the work was worth the consumption of so much time i p 82  in science no man can safely speculate about the nature and relation of things with which he is unacquainted at first hand and the acquirement of an intimate and practical knowledge of the process of speciesmaking and of all the uncertainties which underlie the boundaries between species and varieties drawn by even the most careful and conscientious systematists footnote after describing a set of forms as distinct species tearing up my ms and making them one species tearing that up and making them separate and then making them one again which has happened to me i have gnashed my teeth cursed species and asked what sin i had committed to be so punished ii p 40 is there any naturalist provided with a logical sense and a large suite of specimens who has not undergone pangs of the sort described in this vigorous paragraph which might with advantage be printed on the titlepage of every systematic monograph as a warning to the uninitiated were of no less importance to the author of the origin of species than was the bearing of the cirripede work upon the principles of a natural classification i p 81 no one as darwin justly observes has a right to examine the question of species who has not minutely described many ii p 39  in september 1854 the cirripede work was finished ten thousand barnacles had been sent out of the house all over the world and darwin had the satisfaction of being free to turn again to his old notes on species in 1855 he began to breed pigeons and to make observations on the effects of use and disuse experiments on seeds and so on while resuming his industrious collection of facts with a view to see how far they favour or are opposed to the notion that wild species are mutable or immutable i mean with my utmost power to give all arguments and facts on both sides i have a number of people helping me every way and giving me most valuable assistance but i often doubt whether the subject will not quite overpower me ii p 49  early in 1856 on lyells advice darwin began to write out his views on the origin of species on a scale three or four times as extensive as that of the work published in 1859 in july of the same year he gave a brief sketch of his theory in a letter to asa gray and in the year 1857 his letters to his correspondents show him to be busily engaged on what he calls his big book ii pp 85 94 in may 1857 darwin writes to wallace i am now preparing my work on the question how and in what way do species and varieties differ from each other for publication but i find the subject so very large that though i have written many chapters i do not suppose i shall go to press for two years ii p 95 in december 1857 he writes in the course of a long letter to the same correspondent i am extremely glad to hear that you are attending to distribution in accordance with theoretical ideas i am a firm believer that without speculation there is no good and original observation ii p 108 footnote the last remark contains a pregnant truth but it must be confessed it hardly squares with the declaration in the autobiography i p 83 that he worked on true baconian principles in june 1858 he received from mr wallace then in the malay archipelago an essay on the tendency of varieties to depart indefinitely from the original type of which darwin says if wallace had my ms sketch written out in 1842 he could not have made a better short abstract even his terms stand now as heads of my chapters please return me the ms which he does not say he wishes me to publish but i shall of course at once write and offer to send it to any journal so all my originality whatever it may amount to will be smashed though my book if ever it will have any value will not be deteriorated as all the labour consists in the application of the theory ii p 116  thus darwins first impulse was to publish wallaces essay without note or comment of his own but on consultation with lyell and hooker the latter of whom had read the sketch of 1844 they suggested as an undoubtedly more equitable course that extracts from the ms of 1844 and from the letter to dr asa gray should be communicated to the linnean society along with wallaces essay the joint communication was read on july 1 1858 and published under the title on the tendency of species to form varieties and on the perpetuation of varieties and species by natural means of selection this was followed on darwins part by the composition of a summary account of the conclusions to which his twenty years work on the species question had led him it occupied him for thirteen months and appeared in november 1859 under the title on the origin of species by means of natural selection or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle of life  it is doubtful if any single book except the principia ever worked so great and so rapid a revolution in science or made so deep an impression on the general mind it aroused a tempest of opposition and met with equally vehement support and it must be added that no book has been more widely and persistently misunderstood by both friends and foes in 1861 darwin remarks to a correspondent you understand my book perfectly and that i find a very rare event with my critics i p 313 the immense popularity which the origin at once acquired was no doubt largely due to its many points of contact with philosophical and theological questions in which every intelligent man feels a profound interest but a good deal must be assigned to a somewhat delusive simplicity of style which tends to disguise the complexity and difficulty of the subject and much to the wealth of information on all sorts of curious problems of natural history which is made accessible to the most unlearned reader but long occupation with the work has led the present writer to believe that the origin of species is one of the hardest of books to master footnote he is comforted to find that probably the best qualified judge among all the readers of the origin in 1859 was of the same opinion sir j hooker writes it is the very hardest book to read to full profit that i ever tried ii p 242 and he is justified in this conviction by observing that although the origin has been close on thirty years before the world the strangest misconceptions of the essential nature of the theory therein advocated are still put forth by serious writers  although then the present occasion is not suitable for any detailed criticism of the theory or of the objections which have been brought against it it may not be out of place to endeavour to separate the substance of the theory from its accidents and to show that a variety not only of hostile comments but of friendly wouldbe improvements lose their raison dêtre to the careful student observation proves the existence among all living beings of phenomena of three kinds denoted by the terms heredity variation and multiplication progeny tend to resemble their parents nevertheless all their organs and functions are susceptible of departing more or less from the average parental character and their number is in excess of that of their parents severe competition for the means of living or the struggle for existence is a necessary consequence of unlimited multiplication while selection or the preservation of favourable variations and the extinction of others is a necessary consequence of severe competition favourable variations are those which are better adapted to surrounding conditions it follows therefore that every variety which is selected into a species is so favoured and preserved in consequence of being in some one or more respects better adapted to its surroundings than its rivals in other words every species which exists exists in virtue of adaptation and whatever accounts for that adaptation accounts for the existence of the species  to say that darwin has put forward a theory of the adaptation of species but not of their origin is therefore to misunderstand the first principles of the theory for as has been pointed out it is a necessary consequence of the theory of selection that every species must have some one or more structural or functional peculiarities in virtue of the advantage conferred by which it has fought through the crowd of its competitors and achieved a certain duration in this sense it is true that every species has been originated by selection  there is another sense however in which it is equally true that selection originates nothing unless profitable variations  occur natural selection can do nothing origin ed i p 82 nothing can be effected unless favourable variations occur ibid p 108 what applies to one animal will apply throughout time to all animalsthat is if they varyfor otherwise natural selection can do nothing so it will be with plants ibid p 113 strictly speaking therefore the origin of species in general lies in variation while the origin of any particular species lies firstly in the occurrence and secondly in the selection and preservation of a particular variation clearness on this head will relieve one from the necessity of attending to the fallacious assertion that natural selection is a deus ex machinâ or occult agency  those again who confuse the operation of the natural causes which bring about variation and selection with what they are pleased to call chance can hardly have read the opening paragraph of the fifth chapter of the origin ed i p 131 i have sometimes spoken as if the variations  had been due to chance this is of course a wholly incorrect expression but it seems to acknowledge plainly our ignorance of the cause of each particular variation  another point of great importance to the right comprehension of the theory is that while every species must needs have some adaptive advantageous characters to which it owes its preservation by selection it may possess any number of others which are neither advantageous nor disadvantageous but indifferent or even slightly disadvantageous ibid p 81 for variations take place not merely in one organ or function at a time but in many and thus an advantageous variation which gives rise to the selection of a new race or species may be accompanied by others which are indifferent but which are just as strongly hereditary as the advantageous variations the advantageous structure is but one product of a modified general constitution which may manifest itself by several other products and the selective process carries the general constitution along with the advantageous special peculiarity a given species of plant may owe its existence to the selective adaptation of its flowers to insect fertilisers but the character of its leaves may be the result of variations of an indifferent character it is the origin of variations of this kind to which darwin refers in his frequent reference to what he calls laws of correlation of growth or correlated variation  these considerations lead us further to see the inappropriateness of the objections raised to darwins theory on the ground that natural selection does not account for the first commencements of useful organs but it does not pretend to do so the source of such commencements is necessarily to be sought in different variations which remain unaffected by selection until they have taken such a form as to become utilisable in the struggle for existence  it is not essential to darwins theory that anything more should be assumed than the facts of heredity variation and unlimited multiplication and the validity of the deductive reasoning as to the effect of the last that is of the struggle for existence which it involves upon the varieties resulting from the operation of the former nor is it essential that one should take up any particular position in regard to the mode of variation whether for example it takes place per saltum or gradually whether it is definite in character or indefinite still less are those who accept the theory bound to any particular views as to the causes of heredity or of variation  that darwin held strong opinions on some or all of these points may be quite true but so far as the theory is concerned they must be regarded as obiter dicta with respect to the causes of variation darwins opinions are from first to last put forward altogether tentatively in the first edition of the origin he attributes the strongest influence to changes in the conditions of life of parental organisms which he appears to think act on the germ through the intermediation of the sexual organs he points out over and over again that habit use disuse and the direct influence of conditions have some effect but he does not think it great and he draws attention to the difficulty of distinguishing between effects of these agencies and those of selection there is however one class of variations which he withdraws from the direct influence of selection namely the variations in the fertility of the sexual union of more or less closely allied forms he regards less fertility or more or less complete sterility as incidental to other acquired differences ibid p 245  considering the difficulties which surround the question of the causes of variation it is not to be wondered at that darwin should have inclined sometimes rather more to one and sometimes rather more to another of the possible alternatives there is little difference between the last edition of the origin 1872 and the first on this head in 1876 however he writes to moritz wagner in my opinion the greatest error which i have committed has been not allowing sufficient weight to the direct action of the environments ie food climate c independently of natural selection when i wrote the origin and for some years afterwards i could find little good evidence of the direct action of the environment now there is a large body of evidence and your case of the saturnia is one of the most remarkable of which i have heard iii p 159 but there is really nothing to prevent the most tenacious adherent to the theory of natural selection from taking any view he pleases as to the importance of the direct influence of conditions and the hereditary transmissibility of the modifications which they produce in fact there is a good deal to be said for the view that the socalled direct influence of conditions is itself a case of selection whether the hypothesis of pangenesis be accepted or rejected it can hardly be doubted that the struggle for existence goes on not merely between distinct organisms but between the physiological units of which each organism is composed and that changes in external conditions favour some and hinder others  after a short stay in cambridge darwin resided in london for the first five years which followed his return to england and for three years he held the post of secretary to the geological society though he shared to the full his friend lyells objection to entanglement in such engagements in fact he used to say in later life more than half in earnest that he gave up hoping for work from men who accepted official duties and especially government appointments happily for him he was exempted from the necessity of making any sacrifice of this kind but an even heavier burden was laid upon him during the earlier half of his voyage darwin retained the vigorous health of his boyhood and indeed proved himself to be exceptionally capable of enduring fatigue and privation an anomalous but severe disorder which laid him up for several weeks at valparaiso in 1834 however seems to have left its mark on his constitution and in the later years of his london life attacks of illness usually accompanied by severe vomiting and great prostration of strength became frequent as he grew older a considerable part of every day even at his best times was spent in misery while not unfrequently months of suffering rendered work of any kind impossible even darwins remarkable tenacity of purpose and methodical utilisation of every particle of available energy could not have enabled him to achieve a fraction of the vast amount of labour he got through in the course of the following forty years had not the wisest and the most loving care unceasingly surrounded him from the time of his marriage in 1839 as early as 1842 the failure of health was so marked that removal from london became imperatively necessary and darwin purchased a house and grounds at down a solitary hamlet in kent which was his home for the rest of his life under the strictly regulated conditions of a valetudinarian existence the intellectual activity of the invalid might have put to shame most healthy men and so long as he could hold his head up there was no limit to the genial kindness of thought and action for all about him those friends who were privileged to share the intimate life of the household at down have an abiding memory of the cheerful restfulness which pervaded and characterised it  after mentioning his settlement at down darwin writes in his autobiography  my chief enjoyment and sole employment throughout life has been scientific work and the excitement from such work makes me for the time forget or drives quite away my daily discomfort i have therefore nothing to record during the rest of my life except the publication of my several books i p 79  of such works published subsequently to 1859 several are monographic discussions of topics briefly dealt with in the origin which it must always be recollected was considered by the author to be merely an abstract of an opus majus  the earliest of the books which may be placed in this category on the various contrivances by which orchids are fertilised by insects was published in 1862 and whether we regard its theoretical significance the excellence of the observations and the ingenuity of the reasonings which it records or the prodigious mass of subsequent investigation of which it has been the parent it has no superior in point of importance the conviction that no theory of the origin of species could be satisfactory which failed to offer an explanation of the way in which mechanisms involving adaptations of structure and function to the performance of certain operations are brought about was from the first dominant in darwins mind as has been seen he rejected lamarcks views because of their obvious incapacity to furnish such an explanation in the case of the great majority of animal mechanisms and in that of all those presented by the vegetable world  so far back as 1793 the wonderful work of sprengel had established beyond any reasonable doubt the fact that in a large number of cases a flower is a piece of mechanism the object of which is to convert insect visitors into agents of fertilisation sprengels observations had been most undeservedly neglected and wellnigh forgotten but robert brown having directed darwins attention to them in 1841 he was attracted towards the subject and verified many of sprengels statements iii p 258 it may be doubted whether there was a living botanical specialist except perhaps brown who had done as much if however adaptations of this kind were to be explained by natural selection it was necessary to show that the plants which were provided with mechanisms for ensuring the aid of insects as fertilisers were by so much the better fitted to compete with their rivals this sprengel had not done darwin had been attending to cross fertilisation in plants so far back as 1839 from having arrived in the course of his speculations on the origin of species at the conviction that crossing played an important part in keeping specific forms constant i p 90 the further development of his views on the importance of cross fertilisation appears to have taken place between this time and 1857 when he published his first papers on the fertilisation of flowers in the gardeners chronicle if the conclusion at which he ultimately arrived that cross fertilisation is favourable to the fertility of the parent and to the vigour of the offspring is correct then it follows that all those mechanisms which hinder selffertilisation and favour crossing must be advantageous in the struggle for existence and the more perfect the action of the mechanism the greater the advantage thus the way lay open for the operation of natural selection in gradually perfecting the flower as a fertilisationtrap analogous reasoning applies to the fertilising insect the better its structure is adapted to that of the trap the more will it be able to profit by the bait whether of honey or of pollen to the exclusion of its competitors thus by a sort of action and reaction a twofold series of adaptive modifications will be brought about  in 1865 the important bearing of this subject on his theory led darwin to commence a great series of laborious and difficult experiments on the fertilisation of plants which occupied him for eleven years and furnished him with the unexpectedly strong evidence in favour of the influence of crossing which he published in 1876 under the title of the effects of cross and self fertilisation in the vegetable kingdom incidentally as it were to this heavy piece of work he made the remarkable series of observations on the different arrangements by which crossing is favoured and in many cases necessitated which appeared in the work on the different forms of flowers in plants of the same species in 1877  in the course of the twenty years during which darwin was thus occupied in opening up new regions of investigation to the botanist and showing the profound physiological significance of the apparently meaningless diversities of floral structure his attention was keenly alive to any other interesting phenomena of plant life which came in his way in his correspondence he not unfrequently laughs at himself for his ignorance of systematic botany and his acquaintance with vegetable anatomy and physiology was of the slenderest nevertheless if any of the less common features of plant life came under his notice that imperious necessity of seeking for causes which nature had laid upon him impelled and indeed compelled him to inquire the how and the why of the fact and its bearing on his general views and as happily the atavic tendency to frame hypotheses was accompanied by an equally strong need to test them by welldevised experiments and to acquire all possible information before publishing his results the effect was that he touched no topic without elucidating it  thus the investigation of the operations of insectivorous plants embodied in the work on that topic published in 1875 was started fifteen years before by a passing observation made during one of darwins rare holidays  in the summer of 1860 i was idling and resting near hartfield where two species of drosera abound and i noticed that numerous insects had been entrapped by the leaves i carried home some plants and on giving them some insects saw the movements of the tentacles and this made me think it possible that the insects were caught for some special purpose fortunately a crucial test occurred to me that of placing a large number of leaves in various nitrogenous and nonnitrogenous fluids of equal density and as soon as i found that the former alone excited energetic movements it was obvious that here was a fine new field for investigation i p 95  the researches thus initiated led to the proof that plants are capable of secreting a digestive fluid like that of animals and of profiting by the result of digestion whereby the peculiar apparatuses of the insectivorous plants were brought within the scope of natural selection moreover these inquiries widely enlarged our knowledge of the manner in which stimuli are transmitted in plants and opened up a prospect of drawing closer the analogies between the motor processes of plants and those of animals  so with respect to the books on climbing plants 1875 and on the power of movement in plants 1880 darwin says  i was led to take up this subject by reading a short paper by asa gray published in 1858 he sent me some seeds and on raising some plants i was so much fascinated and perplexed by the revolving movements of the tendrils and stems which movements are really very simple though appearing at first sight very complex that i procured various other kinds of climbing plants and studied the whole subject some of the adaptations displayed by climbing plants are as beautiful as those of orchids for ensuring crossfertilisation i p 93  in the midst of all this amount of work remarkable alike for its variety and its importance among plants the animal kingdom was by no means neglected a large moiety of the variation of animals and plants under domestication 1868 which contains the pièces justificatives of the first chapter of the origin is devoted to domestic animals and the hypothesis of pangenesis propounded in the second volume applies to the whole living world in the origin darwin throws out some suggestions as to the causes of variation but he takes heredity as it is manifested by individual organisms for granted as an ultimate fact pangenesis is an attempt to account for the phenomena of heredity in the organism on the assumption that the physiological units of which the organism is composed give off gemmules which in virtue of heredity tend to reproduce the unit from which they are derived  that darwin had the application of his theory to the origin of the human species clearly in his mind in 1859 is obvious from a passage in the first edition of the origin of species ed i p 488 in the distant future i see open fields for far more important researches psychology will be based on a new foundation that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history it is one of the curiosities of scientific literature that in the face of this plain declaration its author should have been charged with concealing his opinions on the subject of the origin of man but he reserved the full statement of his views until 1871 when the descent of man was published the expression of the emotions originally intended to form only a chapter in the descent of man grew into a separate volume which appeared in 1872 although always taking a keen interest in geology darwin naturally found no time disposable for geological work even had his health permitted it after he became seriously engaged with the great problem of species but the last of his labours is in some sense a return to his earliest inasmuch as it is an expansion of a short paper read before the geological society more than forty years before and as he says revived old geological thoughts i p 98 in fact the formation of vegetable mould through the action of worms affords as striking an example of the great results produced by the longcontinued operation of small causes as even the author of the principles of geology could have desired  in the early months of 1882 darwins health underwent a change for the worse attacks of giddiness and fainting supervened and on the 19th of april he died on the 24th his remains were interred in westminster abbey in accordance with the general feeling that such a man as he should not go to the grave without some public recognition of the greatness of his work  mr darwin became a fellow of the royal society in 1839 one of the royal medals was awarded to him in 1853 and he received the copley medal in 1864 the life and letters edited with admirable skill and judgment by mr francis darwin gives a full and singularly vivid presentment of his fathers personal character of his mode of work and of the events of his life in the present brief obituary notice the writer has attempted nothing more than to select and put together those facts which enable us to trace the intellectual evolution of one of the greatest of the many great men of science whose names adorn the long roll of the fellows of the royal society     xi  on our knowledge of the causes of the phenomena of organic nature  six lectures to working men1863    i the present condition of organic nature   when it was my duty to consider what subject i would select for the six lectures which i shall now have the pleasure of delivering to you it occurred to me that i could not do better than endeavour to put before you in a true light or in what i might perhaps with more modesty call that which i conceive myself to be the true light the position of a book which has been more praised and more abused perhaps than any book which has appeared for some yearsi mean mr darwins work on the origin of species that work i doubt not many of you have read for i know the inquiring spirit which is rife among you at any rate all of you will have heard of itsome by one kind of report and some by another kind of report the attention of all and the curiosity of all have been probably more or less excited on the subject of that work all i can do and all i shall attempt to do is to put before you that kind of judgment which has been formed by a man who of course is liable to judge erroneously but at any rate of one whose business and profession it is to form judgments upon questions of this nature  and here as it will always happen when dealing with an extensive subject the greater part of my courseif indeed so small a number of lectures can be properly called a coursemust be devoted to preliminary matters or rather to a statement of those facts and of those principles which the work itself dwells upon and brings more or less directly before us i have no right to suppose that all or any of you are naturalists and even if you were the misconceptions and misunderstandings prevalent even among naturalists on these matters would make it desirable that i should take the course i now propose to takethat i should start from the beginningthat i should endeavour to point out what is the existing state of the organic worldthat i should point out its past conditionthat i should state what is the precise nature of the undertaking which mr darwin has taken in hand that i should endeavour to show you what are the only methods by which that undertaking can be brought to an issue and to point out to you how far the author of the work in question has satisfied those conditions how far he has not satisfied them how far they are satisfiable by man and how far they are not satisfiable by man  tonight in taking up the first part of the question i shall endeavour to put before you a sort of broad notion of our knowledge of the condition of the living world there are many ways of doing this i might deal with it pictorially and graphically following the example of humboldt in his aspects of nature i might endeavour to point out the infinite variety of organic life in every mode of its existence with reference to the variations of climate and the like and such an attempt would be fraught with interest to us all but considering the subject before us such a course would not be that best calculated to assist us in an argument of this kind we must go further and dig deeper into the matter we must endeavour to look into the foundations of living nature if i may so say and discover the principles involved in some of her most secret operations i propose therefore in the first place to take some ordinary animal with which you are all familiar and by easily comprehensible and obvious examples drawn from it to show what are the kind of problems which living beings in general lay before us and i shall then show you that the same problems are laid open to us by all kinds of living beings but first let me say in what sense i have used the words organic nature in speaking of the causes which lead to our present knowledge of organic nature i have used it almost as an equivalent of the word living and for this reasonthat in almost all living beings you can distinguish several distinct portions set apart to do particular things and work in a particular way these are termed organs and the whole together is called organic and as it is universally characteristic of them the term organic has been very conveniently employed to denote the whole of living naturethe whole of the plant world and the whole of the animal world  few animals can be more familiar to you than that whose skeleton is shown on our diagram you need not bother yourselves with this equus caballus written under it that is only the latin name of it and does not make it any better it simply means the common horse suppose we wish to understand all about the horse our first object must be to study the structure of the animal the whole of his body is inclosed within a hide a skin covered with hair and if that hide or skin be taken off we find a great mass of flesh or what is technically called muscle being the substance which by its power of contraction enables the animal to move these muscles move the hard parts one upon the other and so give that strength and power of motion which renders the horse so useful to us in the performance of those services in which we employ him  and then on separating and removing the whole of this skin and flesh you have a great series of bones hard structures bound together with ligaments and forming the skeleton which is represented here  in that skeleton there are a number of parts to be recognised the long series of bones beginning from the skull and ending in the tail is called the spine and those in front are the ribs and then there are two pairs of limbs one before and one behind and there are what we all know as the forelegs and the hindlegs if we pursue our researches into the interior of this animal we find within the framework of the skeleton a great cavity or rather i should say two great cavitiesone cavity beginning in the skull and running through the neckbones along the spine and ending in the tail containing the brain and the spinal marrow which are extremely important organs the second great cavity commencing with the mouth contains the gullet the stomach the long intestine and all the rest of those internal apparatus which are essential for digestion and then in the same great cavity there are lodged the heart and all the great vessels going from it and besides that the organs of respirationthe lungs and then the kidneys and the organs of reproduction and so on let us now endeavour to reduce this notion of a horse that we now have to some such kind of simple expressions as can be at once and without difficulty retained in the mind apart from all minor details if i make a transverse section that is if i were to saw a dead horse across i should find that if i left out the details and supposing i took my section through the anterior region and through the forelimbs i should have here this kind of section of the body fig 1  illustration fig 1  here would be the upper part of the animalthat great mass of bones that we spoke of as the spine a fig 1 here i should have the alimentary canal b fig 1 here i should have the heart c fig 1 and then you see there would be a kind of double tube the whole being inclosed within the hide the spinal marrow would be placed in the upper tube a fig 1 and in the lower tube d d fig 1 there would be the alimentary canal b and the heart e and here i shall have the legs proceeding from each side for simplicitys sake i represent them merely as stumps e e fig 1 now that is a horseas mathematicians would sayreduced to its most simple expression carry that in your minds if you please as a simplified idea of the structure of the horse the considerations which i have now put before you belong to what we technically call the anatomy of the horse now suppose we go to work upon these several partsflesh and hair and skin and bone and lay open these various organs with our scalpels and examine them by means of our magnifyingglasses and see what we can make of them we shall find that the flesh is made up of bundles of strong fibres the brain and nerves too we shall find are made up of fibres and these queerlooking things that are called ganglionic corpuscles if we take a slice of the bone and examine it we shall find that it is very like this diagram of a section of the bone of on ostrich though differing of course in some details and if we take any part whatsoever of the tissue and examine it we shall find it all has a minute structure visible only under the microscope all these parts constitute microscopic anatomy or histology these parts are constantly being changed every part is constantly growing decaying and being replaced during the life of the animal the tissue is constantly replaced by new material and if you go back to the young state of the tissue in the case of muscle or in the case of skin or any of the organs i have mentioned you will find that they all come under the same condition every one of these microscopic filaments and fibres i now speak merely of the general character of the whole processevery one of these partscould be traced down to some modification of a tissue which can be readily divided into little particles of fleshy matter of that substance which is composed of the chemical elements carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen having such a shape as this fig 2 these particles into which all primitive tissues break up are called cells if i were to make a section of a piece of the skin of my hand i should find that it was made up of these cells if i examine the fibres which form the various organs of all living animals i should find that all of them at one time or other had been formed out of a substance consisting of similar elements so that you see just as we reduced the whole body in the gross to that sort of simple expression given in fig 1 so we may reduce the whole of the microscopic structural elements to a form of even greater simplicity just as the plan of the whole body may be so represented in a sense fig 1 so the primary structure of every tissue may be represented by a mass of cells fig 2  illustration fig 2  having thus in this sort of general way sketched to you what i may call perhaps the architecture of the body of the horse what we term technically its morphology i must now turn to another aspect a horse is not a mere dead structure it is an active living working machine hitherto we have as it were been looking at a steamengine with the fires out and nothing in the boiler but the body of the living animal is a beautifullyformed active machine and every part has its different work to do in the working of that machine which is what we call its life the horse if you see him after his days work is done is cropping the grass in the fields as it may be or munching the oats in his stable what is he doing his jaws are working as a milland a very complex mill toogrinding the corn or crushing the grass to a pulp as soon as that operation has taken place the food is passed down to the stomach and there it is mixed with the chemical fluid called the gastric juice a substance which has the peculiar property of making soluble and dissolving out the nutritious matter in the grass and leaving behind those parts which are not nutritious so that you have first the mill then a sort of chemical digester and then the food thus partially dissolved is carried back by the muscular contractions of the intestines into the hinder parts of the body while the soluble portions are taken up into the blood the blood is contained in a vast system of pipes spreading through the whole body connected with a forcepumpthe heartwhich by its position and by the contractions of its valves keeps the blood constantly circulating in one direction never allowing it to rest and then by means of this circulation of the blood laden as it is with the products of digestion the skin the flesh the hair and every other part of the body draws from it that which it wants and every one of these organs derives those materials which are necessary to enable it to do its work  the action of each of these organs the performance of each of these various duties involve in their operation a continual absorption of the matters necessary for their support from the blood and a constant formation of waste products which are returned to the blood and conveyed by it to the lungs and the kidneys which are organs that have allotted to them the office of extracting separating and getting rid of these waste products and thus the general nourishment labour and repair of the whole machine are kept up with order and regularity but not only is it a machine which feeds and appropriates to its own support the nourishment necessary to its existenceit is an engine for locomotive purposes the horse desires to go from one place to another and to enable it to do this it has those strong contractile bundles of muscles attached to the bones of its limbs which are put in motion by means of a sort of telegraphic apparatus formed by the brain and the great spinal cord running through the spine or backbone and to this spinal cord are attached a number of fibres termed nerves which proceed to all parts of the structure by means of these the eyes nose tongue and skinall the organs of perceptiontransmit impressions or sensations to the brain which acts as a sort of great central telegraphoffice receiving impressions and sending messages to all parts of the body and putting in motion the muscles necessary to accomplish any movement that maybe desired so that you have here an extremely complex and beautifullyproportioned machine with all its parts working harmoniously together towards one common objectthe preservation of the life of the animal  now note this the horse makes up its waste by feeding and its food is grass or oats or perhaps other vegetable products therefore in the long run the source of all this complex machinery lies in the vegetable kingdom but where does the grass or the oat or any other plant obtain this nourishing foodproducing material at first it is a little seed which soon begins to draw into itself from the earth and the surrounding air matters which in themselves contain no vital properties whatever it absorbs into its own substance water an inorganic body it draws into its substance carbonic acid an inorganic matter and ammonia another inorganic matter found in the air and then by some wonderful chemical process the details of which chemists do not yet understand though they are near foreshadowing them it combines them into one substance which is known to us as protein a complex compound of carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen which alone possesses the property of manifesting vitality and of permanently supporting animal life so that you see the waste products of the animal economy the effete materials which are continually being thrown off by all living beings in the form of organic matters are constantly replaced by supplies of the necessary repairing and rebuilding materials drawn from the plants which in their turn manufacture them so to speak by a mysterious combination of those same inorganic materials  let us trace out the history of the horse in another direction after a certain time as the result of sickness or disease the effect of accident or the consequence of old age sooner or later the animal dies the multitudinous operations of this beautiful mechanism flag in their performance the horse loses its vigour and after passing through the curious series of changes comprised in its formation and preservation it finally decays and ends its life by going back into that inorganic world from which all but an inappreciable fraction of its substance was derived its bones become mere carbonate and phosphate of lime the matter of its flesh and of its other parts becomes in the long run converted into carbonic acid into water and into ammonia you will now perhaps understand the curious relation of the animal with the plant of the organic with the inorganic world which is shown in this diagram  illustration inorganic world fig 3  the plant gathers these inorganic materials together and makes them up into its own substance the animal eats the plant and appropriates the nutritious portions to its own sustenance rejects and gets rid of the useless matters and finally the animal itself dies and its whole body is decomposed and returned into the inorganic world there is thus a constant circulation from one to the other a continual formation of organic life from inorganic matters and as constant a return of the matter of living bodies to the inorganic world so that the materials of which our bodies are composed are largely in all probability the substances which constituted the matter of long extinct creations but which have in the interval constituted a part of the inorganic world  thus we come to the conclusion strange at first sight that the matter constituting the living world is identical with that which forms the inorganic world and not less true is it that remarkable as are the powers or in other words as are the forces which are exerted by living beings yet all these forces are either identical with those which exist in the inorganic world or they are convertible into them i mean in just the same sense as the researches of physical philosophers have shown that heat is convertible into electricity that electricity is convertible into magnetism magnetism into mechanical force or chemical force and any one of them with the other each being measurable in terms of the othereven so i say that great law is applicable to the living world consider why is the skeleton of this horse capable of supporting the masses of flesh and the various organs forming the living body unless it is because of the action of the same forces of cohesion which combines together the particles of matter composing this piece of chalk what is there in the muscular contractile power of the animal but the force which is expressible and which is in a certain sense convertible into the force of gravity which it overcomes or if you go to more hidden processes in what does the process of digestion differ from those processes which are carried on in the laboratory of the chemist even if we take the most recondite and most complex operations of animal lifethose of the nervous system these of late years have been shown to bei do not say identical in any sense with the electrical processesbut this has been shown that they are in some way or other associated with them that is to say that every amount of nervous action is accompanied by a certain amount of electrical disturbance in the particles of the nerves in which that nervous action is carried on in this way the nervous action is related to electricity in the same way that heat is related to electricity and the same sort of argument which demonstrates the two latter to be related to one another shows that the nervous forces are correlated to electricity for the experiments of m dubois reymond and others have shown that whenever a nerve is in a state of excitement sending a message to the muscles or conveying an impression to the brain there is a disturbance of the electrical condition of that nerve which does not exist at other times and there are a number of other facts and phenomena of that sort so that we come to the broad conclusion that not only as to living matter itself but as to the forces that matter exerts there is a close relationship between the organic and the inorganic worldthe difference between them arising from the diverse combination and disposition of identical forces and not from any primary diversity so far as we can see  i said just now that the horse eventually died and became converted into the same inorganic substances from whence all but an inappreciable fraction of its substance demonstrably originated so that the actual wanderings of matter are as remarkable as the transmigrations of the soul fabled by indian tradition but before death has occurred in the one sex or the other and in fact in both certain products or parts of the organism have been set free certain parts of the organisms of the two sexes have come into contact with one another and from that conjunction from that union which then takes place there results the formation of a new being at stated times the mare from a particular part of the interior of her body called the ovary gets rid of a minute particle of matter comparable in all essential respects with that which we called a cell a little while since which cell contains a kind of nucleus in its centre surrounded by a clear space and by a viscid mass of protein substance fig 2 and though it is different in appearance from the eggs which we are mostly acquainted with it is really an egg after a time this minute particle of matter which may only be a small fraction of a grain in weight undergoes a series of changeswonderful complex changes finally upon its surface there is fashioned a little elevation which afterwards becomes divided and marked by a groove the lateral boundaries of the groove extend upwards and downwards and at length give rise to a double tube in the upper and smaller tube the spinal marrow and brain are fashioned in the lower the alimentary canal and heart and at length two pairs of buds shoot out at the sides of the body and they are the rudiments of the limbs in fact a true drawing of a section of the embryo in this state would in all essential respects resemble that diagram of a horse reduced to its simplest expression which i first placed before you fig 1  slowly and gradually these changes take place the whole of the body at first can be broken up into cells which become in one place metamorphosed into musclein another place into gristle and bonein another place into fibrous tissueand in another into hair every part becoming gradually and slowly fashioned as if there were an artificer at work in each of these complex structures that i have mentioned this embryo as it is called then passes into other conditions i should tell you that there is a time when the embryos of neither dog nor horse nor porpoise nor monkey nor man can be distinguished by any essential feature one from the other there is a time when they each and all of them resemble this one of the dog but as development advances all the parts acquire their speciality till at length you have the embryo converted into the form of the parent from which it started so that you see this living animal this horse begins its existence as a minute particle of nitrogenous matter which being supplied with nutriment derived as i have shown from the inorganic world grows up according to the special type and construction of its parents works and undergoes a constant waste and that waste is made good by nutriment derived from the inorganic world the waste given off in this way being directly added to the inorganic world eventually the animal itself dies and by the process of decomposition its whole body is returned to those conditions of inorganic matter in which its substance originated  this then is that which is true of every living form from the lowest plant to the highest animalto man himself you might define the life of every one in exactly the same terms as those which i have now used the difference between the highest and the lowest being simply in the complexity of the developmental changes the variety of the structural forms and the diversity of the physiological functions which are exerted by each  if i were to take an oak tree as a specimen of the plant world i should find that it originated in an acorn which too commenced in a cell the acorn is placed in the ground and it very speedily begins to absorb the inorganic matters i have named adds enormously to its bulk and we can see it year after year extending itself upward and downward attracting and appropriating to itself inorganic materials which it vivifies and eventually as it ripens gives off its own proper acorns which again run the same course but i need not multiply examplesfrom the highest to the lowest the essential features of life are the same as i have described in each of these cases  so much then for these particular features of the organic world which you can understand and comprehend so long as you confine yourself to one sort of living being and study that only  but as you know horses are not the only living creatures in the world and again horses like all other animals have certain limitsare confined to a certain area on the surface of the earth on which we liveand as that is the simpler matter i may take that first in its wild state and before the discovery of america when the natural state of things was interfered with by the spaniards the horse was only to be found in parts of the earth which are known to geographers as the old world that is to say you might meet with horses in europe asia or africa but there were none in australia and there were none whatsoever in the whole continent of america from labrador down to cape horn this is an empirical fact and it is what is called stated in the way i have given it you the geographical distribution of the horse  why horses should be found in europe asia and africa and not in america is not obvious the explanation that the conditions of life in america are unfavourable to their existence and that therefore they had not been created there evidently does not apply for when the invading spaniards or our own yeomen farmers conveyed horses to these countries for their own use they were found to thrive well and multiply very rapidly and many are even now running wild in those countries and in a perfectly natural condition now suppose we were to do for every animal what we have here done for the horsethat is to mark off and distinguish the particular district or region to which each belonged and supposing we tabulated all these results that would be called the geographical distribution of animals while a corresponding study of plants would yield as a result the geographical distribution of plants  i pass on from that now as i merely wished to explain to you what i meant by the use of the term geographical distribution as i said there is another aspect and a much more important one and that is the relations of the various animals to one another the horse is a very welldefined matteroffact sort of animal and we are all pretty familiar with its structure i dare say it may have struck you that it resembles very much no other member of the animal kingdom except perhaps the zebra or the ass but let me ask you to look along these diagrams here is the skeleton of the horse and here the skeleton of the dog you will notice that we have in the horse a skull a backbone and ribs shoulderblades and haunchbones in the forelimb one upper armbone two fore armbones wristbones wrongly called knee and middle handbones ending in the three bones of a finger the last of which is sheathed in the horny hoof of the forefoot in the hindlimb one thighbone two legbones anklebones and middle footbones ending in the three bones of a toe the last of which is encased in the hoof of the hindfoot now turn to the dogs skeleton we find identically the same bones but more of them there being more toes in each foot and hence more toebones  well that is a very curious thing the fact is that the dog and the horsewhen one gets a look at them without the outward impediments of the skinare found to be made in very much the same sort of fashion and if i were to make a transverse section of the dog i should find the same organs that i have already shown you as forming parts of the horse well here is another skeletonthat of a kind of lemuryou see he has just the same bones and if i were to make a transverse section of it it would be just the same again in your minds eye turn him round so as to put his backbone in a position inclined obliquely upwards and forwards just as in the next three diagrams which represent the skeletons of an orang a chimpanzee and a gorilla and you find you have no trouble in identifying the bones throughout and lastly turn to the end of the series the diagram representing a mans skeleton and still you find no great structural feature essentially altered there are the same bones in the same relations from the horse we pass on and on with gradual steps until we arrive at last at the highest known forms on the other hand take the other line of diagrams and pass from the horse downwards in the scale to this fish and still though the modifications are vastly greater the essential framework of the organisation remains unchanged here for instance is a porpoise here is its strong backbone with the cavity running through it which contains the spinal cord here are the ribs here the shoulderblade here is the little short upperarm bone here are the two forearm bones the wristbone and the fingerbones  strange is it not that the porpoise should have in this queerlooking affairits flapper as it is called the same fundamental elements as the foreleg of the horse or the dog or the ape or man and here you will notice a very curious thingthe hinder limbs are absent now let us make another jump let us go to the codfish here you see is the forearm in this large pectoral fincarrying your minds eye onward from the flapper of the porpoise and here you have the hinder limbs restored in the shape of these ventral fins if i were to make a transverse section of this i should find just the same organs that we have before noticed so that you see there comes out this strange conclusion as the result of our investigations that the horse when examined and compared with other animals is found by no means to stand alone in nature but that there are an enormous number of other creatures which have backbones ribs and legs and other parts arranged in the same general manner and in all their formation exhibiting the same broad peculiarities  i am sure that you cannot have followed me even in this extremely elementary exposition of the structural relations of animals without seeing what i have been driving at all through which is to show you that step by step naturalists have come to the idea of a unity of plan or conformity of construction among animals which appeared at first sight to be extremely dissimilar  and here you have evidence of such a unity of plan among all the animals which have backbones and which we technically call vertebrata but there are multitudes of other animals such as crabs lobsters spiders and so on which we term annulosa in these i could not point out to you the parts that correspond with those of the horsethe backbone for instanceas they are constructed upon a very different principle which is also common to all of them that is to say the lobster the spider and the centipede have a common plan running through their whole arrangement in just the same way that the horse the dog and the porpoise assimilate to each other  yet other creatureswhelks cuttlefishes oysters snails and all their tribe molluscaresemble one another in the same way but differ from both vertebrata and annulosa and the like is true of the animals called coelenterata polypes and protozoa animalcules and sponges  now by pursuing this sort of comparison naturalists have arrived at the conviction that there aresome think five and some sevenbut certainly not more than the latter numberand perhaps it is simpler to assume fivedistinct plans or constructions in the whole of the animal world and that the hundreds of thousands of species of creatures on the surface of the earth are all reducible to those five or at most seven plans of organisation  but can we go no further than that when one has got so far one is tempted to go on a step and inquire whether we cannot go back yet further and bring down the whole to modifications of one primordial unit the anatomist cannot do this but if he call to his aid the study of development he can do it for we shall find that distinct as those plans are whether it be a porpoise or man or lobster or any of those other kinds i have mentioned every one begins its existence with one and the same primitive formthat of the egg consisting as we have seen of a nitrogenous substance having a small particle or nucleus in the centre of it furthermore the earlier changes of each are substantially the same and it is in this that lies that true unity of organisation of the animal kingdom which has been guessed at and fancied for many years but which it has been left to the present time to be demonstrated by the careful study of development but is it possible to go another step further still and to show that in the same way the whole of the organic world is reducible to one primitive condition of form is there among the plants the same primitive form of organisation and is that identical with that of the animal kingdom the reply to that question too is not uncertain or doubtful it is now proved that every plant begins its existence under the same form that is to say in that of a cella particle of nitrogenous matter having substantially the same conditions so that if you trace back the oak to its first germ or a man or a horse or lobster or oyster or any other animal you choose to name you shall find each and all of these commencing their existence in forms essentially similar to each other and furthermore that the first processes of growth and many of the subsequent modifications are essentially the same in principle in almost all  in conclusion let me in a few words recapitulate the positions which i have laid down and you must understand that i have not been talking mere theory i have been speaking of matters which are as plainly demonstrable as the commonest propositions of euclidof facts that must form the basis of all speculations and beliefs in biological science we have gradually traced down all organic forms or in other words we have analysed the present condition of animated nature until we found that each species took its origin in a form similar to that under which all the others commenced their existence we have found the whole of the vast array of living forms with which we are surrounded constantly growing increasing decaying and disappearing the animal constantly attracting modifying and applying to its sustenance the matter of the vegetable kingdom which derived its support from the absorption and conversion of inorganic matter and so constant and universal is this absorption waste and reproduction that it may be said with perfect certainty that there is left in no one of our bodies at the present moment a millionth part of the matter of which they were originally formed we have seen again that not only is the living matter derived from the inorganic world but that the forces of that matter are all of them correlative with and convertible into those of inorganic nature  this for our present purposes is the best view of the present condition of organic nature which i can lay before you it gives you the great outlines of a vast picture which you must fill up by your own study  in the next lecture i shall endeavour in the same way to go back into the past and to sketch in the same broad manner the history of life in epochs preceding our own    ii the past condition of organic nature   in the lecture which i delivered last monday evening i endeavoured to sketch in a very brief manner but as well as the time at my disposal would permit the present condition of organic nature meaning by that large title simply an indication of the great broad and general principles which are to be discovered by those who look attentively at the phenomena of organic nature as at present displayed the general result of our investigations might be summed up thus we found that the multiplicity of the forms of animal life great as that may be may be reduced to a comparatively few primitive plans or types of construction that a further study of the development of those different forms revealed to us that they were again reducible until we at last brought the infinite diversity of animal and even vegetable life down to the primordial form of a single cell  we found that our analysis of the organic world whether animals or plants showed in the long run that they might both be reduced into and were in fact composed of the same constituents and we saw that the plant obtained the materials constituting its substance by a peculiar combination of matters belonging entirely to the inorganic world that then the animal was constantly appropriating the nitrogenous matters of the plant to its own nourishment and returning them back to the inorganic world in what we spoke of as its waste and that finally when the animal ceased to exist the constituents of its body were dissolved and transmitted to that inorganic world whence they had been at first abstracted thus we saw in both the blade of grass and the horse but the same elements differently combined and arranged we discovered a continual circulation going onthe plant drawing in the elements of inorganic nature and combining them into food for the animal creation the animal borrowing from the plant the matter for its own support giving off during its life products which returned immediately to the inorganic world and that eventually the constituent materials of the whole structure of both animals and plants were thus returned to their original source there was a constant passage from one state of existence to another and a returning back again  lastly when we endeavoured to form some notion of the nature of the forces exercised by living beings we discovered that theyif not capable of being subjected to the same minute analysis as the constituents of those beings themselvesthat they were correlative withthat they were the equivalents of the forces of inorganic naturethat they were in the sense in which the term is now used convertible with them that was our general result  and now leaving the present i must endeavour in the same manner to put before you the facts that are to be discovered in the past history of the living world in the past conditions of organic nature we have tonight to deal with the facts of that historya history involving periods of time before which our mere human records sink into utter insignificancea history the variety and physical magnitude of whose events cannot even be foreshadowed by the history of human life and human phenomenaa history of the most varied and complex character  we must deal with the history then in the first place as we should deal with all other histories the historical student knows that his first business should be to inquire into the validity of his evidence and the nature of the record in which the evidence is contained that he may be able to form a proper estimate of the correctness of the conclusions which have been drawn from that evidence so here we must pass in the first place to the consideration of a matter which may seem foreign to the question under discussion we must dwell upon the nature of the records and the credibility of the evidence they contain we must look to the completeness or incompleteness of those records themselves before we turn to that which they contain and reveal the question of the credibility of the history happily for us will not require much consideration for in this history unlike those of human origin there can be no cavilling no differences as to the reality and truth of the facts of which it is made up the facts state themselves and are laid out clearly before us  but although one of the greatest difficulties of the historical student is cleared out of our path there are other difficultiesdifficulties in rightly interpreting the facts as they are presented to uswhich may be compared with the greatest difficulties of any other kinds of historical study  what is this record of the past history of the globe and what are the questions which are involved in an inquiry into its completeness or incompleteness that record is composed of mud and the question which we have to investigate this evening resolves itself into a question of the formation of mud you may think perhaps that this is a vast stepof almost from the sublime to the ridiculousfrom the contemplation of the history of the past ages of the worlds existence to the consideration of the history of the formation of mud but in nature there is nothing mean and unworthy of attention there is nothing ridiculous or contemptible in any of her works and this inquiry you will soon see i hope takes us to the very root and foundations of our subject  how then is mud formed always with some trifling exceptions which i need not consider nowalways as the result of the action of water wearing down and disintegrating the surface of the earth and rocks with which it comes in contactpounding and grinding it down and carrying the particles away to places where they cease to be disturbed by this mechanical action and where they can subside and rest for the ocean urged by winds washes as we know a long extent of coast and every wave loaded as it is with particles of sand and gravel as it breaks upon the shore does something towards the disintegrating process and thus slowly but surely the hardest rocks are gradually ground down to a powdery substance and the mud thus formed coarser or finer as the case may be is carried by the rush of the tides or currents till it reaches the comparatively deeper parts of the ocean in which it can sink to the bottom that is to parts where there is a depth of about fourteen or fifteen fathoms a depth at which the water is usually nearly motionless and in which of course the finer particles of this detritus or mud as we call it sinks to the bottom  or again if you take a river rushing down from its mountain sources brawling over the stones and rocks that intersect its path loosening removing and carrying with it in its downward course the pebbles and lighter matters from its banks it crushes and pounds down the rocks and earths in precisely the same way as the wearing action of the sea waves the matters forming the deposit are torn from the mountainside and whirled impetuously into the valley more slowly over the plain thence into the estuary and from the estuary they are swept into the sea the coarser and heavier fragments are obviously deposited first that is as soon as the current begins to lose its force by becoming amalgamated with the stiller depths of the ocean but the finer and lighter particles are carried further on and eventually deposited in a deeper and stiller portion of the ocean  it clearly follows from this that mud gives us a chronology for it is evident that supposing this which i now sketch to be the sea bottom and supposing this to be a coastline from the washing action of the sea upon the rock wearing and grinding it down into a sediment of mud the mud will be carried down and at length deposited in the deeper parts of this sea bottom where it will form a layer and then while that first layer is hardening other mud which is coming from the same source will of course be carried to the same place and as it is quite impossible for it to get beneath the layer already there it deposits itself above it and forms another layer and in that way you gradually have layers of mud constantly forming and hardening one above the other and conveying a record of time  it is a necessary result of the operation of the law of gravitation that the uppermost layer shall be the youngest and the lowest the oldest and that the different beds shall be older at any particular point or spot in exactly the ratio of their depth from the surface so that if they were upheaved afterwards and you had a series of these different layers of mud converted into sandstone or limestone as the case might be you might be sure that the bottom layer was deposited first and that the upper layers were formed afterwards here you see is the first step in the historythese layers of mud give us an idea of time  the whole surface of the earthi speak broadly and leave out minor qualificationsis made up of such layers of mud so hard the majority of them that we call them rock whether limestone or sandstone or other varieties of rock and seeing that every part of the crust of the earth is made up in this way you might think that the determination of the chronology the fixing of the time which it has taken to form this crust is a comparatively simple matter take a broad average ascertain how fast the mud is deposited upon the bottom of the sea or in the estuary of rivers take it to be an inch or two or three inches a year or whatever you may roughly estimate it at then take the total thickness of the whole series of stratified rocks which geologists estimate at twelve or thirteen miles or about seventy thousand feet make a sum in short division divide the total thickness by that of the quantity deposited in one year and the result will of course give you the number of years which the crust has taken to form  truly that looks a very simple process it would be so except for certain difficulties the very first of which is that of finding how rapidly sediments are deposited but the main difficultya difficulty which renders any certain calculations of such a matter out of the questionis this the seabottom on which the deposit takes place is continually shifting  instead of the surface of the earth being that stable fixed thing that it is popularly believed to be being in common parlance the very emblem of fixity itself it is incessantly moving and is in fact as unstable as the surface of the sea except that its undulations are infinitely slower and enormously higher and deeper  now what is the effect of this oscillation take the case to which i have previously referred the finer or coarser sediments that are carried down by the current of the river will only be carried out a certain distance and eventually as we have already seen on reaching the stiller part of the ocean will be deposited at the bottom  illustration fig 4  let c y fig 4 be the seabottom y d the shore x y the sealevel then the coarser deposit will subside over the region b the finer over a while beyond a there will be no deposit at all and consequently no record will be kept simply because no deposit is going on now suppose that the whole land c d which we have regarded as stationary goes down as it does so both a and b go further out from the shore which will be at y1 x1 y1 being the new sealevel the consequence will be that the layer of mud a being now for the most part further than the force of the current is strong enough to convey even the finest débris will of course receive no more deposits and having attained a certain thickness will now grow no thicker  we should be misled in taking the thickness of that layer whenever it may be exposed to our view as a record of time in the manner in which we are now regarding this subject as it would give us only an imperfect and partial record it would seem to represent too short a period of time  suppose on the other hand that the land c d had gone on rising slowly and graduallysay an inch or two inches in the course of a centurywhat would be the practical effect of that movement why that the sediment a and b which has been already deposited would eventually be brought nearer to the shorelevel and again subjected to the wear and tear of the sea and directly the sea begins to act upon it it would of course soon cut up and carry it way to a greater or less extent to be redeposited further out  well as there is in all probability not one single spot on the whole surface of the earth which has not been up and down in this way a great many times it follows that the thickness of the deposits formed at any particular spot cannot be taken even supposing we had at first obtained correct data as to the rate at which they took place as affording reliable information as to the period of time occupied in its deposit so that you see it is absolutely necessary from these facts seeing that our record entirely consists of accumulations of mud superimposed one on the other seeing in the next place that any particular spots on which accumulations have occurred have been constantly moving up and down and sometimes out of the reach of a deposit and at other times its own deposit broken up and carried away it follows that our record must be in the highest degree imperfect and we have hardly a trace left of thick deposits or any definite knowledge of the area that they occupied in a great many cases and mark this that supposing even that the whole surface of the earth had been accessible to the geologistthat man had had access to every part of the earth and had made sections of the whole and put them all togethereven then his record must of necessity be imperfect  but to how much has man really access if you will look at this map you will see that it represents the proportion of the sea to the earth this coloured part indicates all the dry land and this other portion is the water you will notice at once that the water covers threefifths of the whole surface of the globe and has covered it in the same manner ever since man has kept any record of his own observations to say nothing of the minute period during which he has cultivated geological inquiry so that threefifths of the surface of the earth is shut out from us because it is under the sea let us look at the other twofifths and see what are the countries in which anything that may be termed searching geological inquiry has been carried out a good deal of france germany and great britain and ireland bits of spain of italy and of russia have been examined but of the whole great mass of africa except parts of the southern extremity we know next to nothing little bits of india but of the greater part of the asiatic continent nothing bits of the northern american states and of canada but of the greater part of the continent of north america and in still larger proportion of south america nothing  under these circumstances it follows that even with reference to that kind of imperfect information which we can possess it is only of about the tenthousandth part of the accessible parts of the earth that has been examined properly therefore it is with justice that the most thoughtful of those who are concerned in these inquiries insist continually upon the imperfection of the geological record for i repeat it is absolutely necessary from the nature of things that that record should be of the most fragmentary and imperfect character unfortunately this circumstance has been constantly forgotten men of science like young colts in a fresh pasture are apt to be exhilarated on being turned into a new field of inquiry to go off at a handgallop in total disregard of hedges and ditches to lose sight of the real limitation of their inquiries and to forget the extreme imperfection of what is really known geologists have imagined that they could tell us what was going on at all parts of the earths surface during a given epoch they have talked of this deposit being contemporaneous with that deposit until from our little local histories of the changes at limited spots of the earths surface they have constructed a universal history of the globe as full of wonders and portents as any other story of antiquity  but what does this attempt to construct a universal history of the globe imply it implies that we shall not only have a precise knowledge of the events which have occurred at any particular point but that we shall be able to say what events at any one spot took place at the same time with those at other spots  let us see how far that is in the nature of things practicable suppose that here i make a section of the lake of killarney and here the section of another lakethat of loch lomond in scotland for instance the rivers that flow into them are constantly carrying down deposits of mud and beds or strata are being as constantly formed one above the other at the bottom of those lakes now there is not a shadow of doubt that in these two lakes the lower beds are all older than the upperthere is no doubt about that but what does this tell us about the age of any given bed in loch lomond as compared with that of any given bed in the lake of killarney it is indeed obvious that if any two sets of deposits are separated and discontinuous there is absolutely no means whatever given you by the nature of the deposit of saying whether one is much younger or older than the other but you may say as many have said and think that the case is very much altered if the beds which we are comparing are continuous suppose two beds of mud hardened into rocka and bare seen in section fig 5  illustration fig 5  well you say it is admitted that the lowermost bed is always the older very well b therefore is older than a no doubt as a whole it is so or if any parts of the two beds which are in the same vertical line are compared it is so but suppose you take what seems a very natural step further and say that the part a of the bed a is younger than the part b of the bed b is this sound reasoning if you find any record of changes taking place at b did they occur before any events which took place while a was being deposited it looks all very plain sailing indeed to say that they did and yet there is no proof of anything of the kind as the former director of this institution sir h de la beche long ago showed this reasoning may involve an entire fallacy it is extremely possible that a may have been deposited ages before b it is very easy to understand how that can be to return to fig 4 when a and b were deposited they were substantially contemporaneous a being simply the finer deposit and b the coarser of the same detritus or waste of land now suppose that that seabottom goes down as shown in fig 4 so that the first deposit is carried no farther than a forming the bed a1 and the coarse no farther than b forming the bed b1 the result will be the formation of two continuous beds one of fine sediment a a1 overlapping another of coarse sediment b b1 now suppose the whole seabottom is raised up and a section exposed about the point a1 no doubt at this spot the upper bed is younger than the lower but we should obviously greatly err if we concluded that the mass of the upper bed at a was younger than the lower bed at b for we have just seen that they are contemporaneous deposits still more should we be in error if we supposed the upper bed at a to be younger than the continuation of the lower bed at b1 for a was deposited long before b1 in fine if instead of comparing immediately adjacent parts of two beds one of which lies upon another we compare distant parts it is quite possible that the upper may be any number of years older than the under and the under any number of years younger than the upper  now you must not suppose that i put this before you for the purpose of raising a paradoxical difficulty the fact is that the great mass of deposits have taken place in seabottoms which are gradually sinking and have been formed under the very conditions i am here supposing  do not run away with the notion that this subverts the principle i laid down at first the error lies in extending a principle which is perfectly applicable to deposits in the same vertical line to deposits which are not in that relation to one another  it is in consequence of circumstances of this kind and of others that i might mention to you that our conclusions on and interpretations of the record are really and strictly only valid so long as we confine ourselves to one vertical section i do not mean to tell you that there are no qualifying circumstances so that even in very considerable areas we may safely speak of conformably superimposed beds being older or younger than others at many different points but we can never be quite sure in coming to that conclusion and especially we cannot be sure if there is any break in their continuity or any very great distance between the points to be compared  well now so much for the record itselfso much for its imperfectionsso much for the conditions to be observed in interpreting it and its chronological indications the moment we pass beyond the limits of a vertical linear section  now let us pass from the record to that which it containsfrom the book itself to the writing and the figures on its pages this writing and these figures consist of remains of animals and plants which in the great majority of cases have lived and died in the very spot in which we now find them or at least in the immediate vicinity you must all of you be awareand i referred to the fact in my last lecturethat there are vast numbers of creatures living at the bottom of the sea these creatures like all others sooner or later die and their shells and hard parts lie at the bottom and then the fine mud which is being constantly brought down by rivers and the action of the wear and tear of the sea covers them over and protects them from any further change or alteration and of course as in process of time the mud becomes hardened and solidified the shells of these animals are preserved and firmly imbedded in the limestone or sandstone which is being thus formed you may see in the galleries of the museum up stairs specimens of limestones in which such fossil remains of existing animals are imbedded there are some specimens in which turtles eggs have been imbedded in calcareous sand and before the sun had hatched the young turtles they became covered over with calcareous mud and thus have been preserved and fossilised  not only does this process of imbedding and fossilisation occur with marine and other aquatic animals and plants but it affects those land animals and plants which are drifted away to sea or become buried in bogs or morasses and the animals which have been trodden down by their fellows and crushed in the mud at the rivers bank as the herd have come to drink in any of these cases the organisms may be crushed or be mutilated before or after putrefaction in such a manner that perhaps only a part will be left in the form in which it reaches us it is indeed a most remarkable fact that it is quite an exceptional case to find a skeleton of any one of all the thousands of wild land animals that we know are constantly being killed or dying in the course of nature they are preyed on and devoured by other animals or die in places where their bodies are not afterwards protected by mud there are other animals existing on the sea the shells of which form exceedingly large deposits you are probably aware that before the attempt was made to lay the atlantic telegraphic cable the government employed vessels in making a series of very careful observations and soundings of the bottom of the atlantic and although as we must all regret that up to the present time that project has not succeeded we have the satisfaction of knowing that it yielded some most remarkable results to science the atlantic ocean had to be sounded right across to depths of several miles in some places and the nature of its bottom was carefully ascertained well now a space of about 1000 miles wide from east to west and i do not exactly know how many from north to south but at any rate 600 or 700 miles was carefully examined and it was found that over the whole of that immense area an excessively fine chalky mud is being deposited and this deposit is entirely made up of animals whose hard parts are deposited in this part of the ocean and are doubtless gradually acquiring solidity and becoming metamorphosed into a chalky limestone thus you see it is quite possible in this way to preserve unmistakable records of animal and vegetable life whenever the seabottom by some of those undulations of the earths crust that i have referred to becomes upheaved and sections or borings are made or pits are dug then we become able to examine the contents and constituents of these ancient seabottoms and find out what manner of animals lived at that period  now it is a very important consideration in its bearing on the completeness of the record to inquire how far the remains contained in these fossiliferous limestones are able to convey anything like an accurate or complete account of the animals which were in existence at the time of its formation upon that point we can form a very clear judgment and one in which there is no possible room for any mistake there are of course a great number of animalssuch as jellyfishes and other animalswithout any hard parts of which we cannot reasonably expect to find any traces whatever there is nothing of them to preserve within a very short time you will have noticed after they are removed from the water they dry up to a mere nothing certainly they are not of a nature to leave any very visible traces of their existence on such bodies as chalk or mud then again look at land animals it is as i have said a very uncommon thing to find a land animal entire after death insects and other carnivorous animals very speedily pull them to pieces putrefaction takes place and so out of the hundreds of thousands that are known to die every year it is the rarest thing in the world to see one imbedded in such a way that its remains would be preserved for a lengthened period not only is this the case but even when animal remains have been safely imbedded certain natural agents may wholly destroy and remove them  almost all the hard parts of animalsthe bones and so onare composed chiefly of phosphate of lime and carbonate of lime some years ago i had to make an inquiry into the nature of some very curious fossils sent to me from the north of scotland fossils are usually hard bony structures that have become imbedded in the way i have described and have gradually acquired the nature and solidity of the body with which they are associated but in this case i had a series of holes in some pieces of rock and nothing else those holes however had a certain definite shape about them and when i got a skilful workman to make castings of the interior of these holes i found that they were the impressions of the joints of a backbone and of the armour of a great reptile twelve or more feet long this great beast had died and got buried in the sand the sand had gradually hardened over the bones but remained porous water had trickled through it and that water being probably charged with a superfluity of carbonic acid had dissolved all the phosphate and carbonate of lime and the bones themselves had thus decayed and entirely disappeared but as the sandstone happened to have consolidated by that time the precise shape of the bones was retained if that sandstone had remained soft a little longer we should have known nothing whatsoever of the existence of the reptile whose bones it had encased  how certain it is that a vast number of animals which have existed at one period on this earth have entirely perished and left no trace whatever of their forms may be proved to you by other considerations there are large tracts of sandstone in various parts of the world in which nobody has yet found anything but footsteps not a bone of any description but an enormous number of traces of footsteps there is no question about them there is a whole valley in connecticut covered with these footsteps and not a single fragment of the animals which made them have yet been found let me mention another case while upon that matter which is even more surprising than those to which i have yet referred there is a limestone formation near oxford at a place called stonesfield which has yielded the remains of certain very interesting mammalian animals and up to this time if i recollect rightly there have been found seven specimens of its lower jaws and not a bit of anything else neither limbbones nor skull nor any part whatever not a fragment of the whole system of course it would be preposterous to imagine that the beasts had nothing else but a lower jaw the probability is as dr buckland showed as the result of his observations on dead dogs in the river thames that the lower jaw not being secured by very firm ligaments to the bones of the head and being a weighty affair would easily be knocked off or might drop away from the body as it floated in water in a state of decomposition the jaw would thus be deposited immediately while the rest of the body would float and drift away altogether ultimately reaching the sea and perhaps becoming destroyed the jaw becomes covered up and preserved in the river silt and thus it comes that we have such a curious circumstance as that of the lower jaws in the stonesfield slates so that you see faulty as these layers of stone in the earths crust are defective as they necessarily are as a record the account of contemporaneous vital phenomena presented by them is by the necessity of the case infinitely more defective and fragmentary  it was necessary that i should put all this very strongly before you because otherwise you might have been led to think differently of the completeness of our knowledge by the next facts i shall state to you  the researches of the last threequarters of a century have in truth revealed a wonderful richness of organic life in those rocks certainly not fewer than thirty or forty thousand different species of fossils have been discovered you have no more ground for doubting that these creatures really lived and died at or near the places in which we find them than you have for like scepticism about a shell on the seashore the evidence is as good in the one case as in the other  our next business is to look at the general character of these fossil remains and it is a subject which will be requisite to consider carefully and the first point for us is to examine how much the extinct flora and fauna as a wholedisregarding altogether the succession of their constituents of which i shall speak afterwardsdiffer from the flora and fauna of the present dayhow far they differ in what we do know about them leaving altogether out of consideration speculations based upon what we do not know  i strongly imagine that if it were not for the peculiar appearance that fossilised animals have any of you might readily walk through a museum which contains fossil remains mixed up with those of the present forms of life and i doubt very much whether your uninstructed eyes would lead you to see any vast or wonderful difference between the two if you looked closely you would notice in the first place a great many things very like animals with which you are acquainted now you would see differences of shape and proportion but on the whole a close similarity  i explained what i meant by orders the other day when i described the animal kingdom as being divided into subkingdoms classes and orders if you divide the animal kingdom into orders you will find that there are above one hundred and twenty the number may vary on one side or the other but this is a fair estimate that is the sum total of the orders of all the animals which we know now and which have been known in past times and left remains behind  now how many of those are absolutely extinct that is to say how many of these orders of animals have lived at a former period of the worlds history but have at present no representatives that is the sense in which i meant to use the word extinct i mean that those animals did live on this earth at one time but have left no one of their kind with us at the present moment so that estimating the number of extinct animals is a sort of way of comparing the past creation as a whole with the present as a whole among the mammalia and birds there are none extinct but when we come to the reptiles there is a most wonderful thing out of the eight orders or thereabouts which you can make among reptiles onehalf are extinct these diagrams of the plesiosaurus the ichthyosaurus the pterodactyle give you a notion of some of these extinct reptiles and here is a cast of the pterodactyle and bones of the ichthyosaurus and the plesiosaurus just as freshlooking as if it had been recently dug up in a churchyard thus in the reptile class there are no less than half of the orders which are absolutely extinct if we turn to the amphibia there was one extinct order the labyrinthodonts typified by the large salamanderlike beast shown in this diagram  no order of fishes is known to be extinct every fish that we find in the stratato which i have been referringcan be identified and placed in one of the orders which exist at the present day there is not known to be a single ordinal form of insect extinct there are only two orders extinct among the crustacea there is not known to be an extinct order of these creatures the parasitic and other worms but there are two not to say three absolutely extinct orders of this class the echinodermata out of all the orders of the coelenterata and protozoa only one the rugose corals  so that you see out of somewhere about 120 orders of animals taking them altogether you will not at the outside estimate find above ten or a dozen extinct summing up all the order of animals which have left remains behind them you will not find above ten or a dozen which cannot be arranged with those of the present day that is to say that the difference does not amount to much more than ten per cent and the proportion of extinct orders of plants is still smaller i think that that is a very astounding a most astonishing fact seeing the enormous epochs of time which have elapsed during the constitution of the surface of the earth as it at present exists it is indeed a most astounding thing that the proportion of extinct ordinal types should be so exceedingly small  but now there is another point of view in which we must look at this past creation suppose that we were to sink a vertical pit through the floor beneath us and that i could succeed in making a section right through in the direction of new zealand i should find in each of the different beds through which i passed the remains of animals which i should find in that stratum and not in the others first i should come upon beds of gravel or drift containing the bones of large animals such as the elephant rhinoceros and cave tiger rather curious things to fall across in piccadilly if i should dig lower still i should come upon a bed of what we call the london clay and in this as you will see in our galleries up stairs are found remains of strange cattle remains of turtles palms and large tropical fruits with shellfish such as you see the like of now only in tropical regions if i went below that i should come upon the chalk and there i should find something altogether different the remains of ichthyosauria and pterodactyles and ammonites and so forth  i do not know what mr godwin austin would say comes next but probably rocks containing more ammonites and more ichthyosauria and plesiosauria with a vast number of other things and under that i should meet with yet older rocks containing numbers of strange shells and fishes and in thus passing from the surface to the lowest depths of the earths crust the forms of animal life and vegetable life which i should meet with in the successive beds would looking at them broadly be the more different the further that i went down or in other words inasmuch as we started with the clear principle that in a series of naturallydisposed mud beds the lowest are the oldest we should come to this result that the further we go back in time the more difference exists between the animal and vegetable life of an epoch and that which now exists that was the conclusion to which i wished to bring you at the end of this lecture    iii the method by which the causes of the present and past conditions of organic nature are to be discoveredthe origination of living beings   in the two preceding lectures i have endeavoured to indicate to you the extent of the subjectmatter of the inquiry upon which we are engaged and having thus acquired some conception of the past and present phenomena of organic nature i must now turn to that which constitutes the great problem which we have set before ourselvesi mean the question of what knowledge we have of the causes of these phenomena of organic nature and how such knowledge is obtainable  here on the threshold of the inquiry an objection meets us there are in the world a number of extremely worthy wellmeaning persons whose judgments and opinions are entitled to the utmost respect on account of their sincerity who are of opinion that vital phenomena and especially all questions relating to the origin of vital phenomena are questions quite apart from the ordinary run of inquiry and are by their very nature placed out of our reach they say that all these phenomena originated miraculously or in some way totally different from the ordinary course of nature and that therefore they conceive it to be futile not to say presumptuous to attempt to inquire into them  to such sincere and earnest persons i would only say that a question of this kind is not to be shelved upon theoretical or speculative grounds you may remember the story of the sophist who demonstrated to diogenes in the most complete and satisfactory manner that he could not walk that in fact all motion was an impossibility and that diogenes refuted him by simply getting up and walking round his tub so in the same way the man of science replies to objections of this kind by simply getting up and walking onward and showing what science has done and is doingby pointing to that immense mass of facts which have been ascertained as systematised under the forms of the great doctrines of morphology of development of distribution and the like he sees an enormous mass of facts and laws relating to organic beings which stand on the same good sound foundation as every other natural law with this mass of facts and laws before us therefore seeing that as far as organic matters have hitherto been accessible and studied they have shown themselves capable of yielding to scientific investigation we may accept this as proof that order and law reign there as well as in the rest of nature the man of science says nothing to objectors of this sort but supposes that we can and shall walk to a knowledge of the origin of organic nature in the same way that we have walked to a knowledge of the laws and principles of the inorganic world  but there are objectors who say the same from ignorance and illwill to such i would reply that the objection comes ill from them and that the real presumption i may almost say the real blasphemy in this matter is in the attempt to limit that inquiry into the causes of phenomena which is the source of all human blessings and from which has sprung all human prosperity and progress for after all we can accomplish comparatively little the limited range of our own faculties bounds us on every sidethe field of our powers of observation is small enough and he who endeavours to narrow the sphere of our inquiries is only pursuing a course that is likely to produce the greatest harm to his fellowmen  but now assuming as we all do i hope that these phenomena are properly accessible to inquiry and setting out upon our search into the causes of the phenomena of organic nature or at any rate setting out to discover how much we at present know upon these abstruse matters the question arises as to what is to be our course of proceeding and what method we must lay down for our guidance i reply to that question that our method must be exactly the same as that which is pursued in any other scientific inquiry the method of scientific investigation being the same for all orders of facts and phenomena whatsoever  i must dwell a little on this point for i wish you to leave this room with a very clear conviction that scientific investigation is not as many people seem to suppose some kind of modern black art i say that you might easily gather this impression from the manner in which many persons speak of scientific inquiry or talk about inductive and deductive philosophy or the principles of the baconian philosophy i do protest that of the vast number of cants in this world there are none to my mind so contemptible as the pseudoscientific cant which is talked about the baconian philosophy  to hear people talk about the great chancellorand a very great man he certainly wasyou would think that it was he who had invented science and that there was no such thing as sound reasoning before the time of queen elizabeth of course you say that cannot possibly be true you perceive on a moments reflection that such an idea is absurdly wrong and yet so firmly rooted is this sort of impressioni cannot call it an idea or conceptionthe thing is too absurd to be entertainedbut so completely does it exist at the bottom of most mens minds that this has been a matter of observation with me for many years past there are many men who though knowing absolutely nothing of the subject with which they may be dealing wish nevertheless to damage the author of some view with which they think fit to disagree what they do then is not to go and learn something about the subject which one would naturally think the best way of fairly dealing with it but they abuse the originator of the view they question in a general manner and wind up by saying that after all you know the principles and method of this author are totally opposed to the canons of the baconian philosophy then everybody applauds as a matter of course and agrees that it must be so but if you were to stop them all in the middle of their applause you would probably find that neither the speaker nor his applauders could tell you how or in what way it was so neither the one nor the other having the slightest idea of what they mean when they speak of the baconian philosophy  you will understand i hope that i have not the slightest desire to join in the outcry against either the morals the intellect or the great genius of lord chancellor bacon he was undoubtedly a very great man let people say what they will of him but notwithstanding all that he did for philosophy it would be entirely wrong to suppose that the methods of modern scientific inquiry originated with him or with his age they originated with the first man whoever he was and indeed existed long before him for many of the essential processes of reasoning are exerted by the higher order of brutes as completely and effectively as by ourselves we see in many of the brute creation the exercise of one at least of the same powers of reasoning as that which we ourselves employ  the method of scientific investigation is nothing but the expression of the necessary mode of working of the human mind it is simply the mode at which all phenomena are reasoned about rendered precise and exact there is no more difference but there is just the same kind of difference between the mental operations of a man of science and those of an ordinary person as there is between the operations and methods of a baker or of a butcher weighing out his goods in common scales and the operations of a chemist in performing a difficult and complex analysis by means of his balance and finelygraduated weights it is not that the action of the scales in the one case and the balance in the other differ in the principles of their construction or manner of working but the beam of one is set on an infinitely finer axis than the other and of course turns by the addition of a much smaller weight  you will understand this better perhaps if i give you some familiar example you have all heard it repeated i dare say that men of science work by means of induction and deduction and that by the help of these operations they in a sort of sense wring from nature certain other things which are called natural laws and causes and that out of these by some cunning skill of their own they build up hypotheses and theories and it is imagined by many that the operations of the common mind can be by no means compared with these processes and that they have to be acquired by a sort of special apprenticeship to the craft to hear all these large words you would think that the mind of a man of science must be constituted differently from that of his fellow men but if you will not be frightened by terms you will discover that you are quite wrong and that all these terrible apparatus are being used by yourselves every day and every hour of your lives  there is a wellknown incident in one of molières plays where the author makes the hero express unbounded delight on being told that he had been talking prose during the whole of his life in the same way i trust that you will take comfort and be delighted with yourselves on the discovery that you have been acting on the principles of inductive and deductive philosophy during the same period probably there is not one here who has not in the course of the day had occasion to set in motion a complex train of reasoning of the very same kind though differing of course in degree as that which a scientific man goes through in tracing the causes of natural phenomena  a very trivial circumstance will serve to exemplify this suppose you go into a fruiterers shop wanting an appleyou take up one and on biting it you find it is sour you look at it and see that it is hard and green you take up another one and that too is hard green and sour the shopman offers you a third but before biting it you examine it and find that it is hard and green and you immediately say that you will not have it as it must be sour like those that you have already tried  nothing can be more simple than that you think but if you will take the trouble to analyse and trace out into its logical elements what has been done by the mind you will be greatly surprised in the first place you have performed the operation of induction you found that in two experiences hardness and greenness in apples went together with sourness it was so in the first case and it was confirmed by the second true it is a very small basis but still it is enough to make an induction from you generalise the facts and you expect to find sourness in apples where you get hardness and greenness you found upon that a general law that all hard and green apples are sour and that so far as it goes is a perfect induction well having got your natural law in this way when you are offered another apple which you find is hard and green you say all hard and green apples are sour this apple is hard and green therefore this apple is sour that train of reasoning is what logicians call a syllogism and has all its various parts and termsits major premiss its minor premiss and its conclusion and by the help of further reasoning which if drawn out would have to be exhibited in two or three other syllogisms you arrive at your final determination i will not have that apple so that you see you have in the first place established a law by induction and upon that you have founded a deduction and reasoned out the special conclusion of the particular case well now suppose having got your law that at some time afterwards you are discussing the qualities of apples with a friend you will say to him it is a very curious thingbut i find that all hard and green apples are sour your friend says to you but how do you know that you at once reply oh because i have tried them over and over again and have always found them to be so well if we were talking science instead of common sense we should call that an experimental verification and if still opposed you go further and say i have heard from the people in somersetshire and devonshire where a large number of apples are grown that they have observed the same thing it is also found to be the case in normandy and in north america in short i find it to be the universal experience of mankind wherever attention has been directed to the subject whereupon your friend unless he is a very unreasonable man agrees with you and is convinced that you are quite right in the conclusion you have drawn he believes although perhaps he does not know he believes it that the more extensive verifications arethat the more frequently experiments have been made and results of the same kind arrived atthat the more varied the conditions under which the same results are attained the more certain is the ultimate conclusion and he disputes the question no further he sees that the experiment has been tried under all sorts of conditions as to time place and people with the same result and he says with you therefore that the law you have laid down must be a good one and he must believe it  in science we do the same thingthe philosopher exercises precisely the same faculties though in a much more delicate manner in scientific inquiry it becomes a matter of duty to expose a supposed law to every possible kind of verification and to take care moreover that this is done intentionally and not left to a mere accident as in the case of the apples and in science as in common life our confidence in a law is in exact proportion to the absence of variation in the result of our experimental verifications for instance if you let go your grasp of an article you may have in your hand it will immediately fall to the ground that is a very common verification of one of the best established laws of naturethat of gravitation the method by which men of science establish the existence of that law is exactly the same as that by which we have established the trivial proposition about the sourness of hard and green apples but we believe it in such an extensive thorough and unhesitating manner because the universal experience of mankind verifies it and we can verify it ourselves at any time and that is the strongest possible foundation on which any natural law can rest  so much then by way of proof that the method of establishing laws in science is exactly the same as that pursued in common life let us now turn to another matter though really it is but another phase of the same question and that is the method by which from the relations of certain phenomena we prove that some stand in the position of causes towards the others  i want to put the case clearly before you and i will therefore show you what i mean by another familiar example i will suppose that one of you on coming down in the morning to the parlour of your house finds that a teapot and some spoons which had been left in the room on the previous evening are gonethe window is open and you observe the mark of a dirty hand on the windowframe and perhaps in addition to that you notice the impress of a hobnailed shoe on the gravel outside all these phenomena have struck your attention instantly and before two seconds have passed you say oh somebody has broken open the window entered the room and run off with the spoons and the teapot that speech is out of your mouth in a moment and you will probably add i know there has i am quite sure of it you mean to say exactly what you know but in reality you are giving expression to what is in all essential particulars an hypothesis you do not know it at all it is nothing but an hypothesis rapidly framed in your own mind and it is an hypothesis founded on a long train of inductions and deductions  what are those inductions and deductions and how have you got at this hypothesis you have observed in the first place that the window is open but by a train of reasoning involving many inductions and deductions you have probably arrived long before at the general lawand a very good one it isthat windows do not open of themselves and you therefore conclude that something has opened the window a second general law that you have arrived at in the same way is that teapots and spoons do not go out of a window spontaneously and you are satisfied that as they are not now where you left them they have been removed in the third place you look at the marks on the windowsill and the shoemarks outside and you say that in all previous experience the former kind of mark has never been produced by anything else but the hand of a human being and the same experience shows that no other animal but man at present wears shoes with hobnails in them such as would produce the marks in the gravel i do not know even if we could discover any of those missing links that are talked about that they would help us to any other conclusion at any rate the law which states our present experience is strong enough for my present purpose you next reach the conclusion that as these kinds of marks have not been left by any other animals than men or are liable to be formed in any other way than by a mans hand and shoe the marks in question have been formed by a man in that way you have further a general law founded on observation and experience and that too is i am sorry to say a very universal and unimpeachable onethat some men are thieves and you assume at once from all these premissesand that is what constitutes your hypothesisthat the man who made the marks outside and on the windowsill opened the window got into the room and stole your teapot and spoons you have now arrived at a vera causayou have assumed a cause which it is plain is competent to produce all the phenomena you have observed you can explain all these phenomena only by the hypothesis of a thief but that is a hypothetical conclusion of the justice of which you have no absolute proof at all it is only rendered highly probable by a series of inductive and deductive reasonings  i suppose your first action assuming that you are a man of ordinary common sense and that you have established this hypothesis to your own satisfaction will very likely be to go off for the police and set them on the track of the burglar with the view to the recovery of your property but just as you are starting with this object some person comes in and on learning what you are about says my good friend you are going on a great deal too fast how do you know that the man who really made the marks took the spoons it might have been a monkey that took them and the man may have merely looked in afterwards you would probably reply well that is all very well but you see it is contrary to all experience of the way teapots and spoons are abstracted so that at any rate your hypothesis is less probable than mine while you are talking the thing over in this way another friend arrives one of that good kind of people that i was talking of a little while ago and he might say oh my dear sir you are certainly going on a great deal too fast you are most presumptuous you admit that all these occurrences took place when you were fast asleep at a time when you could not possibly have known anything about what was taking place how do you know that the laws of nature are not suspended during the night it may be that there has been some kind of supernatural interference in this case in point of fact he declares that your hypothesis is one of which you cannot at all demonstrate the truth and that you are by no means sure that the laws of nature are the same when you are asleep as when you are awake  well now you cannot at the moment answer that kind of reasoning you feel that your worthy friend has you somewhat at a disadvantage you will feel perfectly convinced in your own mind however that you are quite right and you say to him my good friend i can only be guided by the natural probabilities of the case and if you will be kind enough to stand aside and permit me to pass i will go and fetch the police well we will suppose that your journey is successful and that by good luck you meet with a policeman that eventually the burglar is found with your property on his person and the marks correspond to his hand and to his boots probably any jury would consider those facts a very good experimental verification of your hypothesis touching the cause of the abnormal phenomena observed in your parlour and would act accordingly  now in this suppositious case i have taken phenomena of a very common kind in order that you might see what are the different steps in an ordinary process of reasoning if you will only take the trouble to analyse it carefully all the operations i have described you will see are involved in the mind of any man of sense in leading him to a conclusion as to the course he should take in order to make good a robbery and punish the offender i say that you are led in that case to your conclusion by exactly the same train of reasoning as that which a man of science pursues when he is endeavouring to discover the origin and laws of the most occult phenomena the process is and always must be the same and precisely the same mode of reasoning was employed by newton and laplace in their endeavours to discover and define the causes of the movements of the heavenly bodies as you with your own common sense would employ to detect a burglar the only difference is that the nature of the inquiry being more abstruse every step has to be most carefully watched so that there may not be a single crack or flaw in your hypothesis a flaw or crack in many of the hypotheses of daily life may be of little or no moment as affecting the general correctness of the conclusions at which we may arrive but in a scientific inquiry a fallacy great or small is always of importance and is sure to be in the long run constantly productive of mischievous if not fatal results  do not allow yourselves to be misled by the common notion that an hypothesis is untrustworthy simply because it is an hypothesis it is often urged in respect to some scientific conclusion that after all it is only an hypothesis but what more have we to guide us in ninetenths of the most important affairs of daily life than hypotheses and often very illbased ones so that in science where the evidence of an hypothesis is subjected to the most rigid examination we may rightly pursue the same course you may have hypotheses and hypotheses a man may say if he likes that the moon is made of green cheese that is an hypothesis but another man who has devoted a great deal of time and attention to the subject and availed himself of the most powerful telescopes and the results of the observations of others declares that in his opinion it is probably composed of materials very similar to those of which our own earth is made up and that is also only an hypothesis but i need not tell you that there is an enormous difference in the value of the two hypotheses that one which is based on sound scientific knowledge is sure to have a corresponding value and that which is a mere hasty random guess is likely to have but little value every great step in our progress in discovering causes has been made in exactly the same way as that which i have detailed to you a person observing the occurrence of certain facts and phenomena asks naturally enough what process what kind of operation known to occur in nature applied to the particular case will unravel and explain the mystery hence you have the scientific hypothesis and its value will be proportionate to the care and completeness with which its basis had been tested and verified it is in these matters as in the commonest affairs of practical life the guess of the fool will be folly while the guess of the wise man will contain wisdom in all cases you see that the value of the result depends on the patience and faithfulness with which the investigator applies to his hypothesis every possible kind of verification  i dare say i may have to return to this point by and by but having dealt thus far with our logical methods i must now turn to something which perhaps you may consider more interesting or at any rate more tangible but in reality there are but few things that can be more important for you to understand than the mental processes and the means by which we obtain scientific conclusions and theories footnote those who wish to study fully the doctrines of which i have endeavoured to give some roughandready illustrations must read mr john stuart mills system of logic having granted that the inquiry is a proper one and having determined on the nature of the methods we are to pursue and which only can lead to success i must now turn to the consideration of our knowledge of the nature of the processes which have resulted in the present condition of organic nature  here let me say at once lest some of you misunderstand me that i have extremely little to report the question of how the present condition of organic nature came about resolves itself into two questions the first is how has organic or living matter commenced its existence and the second is how has it been perpetuated on the second question i shall have more to say hereafter but on the first one what i now have to say will be for the most part of a negative character  if you consider what kind of evidence we can have upon this matter it will resolve itself into two kinds we may have historical evidence and we may have experimental evidence it is for example conceivable that inasmuch as the hardened mud which forms a considerable portion of the thickness of the earths crust contains faithful records of the past forms of life and inasmuch as these differ more and more as we go further downit is possible and conceivable that we might come to some particular bed or stratum which should contain the remains of those creatures with which organic life began upon the earth and if we did so and if such forms of organic life were preservable we should have what i would call historical evidence of the mode in which organic life began upon this planet many persons will tell you and indeed you will find it stated in many works on geology that this has been done and that we really possess such a record there are some who imagine that the earliest forms of life of which we have as yet discovered any record are in truth the forms in which animal life began upon the globe the grounds on which they base that supposition are thesethat if you go through the enormous thickness of the earths crust and get down to the older rocks the higher vertebrate animalsthe quadrupeds birds and fishescease to be found beneath them you find only the invertebrate animals and in the deepest and lowest rocks those remains become scantier and scantier not in any very gradual progression however until at length in what are supposed to be the oldest rocks the animal remains which are found are almost always confined to four formsoldhamia whose precise nature is not known whether plant or animal lingula a kind of mollusc trilobites a crustacean animal having the same essential plan of construction though differing in many details from a lobster or crab and hymenocaris which is also a crustacean so that you have all the fauna reduced at this period to four forms one a kind of animal or plant that we know nothing about and three undoubted animalstwo crustaceans and one mollusc  i think considering the organisation of these mollusca and crustacea and looking at their very complex nature that it does indeed require a very strong imagination to conceive that these were the first created of all living things and you must take into consideration the fact that we have not the slightest proof that these which we call the oldest beds are really so i repeat we have not the slightest proof of it when you find in some places that in an enormous thickness of rocks there are but very scanty traces of life or absolutely none at all and that in other parts of the world rocks of the very same formation are crowded with the records of living forms i think it is impossible to place any reliance on the supposition or to feel ones self justified in supposing that these are the forms in which life first commenced i have not time here to enter upon the technical grounds upon which i am led to this conclusionthat could hardly be done properly in half a dozen lectures on that part alonei must content myself with saying that i do not at all believe that these are the oldest forms of life  i turn to the experimental side to see what evidence we have there to enable us to say that we know anything about the experimental origination of organisation and life the investigator ought to be able to take inorganic matters such as carbonic acid ammonia water and salines in any sort of inorganic combination and be able to build them up into protein matter and then that protein matter ought to begin to live in an organic form that nobody has done as yet and i suspect it will be a long while before anybody does do it but the thing is by no means so impossible as it looks for the researches of modern chemistry have shown usi wont say the road towards it but if i may so say they have shown the fingerpost pointing to the road that may lead to it  it is not many years agoand you must recollect that organic chemistry is a young science not above a couple of generations old you must not expect too much of itit is not many years ago since it was said to be perfectly impossible to fabricate any organic compound that is to say any nonmineral compound which is to be found in an organised being it remained so for a very long period but it is now a considerable number of years since a distinguished foreign chemist contrived to fabricate urea a substance of a very complex character which forms one of the waste products of animal structures and of late years a number of other compounds such as butyric acid and others have been added to the list i need not tell you that chemistry is an enormous distance from the goal i indicate all i wish to point out to you is that it is by no means safe to say that that goal may not be reached one day it may be that it is impossible for us to produce the conditions requisite to the origination of life but we must speak modestly about the matter and recollect that science has put her foot upon the bottom round of the ladder truly he would be a bold man who would venture to predict where she will be fifty years hence  there is another inquiry which bears indirectly upon this question and upon which i must say a few words you are all of you aware of the phenomena of what is called spontaneous generation our forefathers down to the seventeenth century or thereabouts all imagined in perfectly good faith that certain vegetable and animal forms gave birth in the process of their decomposition to insect life thus if you put a piece of meat in the sun and allowed it to putrefy they conceived that the grubs which soon began to appear were the result of the action of a power of spontaneous generation which the meat contained and they could give you receipts for making various animal and vegetable preparations which would produce particular kinds of animals a very distinguished italian naturalist named redi took up the question at a time when everybody believed in it among others our own great harvey the discoverer of the circulation of the blood you will constantly find his name quoted however as an opponent of the doctrine of spontaneous generation but the fact is and you will see it if you will take the trouble to look into his works harvey believed it as profoundly as any man of his time but he happened to enunciate a very curious propositionthat every living thing came from an egg he did not mean to use the word in the sense in which we now employ it he only meant to say that every living thing originated in a little rounded particle of organised substance and it is from this circumstance probably that the notion of harvey having opposed the doctrine originated then came redi and he proceeded to upset the doctrine in a very simple manner he merely covered the piece of meat with some very fine gauze and then he exposed it to the same conditions the result of this was that no grubs or insects were produced he proved that the grubs originated from the insects who came and deposited their eggs in the meat and that they were hatched by the heat of the sun by this kind of inquiry he thoroughly upset the doctrine of spontaneous generation for his time at least  then came the discovery and application of the microscope to scientific inquiries which showed to naturalists that besides the organisms which they already knew as living beings and plants there were an immense number of minute things which could be obtained apparently almost at will from decaying vegetable and animal forms thus if you took some ordinary black pepper or some hay and steeped it in water you would find in the course of a few days that the water had become impregnated with an immense number of animalcules swimming about in all directions from facts of this kind naturalists were led to revive the theory of spontaneous generation they were headed here by an english naturalistneedhamand afterwards in france by the learned buffon they said that these things were absolutely begotten in the water of the decaying substances out of which the infusion was made it did not matter whether you took animal or vegetable matter you had only to steep it in water and expose it and you would soon have plenty of animalcules they made an hypothesis about this which was a very fair one they said this matter of the animal world or of the higher plants appears to be dead but in reality it has a sort of dim life about it which if it is placed under fair conditions will cause it to break up into the forms of these little animalcules and they will go through their lives in the same way as the animal or plant of which they once formed a part  the question now became very hotly debated spallanzani an italian naturalist took up opposite views to those of needham and buffon and by means of certain experiments he showed that it was quite possible to stop the process by boiling the water and closing the vessel in which it was contained oh said his opponents but what do you know you may be doing when you heat the air over the water in this way you may be destroying some property of the air requisite for the spontaneous generation of the animalcules  however spallanzanis views were supposed to be upon the right side and those of the others fell into discredit although the fact was that spallanzani had not made good his views well then the subject continued to be revived from time to time and experiments were made by several persons but these experiments were not altogether satisfactory it was found that if you put an infusion in which animalcules would appear if it were exposed to the air into a vessel and boiled it and then sealed up the mouth of the vessel so that no air save such as had been heated to 212° could reach its contents that then no animalcules would be found but if you took the same vessel and exposed the infusion to the air then you would get animalcules furthermore it was found that if you connected the mouth of the vessel with a redhot tube in such a way that the air would have to pass through the tube before reaching the infusion that then you would get no animalcules yet another thing was noticed if you took two flasks containing the same kind of infusion and left one entirely exposed to the air and in the mouth of the other placed a ball of cotton wool so that the air would have to filter itself through it before reaching the infusion that then although you might have plenty of animalcules in the first flask you would certainly obtain none from the second  these experiments you see all tended towards one conclusionthat the infusoria were developed from little minute spores or eggs which were constantly floating in the atmosphere and which lose their power of germination if subjected to heat but one observer now made another experiment which seemed to go entirely the other way and puzzled him altogether he took some of this boiled infusion that i have been speaking of and by the use of a mercurial batha kind of trough used in laboratorieshe deftly inverted a vessel containing the infusion into the mercury so that the latter reached a little beyond the level of the mouth of the inverted vessel you see that he thus had a quantity of the infusion shut off from any possible communication with the outer air by being inverted upon a bed of mercury  he then prepared some pure oxygen and nitrogen gases and passed them by means of a tube going from the outside of the vessel up through the mercury into the infusion so that he thus had it exposed to a perfectly pure atmosphere of the same constituents as the external air of course he expected he would get no infusorial animalcules at all in that infusion but to his great dismay and discomfiture he found he almost always did get them  furthermore it has been found that experiments made in the manner described above answer well with most infusions but that if you fill the vessel with boiled milk and then stop the neck with cottonwool you will have infusoria so that you see there were two experiments that brought you to one kind of conclusion and three to another which was a most unsatisfactory state of things to arrive at in a scientific inquiry  some few years after this the question began to be very hotly discussed in france there was m pouchet a professor at rouen a very learned man but certainly not a very rigid experimentalist he published a number of experiments of his own some of which were very ingenious to show that if you went to work in a proper way there was a truth in the doctrine of spontaneous generation well it was one of the most fortunate things in the world that m pouchet took up this question because it induced a distinguished french chemist m pasteur to take up the question on the other side and he has certainly worked it out in the most perfect manner i am glad to say too that he has published his researches in time to enable me to give you an account of them he verified all the experiments which i have just mentioned to youand then finding those extraordinary anomalies as in the case of the mercury bath and the milk he set himself to work to discover their nature in the case of milk he found it to be a question of temperature milk in a fresh state is slightly alkaline and it is a very curious circumstance but this very slight degree of alkalinity seems to have the effect of preserving the organisms which fall into it from the air from being destroyed at a temperature of 212° which is the boiling point but if you raise the temperature 10° when you boil it the milk behaves like everything else and if the air with which it comes in contact after being boiled at this temperature is passed through a redhot tube you will not get a trace of organisms  he then turned his attention to the mercury bath and found on examination that the surface of the mercury was almost always covered with a very fine dust he found that even the mercury itself was positively full of organic matters that from being constantly exposed to the air it had collected an immense number of these infusorial organisms from the air well under these circumstances he felt that the case was quite clear and that the mercury was not what it had appeared to m schwann to bea bar to the admission of these organisms but that in reality it acted as a reservoir from which the infusion was immediately supplied with the large quantity that had so puzzled him  but not content with explaining the experiments of others m pasteur went to work to satisfy himself completely he said to himself if my view is right and if in point of fact all these appearances of spontaneous generation are altogether due to the falling of minute germs suspended in the atmospherewhy i ought not only to be able to show the germs but i ought to be able to catch and sow them and produce the resulting organisms he accordingly constructed a very ingenious apparatus to enable him to accomplish the trapping of the germ dust in the air he fixed in the window of his room a glass tube in the centre of which he had placed a ball of guncotton which as you all know is ordinary cottonwool which from having been steeped in strong acid is converted into a substance of great explosive power it is also soluble in alcohol and ether one end of the glass tube was of course open to the external air and at the other end of it he placed an aspirator a contrivance for causing a current of the external air to pass through the tube he kept this apparatus going for fourandtwenty hours and then removed the dusted guncotton and dissolved it in alcohol and ether he then allowed this to stand for a few hours and the result was that a very fine dust was gradually deposited at the bottom of it that dust on being transferred to the stage of a microscope was found to contain an enormous number of starch grains you know that the materials of our food and the greater portion of plants are composed of starch and we are constantly making use of it in a variety of ways so that there is always a quantity of it suspended in the air it is these starch grains which form many of those bright specks that we see dancing in a ray of light sometimes but besides these m pasteur found also an immense number of other organic substances such as spores of fungi which had been floating about in the air and had got caged in this way  he went farther and said to himself if these really are the things that give rise to the appearance of spontaneous generation i ought to be able to take a ball of this dusted guncotton and put it into one of my vessels containing that boiled infusion which has been kept away from the air and in which no infusoria are at present developed and then if i am right the introduction of this guncotton will give rise to organisms  accordingly he took one of these vessels of infusion which had been kept eighteen months without the least appearance of life in it and by a most ingenious contrivance he managed to break it open and introduce such a ball of guncotton without allowing the infusion or the cotton ball to come into contact with any air but that which had been subjected to a red heat and in twentyfour hours he had the satisfaction of finding all the indications of what had been hitherto called spontaneous generation he had succeeded in catching the germs and developing organisms in the way ho had anticipated  it now struck him that the truth of his conclusions might be demonstrated without all the apparatus he had employed to do this he took some decaying animal or vegetable substance such as urine which is an extremely decomposable substance or the juice of yeast or perhaps some other artificial preparation and filled a vessel having a long tubular neck with it he then boiled the liquid and bent that long neck into an s shape or zigzag leaving it open at the end the infusion then gave no trace of any appearance of spontaneous generation however long it might be left as all the germs in the air were deposited in the beginning of the bent neck he then cut the tube close to the vessel and allowed the ordinary air to have free and direct access and the result of that was the appearance of organisms in it as soon as the infusion had been allowed to stand long enough to allow of the growth of those it received from the air which was about fortyeight hours the result of m pasteurs experiments proved therefore in the most conclusive manner that all the appearances of spontaneous generation arose from nothing more than the deposition of the germs of organisms which were constantly floating in the air  to this conclusion however the objection was made that if that were the cause then the air would contain such an enormous number of these germs that it would be a continual fog but m pasteur replied that they are not there in anything like the number we might suppose and that an exaggerated view has been held on that subject he showed that the chances of animal or vegetable life appearing in infusions depend entirely on the conditions under which they are exposed if they are exposed to the ordinary atmosphere around us why of course you may have organisms appearing early but on the other hand if they are exposed to air at a great height or in some very quiet cellar you will often not find a single trace of life  so that m pasteur arrived at last at the clear and definite result that all these appearances are like the case of the worms in the piece of meat which was refuted by redi simply germs carried by the air and deposited in the liquids in which they afterwards appear for my own part i conceive that with the particulars of m pasteurs experiments before us we cannot fail to arrive at his conclusions and that the doctrine of spontaneous generation has received a final coup de grâce  you of course understand that all this in no way interferes with the possibility of the fabrication of organic matters by the direct method to which i have referred remote as that possibility may be    iv the perpetuation of living beings hereditary transmission and variation   the inquiry which we undertook at our last meeting into the state of our knowledge of the causes of the phenomena of organic natureof the past and of the presentresolved itself into two subsidiary inquiries the first was whether we know anything either historically or experimentally of the mode of origin of living beings the second subsidiary inquiry was whether granting the origin we know anything about the perpetuation and modifications of the forms of organic beings the reply which i had to give to the first question was altogether negative and the chief result of my last lecture was that neither historically nor experimentally do we at present know anything whatsoever about the origin of living forms we saw that historically we are not likely to know anything about it although we may perhaps learn something experimentally but that at present we are an enormous distance from the goal i indicated  i now then take up the next question what do we know of the reproduction the perpetuation and the modifications of the forms of living beings supposing that we have put the question as to their origination on one side and have assumed that at present the causes of their origination are beyond us and that we know nothing about them upon this question the state of our knowledge is extremely different it is exceedingly large and if not complete our experience is certainly most extensive it would be impossible to lay it all before you and the most i can do or need do tonight is to take up the principal points and put them before you with such prominence as may subserve the purposes of our present argument  the method of the perpetuation of organic beings is of two kindsthe nonsexual and the sexual in the first the perpetuation takes place from and by a particular act of an individual organism which sometimes may not be classed as belonging to any sex at all in the second case it is in consequence of the mutual action and interaction of certain portions of the organisms of usually two distinct individualsthe male and the female the cases of nonsexual perpetuation are by no means so common as the cases of sexual perpetuation and they are by no means so common in the animal as in the vegetable world you are all probably familiar with the fact as a matter of experience that you can propagate plants by means of what are called cuttings for example that by taking a cutting from a geranium plant and rearing it properly by supplying it with light and warmth and nourishment from the earth it grows up and takes the form of its parent having all the properties and peculiarities of the original plant  sometimes this process which the gardener performs artificially takes place naturally that is to say a little bulb or portion of the plant detaches itself drops off and becomes capable of growing as a separate thing that is the case with many bulbous plants which throw off in this way secondary bulbs which are lodged in the ground and become developed into plants this is a nonsexual process and from it results the repetition or reproduction of the form of the original being from which the bulb proceeds  among animals the same thing takes place among the lower forms of animal life the infusorial animalculæ we have already spoken of throw off certain portions or break themselves up in various directions sometimes transversely or sometimes longitudinally or they may give off buds which detach themselves and develop into their proper forms there is the common freshwater polype for instance which multiplies itself in this way just in the same way as the gardener is able to multiply and reproduce the peculiarities and characters of particular plants by means of cuttings so can the physiological experimentalistas was shown by the abbé trembley many years agoso can he do the same thing with many of the lower forms of animal life m de trembley showed that you could take a polype and cut it into two or four or many pieces mutilating it in all directions and the pieces would still grow up and reproduce completely the original form of the animal these are all cases of nonsexual multiplication and there are other instances and still more extraordinary ones in which this process takes place naturally in a more hidden a more recondite kind of way you are all of you familiar with that little green insect the aphis or blight as it is called these little animals during a very considerable part of their existence multiply themselves by means of a kind of internal budding the buds being developed into essentially nonsexual animals which are neither male nor female they become converted into young aphides which repeat the process and their offspring after them and so on again you may go on for nine or ten or even twenty or more successions and there is no very good reason to say how soon it might terminate or how long it might not go on if the proper conditions of warmth and nourishment were kept up  sexual reproduction is quite a distinct matter here in all these cases what is required is the detachment of two portions of the parental organisms which portions we know as the egg or the spermatozoon in plants it is the ovule and the pollengrain as in the flowering plants or the ovule and the antherozooid as in the flowerless among all forms of animal life the spermatozoa proceed from the male sex and the egg is the product of the female now what is remarkable about this mode of reproduction is this that the egg by itself or the spermatozoa by themselves are unable to assume the parental form but if they be brought into contact with one another the effect of the mixture of organic substances proceeding from two sources appears to confer an altogether new vigour to the mixed product this process is brought about as we all know by the sexual intercourse of the two sexes and is called the act of impregnation the result of this act on the part of the male and female is that the formation of a new being is set up in the ovule or egg this ovule or egg soon begins to be divided and subdivided and to be fashioned into various complex organs and eventually to develop into the form of one of its parents as i explained in the first lecture these are the processes by which the perpetuation of organic beings is secured why there should be the two modeswhy this reinvigoration should be required on the part of the female element we do not know but it is most assuredly the fact and it is presumable that however long the process of nonsexual multiplication could be continuedi say there is good reason to believe that it would come to an end if a new commencement were not obtained by a conjunction of the two sexual elements  that character which is common to these two distinct processes is this that whether we consider the reproduction or perpetuation or modification of organic beings as they take place nonsexually or as they may take place sexuallyin either case i say the offspring has a constant tendency to assume speaking generally the character of the parent as i said just now if you take a slip of a plant and tend it with care it will eventually grow up and develop into a plant like that from which it had sprung and this tendency is so strong that as gardeners know this mode of multiplying by means of cuttings is the only secure mode of propagating very many varieties of plants the peculiarity of the primitive stock seems to be better preserved if you propagate it by means of a slip than if you resort to the sexual mode  again in experiments upon the lower animals such as the polype to which i have referred it is most extraordinary that although cut up into various pieces each particular piece will grow up into the form of the primitive stock the head if separated will reproduce the body and the tail and if you cut off the tail you will find that that will reproduce the body and all the rest of the members without in any way deviating from the plan of the organism from which these portions have been detached and so far does this go that some experimentalists have carefully examined the lower orders of animalsamong them the abbé spallanzani who made a number of experiments upon snails and salamandersand have found that they might mutilate them to an incredible extent that you might cut off the jaw or the greater part of the head or the leg or the tail and repeat the experiment several times perhaps cutting off the same member again and again and yet each of those types would be reproduced according to the primitive type nature making no mistake never putting on a fresh kind of leg or head or tail but always tending to repeat and to return to the primitive type  it is the same in sexual reproduction it is a matter of perfectly common experience that the tendency on the part of the offspring always is speaking broadly to reproduce the form of the parents the proverb has it that the thistle does not bring forth grapes so among ourselves there is always a likeness more or less marked and distinct between children and their parents that is a matter of familiar and ordinary observation we notice the same thing occurring in the cases of the domestic animalsdogs for instance and their offspring in all these cases of propagation and perpetuation there seems to be a tendency in the offspring to take the characters of the parental organisms to that tendency a special name is givenand as i may very often use it i will write it up here on this blackboard that you may remember itit is called atavism it expresses this tendency to revert to the ancestral type and comes from the latin word atavus ancestor  well this atavism which i shall speak of is as i said before one of the most marked and striking tendencies of organic beings but side by side with this hereditary tendency there is an equally distinct and remarkable tendency to variation the tendency to reproduce the original stock has as it were its limits and side by side with it there is a tendency to vary in certain directions as if there were two opposing powers working upon the organic being one tending to take it in a straight line and the other tending to make it diverge from that straight line first to one side and then to the other  so that you see these two tendencies need not precisely contradict one another as the ultimate result may not always be very remote from what would have been the case if the line had been quite straight  this tendency to variation is less marked in that mode of propagation which takes place nonsexually it is in that mode that the minor characters of animal and vegetable structures are most completely preserved still it will happen sometimes that the gardener when he has planted a cutting of some favourite plant will find contrary to his expectation that the slip grows up a little different from the primitive stockthat it produces flowers of a different colour or make or some deviation in one way or another this is what is called the sporting of plants  in animals the phenomena of nonsexual propagation are so obscure that at present we cannot be said to know much about them but if we turn to that mode of perpetuation which results from the sexual process then we find variation a perfectly constant occurrence to a certain extent and indeed i think that a certain amount of variation from the primitive stock is the necessary result of the method of sexual propagation itself for inasmuch as the thing propagated proceeds from two organisms of different sexes and different makes and temperaments and as the offspring is to be either of one sex or the other it is quite clear that it cannot be an exact diagonal of the two or it would be of no sex at all it cannot be an exact intermediate form between that of each of its parentsit must deviate to one side or the other you do not find that the male follows the precise type of the male parent nor does the female always inherit the precise characteristics of the motherthere is always a proportion of the female character in the male offspring and of the male character in the female offspring that must be quite plain to all of you who have looked at all attentively on your own children or those of your neighbours you will have noticed how very often it may happen that the son shall exhibit the maternal type of character or the daughter possess the characteristics of the fathers family there are all sorts of intermixtures and intermediate conditions between the two where complexion or beauty or fifty other different peculiarities belonging to either side of the house are reproduced in other members of the same family indeed it is sometimes to be remarked in this kind of variation that the variety belongs strictly speaking to neither of the immediate parents you will see a child in a family who is not like either its father or its mother but some old person who knew its grandfather or grandmother or it may be an uncle or perhaps even a more distant relative will see a great similarity between the child and one of these in this way it constantly happens that the characteristic of some previous member of the family comes out and is reproduced and recognised in the most unexpected manner  but apart from that matter of general experience there are some cases which put that curious mixture in a very clear light you are aware that the offspring of the ass and the horse or rather of the heass and the mare is what is called a mule and on the other hand the offspring of the stallion and the sheass is what is called a hinny it is a very rare thing in this country to see a hinny i never saw one myself but they have been very carefully studied now the curious thing is this that although you have the same elements in the experiment in each case the offspring is entirely different in character according as the male influence comes from the ass or the horse where the ass is the male as in the case of the mule you find that the head is like that of the ass that the ears are long the tail is tufted at the end the feet are small and the voice is an unmistakable bray these are all points of similarity to the ass but on the other hand the barrel of the body and the cut of the neck are much more like those of the mare then if you look at the hinnythe result of the union of the stallion and the sheass then you find it is the horse that has the predominance that the head is more like that of the horse the ears are shorter the legs coarser and the type is altogether altered while the voice instead of being a bray is the ordinary neigh of the horse here you see is a most curious thing you take exactly the same elements ass and horse but you combine the sexes in a different manner and the result is modified accordingly you have in this case however a result which is not general and universalthere is usually an important preponderance but not always on the same side  here then is one intelligible and perhaps necessary cause of variation the fact that there are two sexes sharing in the production of the offspring and that the share taken by each is different and variable not only for each combination but also for different members of the same family  secondly there is a variation to a certain extentthough in all probability the influence of this cause has been very much exaggeratedbut there is no doubt that variation is produced to a certain extent by what are commonly known as external conditionssuch as temperature food warmth and moisture in the long run every variation depends in some sense upon external conditions seeing that everything has a cause of its own i use the term external conditions now in the sense in which it is ordinarily employed certain it is that external conditions have a definite effect you may take a plant which has single flowers and by dealing with the soil and nourishment and so on you may by and by convert single flowers into double flowers and make thorns shoot out into branches you may thicken or make various modifications in the shape of the fruit in animals too you may produce analogous changes in this way as in the case of that deep bronze colour which persons rarely lose after having passed any length of time in tropical countries you may also alter the development of the muscles very much by dint of training all the world knows that exercise has a great effect in this way we always expect to find the arm of a blacksmith hard and wiry and possessing a large development of the brachial muscles no doubt training which is one of the forms of external conditions converts what are originally only instructions teachings into habits or in other words into organisations to a great extent but this second cause of variation cannot be considered to be by any means a large one the third cause that i have to mention however is a very extensive one it is one that for want of a better name has been called spontaneous variation which means that when we do not know anything about the cause of phenomena we call it spontaneous in the orderly chain of causes and effects in this world there are very few things of which it can be said with truth that they are spontaneous certainly not in these physical mattersin these there is nothing of the kindeverything depends on previous conditions but when we cannot trace the cause of phenomena we call them spontaneous  of these variations multitudinous as they are but little is known with perfect accuracy i will mention to you some two or three cases because they are very remarkable in themselves and also because i shall want to use them afterwards réaumur a famous french naturalist a great many years ago in an essay which he wrote upon the art of hatching chickenswhich was indeed a very curious essayhad occasion to speak of variations and monstrosities one very remarkable case had come under his notice of a variation in the form of a human member in the person of a maltese of the name of gratio kelleia who was born with six fingers upon each hand and the like number of toes to each of his feet that was a case of spontaneous variation nobody knows why he was born with that number of fingers and toes and as we dont know we call it a case of spontaneous variation there is another remarkable case also i select these because they happen to have been observed and noted very carefully at the time it frequently happens that a variation occurs but the persons who notice it do not take any care in noting down the particulars until at length when inquiries come to be made the exact circumstances are forgotten and hence multitudinous as may be such spontaneous variations it is exceedingly difficult to get at the origin of them  the second case is one of which you may find the whole details in the philosophical transactions for the year 1813 in a paper communicated by colonel humphrey to the president of the royal societyon a new variety in the breed of sheep giving an account of a very remarkable breed of sheep which at one time was well known in the northern states of america and which went by the name of the ancon or the otter breed of sheep in the year 1791 there was a farmer of the name of seth wright in massachusetts who had a flock of sheep consisting of a ram and i think of some twelve or thirteen ewes of this flock of ewes one at the breedingtime bore a lamb which was very singularly formed it had a very long body very short legs and those legs were bowed i will tell you by and by how this singular variation in the breed of sheep came to be noted and to have the prominence that it now has for the present i mention only these two cases but the extent of variation in the breed of animals is perfectly obvious to any one who has studied natural history with ordinary attention or to any person who compares animals with others of the same kind it is strictly true that there are never any two specimens which are exactly alike however similar they will always differ in some certain particular  now let us go back to atavismto the hereditary tendency i spoke of what will come of a variation when you breed from it when atavism comes if i may say so to intersect variation the two cases of which i have mentioned the history give a most excellent illustration of what occurs gratio kelleia the maltese married when he was twentytwo years of age and as i suppose there were no sixfingered ladies in malta he married an ordinary fivefingered person the result of that marriage was four children the first who was christened salvator had six fingers and six toes like his father the second was george who had five fingers and toes but one of them was deformed showing a tendency to variation the third was andrè he had five fingers and five toes quite perfect the fourth was a girl marie she had five fingers and five toes but her thumbs were deformed showing a tendency toward the sixth  these children grew up and when they came to adult years they all married and of course it happened that they all married fivefingered and fivetoed persons now let us see what were the results salvator had four children they were two boys a girl and another boy the first two boys and the girl were sixfingered and sixtoed like their grandfather the fourth boy had only five fingers and five toes george had only four children there were two girls with six fingers and six toes there was one girl with six fingers and five toes on the right side and five fingers and five toes on the left side so that she was half and half the last a boy had five fingers and five toes the third andrè you will recollect was perfectly wellformed and he had many children whose hands and feet were all regularly developed marie the last who of course married a man who had only five fingers had four children the first a boy was born with six toes but the other three were normal  now observe what very extraordinary phenomena are presented here you have an accidental variation giving rise to what you may call a monstrosity you have that monstrosity or variation diluted in the first instance by an admixture with a female of normal construction and you would naturally expect that in the results of such an union the monstrosity if repeated would be in equal proportion with the normal type that is to say that the children would be half and half some taking the peculiarity of the father and the others being of the purely normal type of the mother but you see we have a great preponderance of the abnormal type well this comes to be mixed once more with the pure the normal type and the abnormal is again produced in large proportion notwithstanding the second dilution now what would have happened if these abnormal types had intermarried with each other that is to say suppose the two boys of salvator had taken it into their heads to marry their first cousins the two first girls of george their uncle you will remember that these are all of the abnormal type of their grandfather the result would probably have been that their offspring would have been in every case a further development of that abnormal type you see it is only in the fourth in the person of marie that the tendency when it appears but slightly in the second generation is washed out in the third while the progeny of andrè who escaped in the first instance escape altogether  we have in this case a good example of natures tendency to the perpetuation of a variation here it is certainly a variation which earned with it no use or benefit and yet you see the tendency to perpetuation may be so strong that notwithstanding a great admixture of pure blood the variety continues itself up to the third generation which is largely marked with it in this case as i have said there was no means of the second generation intermarrying with any but fivefingered persons and the question naturally suggests itself what would have been the result of such marriage réaumur narrates this case only as far as the third generation certainly it would have been an exceedingly curious thing if we could have traced this matter any further had the cousins intermarried a sixfingered variety of the human race might have been set up  to show you that this supposition is by no means an unreasonable one let me now point out what took place in the case of seth wrights sheep where it happened to be a matter of moment to him to obtain a breed or raise a flock of sheep like that accidental variety that i have describedand i will tell you why in that part of massachusetts where seth wright was living the fields were separated by fences and the sheep which were very active and robust would roam abroad and without much difficulty jump over these fences into other peoples farms as a matter of course this exuberant activity on the part of the sheep constantly gave rise to all sorts of quarrels bickerings and contentions among the farmers of the neighbourhood so it occurred to seth wright who was like his successors more or less cute that if he could get a stock of sheep like those with the bandy legs they would not be able to jump over the fences so readily and he acted upon that idea he killed his old ram and as soon as the young one arrived at maturity he bred altogether from it the result was even more striking than in the human experiment which i mentioned just now colonel humphreys testifies that it always happened that the offspring were either pure ancons or pure ordinary sheep that in no case was there any mixing of the ancons with the others in consequence of this in the course of a very few years the farmer was able to get a very considerable flock of this variety and a large number of them were spread throughout massachusetts most unfortunately howeveri suppose it was because they were so commonnobody took enough notice of them to preserve their skeletons and although colonel humphreys states that he sent a skeleton to the president of the royal society at the same time that he forwarded his paper i am afraid that the variety has entirely disappeared for a short time after these sheep had become prevalent in that district the merino sheep were introduced and as their wool was much more valuable and as they were a quiet race of sheep and showed no tendency to trespasser jump over fences the otter breed of sheep the wool of which was inferior to that of the merino was gradually allowed to die out  you see that these facts illustrate perfectly well what may be done if you take care to breed from stocks that are similar to each other after having got a variation if by crossing a variation with the original stock you multiply that variation and then take care to keep that variation distinct from the original stock and make them breed togetherthen you may almost certainly produce a race whose tendency to continue the variation is exceedingly strong  this is what is called selection and it is by exactly the same process as that by which seth wright bred his ancon sheep that our breeds of cattle dogs and fowls are obtained there are some possibilities of exception but still speaking broadly i may say that this is the way in which all our varied races of domestic animals have arisen and you must understand that it is not one peculiarity or one characteristic alone in which animals may vary there is not a single peculiarity or characteristic of any kind bodily or mental in which offspring may not vary to a certain extent from the parent and other animals  among ourselves this is well known the simplest physical peculiarity is mostly reproduced i know a case of a woman who has the lobe of one of her ears a little flattened an ordinary observer might scarcely notice it and yet every one of her children has an approximation to the same peculiarity to some extent if you look at the other extreme too the gravest diseases such as gout scrofula and consumption may be handed down with just the same certainty and persistence as we noticed in the perpetuation of the bandy legs of the ancon sheep  however these facts are best illustrated in animals and the extent of the variation as is well known is very remarkable in dogs for example there are some dogs very much smaller than others indeed the variation is so enormous that probably the smallest dog would be about the size of the head of the largest there are very great variations in the structural forms not only of the skeleton but also in the shape of the skull and in the proportions of the face and the disposition of the teeth  the pointer the retriever bulldog and the terrier differ very greatly and yet there is every reason to believe that every one of these races has arisen from the same sourcethat all the most important races have arisen by this selective breeding from accidental variation  a still more striking case of what may be done by selective breeding and it is a better case because there is no chance of that partial infusion of error to which i alluded has been studied very carefully by mr darwinthe case of the domestic pigeons i dare say there may be some among you who may be pigeon fanciers and i wish you to understand that in approaching the subject i would speak with all humility and hesitation as i regret to say that i am not a pigeon fancier i know it is a great art and mystery and a thing upon which a man must not speak lightly but i shall endeavour as far as my understanding goes to give you a summary of the published and unpublished information which i have gained from mr darwin  among the enormous varietyi believe there are somewhere about a hundred and fifty kinds of pigeonsthere are four kinds which may be selected as representing the extremest divergences of one kind from another their names are the carrier the pouter the fantail and the tumbler in these large diagrams that i have here they are each represented in their relative sizes to each other this first one is the carrier you will notice this large excrescence on its beak it has a comparatively small head there is a bare space round the eyes it has a long neck a very long beak very strong legs large feet long wings and so on the second one is the pouter a very large bird with very long legs and beak it is called the pouter because it is in the habit of causing its gullet to swell up by inflating it with air i should tell you that all pigeons have a tendency to do this at times but in the pouter it is carried to an enormous extent the birds appear to be quite proud of their power of swelling and puffing themselves out in this way and i think it is about as droll a sight as you can well see to look at a cage full of these pigeons puffing and blowing themselves out in this ridiculous manner  this diagram is a representation of the third kind i mentionedthe fantail it is you see a small bird with exceedingly small legs and a very small beak it is most curiously distinguished by the size and extent of its tail which instead of containing twelve feathers may have many moresay thirty or even morei believe there are some with as many as fortytwo this bird has a curious habit of spreading out the feathers of its tail in such a way that they reach forward and touch its head and if this can be accomplished i believe it is looked upon as a point of great beauty  but here is the last great varietythe tumbler and of that great variety one of the principal kinds and one most prized is the specimen represented herethe shortfaced tumbler its beak you see is reduced to a mere nothing just compare the beak of this one and that of the first one the carrieri believe the orthodox comparison of the head and beak of a thoroughly wellbred tumbler is to stick an oat into a cherry and that will give you the proper relative proportions of the beak and head the feet and legs are exceedingly small and the bird appears to be quite a dwarf when placed side by side with this great carrier  these are differences enough in regard to their external appearance but these differences are by no means the whole or even the most important of the differences which obtain between these birds there is hardly a single point of their structure which has not become more or less altered and to give you an idea of how extensive these alterations are i have here some very good skeletons for which i am indebted to my friend mr tegetmeier a great authority in these matters by means of which if you examine them by and by you will be able to see the enormous difference in their bony structures  i had the privilege some time ago of access to some important mss of mr darwin who i may tell you has taken very great pains and spent much valuable time and attention on the investigation of these variations and getting together all the facts that bear upon them i obtained from these mss the following summary of the differences between the domestic breeds of pigeons that is to say a notification of the various points in which their organisation differs in the first place the back of the skull may differ a good deal and the development of the bones of the face may vary a great deal the back varies a good deal the shape of the lower jaw varies the tongue varies very greatly not only in correlation to the length and size of the beak but it seems also to have a kind of independent variation of its own then the amount of naked skin round the eyes and at the base of the beak may vary enormously so may the length of the eyelids the shape of the nostrils and the length of the neck i have already noticed the habit of blowing out the gullet so remarkable in the pouter and comparatively so in the others there are great differences too in the size of the female and the male the shape of the body the number and width of the processes of the ribs the development of the ribs and the size shape and development of the breastbone we may notice tooand i mention the fact because it has been disputed by what is assumed to be high authoritythe variation in the number of the sacral vertebrae the number of these varies from eleven to fourteen and that without any diminution in the number of the vertebrae of the back or of the tail then the number and position of the tailfeathers may vary enormously and so may the number of the primary and secondary feathers of the wings again the length of the feet and of the beakalthough they have no relation to each other yet appear to go togetherthat is you have a long beak wherever you have long feet there are differences also in the periods of the acquirement of the perfect plumagethe size and shape of the eggsthe nature of flight and the powers of flightsocalled homing birds having enormous flying powers footnote the carrier i learn from mr tegetmeier does not carry a highbred bird of this breed being but a poor flier the birds which fly long distances and come homehoming birdsand are consequently used as carriers are not carriers in the fancy sense while on the other hand the little tumbler is so called because of its extraordinary faculty of turning head over heels in the air instead of pursuing a direct course and lastly the dispositions and voices of the birds may vary thus the case of the pigeons shows you that there is hardly a single particularwhether of instinct or habit or bony structure or of plumageof either the internal economy or the external shape in which some variation or change may not take place which by selective breeding may become perpetuated and form the foundation of and give rise to a new race  if you carry in your minds eye these four varieties of pigeons you will bear with you as good a notion as you can have perhaps of the enormous extent to which a deviation from a primitive type may be carried by means of this process of selective breeding    v the conditions of existence as affecting the perpetuation of living beings   in the last lecture i endeavoured to prove to you that while as a general rule organic beings tend to reproduce their kind there is in them also a constantly recurring tendency to varyto vary to a greater or to a less extent such a variety i pointed out to you might arise from causes which we do not understand we therefore called it spontaneous and it might come into existence as a definite and marked thing without any gradations between itself and the form which preceded it i further pointed out that such a variety having once arisen might be perpetuated to some extent and indeed to a very marked extent without any direct interference or without any exercise of that process which we called selection and then i stated further that by such selection when exercised artificiallyif you took care to breed only from those forms which presented the same peculiarities of any variety which had arisen in this mannerthe variation might be perpetuated as far as we can see indefinitely  the next question and it is an important one for us is this is there any limit to the amount of variation from the primitive stock which can be produced by this process of selective breeding in considering this question it will be useful to class the characteristics in respect of which organic beings vary under two heads we may consider structural characteristics and we may consider physiological characteristics  in the first place as regards structural characteristics i endeavoured to show you by the skeletons which i had upon the table and by reference to a great many wellascertained facts that the different breeds of pigeons the carriers pouters and tumblers might vary in any of their internal and important structural characters to a very great degree not only might there be changes in the proportions of the skull and the characters of the feet and beaks and so on but that there might be an absolute difference in the number of the vertebrae of the back as in the sacral vertebras of the pouter and so great is the extent of the variation in these and similar characters that i pointed out to you by reference to the skeletons and the diagrams that these extreme varieties may absolutely differ more from one another in their structural characters than do what naturalists call distinct species of pigeons that is to say that they differ so much in structure that there is a greater difference between the pouter and the tumbler than there is between such wild and distinct forms as the rock pigeon or the ring pigeon or the ring pigeon and the stock dove and indeed the differences are of greater value than this for the structural differences between these domesticated pigeons are such as would be admitted by a naturalist supposing he knew nothing at all about their origin to entitle them to constitute even distinct genera  as i have used this term species and shall probably use it a good deal i had better perhaps devote a word or two to explaining what i mean by it  animals and plants are divided into groups which become gradually smaller beginning with a kingdom which is divided into subkingdoms then come the smaller divisions called provinces and so on from a province to a class from a class to an order from orders to families and from these to genera until we come at length to the smallest groups of animals which can be defined one from the other by constant characters which are not sexual and these are what naturalists call species in practice whatever they may do in theory  if in a state of nature you find any two groups of living beings which are separated one from the other by some constantlyrecurring characteristic i dont care how slight and trivial so long as it is defined and constant and does not depend on sexual peculiarities then all naturalists agree in calling them two species that is what is meant by the use of the word speciesthat is to say it is for the practical naturalist a mere question of structural differences footnote i lay stress here on the practical signification of species whether a physiological test between species exist or not it is hardly ever applicable by the practical naturalist we have seen nowto repeat this point once more and it is very essential that we should rightly understand itwe have seen that breeds known to have been derived from a common stock by selection may be as different in their structure from the original stock as species may be distinct from each other  but is the like true of the physiological characteristics of animals do the physiological differences of varieties amount in degree to those observed between forms which naturalists call distinct species this is a most important point for us to consider  as regards the great majority of physiological characteristics there is no doubt that they are capable of being developed increased and modified by selection  there is no doubt that breeds may be made as different as species in many physiological characters i have already pointed out to you very briefly the different habits of the breeds of pigeons all of which depend upon their physiological peculiaritiesas the peculiar habit of tumbling in the tumblerthe peculiarities of flight in the homing birdsthe strange habit of spreading out the tail and walking in a peculiar fashion in the fantailand lastly the habit of blowing out the gullet so characteristic of the pouter these are all due to physiological modifications and in all these respects these birds differ as much from each other as any two ordinary species do  so with dogs in their habits and instincts it is a physiological peculiarity which leads the greyhound to chase its prey by sightthat enables the beagle to track it by the scentthat impels the terrier to its rathunting propensityand that leads the retriever to its habit of retrieving these habits and instincts are all the results of physiological differences and peculiarities which have been developed from a common stock at least there is every reason to believe so but it is a most singular circumstance that while you may run through almost the whole series of physiological processes without finding a check to your argument you come at last to a point where you do find a check and that is in the reproductive processes for there is a most singular circumstance in respect to natural speciesat least about some of themand it would be sufficient for the purposes of this argument if it were true of only one of them but there is in fact a great number of such casesand that is that similar as they may appear to be to mere races or breeds they present a marked peculiarity in the reproductive process if you breed from the male and female of the same race you of course have offspring of the like kind and if you make the offspring breed together you obtain the same result and if you breed from these again you will still have the same kind of offspring there is no check but if you take members of two distinct species however similar they may be to each other and make them breed together you will find a check with some modifications and exceptions however which i shall speak of presently if you cross two such species with each other thenalthough you may get offspring in the case of the first cross yet if you attempt to breed from the products of that crossing which are what are called hybridsthat is if you couple a male and a female hybridthen the result is that in ninetynine cases out of a hundred you will get no offspring at all there will be no result whatsoever  the reason of this is quite obvious in some cases the male hybrids although possessing all the external appearances and characteristics of perfect animals are physiologically imperfect and deficient in the structural parts of the reproductive elements necessary to generation it is said to be invariably the case with the male mule the cross between the ass and the mare and hence it is that although crossing the horse with the ass is easy enough and is constantly done as far as i am aware if you take two mules a male and a female and endeavour to breed from them you get no offspring whatever no generation will take place this is what is called the sterility of the hybrids between two distinct species  you see that this is a very extraordinary circumstance one does not see why it should be the common teleological explanation is that it is to prevent the impurity of the blood resulting from the crossing of one species with another but you see it does not in reality do anything of the kind there is nothing in this fact that hybrids cannot breed with each other to establish such a theory there is nothing to prevent the horse breeding with the ass or the ass with the horse so that this explanation breaks down as a great many explanations of this kind do that are only founded on mere assumptions  thus you see that there is a great difference between mongrels which are crosses between distinct races and hybrids which are crosses between distinct species the mongrels are so far as we know fertile with one another but between species in many cases you cannot succeed in obtaining even the first cross at any rate it is quite certain that the hybrids are often absolutely infertile one with another  here is a feature then great or small as it may be which distinguishes natural species of animals can we find any approximation to this in the different races known to be produced by selective breeding from a common stock up to the present time the answer to that question is absolutely a negative one as far as we know at present there is nothing approximating to this check in crossing the breeds between the fantail and the pouter the carrier and the tumbler or any other variety or race you may nameso far as we know at presentthere is no difficulty in breeding together the mongrels take the carrier and the fantail for instance and let them represent the horse and the ass in the case of distinct species then you have as the result of their breeding the carrierfantail mongrelwe will say the male and female mongreland as far as we know these two when crossed would not be less fertile than the original cross or than carrier with carrier here you see is a physiological contrast between the races produced by selective modification and natural species i shall inquire into the value of this fact and of some modifying circumstances by and by for the present i merely put it broadly before you  but while considering this question of the limitations of species a word must be said about what is called recurrencethe tendency of races which have been developed by selective breeding from varieties to return to their primitive type this is supposed by many to put an absolute limit to the extent of selective and all other variations people say it is all very well to talk about producing these different races but you know very well that if you turned all these birds wild these pouters and carriers and so on they would all return to their primitive stock this is very commonly assumed to be a fact and it is an argument that is commonly brought forward as conclusive but if you will take the trouble to inquire into it rather closely i think you will find that it is not worth very much the first question of course is do they thus return to the primitive stock and commonly as the thing is assumed and accepted it is extremely difficult to get anything like good evidence of it it is constantly said for example that if domesticated horses are turned wild as they have been in some parts of asia minor and south america that they return at once to the primitive stock from which they were bred but the first answer that you make to this assumption is to ask who knows what the primitive stock was and the second answer is that in that case the wild horses of asia minor ought to be exactly like the wild horses of south america if they are both like the same thing they ought manifestly to be like each other the best authorities however tell you that it is quite different the wild horse of asia is said to be of a dun colour with a largish head and a great many other peculiarities while the best authorities on the wild horses of south america tell you that there is no similarity between their wild horses and those of asia minor the cut of their heads is very different and they are commonly chestnut or baycoloured it is quite clear therefore that as by these facts there ought to have been two primitive stocks they go for nothing in support of the assumption that races recur to one primitive stock and so far as this evidence is concerned it falls to the ground  suppose for a moment that it were so and that domesticated races when turned wild did return to some common condition i cannot see that this would prove much more than that similar conditions are likely to produce similar results and that when you take back domesticated animals into what we call natural conditions you do exactly the same thing as if you carefully undid all the work you had gone through for the purpose of bringing the animal from its wild to its domesticated state i do not see anything very wonderful in the fact if it took all that trouble to get it from a wild state that it should go back into its original state as soon as you removed the conditions which produced the variation to the domesticated form there is an important fact however forcibly brought forward by mr darwin which has been noticed in connection with the breeding of domesticated pigeons and it is that however different these breeds of pigeons may be from each other and we have already noticed the great differences in these breeds that if among any of those variations you chance to have a blue pigeon turn up it will be sure to have the black bars across the wings which are characteristic of the original wild stock the rock pigeon  now this is certainly a very remarkable circumstance but i do not see myself how it tells very strongly either one way or the other i think in fact that this argument in favour of recurrence to the primitive type might prove a great deal too much for those who so constantly bring it forward for example mr darwin has very forcibly urged that nothing is commoner than if you examine a dun horseand i had an opportunity of verifying this illustration lately while in the islands of the west highlands where there are a great many dun horsesto find that horse exhibit a long black stripe down his back very often stripes on his shoulder and very often stripes on his legs i myself saw a pony of this description a short time ago in a bakers cart near rothesay in bute it had the long stripe down the back and stripes on the shoulders and legs just like those of the ass the quagga and the zebra now if we interpret the theory of recurrence as applied to this case might it not be said that here was a case of a variation exhibiting the characters and conditions of an animal occupying something like an intermediate position between the horse the ass the quagga and the zebra and from which these had been developed in the same way with regard even to man every anatomist will tell you that there is nothing commoner in dissecting the human body than to meet with what are called muscular variationsthat is if you dissect two bodies very carefully you will probably find that the modes of attachment and insertion of the muscles are not exactly the same in both there being great peculiarities in the mode in which the muscles are arranged and it is very singular that in some dissections of the human body you will come upon arrangements of the muscles very similar indeed to the same parts in the apes is the conclusion in that case to be that this is like the black bars in the case of the pigeon and that it indicates a recurrence to the primitive type from which the animals have been probably developed truly i think that the opponents of modification and variation had better leave the argument of recurrence alone or it may prove altogether too strong for them  to sum upthe evidence as far as we have gone is against the argument as to any limit to divergences so far as structure is concerned and in favour of a physiological limitation by selective breeding we can produce structural divergences as great as those of species but we cannot produce equal physiological divergences for the present i leave the question there  now the next problem that lies before usand it is an extremely important oneis this does this selective breeding occur in nature because if there is no proof of it all that i have been telling you goes for nothing in accounting for the origin of species are natural causes competent to play the part of selection in perpetuating varieties here we labour under very great difficulties in the last lecture i had occasion to point out to you the extreme difficulty of obtaining evidence even of the first origin of those varieties which we know to have occurred in domesticated animals i told you that almost always the origin of these varieties is overlooked so that i could only produce two or three cases as that of gratio kelleia and of the ancon sheep people forget or do not take notice of them until they come to have a prominence and if that is true of artificial cases under our own eyes and in animals in our own care how much more difficult it must be to have at first hand good evidence of the origin of varieties in nature indeed i do not know that it is possible by direct evidence to prove the origin of a variety in nature or to prove selective breeding but i will tell you what we can proveand this comes to the same thingthat varieties exist in nature within the limits of species and what is more that when a variety has come into existence in nature there are natural causes and conditions which are amply competent to play the part of a selective breeder and although that is not quite the evidence that one would like to havethough it is not direct testimonyyet it is exceeding good and exceedingly powerful evidence in its way  as to the first point of varieties existing among natural species i might appeal to the universal experience of every naturalist and of any person who has ever turned any attention at all to the characteristics of plants and animals in a state of nature but i may as well take a few definite cases and i will begin with man himself  i am one of those who believe that at present there is no evidence whatever for saying that mankind sprang originally from any more than a single pair i must say that i cannot see any good ground whatever or even any tenable sort of evidence for believing that there is more than one species of man nevertheless as you know just as there are numbers of varieties in animals so there are remarkable varieties of men i speak not merely of those broad and distinct variations which you see at a glance everybody of course knows the difference between a negro and a white man and can tell a chinaman from an englishman they each have peculiar characteristics of colour and physiognomy but you must recollect that the characters of these races go very far deeperthey extend to the bony structure and to the characters of that most important of all organs to usthe brain so that among men belonging to different races or even within the same race one man shall have a brain a third or half or even seventy per cent bigger than another and if you take the whole range of human brains you will find a variation in some cases of a hundred per cent apart from these variations in the size of the brain the characters of the skull vary thus if i draw the figures of a mongol and of a negro head on the blackboard in the case of the last the breadth would be about seventenths and in the other it would be ninetenths of the total length so that you see there is abundant evidence of variation among men in their natural condition and if you turn to other animals there is just the same thing the fox for example which has a very large geographical distribution all over europe and parts of asia and on the american continent varies greatly there are mostly large foxes in the north and smaller ones in the south in germany alone the foresters reckon some eight different sorts  of the tiger no one supposes that there is more than one species they extend from the hottest parts of bengal into the dry cold bitter steppes of siberia into a latitude of 50°so that they may even prey upon the reindeer these tigers have exceedingly different characteristics but still they all keep their general features so that there is no doubt as to their being tigers the siberian tiger has a thick fur a small mane and a longitudinal stripe down the back while the tigers of java and sumatra differ in many important respects from the tigers of northern asia so lions vary so birds vary and so if you go further back and lower down in creation you find that fishes vary in different streams in the same country even you will find the trout to be quite different to each other and easily recognisable by those who fish in the particular streams there is the same differences in leeches leech collectors can easily point out to you the differences and the peculiarities which you yourself would probably pass by so with freshwater mussels so in fact with every animal you can mention  in plants there is the same kind of variation take such a case even as the common bramble the botanists are all at war about it some of them wanting to make out that there are many species of it and others maintaining that they are but many varieties of one species and they cannot settle to this day which is a species and which is a variety  so that there can be no doubt whatsoever that any plant and any animal may vary in nature that varieties may arise in the way i have describedas spontaneous varietiesand that those varieties may be perpetuated in the same way that i have shown you spontaneous varieties are perpetuated i say therefore that there can be no doubt as to the origin and perpetuation of varieties in nature  but the question now isdoes selection take place in nature is there anything like the operation of man in exercising selective breeding taking place in nature you will observe that at present i say nothing about species i wish to confine myself to the consideration of the production of those natural races which everybody admits to exist the question is whether in nature there are causes competent to produce races just in the same way as man is able to produce by selection such races of animals as we have already noticed  when a variety has arisen the conditions of existence are such as to exercise an influence which is exactly comparable to that of artificial selection by conditions of existence i mean two thingsthere are conditions which are furnished by the physical the inorganic world and there are conditions of existence which are furnished by the organic world there is in the first place climate under that head i include only temperature and the varied amount of moisture of particular places in the next place there is what is technically called station which meansgiven the climate the particular kind of place in which an animal or a plant lives or grows for example the station of a fish is in the water of a freshwater fish in fresh water the station of a marine fish is in the sea and a marine animal may have a station higher or deeper so again with land animals the differences in their stations are those of different soils and neighbourhoods some being best adapted to a calcareous and others to an arenaceous soil the third condition of existence is food by which i mean food in the broadest sense the supply of the materials necessary to the existence of an organic being in the case of a plant the inorganic matters such as carbonic acid water ammonia and the earthy salts or salines in the case of the animal the inorganic and organic matters which we have seen they require then these are all at least the first two what we may call the inorganic or physical conditions of existence food takes a midplace and then come the organic conditions by which i mean the conditions which depend upon the state of the rest of the organic creation upon the number and kind of living beings with which an animal is surrounded you may class these under two heads there are organic beings which operate as opponents and there are organic beings which operate as helpers to any given organic creature the opponents may be of two kinds there are the indirect opponents which are what we may call rivals and there are the direct opponents those which strive to destroy the creature and these we call enemies by rivals i mean of course in the case of plants those which require for their support the same kind of soil and station and among animals those which require the same kind of station or food or climate those are the indirect opponents the direct opponents are of course those which prey upon an animal or vegetable the helpers may also be regarded as direct and indirect in the case of a carnivorous animal for example a particular herbaceous plant may in multiplying be an indirect helper by enabling the herbivora on which the carnivore preys to get more food and thus to nourish the carnivore more abundantly the direct helper may be best illustrated by reference to some parasitic creature such as the tapeworm the tapeworm exists in the human intestines so that the fewer there are of men the fewer there will be of tapeworms other things being alike it is a humiliating reflection perhaps that we may be classed as direct helpers to the tapeworm but the fact is so we can all see that if there were no men there would be no tapeworms  it is extremely difficult to estimate in a proper way the importance and the working of the conditions of existence i do not think there were any of us who had the remotest notion of properly estimating them until the publication of mr darwins work which has placed them before us with remarkable clearness and i must endeavour as far as i can in my own fashion to give you some notion of how they work we shall find it easiest to take a simple case and one as free as possible from every kind of complication  i will suppose therefore that all the habitable part of this globethe dry land amounting to about 51000000 square milesi will suppose that the whole of that dry land has the same climate and that it is composed of the same kind of rock or soil so that there will be the same station everywhere we thus get rid of the peculiar influence of different climates and stations i will then imagine that there shall be but one organic being in the world and that shall be a plant in this we start fair its food is to be carbonic acid water and ammonia and the saline matters in the soil which are by the supposition everywhere alike we take one single plant with no opponents no helpers and no rivals it is to be a fair field and no favour now i will ask you to imagine further that it shall be a plant which shall produce every year fifty seeds which is a very moderate number for a plant to produce and that by the action of the winds and currents these seeds shall be equally and gradually distributed over the whole surface of the land i want you now to trace out what will occur and you will observe that i am not talking fallaciously any more than a mathematician does when he expounds his problem if you show that the conditions of your problem are such as may actually occur in nature and do not transgress any of the known laws of nature in working out your proposition then you are as safe in the conclusion you arrive at as is the mathematician in arriving at the solution of his problem in science the only way of getting rid of the complications with which a subject of this kind is environed is to work in this deductive method what will be the result then i will suppose that every plant requires one square foot of ground to live upon and the result will be that in the course of nine years the plant will have occupied every single available spot in the whole globe i have chalked upon the blackboard the figures by which i arrive at the result                plants                                       plants

the end of the ninth    year  you will see from this that at the end of the first year the single plant will have produced fifty more of its kind by the end of the second year these will have increased to 2500 and so on in succeeding years you get beyond even trillions and i am not at all sure that i could tell you what the proper arithmetical denomination of the total number really is but at any rate you will understand the meaning of all those noughts then you see that at the bottom i have taken the 51000000 of square miles constituting the surface of the dry land and as the number of square feet are placed under and subtracted from the number of seeds that would be produced in the ninth year you can see at once that there would be an immense number more of plants than there would be square feet of ground for their accommodation this is certainly quite enough to prove my point that between the eighth and ninth year after being planted the single plant would have stocked the whole available surface of the earth  this is a thing which is hardly conceivableit seems hardly imaginableyet it is so it is indeed simply the law of malthus exemplified mr malthus was a clergyman who worked out this subject most minutely and truthfully some years ago he showed quite clearlyand although he was much abused for his conclusions at the time they have never yet been disproved and never will behe showed that in consequence of the increase in the number of organic beings in a geometrical ratio while the means of existence cannot be made to increase in the same ratio that there must come a time when the number of organic beings will be in excess of the power of production of nutriment and that thus some check must arise to the further increase of those organic beings at the end of the ninth year we have seen that each plant would not be able to get its full square foot of ground and at the end of another year it would have to share that space with fifty others the produce of the seeds which it would give off  what then takes place every plant grows up flourishes occupies its square foot of ground and gives off its fifty seeds but notice this that out of this number only one can come to anything there is thus as it were fortynine chances to one against its growing up it depends upon the most fortuitous circumstances whether any one of these fifty seeds shall grow up and flourish or whether it shall die and perish this is what mr darwin has drawn attention to and called the struggle for existence and i have taken this simple case of a plant because some people imagine that the phrase seems to imply a sort of fight  i have taken this plant and shown you that this is the result of the ratio of the increase the necessary result of the arrival of a time coming for every species when exactly as many members must be destroyed as are born that is the inevitable ultimate result of the rate of production now what is the result of all this i have said that there are fortynine struggling against every one and it amounts to this that the smallest possible start given to any one seed may give it an advantage which will enable it to get ahead of all the others anything that will enable any one of these seeds to germinate six hours before any of the others will other things being alike enable it to choke them out altogether i have shown you that there is no particular in which plants will not vary from each other it is quite possible that one of our imaginary plants may vary in such a character as the thickness of the integument of its seeds it might happen that one of the plants might produce seeds having a thinner integument and that would enable the seeds of that plant to germinate a little quicker than those of any of the others and those seeds would most inevitably extinguish the fortynine times as many that were struggling with them  i have put it in this way but you see the practical result of the process is the same as if some person had nurtured the one and destroyed the other seeds it does not matter how the variation is produced so long as it is once allowed to occur the variation in the plant once fairly started tends to become hereditary and reproduce itself the seeds would spread themselves in the same way and take part in the struggle with the fortynine hundred or fortynine thousand with which they might be exposed thus by degrees this variety with some slight organic change or modification must spread itself over the whole surface of the habitable globe and extirpate or replace the other kinds that is what is meant by natural selection that is the kind of argument by which it is perfectly demonstrable that the conditions of existence may play exactly the same part for natural varieties as man does for domesticated varieties no one doubts at all that particular circumstances may be more favourable for one plant and less so for another and the moment you admit that you admit the selective power of nature now although i have been putting a hypothetical case you must not suppose that i have been reasoning hypothetically there are plenty of direct experiments which bear out what we may call the theory of natural selection there is extremely good authority for the statement that if you take the seed of mixed varieties of wheat and sow it collecting the seed next year and sowing it again at length you will find that out of all your varieties only two or three have lived or perhaps even only one there were one or two varieties which were best fitted to get on and they have killed out the other kinds in just the same way and with just the same certainty as if you had taken the trouble to remove them as i have already said the operation of nature is exactly the same as the artificial operation of man  but if this be true of that simple case which i put before you where there is nothing but the rivalry of one member of a species with others what must be the operation of selective conditions when you recollect as a matter of fact that for every species of animal or plant there are fifty or a hundred species which might all more or less be comprehended in the same climate food and stationthat every plant has multitudinous animals which prey upon it and which are its direct opponents and that these have other animals preying upon themthat every plant has its indirect helpers in the birds that scatter abroad its seed and the animals that manure it with their dungi say when these things are considered it seems impossible that any variation which may arise in a species in nature should not tend in some way or other either to be a little better or worse than the previous stock if it is a little better it will have an advantage over and tend to extirpate the latter in this crush and struggle and if it is a little worse it will itself be extirpated  i know nothing that more appropriately expresses this than the phrase the struggle for existence  because it brings before your minds in a vivid sort of way some of the simplest possible circumstances connected with it when a struggle is intense there must be some who are sure to be trodden down crushed and overpowered by others and there will be some who just manage to get through only by the help of the slightest accident i recollect reading an account of the famous retreat of the french troops under napoleon from moscow worn out tired and dejected they at length came to a great river over which there was but one bridge for the passage of the vast army disorganised and demoralised as that army was the struggle must certainly have been a terrible oneevery one heeding only himself and crushing through the ranks and treading down his fellows the writer of the narrative who was himself one of those who were fortunate enough to succeed in getting over and not among the thousands who were left behind or forced into the river ascribed his escape to the fact that he saw striding onward through the mass a great strong fellowone of the french cuirassiers who had on a large blue cloakand he had enough presence of mind to catch and retain a hold of this strong mans cloak he says i caught hold of his cloak and although he swore at me and cut at and struck me by turns and at last when he found he could not shake me off fell to entreating me to leave go or i should prevent him from escaping besides not assisting myself i still kept tight hold of him and would not quit my grasp until he had at last dragged me through here you see was a case of selective savingif we may so term itdepending for its success on the strength of the cloth of the cuirassiers cloak it is the same in nature every species has its bridge of beresina it has to fight its way through and struggle with other species and when wellnigh overpowered it may be that the smallest chance something in its colour perhapsthe minutest circumstancewill turn the scale one way or the other  suppose that by a variation of the black race it had produced the white man at any timeyou know that the negroes are said to believe this to have been the case and to imagine that cain was the first white man and that we are his descendantssuppose that this had ever happened and that the first residence of this human being was on the west coast of africa there is no great structural difference between the white man and the negro and yet there is something so singularly different in the constitution of the two that the malarias of that country which do not hurt the black at all cut off and destroy the white then you see there would have been a selective operation performed if the white man had risen in that way he would have been selected out and removed by means of the malaria now there really is a very curious case of selection of this sort among pigs and it is a case of selection of colour too in the woods of florida there are a great many pigs and it is a very curious thing that they are all black every one of them professor wyman was there some years ago and on noticing no pigs but these black ones he asked some of the people how it was that they had no white pigs and the reply was that in the woods of florida there was a root which they called the paint root and that if the white pigs were to eat any of it it had the effect of making their hoofs crack and they died but if the black pigs ate any of it it did not hurt them at all here was a very simple case of natural selection a skilful breeder could not more carefully develop the black breed of pigs and weed out all the white pigs than the paint root does  to show you how remarkably indirect may be such natural selective agencies as i have referred to i will conclude by noticing a case mentioned by mr darwin and which is certainly one of the most curious of its kind it is that of the humble bee it has been noticed that there are a great many more humble bees in the neighbourhood of towns than out in the open country and the explanation of the matter is this the humble bees build nests in which they store their honey and deposit the larvæ and eggs the field mice are amazingly fond of the honey and larvæ therefore wherever there are plenty of field mice as in the country the humble bees are kept down but in the neighbourhood of towns the number of cats which prowl about the fields eat up the field mice and of course the more mice they eat up the less there are to prey upon the larvæ of the beesthe cats are therefore the indirect helpers of the bees footnote the humble bees on the other hand are direct helpers of some plants such as the heartsease and red clover which are fertilised by the visits of the bees and they are indirect helpers of the numerous insects which are more or less completely supported by the heartsease and red clover coming back a step farther we may say that the old maids are also indirect friends of the humble bees and indirect enemies of the field mice as they keep the cats which eat up the latter this is an illustration somewhat beneath the dignity of the subject perhaps but it occurs to me in passing and with it i will conclude this lecture    vi a critical examination of the position of mr darwins work on the origin of species in relation to the complete theory of the causes of the phenomena of organic nature   in the preceding five lectures i have endeavoured to give you an account of those facts and of those reasonings from facts which form the data upon which all theories regarding the causes of the phenomena of organic nature must be based and although i have had frequent occasion to quote mr darwinas all persons hereafter in speaking upon these subjects will have occasion to quote his famous book on the origin of speciesyou must yet remember that wherever i have quoted him it has not been upon theoretical points or for statements in any way connected with his particular speculations but on matters of fact brought forward by himself or collected by himself and which appear incidentally in his book if a man will make a book professing to discuss a single question an encyclopædia i cannot help it  now having had an opportunity of considering in this sort of way the different statements bearing upon all theories whatsoever i have to lay before you as fairly as i can what is mr darwins view of the matter and what position his theories hold when judged by the principles which i have previously laid down as deciding our judgments upon all theories and hypotheses  i have already stated to you that the inquiry respecting the causes of the phenomena of organic nature resolves itself into two problemsthe first being the question of the origination of living or organic beings and the second being the totally distinct problem of the modification and perpetuation of organic beings when they have already come into existence the first question mr darwin does not touch he does not deal with it at all but he saysgiven the origin of organic mattersupposing its creation to have already taken place my object is to show in consequence of what laws and what demonstrable properties of organic matter and of its environments such states of organic nature as those with which we are acquainted must have come about this you will observe is a perfectly legitimate proposition every person has a right to define the limits of the inquiry which he sets before himself and yet it is a most singular thing that in all the multifarious and not unfrequently ignorant attacks which have been made upon the origin of species there is nothing which has been more speciously criticised than this particular limitation if people have nothing else to urge against the book they saywell after all you see mr darwins explanation of the origin of species is not good for much because in the long run he admits that he does not know how organic matter began to exist but if you admit any special creation for the first particle of organic matter you may just as well admit it for all the rest five hundred or five thousand distinct creations are just as intelligible and just as little difficult to understand as one the answer to these cavils is twofold in the first place all human inquiry must stop somewhere all our knowledge and all our investigation cannot take us beyond the limits set by the finite and restricted character of our faculties or destroy the endless unknown which accompanies like its shadow the endless procession of phenomena so far as i can venture to offer an opinion on such a matter the purpose of our being in existence the highest object that human beings can set before themselves is not the pursuit of any such chimera as the annihilation of the unknown but it is simply the unwearied endeavour to remove its boundaries a little further from our little sphere of action  i wonder if any historian would for a moment admit the objection that it is preposterous to trouble ourselves about the history of the roman empire because we do not know anything positive about the origin and first building of the city of rome would it be a fair objection to urge respecting the sublime discoveries of a newton or a kepler those great philosophers whose discoveries have been of the profoundest benefit and service to all mento say to themafter all that you have told us as to how the planets revolve and how they are maintained in their orbits you cannot tell us what is the cause of the origin of the sun moon and stars so what is the use of what you have done yet these objections would not be one whit more preposterous than the objections which have been made to the origin of species mr darwin then had a perfect right to limit his inquiry as he pleased and the only question for usthe inquiry being so limitedis to ascertain whether the method of his inquiry is sound or unsound whether he has obeyed the canons which must guide and govern all investigation or whether he has broken them and it was because our inquiry this evening is essentially limited to that question that i spent a good deal of time in a former lecture which perhaps some of you thought might have been better employed in endeavouring to illustrate the method and nature of scientific inquiry in general we shall now have to put in practice the principles that i then laid down  i stated to you in substance if not in words that wherever there are complex masses of phenomena to be inquired into whether they be phenomena of the affairs of daily life or whether they belong to the more abstruse and difficult problems laid before the philosopher our course of proceeding in unravelling that complex chain of phenomena with a view to get at its cause is always the same in all cases we must invent an hypothesis we must place before ourselves some more or less likely supposition respecting that cause and then having assumed an hypothesis having supposed a cause for the phenomena in question we must endeavour on the one hand to demonstrate our hypothesis or on the other to upset and reject it altogether by testing it in three ways we must in the first place be prepared to prove that the supposed causes of the phenomena exist in nature that they are what the logicians call vera causætrue causesin the next place we should be prepared to show that the assumed causes of the phenomena are competent to produce such phenomena as those which we wish to explain by them and in the last place we ought to be able to show that no other known causes are competent to produce these phenomena if we can succeed in satisfying these three conditions we shall have demonstrated our hypothesis or rather i ought to say we shall have proved it as far as certainty is possible for us for after all there is no one of our surest convictions which may not be upset or at any rate modified by a further accession of knowledge it was because it satisfied these conditions that we accepted the hypothesis as to the disappearance of the teapot and spoons in the case i supposed in a previous lecture we found that our hypothesis on that subject was tenable and valid because the supposed cause existed in nature because it was competent to account for the phenomena and because no other known cause was competent to account for them and it is upon similar grounds that any hypothesis you choose to name is accepted in science as tenable and valid  what is mr darwins hypothesis as i apprehend itfor i have put it into a shape more convenient for common purposes than i could find verbatim in his bookas i apprehend it i say it is that all the phenomena of organic nature past and present result from or are caused by the interaction of those properties of organic matter which we have called atavism and variability with the conditions of existence or in other wordsgiven the existence of organic matter its tendency to transmit its properties and its tendency occasionally to vary and lastly given the conditions of existence by which organic matter is surroundedthat these put together are the causes of the present and of the past conditions of organic nature  such is the hypothesis as i understand it now let us see how it will stand the various tests which i laid down just now in the first place do these supposed causes of the phenomena exist in nature is it the fact that in nature these properties of organic matteratavism and variabilityand those phenomena which we have called the conditions of existenceis it true that they exist well of course if they do not exist all that i have told you in the last three or four lectures must be incorrect because i have been attempting to prove that they do exist and i take it that there is abundant evidence that they do exist so far therefore the hypothesis does not break down  but in the next place comes a much more difficult inquiryare the causes indicated competent to give rise to the phenomena of organic nature i suspect that this is indubitable to a certain extent it is demonstrable i think as i have endeavoured to show you that they are perfectly competent to give rise to all the phenomena which are exhibited by races in nature furthermore i believe that they are quite competent to account for all that we may call purely structural phenomena which are exhibited by species in nature on that point also i have already enlarged somewhat again i think that the causes assumed are competent to account for most of the physiological characteristics of species and i not only think that they are competent to account for them but i think that they account for many things which otherwise remain wholly unaccountable and inexplicable and i may say incomprehensible for a full exposition of the grounds on which this conviction is based i must refer you to mr darwins work all that i can do now is to illustrate what i have said by two or three cases taken almost at random  i drew your attention on a previous evening to the facts which are embodied in our systems of classification which are the results of the examination and comparison of the different members of the animal kingdom one with another i mentioned that the whole of the animal kingdom is divisible into five subkingdoms that each of these subkingdoms is again divisible into provinces that each province may be divided into classes and the classes into the successively smaller groups orders families genera and species  now in each of these groups the resemblance in structure among the members of the group is closer in proportion as the group is smaller thus a man and a worm are members of the animal kingdom in virtue of certain apparently slight though really fundamental resemblances which they present but a man and a fish are members of the same subkingdom vertebrata because they are much more like one another than either of them is to a worm or a snail or any member of the other subkingdoms for similar reasons men and horses are arranged as members of the same class mammalia men and apes as members of the same order primates and if there were any animals more like men than they were like any of the apes and yet different from men in important and constant particulars of their organisation we should rank them as members of the same family or of the same genus but as of distinct species  that it is possible to arrange all the varied forms of animals into groups having this sort of singular subordination one to the other is a very remarkable circumstance but as mr darwin remarks this is a result which is quite to be expected if the principles which he lays down be correct take the case of the races which are known to be produced by the operation of atavism and variability and the conditions of existence which check and modify these tendencies take the case of the pigeons that i brought before you there it was shown that they might be all classed as belonging to some one of five principal divisions and that within these divisions other subordinate groups might be formed the members of these groups are related to one another in just the same way as the genera of a family and the groups themselves as the families of an order or the orders of a class while all have the same sort of structural relations with the wild rockpigeon as the members of any great natural group have with a real or imaginary typical form now we know that all varieties of pigeons of every kind have arisen by a process of selective breeding from a common stock the rockpigeon hence you see that if all species of animals have proceeded from some common stock the general character of their structural relations and of our systems of classification which express those relations would be just what we find them to be in other words the hypothetical cause is so far competent to produce effects similar to those of the real cause  take again another set of very remarkable factsthe existence of what are called rudimentary organs organs for which we can find no obvious use in the particular animal economy in which they are found and yet which are there  such are the splintlike bones in the leg of the horse which i here show you and which correspond with bones which belong to certain toes and fingers in the human hand and foot in the horse you see they are quite rudimentary and bear neither toes nor fingers so that the horse has only one finger in his forefoot and one toe in his hindfoot but it is a very curious thing that the animals closely allied to the horse show more toes than he as the rhinoceros for instance he has these extra toes well formed and anatomical facts show very clearly that he is very closely related to the horse indeed so we may say that animals in an anatomical sense nearly related to the horse have those parts which are rudimentary in him fully developed  again the sheep and the cow have no cuttingteeth but only a hard pad in the upper jaw that is the common characteristic of ruminants in general but the calf has in its upper jaw some rudiments of teeth which never are developed and never play the part of teeth at all well if you go back in time you find some of the older now extinct allies of the ruminants have welldeveloped teeth in their upper jaws and at the present day the pig which is in structure closely connected with ruminants has welldeveloped teeth in its upper jaw so that here is another instance of organs welldeveloped and very useful in one animal represented by rudimentary organs for which we can discover no purpose whatsoever in another closely allied animal the whalebone whale again has horny whalebone plates in its mouth and no teeth but the young foetal whale before it is born has teeth in its jaws they however are never used and they never come to anything but other members of the group to which the whale belongs have welldeveloped teeth in both jaws  upon any hypothesis of special creation facts of this kind appear to me to be entirely unaccountable and inexplicable but they cease to be so if you accept mr darwins hypothesis and see reason for believing that the whalebone whale and the whale with teeth in its mouth both sprang from a whale that had teeth and that the teeth of the foetal whale are merely remnantsrecollections if we may so sayof the extinct whale so in the case of the horse and the rhinoceros suppose that both have descended by modification from some earlier form which had the normal number of toes and the persistence of the rudimentary bones which no longer support toes in the horse becomes comprehensible  in the language that we speak in england and in the language of the greeks there are identical verbal roots or elements entering into the composition of words that fact remains unintelligible so long as we suppose english and greek to be independently created tongues but when it is shown that both languages are descended from one original we give an explanation of that resemblance in the same way the existence of identical structural roots if i may so term them entering into the composition of widely different animals is striking evidence in favour of the descent of those animals from a common original  to turn to another kind of illustrationif you regard the whole series of stratified rocksthat enormous thickness of sixty or seventy thousand feet that i have mentioned before constituting the only record we have of a most prodigious lapse of time that time being in all probability but a fraction of that of which we have no recordif you observe in these successive strata of rocks successive groups of animals arising and dying out a constant succession giving you the same kind of impression as you travel from one group of strata to another as you would have in travelling from one country to anotherwhen you find this constant succession of forms their traces obliterated except to the man of sciencewhen you look at this wonderful history and ask what it means it is only a paltering with words if you are offered the replythey were so created  but if on the other hand you look on all forms of organised beings as the results of the gradual modification of a primitive type the facts receive a meaning and you see that these older conditions are the necessary predecessors of the present viewed in this light the facts of palaeontology receive a meaningupon any other hypothesis i am unable to see in the slightest degree what knowledge or signification we are to draw out of them again note as bearing upon the same point the singular likeness which obtains between the successive faunæ and floræ whose remains are preserved on the rocks you never find any great and enormous difference between the immediately successive faunæ and floræ unless you have reason to believe there has also been a great lapse of time or a great change of conditions the animals for instance of the newest tertiary rocks in any part of the world are always and without exception found to be closely allied with those which now live in that part of the world for example in europe asia and africa the large mammals are at present rhinoceroses hippopotamuses elephants lions tigers oxen horses c and if you examine the newest tertiary deposits which contain the animals and plants which immediately preceded those which now exist in the same country you do not find gigantic specimens of anteaters and kangaroos but you find rhinoceroses elephants lions tigers cof different species to those now livingbut still their close allies if you turn to south america where at the present day we have great sloths and armadilloes and creatures of that kind what do you find in the newest tertiaries you find the great slothlike creature the megatherium and the great armadillo the glyptodon and so on and if you go to australia you find the same law holds good namely that that condition of organic nature which has preceded the one which now exists presents differences perhaps of species and of genera but that the great types of organic structure are the same as those which now flourish  what meaning has this fact upon any other hypothesis or supposition than one of successive modification but if the population of the world in any age is the result of the gradual modification of the forms which peopled it in the preceding ageif that has been the case it is intelligible enough because we may expect that the creature that results from the modification of an elephantine mammal shall be something like an elephant and the creature which is produced by the modification of an armadillolike mammal shall be like an armadillo upon that supposition i say the facts are intelligible upon any other that i am aware of they are not  so far the facts of palæontology are consistent with almost any form of the doctrine of progressive modification they would not be absolutely inconsistent with the wild speculations of de maillet or with the less objectionable hypothesis of lamarck but mr darwins views have one peculiar merit and that is that they are perfectly consistent with an array of facts which are utterly inconsistent with and fatal to any other hypothesis of progressive modification which has yet been advanced it is one remarkable peculiarity of mr darwins hypothesis that it involves no necessary progression or incessant modification and that it is perfectly consistent with the persistence for any length of time of a given primitive stock contemporaneously with its modifications to return to the case of the domestic breeds of pigeons for example you have the dovecot pigeon which closely resembles the rock pigeon from which they all started existing at the same time with the others and if species are developed in the same way in nature a primitive stock and its modifications may occasionally all find the conditions fitted for their existence and though they come into competition to a certain extent with one another the derivative species may not necessarily extirpate the primitive one or vice versa  now palæontology shows us many facts which are perfectly harmonious with these observed effects of the process by which mr darwin supposes species to have originated but which appear to me to be totally inconsistent with any other hypothesis which has been proposed there are some groups of animals and plants in the fossil world which have been said to belong to persistent types because they have persisted with very little change indeed through a very great range of time while everything about them has changed largely there are families of fishes whose type of construction has persisted all the way from the carboniferous strata right up to the cretaceous and others which have lasted through almost the whole range of the secondary rocks and from the lias to the older tertiaries it is something stupendous thisto consider a genus lasting without essential modifications through all this enormous lapse of time while almost everything else was changed and modified  thus i have no doubt that mr darwins hypothesis will be found competent to explain the majority of the phenomena exhibited by species in nature but in an earlier lecture i spoke cautiously with respect to its power of explaining all the physiological peculiarities of species  there is in fact one set of these peculiarities which the theory of selective modification as it stands at present is not wholly competent to explain and that is the group of phenomena which i mentioned to you under the name of hybridism and which i explained to consist in the sterility of the offspring of certain species when crossed one with another it matters not one whit whether this sterility is universal or whether it exists only in a single case every hypothesis is bound to explain or at any rate not be inconsistent with the whole of the facts which it professes to account for and if there is a single one of these facts which can be shown to be inconsistent with i do not merely mean inexplicable by but contrary to the hypothesis the hypothesis falls to the groundit is worth nothing one fact with which it is positively inconsistent is worth as much and as powerful in negativing the hypothesis as five hundred if i am right in thus defining the obligations of an hypothesis mr darwin in order to place his views beyond the reach of all possible assault ought to be able to demonstrate the possibility of developing from a particular stock by selective breeding two forms which should either be unable to cross one with another or whose crossbred offspring should be infertile with one another  for you see if you have not done that you have not strictly fulfilled all the conditions of the problem you have not shown that you can produce by the cause assumed all the phenomena which you have in nature here are the phenomena of hybridism staring you in the face and you cannot say i can by selective modification produce these same results now it is admitted on all hands that at present so far as experiments have gone it has not been found possible to produce this complete physiological divergence by selective breeding i stated this very clearly before and i now refer to the point because if it could be proved not only that this has not been done but that it cannot be done if it could be demonstrated that it is impossible to breed selectively from any stock a form which shall not breed with another produced from the same stock and if we were shown that this must be the necessary and inevitable results of all experiments i hold that mr darwins hypothesis would be utterly shattered  but has this been done or what is really the state of the case it is simply that so far as we have gone yet with our breeding we have not produced from a common stock two breeds which are not more or less fertile with one another  i do not know that there is a single fact which would justify any one in saying that any degree of sterility has been observed between breeds absolutely known to have been produced by selective breeding from a common stock on the other hand i do not know that there is a single fact which can justify any one in asserting that such sterility cannot be produced by proper experimentation for my own part i see every reason to believe that it may and will be so produced for as mr darwin has very properly urged when we consider the phenomena of sterility we find they are most capricious we do not know what it is that the sterility depends on there are some animals which will not breed in captivity whether it arises from the simple fact of their being shut up and deprived of their liberty or not we do not know but they certainly will not breed what an astounding thing this is to find one of the most important of all functions annihilated by mere imprisonment  so again there are cases known of animals which have been thought by naturalists to be undoubted species which have yielded perfectly fertile hybrids while there are other species which present what everybody believes to be varieties footnote and as i conceive with very good reason but if any objector urges that we cannot prove that they have been produced by artificial or natural selection the objection must be admittedultrasceptical as it is but in science scepticism is a duty which are more or less infertile with one another there are other cases which are truly extraordinary there is one for example which has been carefully examinedof two kinds of seaweed of which the male element of the one which we may call a fertilises the female element of the other b while the male element of b will not fertilise the female element of a so that while the former experiment seems to show us that they are varieties the latter leads to the conviction that they are species  when we see how capricious and uncertain this sterility is how unknown the conditions on which it depends i say that we have no right to affirm that those conditions will not be better understood by and by and we have no ground for supposing that we may not be able to experiment so as to obtain that crucial result which i mentioned just now so that though mr darwins hypothesis does not completely extricate us from this difficulty at present we have not the least right to say it will not do so  there is a wide gulf between the thing you cannot explain and the thing that upsets you altogether there is hardly any hypothesis in this world which has not some fact in connection with it which has not been explained but that is a very different affair to a fact that entirely opposes your hypothesis in this case all you can say is that your hypothesis is in the same position as a good many others  now as to the third test that there are no other causes competent to explain the phenomena i explained to you that one should be able to say of an hypothesis that no other known causes than those supposed by it are competent to give rise to the phenomena here i think mr darwins view is pretty strong i really believe that the alternative is either darwinism or nothing for i do not know of any rational conception or theory of the organic universe which has any scientific position at all beside mr darwins i do not know of any proposition that has been put before us with the intention of explaining the phenomena of organic nature which has in its favour a thousandth part of the evidence which may be adduced in favour of mr darwins views whatever may be the objections to his views certainly all other theories are absolutely out of court  take the lamarckian hypothesis for example lamarck was a great naturalist and to a certain extent went the right way to work he argued from what was undoubtedly a true cause of some of the phenomena of organic nature he said it is a matter of experience that an animal may be modified more or less in consequence of its desires and consequent actions thus if a man exercise himself as a blacksmith his arms will become strong and muscular such organic modification is a result of this particular action and exercise lamarck thought that by a very simple supposition based on this truth he could explain the origin of the various animal species he said for example that the shortlegged birds which live on fish had been converted into the longlegged waders by desiring to get the fish without wetting their feathers and so stretching their legs more and more through successive generations if lamarck could have shown experimentally that even races of animals could be produced in this way there might have been some ground for his speculations but he could show nothing of the kind and his hypothesis has pretty well dropped into oblivion as it deserved to do i said in an earlier lecture that there are hypotheses and hypotheses and when people tell you that mr darwins stronglybased hypothesis is nothing but a mere modification of lamarcks you will know what to think of their capacity for forming a judgment on this subject  but you must recollect that when i say i think it is either mr darwins hypothesis or nothing that either we must take his view or look upon the whole of organic nature as an enigma the meaning of which is wholly hidden from us you must understand that i mean that i accept it provisionally in exactly the same way as i accept any other hypothesis men of science do not pledge themselves to creeds they are bound by articles of no sort there is not a single belief that it is not a bounden duty with them to hold with a light hand and to part with cheerfully the moment it is really proved to be contrary to any fact great or small and if in course of time i see good reasons for such a proceeding i shall have no hesitation in coming before you and pointing out any change in my opinion without finding the slightest occasion to blush for so doing so i say that we accept this view as we accept any other so long as it will help us and we feel bound to retain it only so long as it will serve our great purposethe improvement of mans estate and the widening of his knowledge the moment this or any other conception ceases to be useful for these purposes away with it to the four winds we care not what becomes of it  but to say truth although it has been my business to attend closely to the controversies roused by the publication of mr darwins book i think that not one of the enormous mass of objections and obstacles which have been raised is of any very great value except that sterility case which i brought before you just now all the rest are misunderstandings of some sort arising either from prejudice or want of knowledge or still more from want of patience and care in reading the work  for you must recollect that it is not a book to be read with as much ease as its pleasant style may lead you to imagine you spin through it as if it were a novel the first time you read it and think you know all about it the second time you read it you think you know rather less about it and the third time you are amazed to find how little you have really apprehended its vast scope and objects i can positively say that i never take it up without finding in it some new view or light or suggestion that i have not noticed before that is the best characteristic of a thorough and profound book and i believe this feature of the origin of species explains why so many persons have ventured to pass judgment and criticisms upon it which are by no means worth the paper they are written on  before concluding these lectures there is one point to which i must advertthough as mr darwin has said nothing about man in his book it concerns myself rather than himfor i have strongly maintained on sundry occasions that if mr darwins views are sound they apply as much to man as to the lower mammals seeing that it is perfectly demonstrable that the structural differences which separate man from the apes are not greater than those which separate some apes from others there cannot be the slightest doubt in the world that the argument which applies to the improvement of the horse from an earlier stock or of ape from ape applies to the improvement of man from some simpler and lower stock than man there is not a single facultyfunctional or structural moral intellectual or instinctive thereis no faculty whatever that is not capable of improvement there is no faculty whatsoever which does not depend upon structure and as structure tends to vary it is capable of being improved  well i have taken a good deal of pains at various times to prove this and i have endeavoured to meet the objections of those who maintain that the structural differences between man and the lower animals are of so vast a character and enormous extent that even if mr darwins views are correct you cannot imagine this particular modification to take place it is in fact an easy matter to prove that so far as structure is concerned man differs to no greater extent from the animals which are immediately below him than these do from other members of the same order upon the other hand there is no one who estimates more highly than i do the dignity of human nature and the width of the gulf in intellectual and moral matters which lies between man and the whole of the lower creation  but i find this very argument brought forward vehemently by some you say that man has proceeded from a modification of some lower animal and you take pains to prove that the structural differences which are said to exist in his brain do not exist at all and you teach that all functions intellectual moral and others are the expression or the result in the long run of structures and of the molecular forces which they exert it is quite true that i do so  well but i am told at once somewhat triumphantly you say in the same breath that there is a great moral and intellectual chasm between man and the lower animals how is this possible when you declare that moral and intellectual characteristics depend on structure and yet tell us that there is no such gulf between the structure of man and that of the lower animals  i think that objection is based upon a misconception of the real relations which exist between structure and function between mechanism and work function is the expression of molecular forces and arrangements no doubt but does it follow from this that variation in function so depends upon variation in structure that the former is always exactly proportioned to the latter if there is no such relation if the variation in function which follows on a variation in structure may be enormously greater than the variation of the structure then you see the objection falls to the ground  take a couple of watchesmade by the same maker and as completely alike as possible set them upon the table and the function of eachwhich is its rate of goingwill be performed in the same manner and you shall be able to distinguish no difference between them but let me take a pair of pincers and if my hand is steady enough to do it let me just lightly crush together the bearings of the balancewheel or force to a slightly different angle the teeth of the escapement of one of them and of course you know the immediate result will be that the watch so treated from that moment will cease to go but what proportion is there between the structural alteration and the functional result is it not perfectly obvious that the alteration is of the minutest kind yet that slight as it is it has produced an infinite difference in the performance of the functions of these two instruments  well now apply that to the present question what is it that constitutes and makes man what he is what is it but his power of languagethat language giving him the means of recording his experiencemaking every generation somewhat wiser than its predecessormore in accordance with the established order of the universe  what is it but this power of speech of recording experience which enables men to be menlooking before and after and in some dim sense understanding the working of this wondrous universeand which distinguishes man from the whole of the brute world i say that this functional difference is vast unfathomable and truly infinite in its consequences and i say at the same time that it may depend upon structural differences which shall be absolutely inappreciable to us with our present means of investigation what is this very speech that we are talking about i am speaking to you at this moment but if you were to alter in the minutest degree the proportion of the nervous forces now active in the two nerves which supply the muscles of my glottis i should become suddenly dumb the voice is produced only so long as the vocal chords are parallel and these are parallel only so long as certain muscles contract with exact equality and that again depends on the equality of action of those two nerves i spoke of so that a change of the minutest kind in the structure of one of these nerves or in the structure of the part in which it originates or of the supply of blood to that part or of one of the muscles to which it is distributed might render all of us dumb but a race of dumb men deprived of all communication with those who could speak would be little indeed removed from the brutes and the moral and intellectual difference between them and ourselves would be practically infinite though the naturalist should not be able to find a single shadow of even specific structural difference  but let me dismiss this question now and in conclusion let me say that you may go away with it as my mature conviction that mr darwins work is the greatest contribution which has been made to biological science since the publication of the regne animal of cuvier and since that of the history of development of von baer i believe that if you strip it of its theoretical part it still remains one of the greatest encyclopaedias of biological doctrine that any one man ever brought forth and i believe that if you take it as the embodiment of an hypothesis it is destined to be the guide of biological and psychological speculation for the next three or four generations  end of vol ii
