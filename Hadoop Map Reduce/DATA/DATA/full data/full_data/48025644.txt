philosophy of furniture  in the internal decoration if not in the external architecture of their residences the english are supreme the italians have but little sentiment beyond marbles and colours in france meliora probant deteriora sequunturthe people are too much a race of gadabouts to maintain those household proprieties of which indeed they have a delicate appreciation or at least the elements of a proper sense the chinese and most of the eastern races have a warm but inappropriate fancy the scotch are poor decorists the dutch have perhaps an indeterminate idea that a curtain is not a cabbage in spain they are all curtainsa nation of hangmen the russians do not furnish the hottentots and kickapoos are very well in their way the yankees alone are preposterous  how this happens it is not difficult to see we have no aristocracy of blood and having therefore as a natural and indeed as an inevitable thing fashioned for ourselves an aristocracy of dollars the display of wealth has here to take the place and perform the office of the heraldic display in monarchical countries by a transition readily understood and which might have been as readily foreseen we have been brought to merge in simple show our notions of taste itself  to speak less abstractly in england for example no mere parade of costly appurtenances would be so likely as with us to create an impression of the beautiful in respect to the appurtenances themselvesor of taste as regards the proprietorthis for the reason first that wealth is not in england the loftiest object of ambition as constituting a nobility and secondly that there the true nobility of blood confining itself within the strict limits of legitimate taste rather avoids than affects that mere costliness in which a parvenu rivalry may at any time be successfully attempted  the people will imitate the nobles and the result is a thorough diffusion of the proper feeling but in america the coins current being the sole arms of the aristocracy their display may be said in general to be the sole means of the aristocratic distinction and the populace looking always upward for models are insensibly led to confound the two entirely separate ideas of magnificence and beauty in short the cost of an article of furniture has at length come to be with us nearly the sole test of its merit in a decorative point of viewand this test once established has led the way to many analogous errors readily traceable to the one primitive folly  there could be nothing more directly offensive to the eye of an artist than the interior of what is termed in the united statesthat is to say in appallachiaa wellfurnished apartment its most usual defect is a want of keeping we speak of the keeping of a room as we would of the keeping of a picturefor both the picture and the room are amenable to those undeviating principles which regulate all varieties of art and very nearly the same laws by which we decide on the higher merits of a painting suffice for decision on the adjustment of a chamber  a want of keeping is observable sometimes in the character of the several pieces of furniture but generally in their colours or modes of adaptation to use very often the eye is offended by their inartistic arrangement straight lines are too prevalenttoo uninterruptedly continuedor clumsily interrupted at right angles if curved lines occur they are repeated into unpleasant uniformity by undue precision the appearance of many a fine apartment is utterly spoiled  curtains are rarely well disposed or well chosen in respect to other decorations with formal furniture curtains are out of place and an extensive volume of drapery of any kind is under any circumstance irreconcilable with good tastethe proper quantum as well as the proper adjustment depending upon the character of the general effect  carpets are better understood of late than of ancient days but we still very frequently err in their patterns and colours the soul of the apartment is the carpet from it are deduced not only the hues but the forms of all objects incumbent a judge at common law may be an ordinary man a good judge of a carpet must be a genius yet we have heard discoursing of carpets with the air dun mouton qui reve fellows who should not and who could not be entrusted with the management of their own moustaches every one knows that a large floor may have a covering of large figures and that a small one must have a covering of smallyet this is not all the knowledge in the world as regards texture the saxony is alone admissible brussels is the preterpluperfect tense of fashion and turkey is taste in its dying agonies touching patterna carpet should not be bedizzened out like a riccaree indianall red chalk yellow ochre and cocks feathers in briefdistinct grounds and vivid circular or cycloid figures of no meaning are here median laws the abomination of flowers or representations of wellknown objects of any kind should not be endured within the limits of christendom indeed whether on carpets or curtains or tapestry or ottoman coverings all upholstery of this nature should be rigidly arabesque as for those antique floorcloth  still occasionally seen in the dwellings of the rabblecloths of huge sprawling and radiating devises stripeinterspersed and glorious with all hues among which no ground is intelligiblethese are but the wicked invention of a race of timeservers and moneyloverschildren of baal and worshippers of mammonbenthams who to spare thought and economize fancy first cruelly invented the kaleidoscope and then established jointstock companies to twirl it by steam   glare is a leading error in the philosophy of american household decorationan error easily recognised as deduced from the perversion of taste just specified we are violently enamoured of gas and of glass the former is totally inadmissible within doors its harsh and unsteady light offends no one having both brains and eyes will use it a mild or what artists term a cool light with its consequent warm shadows will do wonders for even an illfurnished apartment never was a more lovely thought than that of the astral lamp we mean of course the astral lamp properthe lamp of argand with its original plain groundglass shade and its tempered and uniform moonlight rays the cutglass shade is a weak invention of the enemy the eagerness with which we have adopted it partly on account of its flashiness but principally on account of its greater rest is a good commentary on the proposition with which we began it is not too much to say that the deliberate employer of a cutglass shade is either radically deficient in taste or blindly subservient to the caprices of fashion the light proceeding from one of these gaudy abominations is unequal broken and painful it alone is sufficient to mar a world of good effect in the furniture subjected to its influence female loveliness in especial is more than onehalf disenchanted beneath its evil eye  in the matter of glass generally we proceed upon false principles its leading feature is glitterand in that one word how much of all that is detestable do we express flickering unquiet lights are sometimes pleasingto children and idiots always sobut in the embellishment of a room they should be scrupulously avoided in truth even strong steady lights are inadmissible the huge and unmeaning glass chandeliers prismcut gaslighted and without shade which dangle in our most fashionable drawingrooms may be cited as the quintessence of all that is false in taste or preposterous in folly  the rage for glitterbecause its idea has become as we before observed confounded with that of magnificence in the abstracthas led us also to the exaggerated employment of mirrors we line our dwellings with great british plates and then imagine we have done a fine thing now the slightest thought will be sufficient to convince any one who has an eye at all of the ill effect of numerous lookingglasses and especially of large ones regarded apart from its reflection the mirror presents a continuous flat colourless unrelieved surfacea thing always and obviously unpleasant considered as a reflector it is potent in producing a monstrous and odious uniformity and the evil is here aggravated not in merely direct proportion with the augmentation of its sources but in a ratio constantly increasing in fact a room with four or five mirrors arranged at random is for all purposes of artistic show a room of no shape at all if we add to this evil the attendant glitter upon glitter we have a perfect farrago of discordant and displeasing effects the veriest bumpkin on entering an apartment so bedizzened would be instantly aware of something wrong although he might be altogether unable to assign a cause for his dissatisfaction but let the same person be led into a room tastefully furnished and he would be startled into an exclamation of pleasure and surprise  it is an evil growing out of our republican institutions that here a man of large purse has usually a very little soul which he keeps in it the corruption of taste is a portion or a pendant of the dollarmanufacture as we grow rich our ideas grow rusty it is therefore not among our aristocracy that we must look if at all in appallachia for the spirituality of a british boudoir but we have seen apartments in the tenure of americans of moderns possibly modest or moderate means which in negative merit at least might vie with any of the ormolud cabinets of our friends across the water even now there is present to our minds eye a small and not ostentatious chamber with whose decorations no fault can be found the proprietor lies asleep on a sofathe weather is coolthe time is near midnight we will make a sketch of the room during his slumber  it is oblongsome thirty feet in length and twentyfive in breadtha shape affording the bestordinary opportunities for the adjustment of furniture it has but one doorby no means a wide onewhich is at one end of the parallelogram and but two windows which are at the other these latter are large reaching down to the floorhave deep recessesand open on an italian veranda their panes are of a crimsontinted glass set in rosewood framings more massive than usual they are curtained within the recess by a thick silver tissue adapted to the shape of the window and hanging loosely in small volumes without the recess are curtains of an exceedingly rich crimson silk fringed with a deep network of gold and lined with silver tissue which is the material of the exterior blind there are no cornices but the folds of the whole fabric which are sharp rather than massive and have an airy appearance issue from beneath a broad entablature of rich giltwork which encircles the room at the junction of the ceiling and walls the drapery is thrown open also or closed by means of a thick rope of gold loosely enveloping it and resolving itself readily into a knot no pins or other such devices are apparent the colours of the curtains and their fringethe tints of crimson and goldappear everywhere in profusion and determine the character of the room the carpetof saxony materialis quite half an inch thick and is of the same crimson ground relieved simply by the appearance of a gold cord like that festooning the curtains slightly relieved above the surface of the ground and thrown upon it in such a manner as to form a succession of short irregular curvesone occasionally overlaying the other the walls are prepared with a glossy paper of a silver gray tint spotted with small arabesque devices of a fainter hue of the prevalent crimson many paintings relieve the expanse of paper these are chiefly landscapes of an imaginative castsuch as the fairy grottoes of stanfield or the lake of the dismal swamp of chapman there are nevertheless three or four female heads of an ethereal beautyportraits in the manner of sully the tone of each picture is warm but dark there are no brilliant effects repose speaks in all not one is of small size diminutive paintings give that spotty look to a room which is the blemish of so many a fine work of art overtouched the frames are broad but not deep and richly carved without being dulled or filagreed they have the whole lustre of burnished gold they lie flat on the walls and do not hang off with cords the designs themselves are often seen to better advantage in this latter position but the general appearance of the chamber is injured but one mirrorand this not a very large oneis visible in shape it is nearly circularand it is hung so that a reflection of the person can be obtained from it in none of the ordinary sittingplaces of the room two large low sofas of rosewood and crimson silk goldflowered form the only seats with the exception of two light conversation chairs also of rosewood there is a pianoforte rosewood also without cover and thrown open an octagonal table formed altogether of the richest goldthreaded marble is placed near one of the sofas this is also without coverthe drapery of the curtains has been thought sufficient four large and gorgeous sevres vases in which bloom a profusion of sweet and vivid flowers occupy the slightly rounded angles of the room a tall candelabrum bearing a small antique lamp with highly perfumed oil is standing near the head of my sleeping friend some light and graceful hanging shelves with golden edges and crimson silk cords with gold tassels sustain two or three hundred magnificently bound books beyond these things there is no furniture if we except an argand lamp with a plain crimsontinted ground glass shade which depends from he lofty vaulted ceiling by a single slender gold chain and throws a tranquil but magical radiance over all     a tale of jerusalem       intensos rigidarn in frontern ascendere canos       passus erat         lucande catone      a bristly bore  let us hurry to the walls said abelphittim to buzibenlevi and simeon the pharisee on the tenth day of the month thammuz in the year of the world three thousand nine hundred and fortyonelet us hasten to the ramparts adjoining the gate of benjamin which is in the city of david and overlooking the camp of the uncircumcised for it is the last hour of the fourth watch being sunrise and the idolaters in fulfilment of the promise of pompey should be awaiting us with the lambs for the sacrifices  simeon abelphittim and duzibenlevi were the gizbarim or subcollectors of the offering in the holy city of jerusalem  verily replied the pharisee let us hasten for this generosity in the heathen is unwonted and ficklemindedness has ever been an attribute of the worshippers of baal  that they are fickleminded and treacherous is as true as the pentateuch said buzibenlevi but that is only toward the people of adonai when was it ever known that the ammonites proved wanting to their own interests methinks it is no great stretch of generosity to allow us lambs for the altar of the lord receiving in lieu thereof thirty silver shekels per head  thou forgettest however benlevi replied abelphittim that the roman pompey who is now impiously besieging the city of the most high has no assurity that we apply not the lambs thus purchased for the altar to the sustenance of the body rather than of the spirit  now by the five corners of my beard shouted the pharisee who belonged to the sect called the dashers that little knot of saints whose manner of dashing and lacerating the feet against the pavement was long a thorn and a reproach to less zealous devoteesa stumblingblock to less gifted perambulatorsby the five corners of that beard which as a priest i am forbidden to shavehave we lived to see the day when a blaspheming and idolatrous upstart of rome shall accuse us of appropriating to the appetites of the flesh the most holy and consecrated elements have we lived to see the day when  let us not question the motives of the philistine interrupted abelphittim for today we profit for the first time by his avarice or by his generosity but rather let us hurry to the ramparts lest offerings should be wanting for that altar whose fire the rains of heaven can not extinguish and whose pillars of smoke no tempest can turn aside  that part of the city to which our worthy gizbarim now hastened and which bore the name of its architect king david was esteemed the most strongly fortified district of jerusalem being situated upon the steep and lofty hill of zion here a broad deep circumvallatory trench hewn from the solid rock was defended by a wall of great strength erected upon its inner edge this wall was adorned at regular interspaces by square towers of white marble the lowest sixty and the highest one hundred and twenty cubits in height but in the vicinity of the gate of benjamin the wall arose by no means from the margin of the fosse on the contrary between the level of the ditch and the basement of the rampart sprang up a perpendicular cliff of two hundred and fifty cubits forming part of the precipitous mount moriah so that when simeon and his associates arrived on the summit of the tower called adonibezekthe loftiest of all the turrets around about jerusalem and the usual place of conference with the besieging armythey looked down upon the camp of the enemy from an eminence excelling by many feet that of the pyramid of cheops and by several that of the temple of belus  verily sighed the pharisee as he peered dizzily over the precipice the uncircumcised are as the sands by the seashoreas the locusts in the wilderness the valley of the king hath become the valley of adommin  and yet added benlevi thou canst not point me out a philistineno not onefrom aleph to taufrom the wilderness to the battlementswho seemeth any bigger than the letter jod  lower away the basket with the shekels of silver here shouted a roman soldier in a hoarse rough voice which appeared to issue from the regions of plutolower away the basket with the accursed coin which it has broken the jaw of a noble roman to pronounce is it thus you evince your gratitude to our master pompeius who in his condescension has thought fit to listen to your idolatrous importunities the god phoebus who is a true god has been charioted for an hourand were you not to be on the ramparts by sunrise aedepol do you think that we the conquerors of the world have nothing better to do than stand waiting by the walls of every kennel to traffic with the dogs of the earth lower away i sayand see that your trumpery be bright in color and just in weight  el elohim ejaculated the pharisee as the discordant tones of the centurion rattled up the crags of the precipice and fainted away against the templeel elohimwho is the god phoebuswhom doth the blasphemer invoke thou buzibenlevi who art read in the laws of the gentiles and hast sojourned among them who dabble

neitherbut beware how thou lettest the rope slip too rapidly through thy fingers for should the wickerwork chance to hang on the projection of yonder crag there will be a woful outpouring of the holy things of the sanctuary  by the assistance of some rudely constructed machinery the heavily laden basket was now carefully lowered down among the multitude and from the giddy pinnacle the romans were seen gathering confusedly round it but owing to the vast height and the prevalence of a fog no distinct view of their operations could be obtained  half an hour had already elapsed  we shall be too late sighed the pharisee as at the expiration of this period he looked over into the abysswe shall be too late we shall be turned out of office by the katholim   no more responded abelphittimno more shall we feast upon the fat of the landno longer shall our beards be odorous with frankincenseour loins girded up with fine linen from the temple  racal swore benlevi racal do they mean to defraud us of the purchase money or holy moses are they weighing the shekels of the tabernacle  they have given the signal at last cried the phariseethey have given the signal at last pull away abelphittimand thou buzibenlevi pull awayfor verily the philistines have either still hold upon the basket or the lord hath softened their hearts to place therein a beast of good weight and the gizbarim pulled away while their burden swung heavily upward through the still increasing mist  booshoh heas at the conclusion of an hour some object at the extremity of the rope became indistinctly visiblebooshoh he was the exclamation which burst from the lips of benlevi    booshoh hefor shameit is a ram from the thickets of engedi and as rugged as the valley of jehosaphat  it is a firstling of the flock said abelphittim i know him by the bleating of his lips and the innocent folding of his limbs his eyes are more beautiful than the jewels of the pectoral and his flesh is like the honey of hebron  it is a fatted calf from the pastures of bashan said the pharisee the heathen have dealt wonderfully with uslet us raise up our voices in a psalmlet us give thanks on the shawm and on the psalteryon the harp and on the huggabon the cythern and on the sackbut  it was not until the basket had arrived within a few feet of the gizbarim that a low grunt betrayed to their perception a hog of no common size  now el emanu slowly and with upturned eyes ejaculated the trio as letting go their hold the emancipated porker tumbled headlong among the philistines el emanugod be with usit is the unutterable flesh     the sphinx  during the dread reign of the cholera in new york i had accepted the invitation of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement of his cottage ornee on the banks of the hudson we had here around us all the ordinary means of summer amusement and what with rambling in the woods sketching boating fishing bathing music and books we should have passed the time pleasantly enough but for the fearful intelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city not a day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some acquaintance then as the fatality increased we learned to expect daily the loss of some friend at length we trembled at the approach of every messenger the very air from the south seemed to us redolent with death that palsying thought indeed took entire possession of my soul i could neither speak think nor dream of any thing else my host was of a less excitable temperament and although greatly depressed in spirits exerted himself to sustain my own his richly philosophical intellect was not at any time affected by unrealities to the substances of terror he was sufficiently alive but of its shadows he had no apprehension  his endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into which i had fallen were frustrated in great measure by certain volumes which i had found in his library these were of a character to force into germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition lay latent in my bosom i had been reading these books without his knowledge and thus he was often at a loss to account for the forcible impressions which had been made upon my fancy  a favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omensa belief which at this one epoch of my life i was almost seriously disposed to defend on this subject we had long and animated discussionshe maintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such mattersi contending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute spontaneity that is to say without apparent traces of suggestionhad in itself the unmistakable elements of truth and was entitled to as much respect as that intuition which is the idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius  the fact is that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had occurred to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable and which had in it so much of the portentous character that i might well have been excused for regarding it as an omen it appalled and at the same time so confounded and bewildered me that many days elapsed before i could make up my mind to communicate the circumstances to my friend  near the close of exceedingly warm day i was sitting book in hand at an open window commanding through a long vista of the river banks a view of a distant hill the face of which nearest my position had been denuded by what is termed a landslide of the principal portion of its trees my thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to the gloom and desolation of the neighboring city uplifting my eyes from the page they fell upon the naked face of the bill and upon an objectupon some living monster of hideous conformation which very rapidly made its way from the summit to the bottom disappearing finally in the dense forest below as this creature first came in sight i doubted my own sanityor at least the evidence of my own eyes and many minutes passed before i succeeded in convincing myself that i was neither mad nor in a dream yet when i described the monster which i distinctly saw and calmly surveyed through the whole period of its progress my readers i fear will feel more difficulty in being convinced of these points than even i did myself  estimating the size of the creature by comparison with the diameter of the large trees near which it passedthe few giants of the forest which had escaped the fury of the landslidei concluded it to be far larger than any ship of the line in existence i say ship of the line because the shape of the monster suggested the ideathe hull of one of our seventyfour might convey a very tolerable conception of the general outline the mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of a proboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length and about as thick as the body of an ordinary elephant near the root of this trunk was an immense quantity of black shaggy hairmore than could have been supplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes and projecting from this hair downwardly and laterally sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike those of the wild boar but of infinitely greater dimensions extending forward parallel with the proboscis and on each side of it was a gigantic staff thirty or forty feet in length formed seemingly of pure crystal and in shape a perfect prismit reflected in the most gorgeous manner the rays of the declining sun the trunk was fashioned like a wedge with the apex to the earth from it there were outspread two pairs of wingseach wing nearly one hundred yards in lengthone pair being placed above the other and all thickly covered with metal scales each scale apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter i observed that the upper and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain but the chief peculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a deaths head which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast and which was as accurately traced in glaring white upon the dark ground of the body as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist while i regarded the terrific animal and more especially the appearance on its breast with a feeling or horror and awewith a sentiment of forthcoming evil which i found it impossible to quell by any effort of the reason i perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis suddenly expand themselves and from them there proceeded a sound so loud and so expressive of wo that it struck upon my nerves like a knell and as the monster disappeared at the foot of the hill i fell at once fainting to the floor  upon recovering my first impulse of course was to inform my friend of what i had seen and heardand i can scarcely explain what feeling of repugnance it was which in the end operated to prevent me  at length one evening some three or four days after the occurrence we were sitting together in the room in which i had seen the apparitioni occupying the same seat at the same window and he lounging on a sofa near at hand the association of the place and time impelled me to give him an account of the phenomenon he heard me to the endat first laughed heartilyand then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor as if my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion at this instant i again had a distinct view of the monsterto which with a shout of absolute terror i now directed his attention he looked eagerlybut maintained that he saw nothingalthough i designated minutely the course of the creature as it made its way down the naked face of the hill  i was now immeasurably alarmed for i considered the vision either as an omen of my death or worse as the forerunner of an attack of mania i threw myself passionately back in my chair and for some moments buried my face in my hands when i uncovered my eyes the apparition was no longer apparent  my host however had in some degree resumed the calmness of his demeanor and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the conformation of the visionary creature when i had fully satisfied him on this head he sighed deeply as if relieved of some intolerable burden and went on to talk with what i thought a cruel calmness of various points of speculative philosophy which had heretofore formed subject of discussion between us i remember his insisting very especially among other things upon the idea that the principle source of error in all human investigations lay in the liability of the understanding to underrate or to overvalue the importance of an object through mere misadmeasurement of its propinquity to estimate properly for example he said the influence to be exercised on mankind at large by the thorough diffusion of democracy the distance of the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly be accomplished should not fail to form an item in the estimate yet can you tell me one writer on the subject of government who has ever thought this particular branch of the subject worthy of discussion at all  he here paused for a moment stepped to a bookcase and brought forth one of the ordinary synopses of natural history requesting me then to exchange seats with him that he might the better distinguish the fine print of the volume he took my armchair at the window and opening the book resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before  but for your exceeding minuteness he said in describing the monster i might never have had it in my power to demonstrate to you what it was in the first place let me read to you a schoolboy account of the genus sphinx of the family crepuscularia of the order lepidoptera of the class of insectaor insects the account runs thus  four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of metallic appearance mouth forming a rolled proboscis produced by an elongation of the jaws upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of mandibles and downy palpi the inferior wings retained to the superior by a stiff hair antennae in the form of an elongated club prismatic abdomen pointed the deathsheaded sphinx has occasioned much terror among the vulgar at times by the melancholy kind of cry which it utters and the insignia of death which it wears upon its corslet  he here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair placing himself accurately in the position which i had occupied at the moment of beholding the monster  ah here it is he presently exclaimedit is reascending the face of the hill and a very remarkable looking creature i admit it to be still it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined itfor the fact is that as it wriggles its way up this thread which some spider has wrought along the windowsash i find it to be about the sixteenth of an inch in its extreme length and also about the sixteenth of an inch distant from the pupil of my eye     hopfrog  i never knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king was he seemed to live only for joking to tell a good story of the joke kind and to tell it well was the surest road to his favor thus it happened that his seven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers they all took after the king too in being large corpulent oily men as well as inimitable jokers whether people grow fat by joking or whether there is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke i have never been quite able to determine but certain it is that a lean joker is a rara avis in terris  about the refinements or as he called them the ghost of wit the king troubled himself very little he had an especial admiration for breadth in a jest and would often put up with length for the sake of it overniceties wearied him he would have preferred rabelais gargantua to the zadig of voltaire and upon the whole practical jokes suited his taste far better than verbal ones  at the date of my narrative professing jesters had not altogether gone out of fashion at court several of the great continental powers still retain their fools who wore motley with caps and bells and who were expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms at a moments notice in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table  our king as a matter of course retained his fool the fact is he required something in the way of follyif only to counterbalance the heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministersnot to mention himself  his fool or professional jester was not only a fool however his value was trebled in the eyes of the king by the fact of his being also a dwarf and a cripple dwarfs were as common at court in those days as fools and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through their days days are rather longer at court than elsewhere without both a jester to laugh with and a dwarf to laugh at but as i have already observed your jesters in ninetynine cases out of a hundred are fat round and unwieldyso that it was no small source of selfgratulation with our king that in hopfrog this was the fools name he possessed a triplicate treasure in one person  i believe the name hopfrog was not that given to the dwarf by his sponsors at baptism but it was conferred upon him by general consent of the several ministers on account of his inability to walk as other men do in fact hopfrog could only get along by a sort of interjectional gaitsomething between a leap and a wrigglea movement that afforded illimitable amusement and of course consolation to the king for notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional swelling of the head the king by his whole court was accounted a capital figure  but although hopfrog through the distortion of his legs could move only with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor the prodigious muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his arms by way of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs enabled him to perform many feats of wonderful dexterity where trees or ropes were in question or any thing else to climb at such exercises he certainly much more resembled a squirrel or a small monkey than a frog  i am not able to say with precision from what country hopfrog originally came it was from some barbarous region however that no person ever heard ofa vast distance from the court of our king hopfrog and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself although of exquisite proportions and a marvellous dancer had been forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces and sent as presents to the king by one of his evervictorious generals  under these circumstances it is not to be wondered at that a close intimacy arose between the two little captives indeed they soon became sworn friends hopfrog who although he made a great deal of sport was by no means popular had it not in his power to render trippetta many services but she on account of her grace and exquisite beauty although a dwarf was universally admired and petted so she possessed much influence and never failed to use it whenever she could for the benefit of hopfrog  on some grand state occasioni forgot whatthe king determined to have a masquerade and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind occurred at our court then the talents both of hopfrog and trippetta were sure to be called into play hopfrog in especial was so inventive in the way of getting up pageants suggesting novel characters and arranging costumes for masked balls that nothing could be done it seems without his assistance  the night appointed for the fete had arrived a gorgeous hall had been fitted up under trippettas eye with every kind of device which could possibly give eclat to a masquerade the whole court was in a fever of expectation as for costumes and characters it might well be supposed that everybody had come to a decision on such points many had made up their minds as to what roles they should assume a week or even a month in advance and in fact there was not a particle of indecision anywhereexcept in the case of the king and his seven minsters why they hesitated i never could tell unless they did it by way of a joke more probably they found it difficult on account of being so fat to make up their minds at all events time flew and as a last resort they sent for trippetta and hopfrog  when the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king they found him sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council but the monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor he knew that hopfrog was not fond of wine for it excited the poor cripple almost to madness and madness is no comfortable feeling but the king loved his practical jokes and took pleasure in forcing hopfrog to drink and as the king called it to be merry  come here hopfrog said he as the jester and his friend entered the room swallow this bumper to the health of your absent friends here hopfrog sighed and then let us have the benefit of your invention we want characterscharacters mansomething novelout of the way we are wearied with this everlasting sameness come drink the wine will brighten your wits  hopfrog endeavored as usual to get up a jest in reply to these advances from the king but the effort was too much it happened to be the poor dwarfs birthday and the command to drink to his absent friends forced the tears to his eyes many large bitter drops fell into the goblet as he took it humbly from the hand of the tyrant  ah ha ha roared the latter as the dwarf reluctantly drained the beakersee what a glass of good wine can do why your eyes are shining already  poor fellow his large eyes gleamed rather than shone for the effect of wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous he placed the goblet nervously on the table and looked round upon the company with a halfinsane stare they all seemed highly amused at the success of the kings joke  and now to business said the prime minister a very fat man  yes said the king come lend us your assistance characters my fine fellow we stand in need of charactersall of usha ha ha and as this was seriously meant for a joke his laugh was chorused by the seven  hopfrog also laughed although feebly and somewhat vacantly  come come said the king impatiently have you nothing to suggest  i am endeavoring to think of something novel replied the dwarf abstractedly for he was quite bewildered by the wine  endeavoring cried the tyrant fiercely what do you mean by that ah i perceive you are sulky and want more wine here drink this and he poured out another goblet full and offered it to the cripple who merely gazed at it gasping for breath  drink i say shouted the monster or by the fiends  the dwarf hesitated the king grew purple with rage the courtiers smirked trippetta pale as a corpse advanced to the monarchs seat and falling on her knees before him implored him to spare her friend  the tyrant regarded her for some moments in evident wonder at her audacity he seemed quite at a loss what to do or sayhow most becomingly to express his indignation at last without uttering a syllable he pushed her violently from him and threw the contents of the brimming goblet in her face  the poor girl got up the best she could and not daring even to sigh resumed her position at the foot of the table  there was a dead silence for about half a minute during which the falling of a leaf or of a feather might have been heard it was interrupted by a low but harsh and protracted grating sound which seemed to come at once from every corner of the room  whatwhatwhat are you making that noise for demanded the king turning furiously to the dwarf  the latter seemed to have recovered in great measure from his intoxication and looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrants face merely ejaculated  ii how could it have been me  the sound appeared to come from without observed one of the courtiers i fancy it was the parrot at the window whetting his bill upon his cagewires  true replied the monarch as if much relieved by the suggestion but on the honor of a knight i could have sworn that it was the gritting of this vagabonds teeth  hereupon the dwarf laughed the king was too confirmed a joker to object to any ones laughing and displayed a set of large powerful and very repulsive teeth moreover he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as much wine as desired the monarch was pacified and having drained another bumper with no very perceptible ill effect hopfrog entered at once and with spirit into the plans for the masquerade  i cannot tell what was the association of idea observed he very tranquilly and as if he had never tasted wine in his life but just after your majesty had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her facejust after your majesty had done this and while the parrot was making that odd noise outside the window there came into my mind a capital diversionone of my own country frolicsoften enacted among us at our masquerades but here it will be new altogether unfortunately however it requires a company of eight persons and  here we are cried the king laughing at his acute discovery of the coincidence eight to a fractioni and my seven ministers come what is the diversion  we call it replied the cripple the eight chained ourangoutangs and it really is excellent sport if well enacted  we will enact it remarked the king drawing himself up and lowering his eyelids  the beauty of the game continued hopfrog lies in the fright it occasions among the women  capital roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry  i will equip you as ourangoutangs proceeded the dwarf leave all that to me the resemblance shall be so striking that the company of masqueraders will take you for real beastsand of course they will be as much terrified as astonished  oh this is exquisite exclaimed the king hopfrog i will make a man of you  the chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their jangling you are supposed to have escaped en masse from your keepers your majesty cannot conceive the effect produced at a masquerade by eight chained ourangoutangs imagined to be real ones by most of the company and rushing in with savage cries among the crowd of delicately and gorgeously habited men and women the contrast is inimitable  it must be said the king and the council arose hurriedly as it was growing late to put in execution the scheme of hopfrog  his mode of equipping the party as ourangoutangs was very simple but effective enough for his purposes the animals in question had at the epoch of my story very rarely been seen in any part of the civilized world and as the imitations made by the dwarf were sufficiently beastlike and more than sufficiently hideous their truthfulness to nature was thus thought to be secured  the king and his ministers were first encased in tightfitting stockinet shirts and drawers they were then saturated with tar at this stage of the process some one of the party suggested feathers but the suggestion was at once overruled by the dwarf who soon convinced the eight by ocular demonstration that the hair of such a brute as the ourangoutang was much more efficiently represented by flu a thick coating of the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar a long chain was now procured first it was passed about the waist of the king and tied then about another of the party and also tied then about all successively in the same manner when this chaining arrangement was complete and the party stood as far apart from each other as possible they formed a circle and to make all things appear natural hopfrog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters at right angles across the circle after the fashion adopted at the present day by those who capture chimpanzees or other large apes in borneo  the grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place was a circular room very lofty and receiving the light of the sun only through a single window at top at night the season for which the apartment was especially designed it was illuminated principally by a large chandelier depending by a chain from the centre of the skylight and lowered or elevated by means of a counterbalance as usual but in order not to look unsightly this latter passed outside the cupola and over the roof  the arrangements of the room had been left to trippettas superintendence but in some particulars it seems she had been guided by the calmer judgment of her friend the dwarf at his suggestion it was that on this occasion the chandelier was removed its waxen drippings which in weather so warm it was quite impossible to prevent would have been seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the guests who on account of the crowded state of the saloon could not all be expected to keep from out its centre that is to say from under the chandelier additional sconces were set in various parts of the hall out of the war and a flambeau emitting sweet odor was placed in the right hand of each of the caryaides caryatides that stood against the wallsome fifty or sixty altogether  the eight ourangoutangs taking hopfrogs advice waited patiently until midnight when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders before making their appearance no sooner had the clock ceased striking however than they rushed or rather rolled in all togetherfor the impediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall and all to stumble as they entered  the excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious and filled the heart of the king with glee as had been anticipated there were not a few of the guests who supposed the ferociouslooking creatures to be beasts of some kind in reality if not precisely ourangoutangs many of the women swooned with affright and had not the king taken the precaution to exclude all weapons from the saloon his party might soon have expiated their frolic in their blood as it was a general rush was made for the doors but the king had ordered them to be locked immediately upon his entrance and at the dwarfs suggestion the keys had been deposited with him  while the tumult was at its height and each masquerader attentive only to his own safety for in fact there was much real danger from the pressure of the excited crowd the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung and which had been drawn up on its removal might have been seen very gradually to descend until its hooked extremity came within three feet of the floor  soon after this the king and his seven friends having reeled about the hall in all directions found themselves at length in its centre and of course in immediate contact with the chain while they were thus situated the dwarf who had followed noiselessly at their heels inciting them to keep up the commotion took hold of their own chain at the intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle diametrically and at right angles here with the rapidity of thought he inserted the hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend and in an instant by some unseen agency the chandelierchain was drawn so far upward as to take the hook out of reach and as an inevitable consequence to drag the ourangoutangs together in close connection and face to face  the masqueraders by this time had recovered in some measure from their alarm and beginning to regard the whole matter as a wellcontrived pleasantry set up a loud shout of laughter at the predicament of the apes  leave them to me now screamed hopfrog his shrill voice making itself easily heard through all the din leave them to me i fancy i know them if i can only get a good look at them i can soon tell who they are  here scrambling over the heads of the crowd he managed to get to the wall when seizing a flambeau from one of the caryatides he returned as he went to the centre of the roomleaping with the agility of a monkey upon the kings head and thence clambered a few feet up the chain holding down the torch to examine the group of ourangoutangs and still screaming i shall soon find out who they are  and now while the whole assembly the apes included were convulsed with laughter the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle when the chain flew violently up for about thirty feetdragging with it the dismayed and struggling ourangoutangs and leaving them suspended in midair between the skylight and the floor hopfrog clinging to the chain as it rose still maintained his relative position in respect to the eight maskers and still as if nothing were the matter continued to thrust his torch down toward them as though endeavoring to discover who they were  so thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent that a dead silence of about a minutes duration ensued it was broken by just such a low harsh grating sound as had before attracted the attention of the king and his councillors when the former threw the wine in the face of trippetta but on the present occasion there could be no question as to whence the sound issued it came from the fanglike teeth of the dwarf who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at the mouth and glared with an expression of maniacal rage into the upturned countenances of the king and his seven companions  ah ha said at length the infuriated jester ah ha i begin to see who these people are now here pretending to scrutinize the king more closely he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which enveloped him and which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame in less than half a minute the whole eight ourangoutangs were blazing fiercely amid the shrieks of the multitude who gazed at them from below horrorstricken and without the power to render them the slightest assistance  at length the flames suddenly increasing in virulence forced the jester to climb higher up the chain to be out of their reach and as he made this movement the crowd again sank for a brief instant into silence the dwarf seized his opportunity and once more spoke  i now see distinctly he said what manner of people these maskers are they are a great king and his seven privycouncillorsa king who does not scruple to strike a defenceless girl and his seven councillors who abet him in the outrage as for myself i am simply hopfrog the jesterand this is my last jest  owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which it adhered the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech before the work of vengeance was complete the eight corpses swung in their chains a fetid blackened hideous and indistinguishable mass the cripple hurled his torch at them clambered leisurely to the ceiling and disappeared through the skylight  it is supposed that trippetta stationed on the roof of the saloon had been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge and that together they effected their escape to their own country for neither was seen again     the man of the crowd       ce grand malheur de ne pouvoir être seul                la bruyère  it was well said of a certain german book that er lasst sich nicht lesenit does not permit itself to be read there are some secrets which do not permit themselves to be told men die nightly in their beds wringing the hands of ghostly confessors and looking them piteously in the eyesdie with despair of heart and convulsion of throat on account of the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer themselves to be revealed now and then alas the conscience of man takes up a burthen so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only into the grave and thus the essence of all crime is undivulged  not long ago about the closing in of an evening in autumn i sat at the large bow window of the d coffeehouse in london for some months i had been ill in health but was now convalescent and with returning strength found myself in one of those happy moods which are so precisely the converse of ennuimoods of the keenest appetency when the film from the mental vision departsthe greek phraseand the intellect electrified surpasses as greatly its everyday condition as does the vivid yet candid reason of leibnitz the mad and flimsy rhetoric of gorgias merely to breathe was enjoyment and i derived positive pleasure even from many of the legitimate sources of pain i felt a calm but inquisitive interest in every thing with a cigar in my mouth and a newspaper in my lap i had been amusing myself for the greater part of the afternoon now in poring over advertisements now in observing the promiscuous company in the room and now in peering through the smoky panes into the street  this latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city and had been very much crowded during the whole day but as the darkness came on the throng momently increased and by the time the lamps were well lighted two dense and continuous tides of population were rushing past the door at this particular period of the evening i had never before been in a similar situation and the tumultuous sea of human heads filled me therefore with a delicious novelty of emotion i gave up at length all care of things within the hotel and became absorbed in contemplation of the scene without  at first my observations took an abstract and generalizing turn i looked at the passengers in masses and thought of them in their aggregate relations soon however i descended to details and regarded with minute interest the innumerable varieties of figure dress air gait visage and expression of countenance  by far the greater number of those who went by had a satisfied businesslike demeanor and seemed to be thinking only of making their way through the press their brows were knit and their eyes rolled quickly when pushed against by fellowwayfarers they evinced no symptom of impatience but adjusted their clothes and hurried on others still a numerous class were restless in their movements had flushed faces and talked and gesticulated to themselves as if feeling in solitude on account of the very denseness of the company around when impeded in their progress these people suddenly ceased muttering but redoubled their gesticulations and awaited with an absent and overdone smile upon the lips the course of the persons impeding them if jostled they bowed profusely to the jostlers and appeared overwhelmed with confusionthere was nothing very distinctive about these two large classes beyond what i have noted their habiliments belonged to that order which is pointedly termed the decent they were undoubtedly noblemen merchants attorneys tradesmen stockjobbersthe eupatrids and the commonplaces of societymen of leisure and men actively engaged in affairs of their ownconducting business upon their own responsibility they did not greatly excite my attention  the tribe of clerks was an obvious one and here i discerned two remarkable divisions there were the junior clerks of flash housesyoung gentlemen with tight coats bright boots welloiled hair and supercilious lips setting aside a certain dapperness of carriage which may be termed deskism for want of a better word the manner of these persons seemed to me an exact facsimile of what had been the perfection of bon ton about twelve or eighteen months before they wore the castoff graces of the gentryand this i believe involves the best definition of the class  the division of the upper clerks of staunch firms or of the steady old fellows it was not possible to mistake these were known by their coats and pantaloons of black or brown made to sit comfortably with white cravats and waistcoats broad solidlooking shoes and thick hose or gaitersthey had all slightly bald heads from which the right ears long used to penholding had an odd habit of standing off on end i observed that they always removed or settled their hats with both hands and wore watches with short gold chains of a substantial and ancient pattern theirs was the affectation of respectabilityif indeed there be an affectation so honorable  there were many individuals of dashing appearance whom i easily understood as belonging to the race of swell pickpockets with which all great cities are infested i watched these gentry with much inquisitiveness and found it difficult to imagine how they should ever be mistaken for gentlemen by gentlemen themselves their voluminousness of wristband with an air of excessive frankness should betray them at once  the gamblers of whom i descried not a few were still more easily recognisable they wore every variety of dress from that of the desperate thimblerig bully with velvet waistcoat fancy neckerchief gilt chains and filagreed buttons to that of the scrupulously inornate clergyman than which nothing could be less liable to suspicion still all were distinguished by a certain sodden swarthiness of complexion a filmy dimness of eye and pallor and compression of lip there were two other traits moreover by which i could always detect thema guarded lowness of tone in conversation and a more than ordinary extension of the thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingersvery often in company with these sharpers i observed an order of men somewhat different in habits but still birds of a kindred feather they may be defined as the gentlemen who live by their wits they seem to prey upon the public in two battalionsthat of the dandies and that of the military men of the first grade the leading features are long locks and smiles of the second frogged coats and frowns  descending in the scale of what is termed gentility i found darker and deeper themes for speculation i saw jew pedlars with hawk eyes flashing from countenances whose every other feature wore only an expression of abject humility sturdy professional street beggars scowling upon mendicants of a better stamp whom despair alone had driven forth into the night for charity feeble and ghastly invalids upon whom death had placed a sure hand and who sidled and tottered through the mob looking every one beseechingly in the face as if in search of some chance consolation some lost hope modest young girls returning from long and late labor to a cheerless home and shrinking more tearfully than indignantly from the glances of ruffians whose direct contact even could not be avoided women of the town of all kinds and of all agesthe unequivocal beauty in the prime of her womanhood putting one in mind of the statue in lucian with the surface of parian marble and the interior filled with filththe loathsome and utterly lost leper in ragsthe wrinkled bejewelled and paintbegrimed beldame making a last effort at youththe mere child of immature form yet from long association an adept in the dreadful coquetries of her trade and burning with a rabid ambition to be ranked the equal of her elders in vice drunkards innumerable and indescribablesome in shreds and patches reeling inarticulate with bruised visage and lacklustre eyessome in whole although filthy garments with a slightly unsteady swagger thick sensual lips and heartylooking rubicund facesothers clothed in materials which had once been good and which even now were scrupulously well brushedmen who walked with a more than naturally firm and springy step but whose countenances were fearfully pale whose eyes hideously wild and red and who clutched with quivering fingers as they strode through the crowd at every object which came within their reach beside these piemen porters coalheavers sweeps organgrinders monkeyexhibiters and ballad mongers those who vended with those who sang ragged artizans and exhausted laborers of every description and all full of a noisy and inordinate vivacity which jarred discordantly upon the ear and gave an aching sensation to the eye  as the night deepened so deepened to me the interest of the scene for not only did the general character of the crowd materially alter its gentler features retiring in the gradual withdrawal of the more orderly portion of the people and its harsher ones coming out into bolder relief as the late hour brought forth every species of infamy from its den but the rays of the gaslamps feeble at first in their struggle with the dying day had now at length gained ascendancy and threw over every thing a fitful and garish lustre all was dark yet splendidas that ebony to which has been likened the style of tertullian  the wild effects of the light enchained me to an examination of individual faces and although the rapidity with which the world of light flitted before the window prevented me from casting more than a glance upon each visage still it seemed that in my then peculiar mental state i could frequently read even in that brief interval of a glance the history of long years  with my brow to the glass i was thus occupied in scrutinizing the mob when suddenly there came into view a countenance that of a decrepid old man some sixtyfive or seventy years of agea countenance which at once arrested and absorbed my whole attention on account of the absolute idiosyncrasy of its expression any thing even remotely resembling that expression i had never seen before i well remember that my first thought upon beholding it was that retzch had he viewed it would have greatly preferred it to his own pictural incarnations of the fiend as i endeavored during the brief minute of my original survey to form some analysis of the meaning conveyed there arose confusedly and paradoxically within my mind the ideas of vast mental power of caution of penuriousness of avarice of coolness of malice of blood thirstiness of triumph of merriment of excessive terror of intenseof supreme despair i felt singularly aroused startled fascinated how wild a history i said to myself is written within that bosom then came a craving desire to keep the man in viewto know more of him hurriedly putting on an overcoat and seizing my hat and cane i made my way into the street and pushed through the crowd in the direction which i had seen him take for he had already disappeared with some little difficulty i at length came within sight of him approached and followed him closely yet cautiously so as not to attract his attention  i had now a good opportunity of examining his person he was short in stature very thin and apparently very feeble his clothes generally were filthy and ragged but as he came now and then within the strong glare of a lamp i perceived that his linen although dirty was of beautiful texture and my vision deceived me or through a rent in a closelybuttoned and evidently secondhanded roquelaire which enveloped him i caught a glimpse both of a diamond and of a dagger these observations heightened my curiosity and i resolved to follow the stranger whithersoever he should go  it was now fully nightfall and a thick humid fog hung over the city soon ending in a settled and heavy rain this change of weather had an odd effect upon the crowd the whole of which was at once put into new commotion and overshadowed by a world of umbrellas the waver the jostle and the hum increased in a tenfold degree for my own part i did not much regard the rainthe lurking of an old fever in my system rendering the moisture somewhat too dangerously pleasant tying a handkerchief about my mouth i kept on for half an hour the old man held his way with difficulty along the great thoroughfare and i here walked close at his elbow through fear of losing sight of him never once turning his head to look back he did not observe me by and bye he passed into a cross street which although densely filled with people was not quite so much thronged as the main one he had quitted here a change in his demeanor became evident he walked more slowly and with less object than beforemore hesitatingly he crossed and recrossed the way repeatedly without apparent aim and the press was still so thick that at every such movement i was obliged to follow him closely the street was a narrow and long one and his course lay within it for nearly an hour during which the passengers had gradually diminished to about that number which is ordinarily seen at noon in broadway near the parkso vast a difference is there between a london populace and that of the most frequented american city a second turn brought us into a square brilliantly lighted and overflowing with life the old manner of the stranger reappeared his chin fell upon his breast while his eyes rolled wildly from under his knit brows in every direction upon those who hemmed him in he urged his way steadily and perseveringly i was surprised however to find upon his having made the circuit of the square that he turned and retraced his steps still more was i astonished to see him repeat the same walk several timesonce nearly detecting me as he came round with a sudden movement  in this exercise he spent another hour at the end of which we met with far less interruption from passengers than at first the rain fell fast the air grew cool and the people were retiring to their homes with a gesture of impatience the wanderer passed into a byestreet comparatively deserted down this some quarter of a mile long he rushed with an activity i could not have dreamed of seeing in one so aged and which put me to much trouble in pursuit a few minutes brought us to a large and busy bazaar with the localities of which the stranger appeared well acquainted and where his original demeanor again became apparent as he forced his way to and fro without aim among the host of buyers and sellers  during the hour and a half or thereabouts which we passed in this place it required much caution on my part to keep him within reach without attracting his observation luckily i wore a pair of caoutchouc overshoes and could move about in perfect silence at no moment did he see that i watched him he entered shop after shop priced nothing spoke no word and looked at all objects with a wild and vacant stare i was now utterly amazed at his behavior and firmly resolved that we should not part until i had satisfied myself in some measure respecting him  a loudtoned clock struck eleven and the company were fast deserting the bazaar a shopkeeper in putting up a shutter jostled the old man and at the instant i saw a strong shudder come over his frame he hurried into the street looked anxiously around him for an instant and then ran with incredible swiftness through many crooked and peopleless lanes until we emerged once more upon the great thoroughfare whence we had startedthe street of the d hotel it no longer wore however the same aspect it was still brilliant with gas but the rain fell fiercely and there were few persons to be seen the stranger grew pale he walked moodily some paces up the once populous avenue then with a heavy sigh turned in the direction of the river and plunging through a great variety of devious ways came out at length in view of one of the principal theatres it was about being closed and the audience were thronging from the doors i saw the old man gasp as if for breath while he threw himself amid the crowd but i thought that the intense agony of his countenance had in some measure abated his head again fell upon his breast he appeared as i had seen him at first i observed that he now took the course in which had gone the greater number of the audiencebut upon the whole i was at a loss to comprehend the waywardness of his actions  as he proceeded the company grew more scattered and his old uneasiness and vacillation were resumed for some time he followed closely a party of some ten or twelve roisterers but from this number one by one dropped off until three only remained together in a narrow and gloomy lane little frequented the stranger paused and for a moment seemed lost in thought then with every mark of agitation pursued rapidly a route which brought us to the verge of the city amid regions very different from those we had hitherto traversed it was the most noisome quarter of london where every thing wore the worst impress of the most deplorable poverty and of the most desperate crime by the dim light of an accidental lamp tall antique wormeaten wooden tenements were seen tottering to their fall in directions so many and capricious that scarce the semblance of a passage was discernible between them the pavingstones lay at random displaced from their beds by the ranklygrowing grass horrible filth festered in the dammedup gutters the whole atmosphere teemed with desolation yet as we proceeded the sounds of human life revived by sure degrees and at length large bands of the most abandoned of a london populace were seen reeling to and fro the spirits of the old man again flickered up as a lamp which is near its death hour once more he strode onward with elastic tread suddenly a corner was turned a blaze of light burst upon our sight and we stood before one of the huge suburban temples of intemperanceone of the palaces of the fiend gin  it was now nearly daybreak but a number of wretched inebriates still pressed in and out of the flaunting entrance with a half shriek of joy the old man forced a passage within resumed at once his original bearing and stalked backward and forward without apparent object among the throng he had not been thus long occupied however before a rush to the doors gave token that the host was closing them for the night it was something even more intense than despair that i then observed upon the countenance of the singular being whom i had watched so pertinaciously yet he did not hesitate in his career but with a mad energy retraced his steps at once to the heart of the mighty london long and swiftly he fled while i followed him in the wildest amazement resolute not to abandon a scrutiny in which i now felt an interest allabsorbing the sun arose while we proceeded and when we had once again reached that most thronged mart of the populous town the street of the d hotel it presented an appearance of human bustle and activity scarcely inferior to what i had seen on the evening before and here long amid the momently increasing confusion did i persist in my pursuit of the stranger but as usual he walked to and fro and during the day did not pass from out the turmoil of that street and as the shades of the second evening came on i grew wearied unto death and stopping fully in front of the wanderer gazed at him steadfastly in the face he noticed me not but resumed his solemn walk while i ceasing to follow remained absorbed in contemplation this old man i said at length is the type and the genius of deep crime he refuses to be alone page 228 he is the man of the crowd it will be in vain to follow for i shall learn no more of him nor of his deeds the worst heart of the world is a grosser book than the hortulus animæ 1

wickedness in i was often present at tobys chastisements and even by the way in which he kicked i could perceive that he was getting worse and worse every day at last i saw through the tears in my eyes that there was no hope of the villain at all and one day when he had been cuffed until he grew so black in the face that one might have mistaken him for a little african and no effect had been produced beyond that of making him wriggle himself into a fit i could stand it no longer but went down upon my knees forthwith and uplifting my voice made prophecy of his ruin  the fact is that his precocity in vice was awful at five months of age he used to get into such passions that he was unable to articulate at six months i caught him gnawing a pack of cards at seven months he was in the constant habit of catching and kissing the female babies at eight months he peremptorily refused to put his signature to the temperance pledge thus he went on increasing in iniquity month after month until at the close of the first year he not only insisted upon wearing moustaches but had contracted a propensity for cursing and swearing and for backing his assertions by bets  through this latter most ungentlemanly practice the ruin which i had predicted to toby dammit overtook him at last the fashion had grown with his growth and strengthened with his strength so that when he came to be a man he could scarcely utter a sentence without interlarding it with a proposition to gamble not that he actually laid wagersno i will do my friend the justice to say that he would as soon have laid eggs with him the thing was a mere formulanothing more his expressions on this head had no meaning attached to them whatever they were simple if not altogether innocent expletivesimaginative phrases wherewith to round off a sentence when he said ill bet you so and so nobody ever thought of taking him up but still i could not help thinking it my duty to put him down the habit was an immoral one and so i told him it was a vulgar onethis i begged him to believe it was discountenanced by societyhere i said nothing but the truth it was forbidden by act of congresshere i had not the slightest intention of telling a lie i remonstratedbut to no purpose i demonstratedin vain i entreatedhe smiled i imploredhe laughed i preachedhe sneered i threatenedhe swore i kicked himhe called for the police i pulled his nosehe blew it and offered to bet the devil his head that i would not venture to try that experiment again  poverty was another vice which the peculiar physical deficiency of dammits mother had entailed upon her son he was detestably poor and this was the reason no doubt that his expletive expressions about betting seldom took a pecuniary turn i will not be bound to say that i ever heard him make use of such a figure of speech as ill bet you a dollar it was usually ill bet you what you please or ill bet you what you dare or ill bet you a trifle or else more significantly still ill bet the devil my head  this latter form seemed to please him bestperhaps because it involved the least risk for dammit had become excessively parsimonious had any one taken him up his head was small and thus his loss would have been small too but these are my own reflections and i am by no means sure that i am right in attributing them to him at all events the phrase in question grew daily in favor notwithstanding the gross impropriety of a man betting his brains like banknotesbut this was a point which my friends perversity of disposition would not permit him to comprehend in the end he abandoned all other forms of wager and gave himself up to ill bet the devil my head with a pertinacity and exclusiveness of devotion that displeased not less than it surprised me i am always displeased by circumstances for which i cannot account mysteries force a man to think and so injure his health the truth is there was something in the air with which mr dammit was wont to give utterance to his offensive expressionsomething in his manner of enunciationwhich at first interested and afterwards made me very uneasysomething which for want of a more definite term at present i must be permitted to call queer but which mr coleridge would have called mystical mr kant pantheistical mr carlyle twistical and mr emerson hyperquizzitistical i began not to like it at all mr dammits soul was in a perilous state i resolved to bring all my eloquence into play to save it i vowed to serve him as st patrick in the irish chronicle is said to have served the toadthat is to say awaken him to a sense of his situation i addressed myself to the task forthwith once more i betook myself to remonstrance again i collected my energies for a final attempt at expostulation  when i had made an end of my lecture mr dammit indulged himself in some very equivocal behavior for some moments he remained silent merely looking me inquisitively in the face but presently he threw his head to one side and elevated his eyebrows to a great extent then he spread out the palms of his hands and shrugged up his shoulders then he winked with the right eye then he repeated the operation with the left then he shut them both up very tight then he opened them both so very wide that i became seriously alarmed for the consequences then applying his thumb to his nose he thought proper to make an indescribable movement with the rest of his fingers finally setting his arms akimbo he condescended to reply  i can call to mind only the beads of his discourse he would be obliged to me if i would hold my tongue he wished none of my advice he despised all my insinuations he was old enough to take care of himself did i still think him baby dammit did i mean to say any thing against his character did i intend to insult him was i a fool was my maternal parent aware in a word of my absence from the domiciliary residence he would put this latter question to me as to a man of veracity and he would bind himself to abide by my reply once more he would demand explicitly if my mother knew that i was out my confusion he said betrayed me and he would be willing to bet the devil his head that she did not  mr dammit did not pause for my rejoinder turning upon his heel he left my presence with undignified precipitation it was well for him that he did so my feelings had been wounded even my anger had been aroused for once i would have taken him up upon his insulting wager i would have won for the archenemy mr dammits little headfor the fact is my mamma was very well aware of my merely temporary absence from home  but khoda shefa midêhedheaven gives reliefas the mussulmans say when you tread upon their toes it was in pursuance of my duty that i had been insulted and i bore the insult like a man it now seemed to me however that i had done all that could be required of me in the case of this miserable individual and i resolved to trouble him no longer with my counsel but to leave him to his conscience and himself but although i forebore to intrude with my advice i could not bring myself to give up his society altogether i even went so far as to humor some of his less reprehensible propensities and there were times when i found myself lauding his wicked jokes as epicures do mustard with tears in my eyesso profoundly did it grieve me to hear his evil talk  one fine day having strolled out together arm in arm our route led us in the direction of a river there was a bridge and we resolved to cross it it was roofed over by way of protection from the weather and the archway having but few windows was thus very uncomfortably dark as we entered the passage the contrast between the external glare and the interior gloom struck heavily upon my spirits not so upon those of the unhappy dammit who offered to bet the devil his head that i was hipped he seemed to be in an unusual good humor he was excessively livelyso much so that i entertained i know not what of uneasy suspicion it is not impossible that he was affected with the transcendentals i am not well enough versed however in the diagnosis of this disease to speak with decision upon the point and unhappily there were none of my friends of the dial present i suggest the idea nevertheless because of a certain species of austere merryandrewism which seemed to beset my poor friend and caused him to make quite a tomfool of himself nothing would serve him but wriggling and skipping about under and over every thing that came in his way now shouting out and now lisping out all manner of odd little and big words yet preserving the gravest face in the world all the time i really could not make up my mind whether to kick or to pity him at length having passed nearly across the bridge we approached the termination of the footway when our progress was impeded by a turnstile of some height through this i made my way quietly pushing it around as usual but this turn would not serve the turn of mr dammit he insisted upon leaping the stile and said he could cut a pigeonwing over it in the air now this conscientiously speaking i did not think he could do the best pigeonwinger over all kinds of style was my friend mr carlyle and as i knew he could not do it i would not believe that it could be done by toby dammit i therefore told him in so many words that he was a braggadocio and could not do what he said for this i had reason to be sorry afterwardfor he straightway offered to bet the devil his head that he could  i was about to reply notwithstanding my previous resolutions with some remonstrance against his impiety when i heard close at my elbow a slight cough which sounded very much like the ejaculation ahem i started and looked about me in surprise my glance at length fell into a nook of the framework of the bridge and upon the figure of a little lame old gentleman of venerable aspect nothing could be more reverend than his whole appearance for he not only had on a full suit of black but his shirt was perfectly clean and the collar turned very neatly down over a white cravat while his hair was parted in front like a girls his hands were clasped pensively together over his stomach and his two eyes were carefully rolled up into the top of his head  upon observing him more closely i perceived that he wore a black silk apron over his smallclothes and this was a thing which i thought very odd before i had time to make any remark however upon so singular a circumstance he interrupted me with a second ahem  to this observation i was not immediately prepared to reply the fact is remarks of this laconic nature are nearly unanswerable i have known a quarterly review nonplussed by the word fudge i am not ashamed to say therefore that i turned to mr dammit for assistance  dammit said i what are you about dont you hearthe gentleman says ahem i looked sternly at my friend while i thus addressed him for to say the truth i felt particularly puzzled and when a man is particularly puzzled he must knit his brows and look savage or else he is pretty sure to look like a fool  dammit observed ialthough this sounded very much like an oath than which nothing was further from my thoughtsdammit i suggestedthe gentleman says ahem  i do not attempt to defend my remark on the score of profundity i did not think it profound myself but i have noticed that the effect of our speeches is not always proportionate with their importance in our own eyes and if i had shot mr d through and through with a paixhan bomb or knocked him in the head with the poets and poetry of america he could hardly have been more discomfited than when i addressed him with those simple words dammit what are you aboutdont you hearthe gentleman says ahem  you dont say so gasped he at length after turning more colors than a pirate runs up one after the other when chased by a manofwar are you quite sure he said that well at all events i am in for it now and may as well put a bold face upon the matter here goes thenahem  at this the little old gentleman seemed pleasedgod only knows why he left his station at the nook of the bridge limped forward with a gracious air took dammit by the hand and shook it cordially looking all the while straight up in his face with an air of the most unadulterated benignity which it is possible for the mind of man to imagine  i am quite sure you will win it dammit said he with the frankest of all smiles but we are obliged to have a trial you know for the sake of mere form  ahem replied my friend taking off his coat with a deep sigh tying a pockethandkerchief around his waist and producing an unaccountable alteration in his countenance by twisting up his eyes and bringing down the corners of his mouthahem and ahem said he again after a pause and not another word more than ahem did i ever know him to say after that aha thought i without expressing myself aloudthis is quite a remarkable silence on the part of toby dammit and is no doubt a consequence of his verbosity upon a previous occasion one extreme induces another i wonder if he has forgotten the many unanswerable questions which he propounded to me so fluently on the day when i gave him my last lecture at all events he is cured of the transcendentals  ahem here replied toby just as if he had been reading my thoughts and looking like a very old sheep in a revery  the old gentleman now took him by the arm and led him more into the shade of the bridgea few paces back from the turnstile my good fellow said he i make it a point of conscience to allow you this much run wait here till i take my place by the stile so that i may see whether you go over it handsomely and transcendentally and dont omit any flourishes of the pigeonwing a mere form you know i will say one two three and away mind you start at the word away here he took his position by the stile paused a moment as if in profound reflection then looked up and i thought smiled very slightly then tightened the strings of his apron then took a long look at dammit and finally gave the word as agreed upon              onetwothreeandaway  punctually at the word away my poor friend set off in a strong gallop the stile was not very high like mr lordsnor yet very low like that of mr lords reviewers but upon the whole i made sure that he would clear it and then what if he did notah that was the questionwhat if he did not what right said i had the old gentleman to make any other gentleman jump the little old dotandcarryone who is he if he asks me to jump i wont do it thats flat and i dont care who the devil he is the bridge as i say was arched and covered in in a very ridiculous manner and there was a most uncomfortable echo about it at all timesan echo which i never before so particularly observed as when i uttered the four last words of my remark  but what i said or what i thought or what i heard occupied only an instant in less than five seconds from his starting my poor toby had taken the leap i saw him run nimbly and spring grandly from the floor of the bridge cutting the most awful flourishes with his legs as he went up i saw him high in the air pigeonwinging it to admiration just over the top of the stile and of course i thought it an unusually singular thing that he did not continue to go over but the whole leap was the affair of a moment and before i had a chance to make any profound reflections down came mr dammit on the flat of his back on the same side of the stile from which he had started at the same instant i saw the old gentleman limping off at the top of his speed having caught and wrapt up in his apron something that fell heavily into it from the darkness of the arch just over the turnstile at all this i was much astonished but i had no leisure to think for dammit lay particularly still and i concluded that his feelings had been hurt and that he stood in need of my assistance i hurried up to him and found that he had received what might be termed a serious injury the truth is he had been deprived of his head which after a close search i could not find anywhere so i determined to take him home and send for the homoeopathists in the meantime a thought struck me and i threw open an adjacent window of the bridge when the sad truth flashed upon me at once about five feet just above the top of the turnstile and crossing the arch of the footpath so as to constitute a brace there extended a flat iron bar lying with its breadth horizontally and forming one of a series that served to strengthen the structure throughout its extent with the edge of this brace it appeared evident that the neck of my unfortunate friend had come precisely in contact  he did not long survive his terrible loss the homoeopathists did not give him little enough physic and what little they did give him he hesitated to take so in the end he grew worse and at length died a lesson to all riotous livers i bedewed his grave with my tears worked a bar sinister on his family escutcheon and for the general expenses of his funeral sent in my very moderate bill to the transcendentalists the scoundrels refused to pay it so i had mr dammit dug up at once and sold him for dogs meat     thou art the man  i will now play the oedipus to the rattleborough enigma i will expound to youas i alone canthe secret of the enginery that effected the rattleborough miraclethe one the true the admitted the undisputed the indisputable miracle which put a definite end to infidelity among the rattleburghers and converted to the orthodoxy of the grandames all the carnalminded who had ventured to be sceptical before  this eventwhich i should be sorry to discuss in a tone of unsuitable levityoccurred in the summer of 18 mr barnabas shuttleworthyone of the wealthiest and most respectable citizens of the boroughhad been missing for several days under circumstances which gave rise to suspicion of foul play mr shuttleworthy had set out from rattleborough very early one saturday morning on horseback with the avowed intention of proceeding to the city of about fifteen miles distant and of returning the night of the same day two hours after his departure however his horse returned without him and without the saddlebags which had been strapped on his back at starting the animal was wounded too and covered with mud these circumstances naturally gave rise to much alarm among the friends of the missing man and when it was found on sunday morning that he had not yet made his appearance the whole borough arose en masse to go and look for his body  the foremost and most energetic in instituting this search was the bosom friend of mr shuttleworthya mr charles goodfellow or as he was universally called charley goodfellow or old charley goodfellow now whether it is a marvellous coincidence or whether it is that the name itself has an imperceptible effect upon the character i have never yet been able to ascertain but the fact is unquestionable that there never yet was any person named charles who was not an open manly honest goodnatured and frankhearted fellow with a rich clear voice that did you good to hear it and an eye that looked you always straight in the face as much as to say i have a clear conscience myself am afraid of no man and am altogether above doing a mean action and thus all the hearty careless walking gentlemen of the stage are very certain to be called charles  now old charley goodfellow although he had been in rattleborough not longer than six months or thereabouts and although nobody knew any thing about him before he came to settle in the neighborhood had experienced no difficulty in the world in making the acquaintance of all the respectable people in the borough not a man of them but would have taken his bare word for a thousand at any moment and as for the women there is no saying what they would not have done to oblige him and all this came of his having been christened charles and of his possessing in consequence that ingenuous face which is proverbially the very best letter of recommendation  i have already said that mr shuttleworthy was one of the most respectable and undoubtedly he was the most wealthy man in rattleborough while old charley goodfellow was upon as intimate terms with him as if he had been his own brother the two old gentlemen were nextdoor neighbours and although mr shuttleworthy seldom if ever visited old charley and never was known to take a meal in his house still this did not prevent the two friends from being exceedingly intimate as i have just observed for old charley never let a day pass without stepping in three or four times to see how his neighbour came on and very often he would stay to breakfast or tea and almost always to dinner and then the amount of wine that was made way with by the two cronies at a sitting it would really be a difficult thing to ascertain old charleys favorite beverage was chateaumargaux and it appeared to do mr shuttleworthys heart good to see the old fellow swallow it as he did quart after quart so that one day when the wine was in and the wit as a natural consequence somewhat out he said to his crony as he slapped him upon the backi tell you what it is old charley you are by all odds the heartiest old fellow i ever came across in all my born days and since you love to guzzle the wine at that fashion ill be darned if i dont have to make thee a present of a big box of the chateaumargaux od rot memr shuttleworthy had a sad habit of swearing although he seldom went beyond od rot me or by gosh or by the jolly gollyod rot me says he if i dont send an order to town this very afternoon for a double box of the best that can be got and ill make ye a present of it i willye neednt say a word nowi will i tell ye and theres an end of it so look out for itit will come to hand some of these fine days precisely when ye are looking for it the least i mention this little bit of liberality on the part of mr shuttleworthy just by way of showing you how very intimate an understanding existed between the two friends  well on the sunday morning in question when it came to be fairly understood that mr shuttleworthy had met with foul play i never saw any one so profoundly affected as old charley goodfellow when he first heard that the horse had come home without his master and without his masters saddlebags and all bloody from a pistolshot that had gone clean through and through the poor animals chest without quite killing him when he heard all this he turned as pale as if the missing man had been his own dear brother or father and shivered and shook all over as if he had had a fit of the ague  at first he was too much overpowered with grief to be able to do any thing at all or to concert upon any plan of action so that for a long time he endeavored to dissuade mr shuttleworthys other friends from making a stir about the matter thinking it best to wait awhilesay for a week or two or a month or twoto see if something wouldnt turn up or if mr shuttleworthy wouldnt come in the natural way and explain his reasons for sending his horse on before i dare say you have often observed this disposition to temporize or to procrastinate in people who are labouring under any very poignant sorrow their powers of mind seem to be rendered torpid so that they have a horror of any thing like action and like nothing in the world so well as to lie quietly in bed and nurse their grief as the old ladies express itthat is to say ruminate over the trouble  the people of rattleborough had indeed so high an opinion of the wisdom and discretion of old charley that the greater part of them felt disposed to agree with him and not make a stir in the business until something should turn up as the honest old gentleman worded it and i believe that after all this would have been the general determination but for the very suspicious interference of mr shuttleworthys nephew a young man of very dissipated habits and otherwise of rather bad character this nephew whose name was pennifeather would listen to nothing like reason in the matter of lying quiet but insisted upon making immediate search for the corpse of the murdered manthis was the expression he employed and mr goodfellow acutely remarked at the time that it was a singular expression to say no more this remark of old charleys too had great effect upon the crowd and one of the party was heard to ask very impressively how it happened that young mr pennifeather was so intimately cognizant of all the circumstances connected with his wealthy uncles disappearance as to feel authorized to assert distinctly and unequivocally that his uncle was a murdered man hereupon some little squibbing and bickering occurred among various members of the crowd and especially between old charley and mr pennifeatheralthough this latter occurrence was indeed by no means a novelty for no good will had subsisted between the parties for the last three or four months and matters had even gone so far that mr pennifeather had actually knocked down his uncles friend for some alleged excess of liberty that the latter had taken in the uncles house of which the nephew was an inmate upon this occasion old charley is said to have behaved with exemplary moderation and christian charity he arose from the blow adjusted his clothes and made no attempt at retaliation at allmerely muttering a few words about taking summary vengeance at the first convenient opportunitya natural and very justifiable ebullition of anger which meant nothing however and beyond doubt was no sooner given vent to than forgotten  however these matters may be which have no reference to the point now at issue it is quite certain that the people of rattleborough principally through the persuasion of mr pennifeather came at length to the determination of dispersion over the adjacent country in search of the missing mr shuttleworthy i say they came to this determination in the first instance after it had been fully resolved that a search should be made it was considered almost a matter of course that the seekers should dispersethat is to say distribute themselves in partiesfor the more thorough examination of the region round about i forget however by what ingenious train of reasoning it was that old charley finally convinced the assembly that this was the most injudicious plan that could be pursued convince them however he didall except mr pennifeather and in the end it was arranged that a search should be instituted carefully and very thoroughly by the burghers en masse old charley himself leading the way  as for the matter of that there could have been no better pioneer than old charley whom everybody knew to have the eye of a lynx but although he led them into all manner of outoftheway holes and corners by routes that nobody had ever suspected of existing in the neighbourhood and although the search was incessantly kept up day and night for nearly a week still no trace of mr shuttleworthy could be discovered when i say no trace however i must not be understood to speak literally for trace to some extent there certainly was the poor gentleman had been tracked by his horses shoes which were peculiar to a spot about three miles to the east of the borough on the main road leading to the city here the track made off into a bypath through a piece of woodlandthe path coming out again into the main road and cutting off about half a mile of the regular distance following the shoemarks down this lane the party came at length to a pool of stagnant water half hidden by the brambles to the right of the lane and opposite this pool all vestige of the track was lost sight of it appeared however that a struggle of some nature had here taken place and it seemed as if some large and heavy body much larger and heavier than a man had been drawn from the bypath to the pool this latter was carefully dragged twice but nothing was found and the party was upon the point of going away in despair of coming to any result when providence suggested to mr goodfellow the expediency of draining the water off altogether this project was received with cheers and many high compliments to old charley upon his sagacity and consideration as many of the burghers had brought spades with them supposing that they might possibly be called upon to disinter a corpse the drain was easily and speedily effected and no sooner was the bottom visible than right in the middle of the mud that remained was discovered a black silk velvet waistcoat which nearly every one present immediately recognized as the property of mr pennifeather this waistcoat was much torn and stained with blood and there were several persons among the party who had a distinct remembrance of its having been worn by its owner on the very morning of mr shuttleworthys departure for the city while there were others again ready to testify upon oath if required that mr p did not wear the garment in question at any period during the remainder of that memorable day nor could any one be found to say that he had seen it upon mr ps person at any period at all subsequent to mr shuttleworthys disappearance  matters now wore a very serious aspect for mr pennifeather and it was observed as an indubitable confirmation of the suspicions which were excited against him that he grew exceedingly pale and when asked what he had to say for himself was utterly incapable of saying a word hereupon the few friends his riotous mode of living had left him deserted him at once to a man and were even more clamorous than his ancient and avowed enemies for his instantaneous arrest but on the other hand the magnanimity of mr goodfellow shone forth with only the more brilliant lustre through contrast he made a warm and intensely eloquent defence of mr pennifeather in which he alluded more than once to his own sincere forgiveness of that wild young gentlemanthe heir of the worthy mr shuttleworthyfor the insult which he the young gentleman had no doubt in the heat of passion thought proper to put upon him mr goodfellow he forgave him for it he said from the very bottom of his heart and for himself mr goodfellow so far from pushing the suspicious circumstances to extremity which he was sorry to say really had arisen against mr pennifeather he mr goodfellow would make every exertion in his power would employ all the little eloquence in his possession tototosoften down as much as he could conscientiously do so the worst features of this really exceedingly perplexing piece of business  mr goodfellow went on for some half hour longer in this strain very much to the credit both of his head and of his heart but your warmhearted people are seldom apposite in their observationsthey run into all sorts of blunders contretemps and mal aproposisms in the hotheadedness of their zeal to serve a friendthus often with the kindest intentions in the world doing infinitely more to prejudice his cause than to advance it  so in the present instance it turned out with all the eloquence of old charley for although he laboured earnestly in behalf of the suspected yet it so happened somehow or other that every syllable he uttered of which the direct but unwitting tendency was not to exalt the speaker in the good opinion of his audience had the effect to deepen the suspicion already attached to the individual whose cause he pleaded and to arouse against him the fury of the mob  one of the most unaccountable errors committed by the orator was his allusion to the suspected as the heir of the worthy old gentleman mr shuttleworthy the people had really never thought of this before they had only remembered certain threats of disinheritance uttered a year or two previously by the uncle who had no living relative except the nephew and they had therefore always looked upon this disinheritance as a matter that was settledso singleminded a race of beings were the rattleburghers but the remark of old charley brought them at once to a consideration of this point and thus gave them to see the possibility of the threats having been nothing more than a threat and straightway hereupon arose the natural question of cui bonoa question that tended even more than the waistcoat to fasten the terrible crime upon the young man and here lest i may be misunderstood permit me to digress for one moment merely to observe that the exceedingly brief and simple latin phrase which i have employed is invariably mistranslated and misconceived cui bono in all the crack novels and elsewherein those of mrs gore for example the author of cecil a lady who quotes all tongues from the chaldaean to chickasaw and is helped to her learning as needed upon a systematic plan by mr beckfordin all the crack novels i say from those of bulwer and dickens to those of bulwer and dickens to those of turnapenny and ainsworth the two little latin words cui bono are rendered to what purpose or as if quo bono to what good their true meaning nevertheless is for whose advantage cui to whom bono is it for a benefit it is a purely legal phrase and applicable precisely in cases such as we have now under consideration where the probability of the doer of a deed hinges upon the probability of the benefit accruing to this individual or to that from the deeds accomplishment now in the present instance the question cui bono very pointedly implicated mr pennifeather his uncle had threatened him after making a will in his favour with disinheritance but the threat had not been actually kept the original will it appeared had not been altered had it been altered the only supposable motive for murder on the part of the suspected would have been the ordinary one of revenge and even this would have been counteracted by the hope of reinstation into the good graces of the uncle but the will being unaltered while the threat to alter remained suspended over the nephews head there appears at once the very strongest possible inducement for the atrocity and so concluded very sagaciously the worthy citizens of the borough of rattle  mr pennifeather was accordingly arrested upon the spot and the crowd after some further search proceeded homeward having him in custody on the route however another circumstance occurred tending to confirm the suspicion entertained mr goodfellow whose zeal led him to be always a little in advance of the party was seen suddenly to run forward a few paces stoop and then apparently to pick up some small object from the grass having quickly examined it he was observed too to make a sort of half attempt at concealing it in his coat pocket but this action was noticed as i say and consequently prevented when the object picked up was found to be a spanish knife which a dozen persons at once recognized as belonging to mr pennifeather moreover his initials were engraved upon the handle the blade of this knife was open and bloody  no doubt now remained of the guilt of the nephew and immediately upon reaching rattleborough he was taken before a magistrate for examination  here matters again took a most unfavourable turn the prisoner being questioned as to his whereabouts on the morning of mr shuttleworthys disappearance had absolutely the audacity to acknowledge that on that very morning he had been out with his rifle deerstalking in the immediate neighbourhood of the pool where the bloodstained waistcoat had been discovered through the sagacity of mr goodfellow  this latter now came forward and with tears in his eyes asked permission to be examined he said that a stern sense of the duty he owed his maker not less than his fellowmen would permit him no longer to remain silent hitherto the sincerest affection for the young man notwithstanding the latters illtreatment of himself mr goodfellow had induced him to make every hypothesis which imagination could suggest by way of endeavoring to account for what appeared suspicious in the circumstances that told so seriously against mr pennifeather but these circumstances were now altogether too convincingtoo damning he would hesitate no longerhe would tell all he knew although his heart mr goodfellows should absolutely burst asunder in the effort he then went on to state that on the afternoon of the day previous to mr shuttleworthys departure for the city that worthy old gentleman had mentioned to his nephew in his hearing mr goodfellows that his object in going to town on the morrow was to make a deposit of an unusually large sum of money in the farmers and mechanics bank and that then and there the said mr shuttleworthy had distinctly avowed to the said nephew his irrevocable determination of rescinding the will originally made and of cutting him off with a shilling he the witness now solemnly called upon the accused to state whether what he the witness had just stated was or was not the truth in every substantial particular much to the astonishment of every one present mr pennifeather frankly admitted that it was  the magistrate now considered it his duty to send a couple of constables to search the chamber of the accused in the house of his uncle from this search they almost immediately returned with the wellknown steelbound russet leather pocketbook which the old gentleman had been in the habit of carrying for years its valuable contents however had been abstracted and the magistrate in vain endeavored to extort from the prisoner the use which had been made of them or the place of their concealment indeed he obstinately denied all knowledge of the matter the constables also discovered between the bed and sacking of the unhappy man a shirt and neckhandkerchief both marked with the initials of his name and both hideously besmeared with the blood of the victim  at this juncture it was announced that the horse of the murdered man had just expired in the stable from the effects of the wound he had received and it was proposed by mr goodfellow that a post mortem examination of the beast should be immediately made with the view if possible of discovering the ball this was accordingly done and as if to demonstrate beyond a question the guilt of the accused mr goodfellow after considerable searching in the cavity of the chest was enabled to detect and to pull forth a bullet of very extraordinary size which upon trial was found to be exactly adapted to the bore of mr pennifeathers rifle while it was far too large for that of any other person in the borough or its vicinity to render the matter even surer yet however this bullet was discovered to have a flaw or seam at right angles to the usual suture and upon examination this seam corresponded precisely with an accidental ridge or elevation in a pair of moulds acknowledged by the accused himself to be his own property upon finding of this bullet the examining magistrate refused to listen to any farther testimony and immediately committed the prisoner for trialdeclining resolutely to take any bail in the case although against this severity mr goodfellow very warmly remonstrated and offered to become surety in whatever amount might be required this generosity on the part of old charley was only in accordance with the whole tenour of his amiable and chivalrous conduct during the entire period of his sojourn in the borough of rattle in the present instance the worthy man was so entirely carried away by the excessive warmth of his sympathy that he seemed to have quite forgotten when he offered to go bail for his young friend that he himself mr goodfellow did not possess a single dollars worth of property upon the face of the earth  the result of the committal may be readily foreseen mr pennifeather amid the loud execrations of all rattleborough was brought to trial at the next criminal sessions when the chain of circumstantial evidence strengthened as it was by some additional damning facts which mr goodfellows sensitive conscientiousness forbade him to withhold from the court was considered so unbroken and so thoroughly conclusive that the jury without leaving their seats returned an immediate verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree soon afterward the unhappy wretch received sentence of death and was remanded to the county jail to await the inexorable vengeance of the law  in the meantime the noble behavior of old charley goodfellow had doubly endeared him to the honest citizens of the borough he became ten times a greater favorite than ever and as a natural result of the hospitality with which he was treated he relaxed as it were perforce the extremely parsimonious habits which his poverty had hitherto impelled him to observe and very frequently had little reunions at his own house when wit and jollity reigned supremedampened a little of course by the occasional remembrance of the untoward and melancholy fate which impended over the nephew of the late lamented bosom friend of the generous host  one fine day this magnanimous old gentleman was agreeably surprised at the receipt of the following letter   charles goodfellow esq rattleborough  from hfb  co  chat mar ano 16 doz bottles 12 gross   charles goodfellow esquire   dear sirin conformity with an order transmitted to our firm about  two months since by our esteemed correspondent mr barnabus  shuttleworthy we have the honor of forwarding this morning to your  address a double box of chateaumargaux of the antelope brand violet  seal box numbered and marked as per margin   we remain sir          your most obnt serts                  hoggs frogs bogs  co   city of june 21 18   psthe box will reach you by wagon on the day after your receipt  of this letter our respects to mr shuttleworthy                    h f b  co  the fact is that mr goodfellow had since the death of mr shuttleworthy given over all expectation of ever receiving the promised chateaumargaux and he therefore looked upon it now as a sort of especial dispensation of providence in his behalf he was highly delighted of course and in the exuberance of his joy invited a large party of friends to a petit souper on the morrow for the purpose of broaching the good old mr shuttleworthys present not that he said any thing about the good old mr shuttleworthy when he issued the invitations the fact is he thought much and concluded to say nothing at all he did not mention to any oneif i remember arightthat he had received a present of chateaumargaux he merely asked his friends to come and help him drink some of a remarkable fine quality and rich flavour that he had ordered up from the city a couple of months ago and of which he would be in the receipt upon the morrow i have often puzzled myself to imagine why it was that old charley came to the conclusion to say nothing about having received the wine from his old friend but i could never precisely understand his reason for the silence although he had some excellent and very magnanimous reason no doubt  the morrow at length arrived and with it a very large and highly respectable company at mr goodfellows house indeed half the borough was therei myself among the numberbut much to the vexation of the host the chateaumargaux did not arrive until a late hour and when the sumptuous supper supplied by old charley had been done very ample justice by the guests it came at length howevera monstrously big box of it there was tooand as the whole party were in excessively good humor it was decided nem con that it should be lifted upon the table and its contents disembowelled forthwith  no sooner said than done i lent a helping hand and in a trice we had the box upon the table in the midst of all the bottles and glasses not a few of which were demolished in the scuffle old charley who was pretty much intoxicated and excessively red in the face now took a seat with an air of mock dignity at the head of the board and thumped furiously upon it with a decanter calling upon the company to keep order during the ceremony of disinterring the treasure  after some vociferation quiet was at length fully restored and as very often happens in similar cases a profound and remarkable silence ensued being then requested to force open the lid i complied of course with an infinite deal of pleasure i inserted a chisel and giving it a few slight taps with a hammer the top of the box flew suddenly off and at the same instant there sprang up into a sitting position directly facing the host the bruised bloody and nearly putrid corpse of the murdered mr shuttleworthy himself it gazed for a few seconds fixedly and sorrowfully with its decaying and lacklustre eyes full into the countenance of mr goodfellow uttered slowly but clearly and impressively the wordsthou art the man and then falling over the side of the chest as if thoroughly satisfied stretched out its limbs quiveringly upon the table  the scene that ensued is altogether beyond description the rush for the doors and windows was terrific and many of the most robust men in the room fainted outright through sheer horror but after the first wild shrieking burst of affright all eyes were directed to mr goodfellow if i live a thousand years i can never forget the more than mortal agony which was depicted in that ghastly face of his so lately rubicund with triumph and wine for several minutes he sat rigidly as a statue of marble his eyes seeming in the intense vacancy of their gaze to be turned inward and absorbed in the contemplation of his own miserable murderous soul at length their expression appeared to flash suddenly out into the external world when with a quick leap he sprang from his chair and falling heavily with his head and shoulders upon the table and in contact with the corpse poured out rapidly and vehemently a detailed confession of the hideous crime for which mr pennifeather was then imprisoned and doomed to die  what he recounted was in substance thishe followed his victim to the vicinity of the pool there shot his horse with a pistol despatched its rider with the butt end possessed himself of the pocketbook and supposing the horse dead dragged it with great labour to the brambles by the pond upon his own beast he slung the corpse of mr shuttleworthy and thus bore it to a secure place of concealment a long distance off through the woods  the waistcoat the knife the pocketbook and bullet had been placed by himself where found with the view of avenging himself upon mr pennifeather he had also contrived the discovery of the stained handkerchief and shirt  towards the end of the bloodchurning recital the words of the guilty wretch faltered and grew hollow when the record was finally exhausted he arose staggered backward from the table and felldead                       the means by which this happilytimed confession was extorted although efficient were simple indeed mr goodfellows excess of frankness had disgusted me and excited my suspicions from the first i was present when mr pennifeather had struck him and the fiendish expression which then arose upon his countenance although momentary assured me that his threat of vengeance would if possible be rigidly fulfilled i was thus prepared to view the manoeuvering of old charley in a very different light from that in which it was regarded by the good citizens of rattleborough i saw at once that all the criminating discoveries arose either directly or indirectly from himself but the fact which clearly opened my eyes to the true state of the case was the affair of the bullet found by mr g in the carcass of the horse i had not forgotten although the rattleburghers had that there was a hole where the ball had entered the horse and another where it went out if it were found in the animal then after having made its exit i saw clearly that it must have been deposited by the person who found it the bloody shirt and handkerchief confirmed the idea suggested by the bullet for the blood on examination proved to be capital claret and no more when i came to think of these things and also of the late increase of liberality and expenditure on the part of mr goodfellow i entertained a suspicion which was none the less strong because i kept it altogether to myself  in the meantime i instituted a rigorous private search for the corpse of mr shuttleworthy and for good reasons searched in quarters as divergent as possible from those to which mr goodfellow conducted his party the result was that after some days i came across an old dry well the mouth of which was nearly hidden by brambles and here at the bottom i discovered what i sought  now it so happened that i had overheard the colloquy between the two cronies when mr goodfellow had contrived to cajole his host into the promise of a box of chateauxmargaux upon this hint i acted i procured a stiff piece of whalebone thrust it down the throat of the corpse and deposited the latter in an old wine boxtaking care so to double the body up as to double the whalebone with it in this manner i had to press forcibly upon the lid to keep it down while i secured it with nails and i anticipated of course that as soon as these latter were removed the top would fly off and the body up  having thus arranged the box i marked numbered and addressed it as already told and then writing a letter in the name of the wine merchants with whom mr shuttleworthy dealt i gave instructions to my servant to wheel the box to mr goodfellows door in a barrow at a given signal from myself for the words which i intended the corpse to speak i confidently depended upon my ventriloquial abilities for their effect i counted upon the conscience of the murderous wretch  i believe there is nothing more to be explained mr pennifeather was released upon the spot inherited the fortune of his uncle profited by the lessons of experience turned over a new leaf and led happily ever afterward a new life     why the little frenchman wears his hand in a sling  its on my visiting cards sure enough and its them thats all o pink satin paper that inny gintleman that plases may behould the intheristhin

leddyship complately and intirely by rason of the illigant conversation that i kipt up wid her all about the dear bogs of connaught and by and by she gived me such a swate smile from one ind of her mouth to the ither that it made me as bould as a pig and i jist took hould of the ind of her little finger in the most dillikitest manner in natur looking at her all the while out o the whites of my

quand un bon vin meuble mon estomac           je suis plus savant que balzac          plus sage que pibrac           mon brass seul faisant lattaque           de la nation coseaque           la

            french vaudeville  that pierre bonbon was a restaurateur of uncommon qualifications no man who during the reign of frequented the little câfé in the culdesac le febvre at rouen will i imagine feel himself at liberty to dispute that pierre bonbon was in an equal degree skilled in the philosophy of that period is i presume still more especially undeniable his patés à la fois were beyond doubt immaculate but what pen can do justice to his essays sur la naturehis thoughts sur lamehis observations sur lesprit if his omelettesif his fricandeaux were inestimable what littérateur of that day would not have given twice as much for an idée de bonbon as for all the trash of idées of all the rest of the savants bonbon had ransacked libraries which no other man had ransackedhad more than any other would have entertained a notion of readinghad understood more than any other would have conceived the possibility of understanding and although while he flourished there were not wanting some authors at rouen to assert that his dicta evinced neither the purity of the academy nor the depth of the lyceumalthough mark me his doctrines were by no means very generally comprehended still it did not follow that they were difficult of comprehension it was i think on account of their selfevidency that many persons were led to consider them abstruse it is to bonbonbut let this go no fartherit is to bonbon that kant himself is mainly indebted for his metaphysics the former was indeed not a platonist nor strictly speaking an aristoteliannor did he like the modern leibnitz waste those precious hours which might be employed in the invention of a fricasée or facili gradu the analysis of a sensation in frivolous attempts at reconciling the obstinate oils and waters of ethical discussion not at all bonbon was ionicbonbon was equally italic he reasoned à priorihe reasoned also à posteriori his ideas were innateor otherwise he believed in george of trebizondehe believed in bossarion bessarion bonbon was emphatically abonbonist  i have spoken of the philosopher in his capacity of restaurateur i would not however have any friend of mine imagine that in fulfilling his hereditary duties in that line our hero wanted a proper estimation of their dignity and importance far from it it was impossible to say in which branch of his profession he took the greater pride in his opinion the powers of the intellect held intimate connection with the capabilities of the stomach i am not sure indeed that he greatly disagreed with the chinese who held that the soul lies in the abdomen the greeks at all events were right he thought who employed the same words for the mind and the diaphragm 1 by this i do not mean to insinuate a charge of gluttony or indeed any other serious charge to the prejudice of the metaphysician if pierre bonbon had his failingsand what great man has not a thousandif pierre bonbon i say had his failings they were failings of very little importancefaults indeed which in other tempers have often been looked upon rather in the light of virtues as regards one of these foibles i should not even have mentioned it in this history but for the remarkable prominencythe extreme alto relievoin which it jutted out from the plane of his general disposition he could never let slip an opportunity of making a bargain  1 md  not that he was avariciousno it was by no means necessary to the satisfaction of the philosopher that the bargain should be to his own proper advantage provided a trade could be effecteda trade of any kind upon any terms or under any circumstancesa triumphant smile was seen for many days thereafter to enlighten his countenance and a knowing wink of the eye to give evidence of his sagacity  at any epoch it would not be very wonderful if a humor so peculiar as the one i have just mentioned should elicit attention and remark at the epoch of our narrative had this peculiarity not attracted observation there would have been room for wonder indeed it was soon reported that upon all occasions of the kind the smile of bonbon was wont to differ widely from the downright grin with which he would laugh at his own jokes or welcome an acquaintance hints were thrown out of an exciting nature stories were told of perilous bargains made in a hurry and repented of at leisure and instances were adduced of unaccountable capacities vague longings and unnatural inclinations implanted by the author of all evil for wise purposes of his own  the philosopher had other weaknessesbut they are scarcely worthy our serious examination for example there are few men of extraordinary profundity who are found wanting in an inclination for the bottle whether this inclination be an exciting cause or rather a valid proof of such profundity it is a nice thing to say bonbon as far as i can learn did not think the subject adapted to minute investigationnor do i yet in the indulgence of a propensity so truly classical it is not to be supposed that the restaurateur would lose sight of that intuitive discrimination which was wont to characterize at one and the same time his essais and his omelettes in his seclusions the vin de bourgogne had its allotted hour and there were appropriate moments for the cotes du rhone with him sauterne was to medoc what catullus was to homer he would sport with a syllogism in sipping st peray but unravel an argument over clos de vougeot and upset a theory in a torrent of chambertin well had it been if the same quick sense of propriety had attended him in the peddling propensity to which i have formerly alludedbut this was by no means the case indeed to say the truth that trait of mind in the philosophic bonbon did begin at length to assume a character of strange intensity and mysticism and appeared deeply tinctured with the diablerie of his favorite german studies  to enter the little cafe in the culdesac le febvre was at the period of our tale to enter the sanctum of a man of genius bonbon was a man of genius there was not a souscusinier in rouen who could not have told you that bonbon was a man of genius his very cat knew it and forebore to whisk her tail in the presence of the man of genius his large waterdog was acquainted with the fact and upon the approach of his master betrayed his sense of inferiority by a sanctity of deportment a debasement of the ears and a dropping of the lower jaw not altogether unworthy of a dog it is however true that much of this habitual respect might have been attributed to the personal appearance of the metaphysician a distinguished exterior will i am constrained to say have its way even with a beast and i am willing to allow much in the outward man of the restaurateur calculated to impress the imagination of the quadruped there is a peculiar majesty about the atmosphere of the little greatif i may be permitted so equivocal an expressionwhich mere physical bulk alone will be found at all times inefficient in creating if however bonbon was barely three feet in height and if his head was diminutively small still it was impossible to behold the rotundity of his stomach without a sense of magnificence nearly bordering upon the sublime in its size both dogs and men must have seen a type of his acquirementsin its immensity a fitting habitation for his immortal soul  i might hereif it so pleased medilate upon the matter of habiliment and other mere circumstances of the external metaphysician i might hint that the hair of our hero was worn short combed smoothly over his forehead and surmounted by a conicalshaped white flannel cap and tasselsthat his peagreen jerkin was not after the fashion of those worn by the common class of restaurateurs at that daythat the sleeves were something fuller than the reigning costume permittedthat the cuffs were turned up not as usual in that barbarous period with cloth of the same quality and color as the garment but faced in a more fanciful manner with the particolored velvet of genoathat his slippers were of a bright purple curiously filigreed and might have been manufactured in japan but for the exquisite pointing of the toes and the brilliant tints of the binding and embroiderythat his breeches were of the yellow satinlike material called aimablethat his skyblue cloak resembling in form a dressingwrapper and richly bestudded all over with crimson devices floated cavalierly upon his shoulders like a mist of the morningand that his tout ensemble gave rise to the remarkable words of benevenuta the improvisatrice of florence that it was difficult to say whether pierre bonbon was indeed a bird of paradise or rather a very paradise of perfection i might i say expatiate upon all these points if i pleasedbut i forbear merely personal details may be left to historical noveliststhey are beneath the moral dignity of matteroffact  i have said that to enter the cafe in the culdesac le febvre was to enter the sanctum of a man of geniusbut then it was only the man of genius who could duly estimate the merits of the sanctum a sign consisting of a vast folio swung before the entrance on one side of the volume was painted a bottle on the reverse a pate on the back were visible in large letters oeuvres de bonbon thus was delicately shadowed forth the twofold occupation of the proprietor  upon stepping over the threshold the whole interior of the building presented itself to view a long lowpitched room of antique construction was indeed all the accommodation afforded by the cafe in a corner of the apartment stood the bed of the metaphysician an army of curtains together with a canopy a la grecque gave it an air at once classic and comfortable in the corner diagonary opposite appeared in direct family communion the properties of the kitchen and the bibliotheque a dish of polemics stood peacefully upon the dresser here lay an ovenful of the latest ethicsthere a kettle of dudecimo melanges volumes of german morality were hand and glove with the gridirona toastingfork might be discovered by the side of eusebiusplato reclined at his ease in the fryingpanand contemporary manuscripts were filed away upon the spit  in other respects the cafe de bonbon might be said to differ little from the usual restaurants of the period a fireplace yawned opposite the door on the right of the fireplace an open cupboard displayed a formidable array of labelled bottles  it was here about twelve oclock one night during the severe winter the comments of his neighbours upon his singular propensitythat pierre bonbon i say having turned them all out of his house locked the door upon them with an oath and betook himself in no very pacific mood to the comforts of a leatherbottomed armchair and a fire of blazing fagots  it was one of those terrific nights which are only met with once or twice during a century it snowed fiercely and the house tottered to its centre with the floods of wind that rushing through the crannies in the wall and pouring impetuously down the chimney shook awfully the curtains of the philosophers bed and disorganized the economy of his patepans and papers the huge folio sign that swung without exposed to the fury of the tempest creaked ominously and gave out a moaning sound from its stanchions of solid oak  it was in no placid temper i say that the metaphysician drew up his chair to its customary station by the hearth many circumstances of a perplexing nature had occurred during the day to disturb the serenity of his meditations in attempting des oeufs a la princesse he had unfortunately perpetrated an omelette a la reine the discovery of a principle in ethics had been frustrated by the overturning of a stew and last not least he had been thwarted in one of those admirable bargains which he at all times took such especial delight in bringing to a successful termination but in the chafing of his mind at these unaccountable vicissitudes there did not fail to be mingled some degree of that nervous anxiety which the fury of a boisterous night is so well calculated to produce whistling to his more immediate vicinity the large black waterdog we have spoken of before and settling himself uneasily in his chair he could not help casting a wary and unquiet eye toward those distant recesses of the apartment whose inexorable shadows not even the red firelight itself could more than partially succeed in overcoming having completed a scrutiny whose exact purpose was perhaps unintelligible to himself he drew close to his seat a small table covered with books and papers and soon became absorbed in the task of retouching a voluminous manuscript intended for publication on the morrow  he had been thus occupied for some minutes when i am in no hurry monsieur bonbon suddenly whispered a whining voice in the apartment  the devil ejaculated our hero starting to his feet overturning the table at his side and staring around him in astonishment  very true calmly replied the voice  very truewhat is very truehow came you here vociferated the metaphysician as his eye fell upon something which lay stretched at full length upon the bed  i was saying said the intruder without attending to the interrogativesi was saying that i am not at all pushed for timethat the business upon which i took the liberty of calling is of no pressing importancein short that i can very well wait until you have finished your exposition  my expositionthere nowhow do you knowhow came you to understand that i was writing an expositiongood god  hush replied the figure in a shrill undertone and arising quickly from the bed he made a single step toward our hero while an iron lamp that depended overhead swung convulsively back from his approach  the philosophers amazement did not prevent a narrow scrutiny of the strangers dress and appearance the outlines of his figure exceedingly lean but much above the common height were rendered minutely distinct by means of a faded suit of black cloth which fitted tight to the skin but was otherwise cut very much in the style of a century ago these garments had evidently been intended for a much shorter person than their present owner his ankles and wrists were left naked for several inches in his shoes however a pair of very brilliant buckles gave the lie to the extreme poverty implied by the other portions of his dress his head was bare and entirely bald with the exception of a hinder part from which depended a queue of considerable length a pair of green spectacles with side glasses protected his eyes from the influence of the light and at the same time prevented our hero from ascertaining either their color or their conformation about the entire person there was no evidence of a shirt but a white cravat of filthy appearance was tied with extreme precision around the throat and the ends hanging down formally side by side gave although i dare say unintentionally the idea of an ecclesiastic indeed many other points both in his appearance and demeanor might have very well sustained a conception of that nature over his left ear he carried after the fashion of a modern clerk an instrument resembling the stylus of the ancients in a breastpocket of his coat appeared conspicuously a small black volume fastened with clasps of steel this book whether accidentally or not was so turned outwardly from the person as to discover the words rituel catholique in white letters upon the back his entire physiognomy was interestingly saturnineeven cadaverously pale the forehead was lofty and deeply furrowed with the ridges of contemplation the corners of the mouth were drawn down into an expression of the most submissive humility there was also a clasping of the hands as he stepped toward our heroa deep sighand altogether a look of such utter sanctity as could not have failed to be unequivocally preposessing every shadow of anger faded from the countenance of the metaphysician as having completed a satisfactory survey of his visiters person he shook him cordially by the hand and conducted him to a seat  there would however be a radical error in attributing this instantaneous transition of feeling in the philosopher to any one of those causes which might naturally be supposed to have had an influence indeed pierre bonbon from what i have been able to understand of his disposition was of all men the least likely to be imposed upon by any speciousness of exterior deportment it was impossible that so accurate an observer of men and things should have failed to discover upon the moment the real character of the personage who had thus intruded upon his hospitality to say no more the conformation of his visiters feet was sufficiently remarkablehe maintained lightly upon his head an inordinately tall hatthere was a tremulous swelling about the hinder part of his breechesand the vibration of his coat tail was a palpable fact judge then with what feelings of satisfaction our hero found himself thrown thus at once into the society of a person for whom he had at all times entertained the most unqualified respect he was however too much of the diplomatist to let escape him any intimation of his suspicions in regard to the true state of affairs it was not his cue to appear at all conscious of the high honor he thus unexpectedly enjoyed but by leading his guest into the conversation to elicit some important ethical ideas which might in obtaining a place in his contemplated publication enlighten the human race and at the same time immortalize himselfideas which i should have added his visitors great age and wellknown proficiency in the science of morals might very well have enabled him to afford  actuated by these enlightened views our hero bade the gentleman sit down while he himself took occasion to throw some fagots upon the fire and place upon the now reestablished table some bottles of mousseux having quickly completed these operations he drew his chair visavis to his companions and waited until the latter should open the conversation but plans even the most skilfully matured are often thwarted in the outset of their applicationand the restaurateur found himself nonplussed by the very first words of his visiters speech  i see you know me bonbon said he ha ha hahe he hehi hi hiho ho hohu hu huand the devil dropping at once the sanctity of his demeanor opened to its fullest extent a mouth from ear to ear so as to display a set of jagged and fanglike teeth and throwing back his head laughed long loudly wickedly and uproariously while the black dog crouching down upon his haunches joined lustily in the chorus and the tabby cat flying off at a tangent stood up on end and shrieked in the farthest corner of the apartment  not so the philosopher he was too much a man of the world either to laugh like the dog or by shrieks to betray the indecorous trepidation of the cat it must be confessed he felt a little astonishment to see the white letters which formed the words rituel catholique on the book in his guests pocket momently changing both their color and their import and in a few seconds in place of the original title the words regitre des condamnes blazed forth in characters of red this startling circumstance when bonbon replied to his visiters remark imparted to his manner an air of embarrassment which probably might not otherwise have been observed  why sir said the philosopher why sir to speak sincerelyi i imaginei have some faintsome very faint ideaof the remarkable honor  ohahyesvery well interrupted his majesty say no morei see how it is and hereupon taking off his green spectacles he wiped the glasses carefully with the sleeve of his coat and deposited them in his pocket  if bonbon had been astonished at the incident of the book his amazement was now much increased by the spectacle which here presented itself to view in raising his eyes with a strong feeling of curiosity to ascertain the color of his guests he found them by no means black as he had anticipatednor gray as might have been imaginednor yet hazel nor bluenor indeed yellow nor rednor purplenor whitenor greennor any other color in the heavens above or in the earth beneath or in the waters under the earth in short pierre bonbon not only saw plainly that his majesty had no eyes whatsoever but could discover no indications of their having existed at any previous periodfor the space where eyes should naturally have been was i am constrained to say simply a dead level of flesh  it was not in the nature of the metaphysician to forbear making some inquiry into the sources of so strange a phenomenon and the reply of his majesty was at once prompt dignified and satisfactory  eyes my dear bonboneyes did you sayohahi perceive the ridiculous prints eh which are in circulation have given you a false idea of my personal appearance eyestrue eyes pierre bonbon are very well in their proper placethat you would say is the headrightthe head of a worm to you likewise these optics are indispensableyet i will convince you that my vision is more penetrating than your own there is a cat i see in the cornera pretty catlook at herobserve her well now bonbon do you behold the thoughtsthe thoughts i saythe ideasthe reflectionswhich are being engendered in her pericranium there it is nowyou do not she is thinking we admire the length of her tail and the profundity of her mind she has just concluded that i am the most distinguished of ecclesiastics and that you are the most superficial of metaphysicians thus you see i am not altogether blind but to one of my profession the eyes you speak of would be merely an incumbrance liable at any time to be put out by a toastingiron or a pitchfork to you i allow these optical affairs are indispensable endeavor bonbon to use them wellmy vision is the soul  hereupon the guest helped himself to the wine upon the table and pouring out a bumper for bonbon requested him to drink it without scruple and make himself perfectly at home  a clever book that of yours pierre resumed his majesty tapping our friend knowingly upon the shoulder as the latter put down his glass after a thorough compliance with his visiters injunction a clever book that of yours upon my honor its a work after my own heart your arrangement of the matter i think however might be improved and many of your notions remind me of aristotle that philosopher was one of my most intimate acquaintances i liked him as much for his terrible ill temper as for his happy knack at making a blunder there is only one solid truth in all that he has written and for that i gave him the hint out of pure compassion for his absurdity i suppose pierre bonbon you very well know to what divine moral truth i am alluding  cannot say that i  indeedwhy it was i who told aristotle that by sneezing men expelled superfluous ideas through the proboscis  which ishiccupundoubtedly the case said the metaphysician while he poured out for himself another bumper of mousseux and offered his snuffbox to the fingers of his visiter  there was plato too continued his majesty modestly declining the snuffbox and the compliment it impliedthere was plato too for whom i at one time felt all the affection of a friend you knew plato bonbonah no i beg a thousand pardons he met me at athens one day in the parthenon and told me he was distressed for an idea i bade him write down that o nous estin aulos he said that he would do so and went home while i stepped over to the pyramids but my conscience smote me for having uttered a truth even to aid a friend and hastening back to athens i arrived behind the philosophers chair as he was inditing the aulos  giving the lambda a fillip with my finger i turned it upside down so the sentence now read o nous estin augos and is you perceive the fundamental doctrines in his metaphysics  were you ever at rome asked the restaurateur as he finished his second bottle of mousseux and drew from the closet a larger supply of chambertin  but once monsieur bonbon but once there was a time said the devil as if reciting some passage from a bookthere was a time when occurred an anarchy of five years during which the republic bereft of all its officers had no magistracy besides the tribunes of the people and these were not legally vested with any degree of executive powerat that time monsieur bonbonat that time only i was in rome and i have no earthly acquaintance consequently with any of its philosophy 2       2 ils ecrivaient sur la philosophie cicero lucretius      seneca mais cetait la philosophie grecquecondorcet  what do you think ofwhat do you think ofhiccupepicurus  what do i think of whom said the devil in astonishment you cannot surely mean to find any fault with epicurus what do i think of epicurus do you mean me siri am epicurus i am the same philosopher who wrote each of the three hundred treatises commemorated by diogenes laertes  thats a lie said the metaphysician for the wine had gotten a little into his head  very wellvery well sirvery well indeed sir said his majesty apparently much flattered  thats a lie repeated the restaurateur dogmatically thats ahiccupa lie  well well have it your own way said the devil pacifically and bonbon having beaten his majesty at argument thought it his duty to conclude a second bottle of chambertin  as i was saying resumed the visiteras i was observing a little while ago there are some very outre notions in that book of yours monsieur bonbon what for instance do you mean by all that humbug about the soul pray sir what is the soul  thehiccupsoul replied the metaphysician referring to his ms is undoubtedly  no sir  indubitably  no sir  indisputably  no sir  evidently  no sir  incontrovertibly  no sir  hiccup  no sir  and beyond all question a  no sir the soul is no such thing here the philosopher looking daggers took occasion to make an end upon the spot of his third bottle of chambertin  thenhiccuppray sirwhatwhat is it  that is neither here nor there monsieur bonbon replied his majesty musingly i have tastedthat is to say i have known some very bad souls and some toopretty good ones here he smacked his lips and having unconsciously let fall his hand upon the volume in his pocket was seized with a violent fit of sneezing  he continued  there was the soul of cratinuspassable aristophanesracy platoexquisitenot your plato but plato the comic poet your plato would have turned the stomach of cerberusfaugh then let me see there were naevius and andronicus and plautus and terentius then there were lucilius and catullus and naso and quintus flaccusdear quinty as i called him when he sung a seculare for my amusement while i toasted him in pure good humor on a fork but they want flavor these romans one fat greek is worth a dozen of them and besides will keep which cannot be said of a quiritelet us taste your sauterne  bonbon had by this time made up his mind to nil admirari and endeavored to hand down the bottles in question he was however conscious of a strange sound in the room like the wagging of a tail of this although extremely indecent in his majesty the philosopher took no noticesimply kicking the dog and requesting him to be quiet the visiter continued  i found that horace tasted very much like aristotleyou know i am fond of variety terentius i could not have told from menander naso to my astonishment was nicander in disguise virgilius had a strong twang of theocritus martial put me much in mind of archilochusand titus livius was positively polybius and none other  hiccup here replied bonbon and his majesty proceeded  but if i have a penchant monsieur bonbonif i have a penchant it is for a philosopher yet let me tell you sir it is not every devi mean it is not every gentleman who knows how to choose a philosopher long ones are not good and the best if not carefully shelled are apt to be a little rancid on account of the gall  shelled  i mean taken out of the carcass  what do you think of ahiccupphysician  dont mention themugh ugh ugh here his majesty retched violently i never tasted but onethat rascal hippocratessmelt of asafoetidaugh ugh ughcaught a wretched cold washing him in the styxand after all he gave me the cholera morbus  thehiccupwretch ejaculated bonbon thehiccupabsorption of a pillboxand the philosopher dropped a tear  after all continued the visiter after all if a devif a gentleman wishes to live he must have more talents than one or two and with us a fat face is an evidence of diplomacy  how so  why we are sometimes exceedingly pushed for provisions you must know that in a climate so sultry as mine it is frequently impossible to keep a spirit alive for more than two or three hours and after death unless pickled immediately and a pickled spirit is not good they willsmellyou understand eh putrefaction is always to be apprehended when the souls are consigned to us in the usual way  hiccuphiccupgood god how do you manage  here the iron lamp commenced swinging with redoubled violence and the devil half started from his seathowever with a slight sigh he recovered his composure merely saying to our hero in a low tone i tell you what pierre bonbon we must have no more swearing  the host swallowed another bumper by way of denoting thorough comprehension and acquiescence and the visiter continued  why there are several ways of managing the most of us starve some put up with the pickle for my part i purchase my spirits vivente corpore in which case i find they keep very well  but the bodyhiccupthe body  the body the bodywell what of the bodyoh ah i perceive why sir the body is not at all affected by the transaction i have made innumerable purchases of the kind in my day and the parties never experienced any inconvenience there were cain and nimrod and nero and caligula and dionysius and pisistratus andand a thousand others who never knew what it was to have a soul during the latter part of their lives yet sir these men adorned society why possession of his faculties mental and corporeal who writes a keener epigram who reasons more wittily whobut stay i have his agreement in my pocketbook  thus saying he produced a red leather wallet and took from it a number of papers upon some of these bonbon caught a glimpse of the letters machimazarobespwith the words caligula george elizabeth his majesty selected a narrow slip of parchment and from it read aloud the following words  in consideration of certain mental endowments which it is unnecessary to specify and in further consideration of one thousand louis dor i being aged one year and one month do hereby make over to the bearer of this agreement all my right title and appurtenance in the shadow called my soul signed a 4 here his majesty repeated a name which i did not feel justified in indicating more unequivocally  4 querearouet  a clever fellow that resumed he but like you monsieur bonbon he was mistaken about the soul the soul a shadow truly the soul a shadow ha ha hahe he hehu hu hu only think of a fricasseed

fellow ill let you have ithiccupa bargain here the philosopher slapped his majesty upon the back  couldnt think of such a thing said the latter calmly at the same time rising from his seat the metaphysician stared  am supplied at present said his majesty  hiccupeh said the philosopher  have no funds on hand  what  besides very unhandsome in me  sir  to take advantage of  hiccup  your present disgusting and ungentlemanly situation  here the visiter bowed and withdrewin what manner could not precisely be ascertainedbut in a wellconcerted effort to discharge a bottle at the villain the slender chain was severed that depended from the ceiling and the metaphysician prostrated by the downfall of the lamp     some words with a mummy  the symposium of the preceding evening had been a little too much for my nerves i had a wretched headache and was desperately drowsy instead of going out therefore to spend the evening as i had proposed it occurred to me that i could not do a wiser thing than just eat a mouthful of supper and go immediately to bed  a light supper of course i am exceedingly fond of welsh rabbit more than a pound at once however may not at all times be advisable still there can be no material objection to two and really between two and three there is merely a single unit of difference i ventured perhaps upon four my wife will have it fivebut clearly she has confounded two very distinct affairs the abstract number five i am willing to admit but concretely it has reference to bottles of brown stout without which in the way of condiment welsh rabbit is to be eschewed  having thus concluded a frugal meal and donned my nightcap with the serene hope of enjoying it till noon the next day i placed my head upon the pillow and through the aid of a capital conscience fell into a profound slumber forthwith  but when were the hopes of humanity fulfilled i could not have completed my third snore when there came a furious ringing at the streetdoor bell and then an impatient thumping at the knocker which awakened me at once in a minute afterward and while i was still rubbing my eyes my wife thrust in my face a note from my old friend doctor ponnonner it ran thus        come to me by all means my dear good friend as soon as you  receive this come and help us to rejoice at last by long persevering  diplomacy i have gained the assent of the directors of the city museum  to my examination of the mummyyou know the one i mean i have  permission to unswathe it and open it if desirable a few friends only  will be presentyou of course the mummy is now at my house and we  shall begin to unroll it at eleven tonight             yours ever                     ponnonner  by the time i had reached the ponnonner it struck me that i was as wide awake as a man need be i leaped out of bed in an ecstacy overthrowing all in my way dressed myself with a rapidity truly marvellous and set off at the top of my speed for the doctors  there i found a very eager company assembled they had been awaiting me with much impatience the mummy was extended upon the diningtable and the moment i entered its examination was commenced  it was one of a pair brought several years previously by captain arthur sabretash a cousin of ponnonners from a tomb near eleithias in the lybian mountains a considerable distance above thebes on the nile the grottoes at this point although less magnificent than the theban sepulchres are of higher interest on account of affording more numerous illustrations of the private life of the egyptians the chamber from which our specimen was taken was said to be very rich in such illustrations the walls being completely covered with fresco paintings and basreliefs while statues vases and mosaic work of rich patterns indicated the vast wealth of the deceased  the treasure had been deposited in the museum precisely in the same condition in which captain sabretash had found itthat is to say the coffin had not been disturbed for eight years it had thus stood subject only externally to public inspection we had now therefore the complete mummy at our disposal and to those who are aware how very rarely the unransacked antique reaches our shores it will be evident at once that we had great reason to congratulate ourselves upon our good fortune  approaching the table i saw on it a large box or case nearly seven feet long and perhaps three feet wide by two feet and a half deep it was oblongnot coffinshaped the material was at first supposed to be the wood of the sycamore platanus but upon cutting into it we found it to be pasteboard or more properly papier mache composed of papyrus it was thickly ornamented with paintings representing funeral scenes and other mournful subjectsinterspersed among which in every variety of position were certain series of hieroglyphical characters intended no doubt for the name of the departed by good luck mr gliddon formed one of our party and he had no difficulty in translating the letters which were simply phonetic and represented the word allamistakeo  we had some difficulty in getting this case open without injury but having at length accomplished the task we came to a second coffinshaped and very considerably less in size than the exterior one but resembling it precisely in every other respect the interval between the two was filled with resin which had in some degree defaced the colors of the interior box  upon opening this latter which we did quite easily we arrived at a third case also coffinshaped and varying from the second one in no particular except in that of its material which was cedar and still emitted the peculiar and highly aromatic odor of that wood between the second and the third case there was no intervalthe one fitting accurately within the other  removing the third case we discovered and took out the body itself we had expected to find it as usual enveloped in frequent rolls or bandages of linen but in place of these we found a sort of sheath made of papyrus and coated with a layer of plaster thickly gilt and painted the paintings represented subjects connected with the various supposed duties of the soul and its presentation to different divinities with numerous identical human figures intended very probably as portraits of the persons embalmed extending from head to foot was a columnar or perpendicular inscription in phonetic hieroglyphics giving again his name and titles and the names and titles of his relations  around the neck thus ensheathed was a collar of cylindrical glass beads diverse in color and so arranged as to form images of deities of the scarabaeus etc with the winged globe around the small of the waist was a similar collar or belt  stripping off the papyrus we found the flesh in excellent preservation with no perceptible odor the color was reddish the skin was hard smooth and glossy the teeth and hair were in good condition the eyes it seemed had been removed and glass ones substituted which were very beautiful and wonderfully lifelike with the exception of somewhat too determined a stare the fingers and the nails were brilliantly gilded  mr gliddon was of opinion from the redness of the epidermis that the embalmment had been effected altogether by asphaltum but on scraping the surface with a steel instrument and throwing into the fire some of the powder thus obtained the flavor of camphor and other sweetscented gums became apparent  we searched the corpse very carefully for the usual openings through which the entrails are extracted but to our surprise we could discover none no member of the party was at that period aware that entire or unopened mummies are not infrequently met the brain it was customary to withdraw through the nose the intestines through an incision in the side the body was then shaved washed and salted then laid aside for several weeks when the operation of embalming properly so called began  as no trace of an opening could be found doctor ponnonner was preparing his instruments for dissection when i observed that it was then past two oclock hereupon it was agreed to postpone the internal examination until the next evening and we were about to separate for the present when some one suggested an experiment or two with the voltaic pile  the application of electricity to a mummy three or four thousand years old at the least was an idea if not very sage still sufficiently original and we all caught it at once about onetenth in earnest and ninetenths in jest we arranged a battery in the doctors study and conveyed thither the egyptian  it was only after much trouble that we succeeded in laying bare some portions of the temporal muscle which appeared of less stony rigidity than other parts of the frame but which as we had anticipated of course gave no indication of galvanic susceptibility when brought in contact with the wire this the first trial indeed seemed decisive and with a hearty laugh at our own absurdity we were bidding each other good night when my eyes happening to fall upon those of the mummy were there immediately riveted in amazement my brief glance in fact had sufficed to assure me that the orbs which we had all supposed to be glass and which were originally noticeable for a certain wild stare were now so far covered by the lids that only a small portion of the tunica albuginea remained visible  with a shout i called attention to the fact and it became immediately obvious to all  i cannot say that i was alarmed at the phenomenon because alarmed is in my case not exactly the word it is possible however that but for the brown stout i might have been a little nervous as for the rest of the company they really made no attempt at concealing the downright fright which possessed them doctor ponnonner was a man to be pitied mr gliddon by some peculiar process rendered himself invisible mr silk buckingham i fancy will scarcely be so bold as to deny that he made his way upon all fours under the table  after the first shock of astonishment however we resolved as a matter of course upon further experiment forthwith our operations were now directed against the great toe of the right foot we made an incision over the outside of the exterior os sesamoideum pollicis pedis and thus got at the root of the abductor muscle readjusting the battery we now applied the fluid to the bisected nerveswhen with a movement of exceeding lifelikeness the mummy first drew up its right knee so as to bring it nearly in contact with the abdomen and then straightening the limb with inconceivable force bestowed a kick upon doctor ponnonner which had the effect of discharging that gentleman like an arrow from a catapult through a window into the street below  we rushed out en masse to bring in the mangled remains of the victim but had the happiness to meet him upon the staircase coming up in an unaccountable hurry brimful of the most ardent philosophy and more than ever impressed with the necessity of prosecuting our experiment with vigor and with zeal  it was by his advice accordingly that we made upon the spot a profound incision into the tip of the subjects nose while the doctor himself laying violent hands upon it pulled it into vehement contact with the wire  morally and physicallyfiguratively and literallywas the effect electric in the first place the corpse opened its eyes and winked very rapidly for several minutes as does mr barnes in the pantomime in the second place it sneezed in the third it sat upon end in the fourth it shook its fist in doctor ponnonners face in the fifth turning to messieurs gliddon and buckingham it addressed them in very capital egyptian thus  i must say gentlemen that i am as much surprised as i am mortified at your behavior of doctor ponnonner nothing better was to be expected he is a poor little fat fool who knows no better i pity and forgive him but you mr gliddonand you silkwho have travelled and resided in egypt until one might imagine you to the manner bornyou i say who have been so much among us that you speak egyptian fully as well i think as you write your mother tongueyou whom i have always been led to regard as the firm friend of the mummiesi really did anticipate more gentlemanly conduct from you what am i to think of your standing quietly by and seeing me thus unhandsomely used what am i to suppose by your permitting tom dick and harry to strip me of my coffins and my clothes in this wretchedly cold climate in what light to come to the point am i to regard your aiding and abetting that miserable little villain doctor ponnonner in pulling me by the nose  it will be taken for granted no doubt that upon hearing this speech under the circumstances we all either made for the door or fell into violent hysterics or went off in a general swoon one of these three things was i say to be expected indeed each and all of these lines of conduct might have been very plausibly pursued and upon my word i am at a loss to know how or why it was that we pursued neither the one nor the other but perhaps the true reason is to be sought in the spirit of the age which proceeds by the rule of contraries altogether and is now usually admitted as the solution of every thing in the way of paradox and impossibility or perhaps after all it was only the mummys exceedingly natural and matterofcourse air that divested his words of the terrible however this may be the facts are clear and no member of our party betrayed any very particular trepidation or seemed to consider that any thing had gone very especially wrong  for my part i was convinced it was all right and merely stepped aside out of the range of the egyptians fist doctor ponnonner thrust his hands into his breeches pockets looked hard at the mummy and grew excessively red in the face mr glidden stroked his whiskers and drew up the collar of his shirt mr buckingham hung down his head and put his right thumb into the left corner of his mouth  the egyptian regarded him with a severe countenance for some minutes and at length with a sneer said  why dont you speak mr buckingham did you hear what i asked you or not do take your thumb out of your mouth  mr buckingham hereupon gave a slight start took his right thumb out of the left corner of his mouth and by way of indemnification inserted his left thumb in the right corner of the aperture abovementioned  not being able to get an answer from mr b the figure turned peevishly to mr gliddon and in a peremptory tone demanded in general terms what we all meant  mr gliddon replied at great length in phonetics and but for the deficiency of american printingoffices in hieroglyphical type it would afford me much pleasure to record here in the original the whole of his very excellent speech  i may as well take this occasion to remark that all the subsequent conversation in which the mummy took a part was carried on in primitive egyptian through the medium so far as concerned myself and other untravelled members of the companythrough the medium i say of messieurs gliddon and buckingham as interpreters these gentlemen spoke the mother tongue of the mummy with inimitable fluency and grace but i could not help observing that owing no doubt to the introduction of images entirely modern and of course entirely novel to the stranger the two travellers were reduced occasionally to the employment of sensible forms for the purpose of conveying a particular meaning mr gliddon at one period for example could not make the egyptian comprehend the term politics until he sketched upon the wall with a bit of charcoal a little carbunclenosed gentleman out at elbows standing upon a stump with his left leg drawn back right arm thrown forward with his fist shut the eyes rolled up toward heaven and the mouth open at an angle of ninety degrees just in the same way mr buckingham failed to convey the absolutely modern idea wig until at doctor ponnonners suggestion he grew very pale in the face and consented to take off his own  it will be readily understood that mr gliddons discourse turned chiefly upon the vast benefits accruing to science from the unrolling and disembowelling of mummies apologizing upon this score for any disturbance that might have been occasioned him in particular the individual mummy called allamistakeo and concluding with a mere hint for it could scarcely be considered more that as these little matters were now explained it might be as well to proceed with the investigation intended here doctor ponnonner made ready his instruments  in regard to the latter suggestions of the orator it appears that allamistakeo had certain scruples of conscience the nature of which i did not distinctly learn but he expressed himself satisfied with the apologies tendered and getting down from the table shook hands with the company all round  when this ceremony was at an end we immediately busied ourselves in repairing the damages which our subject had sustained from the scalpel we sewed up the wound in his temple bandaged his foot and applied a square inch of black plaster to the tip of his nose  it was now observed that the count this was the title it seems of allamistakeo had a slight fit of shiveringno doubt from the cold the doctor immediately repaired to his wardrobe and soon returned with a black dress coat made in jennings best manner a pair of skyblue plaid pantaloons with straps a pink gingham chemise a flapped vest of brocade a white sack overcoat a walking cane with a hook a hat with no brim patentleather boots strawcolored kid gloves an eyeglass a pair of whiskers and a waterfall cravat owing to the disparity of size between the count and the doctor the proportion being as two to one there was some little difficulty in adjusting these habiliments upon the person of the egyptian but when all was arranged he might have been said to be dressed mr gliddon therefore gave him his arm and led him to a comfortable chair by the fire while the doctor rang the bell upon the spot and ordered a supply of cigars and wine  the conversation soon grew animated much curiosity was of course expressed in regard to the somewhat remarkable fact of allamistakeos still remaining alive  i should have thought observed mr buckingham that it is high time you were dead  why replied the count very much astonished i am little more than seven hundred years old my father lived a thousand and was by no means in his dotage when he died  here ensued a brisk series of questions and computations by means of which it became evident that the antiquity of the mummy had been grossly misjudged it had been five thousand and fifty years and some months since he had been consigned to the catacombs at eleithias  but my remark resumed mr buckingham had no reference to your age at the period of interment i am willing to grant in fact that you are still a young man and my illusion was to the immensity of time during which by your own showing you must have been done up in asphaltum  in what said the count  in asphaltum persisted mr b  ah yes i have some faint notion of what you mean it might be made to answer no doubtbut in my time we employed scarcely any thing else than the bichloride of mercury  but what we are especially at a loss to understand said doctor ponnonner is how it happens that having been dead and buried in egypt five thousand years ago you are here today all alive and looking so delightfully well  had i been as you say dead replied the count it is more than probable that dead i should still be for i perceive you are yet in the infancy of calvanism and cannot accomplish with it what was a common thing among us in the old days but the fact is i fell into catalepsy and it was considered by my best friends that i was either dead or should be they accordingly embalmed me at oncei presume you are aware of the chief principle of the embalming process  why not altogether  why i perceivea deplorable condition of ignorance well i cannot enter into details just now but it is necessary to explain that to embalm properly speaking in egypt was to arrest indefinitely all the animal functions subjected to the process i use the word animal in its widest sense as including the physical not more than the moral and vital being i repeat that the leading principle of embalmment consisted with us in the immediately arresting and holding in perpetual abeyance all the animal functions subjected to the process to be brief in whatever condition the individual was at the period of embalmment in that condition he remained now as it is my good fortune to be of the blood of the scarabaeus i was embalmed alive as you see me at present  the blood of the scarabaeus exclaimed doctor ponnonner  yes the scarabaeus was the insignium or the arms of a very distinguished and very rare patrician family to be of the blood of the scarabaeus is merely to be one of that family of which the scarabaeus is the insignium i speak figuratively  but what has this to do with you being alive  why it is the general custom in egypt to deprive a corpse before embalmment of its bowels and brains the race of the scarabaei alone did not coincide with the custom had i not been a scarabeus therefore i should have been without bowels and brains and without either it is inconvenient to live  i perceive that said mr buckingham and i presume that all the entire mummies that come to hand are of the race of scarabaei  beyond doubt  i thought said mr gliddon very meekly that the scarabaeus was one of the egyptian gods  one of the egyptian what exclaimed the mummy starting to its feet  gods repeated the traveller  mr gliddon i really am astonished to hear you talk in this style said the count resuming his chair no nation upon the face of the earth has ever acknowledged more than one god the scarabaeus the ibis etc were with us as similar creatures have been with others the symbols or media through which we offered worship to the creator too august to be more directly approached  there was here a pause at length the colloquy was renewed by doctor ponnonner  it is not improbable then from what you have explained said he that among the catacombs near the nile there may exist other mummies of the scarabaeus tribe in a condition of vitality  there can be no question of it replied the count all the scarabaei embalmed accidentally while alive are alive now even some of those purposely so embalmed may have been overlooked by their executors and still remain in the tomb  will you be kind enough to explain i said what you mean by purposely so embalmed  with great pleasure answered the mummy after surveying me leisurely through his eyeglassfor it was the first time i had ventured to address him a direct question  with great pleasure he said the usual duration of mans life in my time was about eight hundred years few men died unless by most extraordinary accident before the age of six hundred few lived longer than a decade of centuries but eight were considered the natural term after the discovery of the embalming principle as i have already described it to you it occurred to our philosophers that a laudable curiosity might be gratified and at the same time the interests of science much advanced by living this natural term in installments in the case of history indeed experience demonstrated that something of this kind was indispensable an historian for example having attained the age of five hundred would write a book with great labor and then get himself carefully embalmed leaving instructions to his executors pro tem that they should cause him to be revivified after the lapse of a certain periodsay five or six hundred years resuming existence at the expiration of this time he would invariably find his great work converted into a species of haphazard notebookthat is to say into a kind of literary arena for the conflicting guesses riddles and personal squabbles of whole herds of exasperated commentators these guesses etc which passed under the name of annotations or emendations were found so completely to have enveloped distorted and overwhelmed the text that the author had to go about with a lantern to discover his own book when discovered it was never worth the trouble of the search after rewriting it throughout it was regarded as the bounden duty of the historian to set himself to work immediately in correcting from his own private knowledge and experience the traditions of the day concerning the epoch at which he had originally lived now this process of rescription and personal rectification pursued by various individual sages from time to time had the effect of preventing our history from degenerating into absolute fable  i beg your pardon said doctor ponnonner at this point laying his hand gently upon the arm of the egyptiani beg your pardon sir but may i presume to interrupt you for one moment  by all means sir replied the count drawing up  i merely wished to ask you a question said the doctor you mentioned the historians personal correction of traditions respecting his own epoch pray sir upon an average what proportion of these kabbala were usually found to be right  the kabbala as you properly term them sir were generally discovered to be precisely on a par with the facts recorded in the unrewritten histories themselvesthat is to say not one individual iota of either was ever known under any circumstances to be not totally and radically wrong  but since it is quite clear resumed the doctor that at least five thousand years have elapsed since your entombment i take it for granted that your histories at that period if not your traditions were sufficiently explicit on that one topic of universal interest the creation which took place as i presume you are aware only about ten centuries before  sir said the count allamistakeo  the doctor repeated his remarks but it was only after much additional explanation that the foreigner could be made to comprehend them the latter at length said hesitatingly  the ideas you have suggested are to me i confess utterly novel during my time i never knew any one to entertain so singular a fancy as that the universe or this world if you will have it so ever had a beginning at all i remember once and once only hearing something remotely hinted by a man of many speculations concerning the origin of the human race and by this individual the very word adam or red earth which you make use of was employed he employed it however in a generical sense with reference to the spontaneous germination from rank soil just as a thousand of the lower genera of creatures are germinatedthe spontaneous germination i say of five vast hordes of men simultaneously upspringing in five distinct and nearly equal divisions of the globe  here in general the company shrugged their shoulders and one or two of us touched our foreheads with a very significant air mr silk buckingham first glancing slightly at the occiput and then at the sinciput of allamistakeo spoke as follows  the long duration of human life in your time together with the occasional practice of passing it as you have explained in installments must have had indeed a strong tendency to the general development and conglomeration of knowledge i presume therefore that we are to attribute the marked inferiority of the old egyptians in all particulars of science when compared with the moderns and more especially with the yankees altogether to the superior solidity of the egyptian skull  i confess again replied the count with much suavity that i am somewhat at a loss to comprehend you pray to what particulars of science do you allude  here our whole party joining voices detailed at great length the assumptions of phrenology and the marvels of animal magnetism  having heard us to an end the count proceeded to relate a few anecdotes which rendered it evident that prototypes of gall and spurzheim had flourished and faded in egypt so long ago as to have been nearly forgotten and that the manoeuvres of mesmer were really very contemptible tricks when put in collation with the positive miracles of the theban savans who created lice and a great many other similar things  i here asked the count if his people were able to calculate eclipses he smiled rather contemptuously and said they were  this put me a little out but i began to make other inquiries in regard to his astronomical knowledge when a member of the company who had never as yet opened his mouth whispered in my ear that for information on this head i had better consult ptolemy whoever ptolemy is as well as one plutarch de facie lunae  i then questioned the mummy about burningglasses and lenses and in general about the manufacture of glass but i had not made an end of my queries before the silent member again touched me quietly on the elbow and begged me for gods sake to take a peep at diodorus siculus as for the count he merely asked me in the way of reply if we moderns possessed any such microscopes as would enable us to cut cameos in the style of the egyptians while i was thinking how i should answer this question little doctor ponnonner committed himself in a very extraordinary way  look at our architecture he exclaimed greatly to the indignation of both the travellers who pinched him black and blue to no purpose  look he cried with enthusiasm at the bowlinggreen fountain in new york or if this be too vast a contemplation regard for a moment the capitol at washington d cand the good little medical man went on to detail very minutely the proportions of the fabric to which he referred he explained that the portico alone was adorned with no less than four and twenty columns five feet in diameter and ten feet apart  the count said that he regretted not being able to remember just at that moment the precise dimensions of any one of the principal buildings of the city of aznac whose foundations were laid in the night of time but the ruins of which were still standing at the epoch of his entombment in a vast plain of sand to the westward of thebes he recollected however talking of the porticoes that one affixed to an inferior palace in a kind of suburb called carnac consisted of a hundred and fortyfour columns thirtyseven feet in circumference and twentyfive feet apart the approach to this portico from the nile was through an avenue two miles long composed of sphynxes statues and obelisks twenty sixty and a hundred feet in height the palace itself as well as he could remember was in one direction two miles long and might have been altogether about seven in circuit its walls were richly painted all over within and without with hieroglyphics he would not pretend to assert that even fifty or sixty of the doctors capitols might have been built within these walls but he was by no means sure that two or three hundred of them might not have been squeezed in with some trouble that palace at carnac was an insignificant little building after all he the count however could not conscientiously refuse to admit the ingenuity magnificence and superiority of the fountain at the bowling green as described by the doctor nothing like it he was forced to allow had ever been seen in egypt or elsewhere  i here asked the count what he had to say to our railroads  nothing he replied in particular they were rather slight rather illconceived and clumsily put together they could not be compared of course with the vast level direct irongrooved causeways upon which the egyptians conveyed entire temples and solid obelisks of a hundred and fifty feet in altitude  i spoke of our gigantic mechanical forces  he agreed that we knew something in that way but inquired how i should have gone to work in getting up the imposts on the lintels of even the little palace at carnac  this question i concluded not to hear and demanded if he had any idea of artesian wells but he simply raised his eyebrows while mr gliddon winked at me very hard and said in a low tone that one had been recently discovered by the engineers employed to bore for water in the great oasis  i then mentioned our steel but the foreigner elevated his nose and asked me if our steel could have executed the sharp carved work seen on the obelisks and which was wrought altogether by edgetools of copper  this disconcerted us so greatly that we thought it advisable to vary the attack to metaphysics we sent for a copy of a book called the dial and read out of it a chapter or two about something that is not very clear but which the bostonians call the great movement of progress  the count merely said that great movements were awfully common things in his day and as for progress it was at one time quite a nuisance but it never progressed  we then spoke of the great beauty and importance of democracy and were at much trouble in impressing the count with a due sense of the advantages we enjoyed in living where there was suffrage ad libitum and no king  he listened with marked interest and in fact seemed not a little amused when we had done he said that a great while ago there had occurred something of a very similar sort thirteen egyptian provinces determined all at once to be free and to set a magnificent example to the rest of mankind they assembled their wise men and concocted the most ingenious constitution it is possible to conceive for a while they managed remarkably well only their habit of bragging was prodigious the thing ended however in the consolidation of the thirteen states with some fifteen or twenty others in the most odious and insupportable despotism that was ever heard of upon the face of the earth  i asked what was the name of the usurping tyrant  as well as the count could recollect it was mob  not knowing what to say to this i raised my voice and deplored the egyptian ignorance of steam  the count looked at me with much astonishment but made no answer the silent gentleman however gave me a violent nudge in the ribs with his elbowstold me i had sufficiently exposed myself for onceand demanded if i was really such a fool as not to know that the modern steamengine is derived from the invention of hero through solomon de caus  we were now in imminent danger of being discomfited but as good luck would have it doctor ponnonner having rallied returned to our rescue and inquired if the people of egypt would seriously pretend to rival the moderns in the allimportant particular of dress  the count at this glanced downward to the straps of his pantaloons and then taking hold of the end of one of his coattails held it up close to his eyes for some minutes letting it fall at last his mouth extended itself very gradually from ear to ear but i do not remember that he said any thing in the way of reply  hereupon we recovered our spirits and the doctor approaching the mummy with great dignity desired it to say candidly upon its honor as a gentleman if the egyptians had comprehended at any period the manufacture of either ponnonners lozenges or brandreths pills  we looked with profound anxiety for an answerbut in vain it was not forthcoming the egyptian blushed and hung down his head never was triumph more consummate never was defeat borne with so ill a grace indeed i could not endure the spectacle of the poor mummys mortification i reached my hat bowed to him stiffly and took leave  upon getting home i found it past four oclock and went immediately to bed it is now ten am i have been up since seven penning these memoranda for the benefit of my family and of mankind the former i shall behold no more my wife is a shrew the truth is i am heartily sick of this life and of the nineteenth century in general i am convinced that every thing is going wrong besides i am anxious to know who will be president in 2045 as soon therefore as i shave and swallow a cup of coffee i shall just step over to ponnonners and get embalmed for a couple of hundred years     the poetic principle  in speaking of the poetic principle i have no design to be either thorough or profound while discussing very much at random the essentiality of what we call poetry my principal purpose will be to cite for consideration some few of those minor english or american poems which best suit my own taste or which upon my own fancy have left the most definite impression by minor poems i mean of course poems of little length and here in the beginning permit me to say a few words in regard to a somewhat peculiar principle which whether rightfully or wrongfully has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of the poem i hold that a long poem does not exist i maintain that the phrase a long poem is simply a flat contradiction in terms  i need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as it excites by elevating the soul the value of the poem is in the ratio of this elevating excitement but all excitements are through a psychal necessity transient that degree of excitement which would entitle a poem to be so called at all cannot be sustained throughout a composition of any great length after the lapse of half an hour at the very utmost it flagsfailsa revulsion ensuesand then the poem is in effect and in fact no longer such  there are no doubt many who have found difficulty in reconciling the critical dictum that the paradise lost is to be devoutly admired throughout with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it during perusal the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictum would demand this great work in fact is to be regarded as poetical only when losing sight of that vital requisite in all works of art unity we view it merely as a series of minor poems if to preserve its unityits totality of effect or impressionwe read it as would be necessary at a single sitting the result is but a constant alternation of excitement and depression after a passage of what we feel to be true poetry there follows inevitably a passage of platitude which no critical prejudgment can force us to admire but if upon completing the work we read it again omitting the first bookthat is to say commencing with the secondwe shall be surprised at now finding that admirable which we before condemnedthat damnable which we had previously so much admired it follows from all this that the ultimate aggregate or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun is a nullityand this is precisely the fact  in regard to the iliad we have if not positive proof at least very good reason for believing it intended as a series of lyrics but granting the epic intention i can say only that the work is based in an imperfect sense of art the modern epic is of the supposititious ancient model but an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation but the day of these artistic anomalies is over if at any time any very long poem were popular in reality which i doubt it is at least clear that no very long poem will ever be popular again  that the extent of a poetical work is ceteris paribus the measure of its merit seems undoubtedly when we thus state it a proposition sufficiently absurdyet we are indebted for it to the quarterly reviews surely there can be nothing in mere size abstractly consideredthere can be nothing in mere bulk so far as a volume is concerned which has so continuously elicited admiration from these saturnine pamphlets a mountain to be sure by the mere sentiment of physical magnitude which it conveys does impress us with a sense of the sublimebut no man is impressed after this fashion by the material grandeur of even the columbiad even the quarterlies have not instructed us to be so impressed by it as yet they have not insisted on our estimating lamar tine by the cubic foot or pollock by the poundbut what else are we to infer from their continual plating about sustained effort if by sustained effort any little gentleman has accomplished an epic let us frankly commend him for the effortif this indeed be a thing conk mendablebut let us forbear praising the epic on the efforts account it is to be hoped that common sense in the time to come will prefer deciding upon a work of art rather by the impression it makesby the effect it producesthan by the time it took to impress the effect or by the amount of sustained effort which had been found necessary in effecting the impression the fact is that perseverance is one thing and genius quite anothernor can all the quarterlies in christendom confound them by and by this proposition with many which i have been just urging will be received as selfevident in the meantime by being generally condemned as falsities they will not be essentially damaged as truths  on the other hand it is clear that a poem may be improperly brief undue brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism a very short poem while now and then producing a brilliant or vivid never produces a profound or enduring effect there must be the steady pressing down of the stamp upon the wax de beranger has wrought innumerable things pungent and spiritstirring but in general they have been too imponderous to stamp themselves deeply into the public attention and thus as so many feathers of fancy have been blown aloft only to be whistled down the wind  a remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing a poem in keeping it out of the popular view is afforded by the following exquisite little serenade       i arise from dreams of thee          in the first sweet sleep of night      when the winds are breathing low          and the stars are shining bright      i arise from dreams of thee          and a spirit in my feet      has led mewho knows how          to thy chamberwindow sweet       the wandering airs they faint          on the dark the silent stream      the champak odors fail          like sweet thoughts in a dream      the nightingales complaint          it dies upon her heart      as i must die on shine          o beloved as thou art       o lift me from the grass          i die i faint i fail      let thy love in kisses rain          on my lips and eyelids pale      my cheek is cold and white alas          my heart beats loud and fast      o press it close to shine again          where it will break at last  very few perhaps are familiar with these linesyet no less a poet than shelley is their author their warm yet delicate and ethereal imagination will be appreciated by all but by none so thoroughly as by him who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in the aromatic air of a southern midsummer night  one of the finest poems by willisthe very best in my opinion which he has ever writtenhas no doubt through this same defect of undue brevity been kept back from its proper position not less in the       the shadows lay along broadway          twas near the twilighttide      and slowly there a lady fair          was walking in her pride      alone walkd she but viewlessly          walkd spirits at her side       peace charmd the street beneath her feet          and honor charmd the air      and all astir looked kind on her          and called her good as fair      for all god ever gave to her          she kept with chary care       she kept with care her beauties rare          from lovers warm and true      for heart was cold to all but gold          and the rich came not to won      but honord well her charms to sell          if priests the selling do       now walking there was one more fair          a slight girl lilypale      and she had unseen company          to make the spirit quail      twixt want and scorn she walkd forlorn          and nothing could avail       no mercy now can clear her brow          from this worlds peace to pray      for as loves wild prayer dissolved in air          her womans heart gave way      but the sin forgiven by christ in heaven          by man is cursed alway  in this composition we find it difficult to recognize the willis who has written so many mere verses of society the lines are not only richly ideal but full of energy while they breathe an earnestness an evident sincerity of sentiment for which we look in vain throughout all the other works of this author  while the epic mania while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixity is indispensable has for some years past been gradually dying out of the public mind by mere dint of its own absurdity we find it succeeded by a heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated but one which in the brief period it has already endured may be said to have accomplished more in the corruption of our poetical literature than all its other enemies combined i allude to the heresy of the didactic it has been assumed tacitly and avowedly directly and indirectly that the ultimate object of all poetry is truth every poem it is said should inculcate a morals and by this moral is the poetical merit of the work to be adjudged we americans especially have patronized this happy idea and we bostonians very especially have developed it in full we have taken it into our heads that to write a poem simply for the poems sake and to acknowledge such to have been our design would be to confess ourselves radically wanting in the true poetic dignity and forcebut the simple fact is that would we but permit ourselves to look into our own souls we should immediately there discover that under the sun there neither exists nor can exist any work more thoroughly dignified more supremely noble than this very poem this poem per se this poem which is a poem and nothing more this poem written solely for the poems sake  with as deep a reverence for the true as ever inspired the bosom of man i would nevertheless limit in some measure its modes of inculcation i would limit to enforce them i would not enfeeble them by dissipation the demands of truth are severe she has no sympathy with the myrtles all that which is so indispensable in song is precisely all that with which she has nothing whatever to do it is but making her a flaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers in enforcing a truth we need severity rather than efflorescence of language we must be simple precise terse we must be cool calm unimpassioned in a word we must be in that mood which as nearly as possible is the exact converse of the poetical he must be blind indeed who does not perceive the radical and chasmal difference between the truthful and the poetical modes of inculcation he must be theorymad beyond redemption who in spite of these differences shall still persist in attempting to reconcile the obstinate oils and waters of poetry and truth  dividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious distinctions we have the pure intellect taste and the moral sense i place taste in the middle because it is just this position which in the mind it occupies it holds intimate relations with either extreme but from the moral sense is separated by so faint a difference that aristotle has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the virtues themselves nevertheless we find the offices of the trio marked with a sufficient distinction just as the intellect concerns itself with truth so taste informs us of the beautiful while the moral sense is regardful of duty of this latter while conscience teaches the obligation and reason the expediency taste contents herself with displaying the charmswaging war upon vice solely on the ground of her deformityher disproportionher animosity to the fitting to the appropriate to the harmoniousin a word to beauty  an immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a sense of the beautiful this it is which administers to his delight in the manifold forms and sounds and odors and sentiments amid which he exists and just as the lily is repeated in the lake or the eyes of amaryllis in the mirror so is the mere oral or written repetition of these forms and sounds and colors and odors and sentiments a duplicate source of the light but this mere repetition is not poetry he who shall simply sing with however glowing enthusiasm or with however vivid a truth of description of the sights and sounds and odors and colors and sentiments which greet him in common with all mankindhe i say has yet failed to prove his divine title there is still a something in the distance which he has been unable to attain we have still a thirst unquenchable to allay which he has not shown us the crystal springs this thirst belongs to the immortality of man it is at once a consequence and an indication of his perennial existence it is the desire of the moth for the star it is no mere appreciation of the beauty before us but a wild effort to reach the beauty above inspired by an ecstatic prescience of the glories beyond the grave we struggle by multiform combinations among the things and thoughts of time to attain a portion of that loveliness whose very elements perhaps appertain to eternity alone and thus when by poetry or when by music the most entrancing of the poetic moods we find ourselves melted into tears we weep then not as the abbate gravina supposes through excess of pleasure but through a certain petulant impatient sorrow at our inability to grasp now wholly here on earth at once and for ever those divine and rapturous joys of which through the poem or through the music we attain to but brief and indeterminate glimpses  the struggle to apprehend the supernal lovelinessthis struggle on the part of souls fittingly constitutedhas given to the world all that which it the world has ever been enabled at once to understand and to feel as poetic  the poetic sentiment of course may develop itself in various modesin painting in sculpture in architecture in the dancevery especially in musicand very peculiarly and with a wide field in the com position of the landscape garden our present theme however has regard only to its manifestation in words and here let me speak briefly on the topic of rhythm contenting myself with the certainty that music in its various modes of metre rhythm and rhyme is of so vast a moment in poetry as never to be wisely rejectedis so vitally important an adjunct that he is simply silly who declines its assistance i will not now pause to maintain its absolute essentiality it is in music perhaps that the soul most nearly attains the great end for which when inspired by the poetic sentiment it strugglesthe creation of supernal beauty it may be indeed that here this sublime end is now and then attained in fact we are often made to feel with a shivering delight that from an earthly harp are stricken notes which cannot have been unfamiliar to the angels and thus there can be little doubt that in the union of poetry with music in its popular sense we shall find the widest field for the poetic development the old bards and minnesingers had advantages which we do not possessand thomas moore singing his own songs was in the most legitimate manner perfecting them as poems  to recapitulate theni would define in brief the poetry of words as the rhythmical creation of beauty its sole arbiter is taste with the intellect or with the conscience it has only collateral relations unless incidentally it has no concern whatever either with duty or with truth  a few words however in explanation that pleasure which is at once the most pure the most elevating and the most intense is derived i maintain from the contemplation of the beautiful in the contemplation of beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable elevation or excitement of the soul which we recognize as the poetic sentiment and which is so easily distinguished from truth which is the satisfaction of the reason or from passion which is the excitement of the heart i make beauty thereforeusing the word as inclusive of the sublimei make beauty the province of the poem simply because it is an obvious rule of art that effects should be made to spring as directly as possible from their causesno one as yet having been weak enough to deny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least most readily attainable in the poem it by no means follows however that the incitements of passion or the precepts of duty or even the lessons of truth may not be introduced into a poem and with advantage for they may subserve incidentally in various ways the general purposes of the work but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down in proper subjection to that beauty which is the atmosphere and the real essence of the poem  i cannot better introduce the few poems which i shall present for your consideration than by the citation of the proem to longfellows waif       the day is done and the darkness          falls from the wings of night      as a feather is wafted downward          from an eagle in his flight       i see the lights of the village          gleam through the rain and the mist      and a feeling of sadness comes oer me          that my soul cannot resist       a feeling of sadness and longing          that is not akin to pain      and resembles sorrow only          as the mist resembles the rain       come read to me some poem          some simple and heartfelt lay      that shall soothe this restless feeling          and banish the thoughts of day       not from the grand old masters          not from the bards sublime      whose distant footsteps echo          through the corridors of time       for like strains of martial music          their mighty thoughts suggest      lifes endless toil and endeavor          and tonight i long for rest       read from some humbler poet          whose songs gushed from his heart      as showers from the clouds of summer          or tears from the eyelids start       who through long days of labor          and nights devoid of ease      still heard in his soul the music          of wonderful melodies       such songs have power to quiet          the restless pulse of care      and come like the benediction          that follows after prayer       then read from the treasured volume          the poem of thy choice      and lend to the rhyme of the poet          the beauty of thy voice       and the night shall be filled with music          and the cares that infest the day      shall fold their tents like the arabs          and as silently steal away  with no great range of imagination these lines have been justly admired for their delicacy of expression some of the images are very effective nothing can be better than      the bards sublime          whose distant footsteps echo      down the corridors of time  the idea of the last quatrain is also very effective the poem on the whole however is chiefly to be admired for the graceful insouciance of its metre so well in accordance with the character of the sentiments and especially for the ease of the general manner this ease or naturalness in a literary style it has long been the fashion to regard as ease in appearance aloneas a point of really difficult attainment but not soa natural manner is difficult only to him who should never meddle with itto the unnatural it is but the result of writing with the understanding or with the instinct that the tone in composition should always be that which the mass of mankind would adoptand must perpetually vary of course with the occasion the author who after the fashion of the north american review should be upon all occasions merely quiet must necessarily upon many occasions be simply silly or stupid and has no more right to be considered easy or natural than a cockney exquisite or than the sleeping beauty in the waxworks  among the minor poems of bryant none has so much impressed me as the one which he entitles june i quote only a portion of it       there through the long long summer hours          the golden light should lie      and thick young herbs and groups of flowers          stand in their beauty by      the oriole should build and tell      his lovetale close beside my cell          the idle butterfly      should rest him there and there be heard      the housewifebee and humming bird       and what if cheerful shouts at noon          come from the village sent      or songs of maids beneath the moon          with fairy laughter blent      and what if in the evening light      betrothed lovers walk in sight          of my low monument      i would the lovely scene around      might know no sadder sight nor sound       i know i know i should not see          the seasons glorious show      nor would its brightness shine for me          nor its wild music flow      but if around my place of sleep      the friends i love should come to weep          they might not haste to go      soft airs and song and the light and bloom      should keep them lingering by my tomb       these to their softend hearts should bear          the thoughts of what has been      and speak of one who cannot share          the gladness of the scene      whose part in all the pomp that fills      the circuit of the summer hills          isthat his grave is green      and deeply would their hearts rejoice      to hear again his living voice  the rhythmical flow here is even voluptuousnothing could be more melodious the poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner the intense melancholy which seems to well up perforce to the surface of all the poets cheerful sayings about his grave we find thrilling us to the soulwhile there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill the impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness and if in the remaining compositions which i shall introduce to you there be more or less of a similar tone always apparent let me remind you that how or why we know not this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connected with all the higher manifestations of true beauty it is nevertheless       a feeling of sadness and longing          that is not akin to pain      and resembles sorrow only          as the mist resembles the rain  the taint of which i speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full of brilliancy and spirit as the health of edward coate pinckney       i fill this cup to one made up          of loveliness alone      a woman of her gentle sex          the seeming paragon      to whom the better elements          and kindly stars have given      a form so fair that like the air          tis less of earth than heaven       her every tone is musics own          like those of morning birds      and something more than melody          dwells ever in her words      the coinage of her heart are they          and from her lips each flows      as one may see the burdend bee          forth issue from the rose       affections are as thoughts to her          the measures of her hours      her feelings have the flagrancy          the freshness of young flowers      and lovely passions changing oft          so fill her she appears      the image of themselves by turns          the idol of past years       of her bright face one glance will trace          a picture on the brain      and of her voice in echoing hearts          a sound must long remain      but memory such as mine of her          so very much endears      when death is nigh my latest sigh          will not be lifes but hers       i filld this cup to one made up          of loveliness alone      a woman of her gentle sex          the seeming paragon      her health and would on earth there stood          some more of such a frame      that life might be all poetry          and weariness a name  it was the misfortune of mr pinckney to have been born too far south had he been a new englander it is probable that he would have been ranked as the first of american lyrists by that magnanimous cabal which has so long controlled the destinies of american letters in conducting the thing called the north american review the poem just cited is especially beautiful but the poetic elevation which it induces we must refer chiefly to our sympathy in the poets enthusiasm we pardon his hyperboles for the evident earnestness with which they are uttered  it was by no means my design however to expatiate upon the merits of what i should read you these will necessarily speak for themselves boccalini in his advertisements from parnassus tells us that zoilus once presented apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very admirable bookwhereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the work he replied that he only busied himself about the errors on hearing this apollo handing him a sack of unwinnowed wheat bade him pick out all the chaff for his reward  now this fable answers very well as a hit at the criticsbut i am by no means sure that the god was in the right i am by no means certain that the true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood excellence in a poem especially may be considered in the light of an axiom which need only be properly put to become selfevident it is not excellence if it require to be demonstrated as suchand thus to point out too particularly the merits of a work of art is to admit that they are not merits altogether  among the melodies of thomas moore is one whose distinguished character as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out of view i allude to his lines beginningcome rest in this bosom the intense energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in byron there are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that embodies the all in all of the divine passion of lovea sentiment which perhaps has found its echo in more and in more passionate human hearts than any other single sentiment ever embodied in words       come rest in this bosom my own stricken deer      though the herd have fled from thee thy home is still here      here still is the smile that no cloud can oercast      and a heart and a hand all thy own to the last       oh what was love made for if tis not the same      through joy and through torment through glory and shame      i know not i ask not if guilts in that heart      i but know that i love thee whatever thou art       thou hast calld me thy angel in moments of bliss      and thy angel ill be mid the horrors of this      through the furnace unshrinking thy steps to pursue      and shield thee and save theeor perish there too  it has been the fashion of late days to deny moore imagination while granting him fancya distinction originating with coleridgethan whom no man more fully comprehended the great powers of moore the fact is that the fancy of this poet so far predominates over all his other faculties and over the fancy of all other men as to have induced very naturally the idea that he is fanciful only but never was there a greater mistake never was a grosser wrong done the fame of a true poet in the compass of the english language i can call to mind no poem more profoundlymore weirdly imaginative in the best sense than the lines commencingi would i were by that dim lakewhich are the com position of thomas moore i regret that i am unable to remember them  one of the noblestand speaking of fancyone of the most singularly fanciful of modern poets was thomas hood his fair ines had always for me an inexpressible charm       o saw ye not fair ines          shes gone into the west      to dazzle when the sun is down          and rob the world of rest      she took our daylight with her          the smiles that we love best      with morning blushes on her cheek          and pearls upon her breast       o turn again fair ines          before the fall of night      for fear the moon should shine alone          and stars unrivalltd bright      and blessed will the lover be          that walks beneath their light      and breathes the love against thy cheek          i dare not even write       would i had been fair ines          that gallant cavalier      who rode so gaily by thy side          and whisperd thee so near      were there no bonny dames at home          or no true lovers here      that he should cross the seas to win          the dearest of the dear       i saw thee lovely ines          descend along the shore      with bands of noble gentlemen          and banners waved before      and gentle youth and maidens gay          and snowy plumes they wore      it would have been a beauteous dream          if it had been no more       alas alas fair ines          she went away with song      with music waiting on her steps          and shootings of the throng      but some were sad and felt no mirth          but only musics wrong      in sounds that sang farewell farewell          to her youve loved so long       farewell farewell fair ines          that vessel never bore      so fair a lady on its deck          nor danced so light before      alas for pleasure on the sea          and sorrow on the shorel      the smile that blest one lovers heart          has broken many

of this poem is no less remarkable than its pathos the versification although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the fantastic is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which is the thesis of the poem  among the minor poems of lord byron is one which has never received from the critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves       though the day of my destinys over          and the star of my fate bath declined      thy soft heart refused to discover          the faults which so many could find      though thy soul with my grief was acquainted          it shrunk not to share it with me      and the love which my spirit bath painted          it never bath found but in thee       then when nature around me is smiling          the last smile which answers to mine      i do not believe it beguiling          because it reminds me of shine      and when winds are at war with the ocean          as the breasts i believed in with me      if their billows excite an emotion          it is that they bear me from thee       though the rock of my last hope is shivered          and its fragments are sunk in the wave      though i feel that my soul is delivered          to painit shall not be its slave      there is many a pang to pursue me          they may crush but they shall not contemn      they may torture but shall not subdue me          tis of thee that i thinknot of them       though human thou didst not deceive me          though woman thou didst not forsake      though loved thou forborest to grieve me          though slandered thou never couldst shake      though trusted thou didst not disclaim me          though parted it was not to fly      though watchful twas not to defame me          nor mute that the world might belie       yet i blame not the world nor despise it          nor the war of the many with one      if my soul was not fitted to prize it          twas folly not sooner to shun      and if dearly that error bath cost me          and more than i once could foresee      i have found that whatever it lost me          it could not deprive me of thee       from the wreck of the past which bath perished          thus much i at least may recall      it bath taught me that which i most cherished          deserved to be dearest of all      in the desert a fountain is springing          in the wide waste there still is a tree      and a bird in the solitude singing         which speaks to my spirit of thee  although the rhythm here is one of the most difficult the versification could scarcely be improved no nobler theme ever engaged the pen of poet it is the soulelevating idea that no man can consider himself entitled to complain of fate while in his adversity he still retains the unwavering love of woman  from alfred tennyson although in perfect sincerity i regard him as the noblest poet that ever lived i have left myself time to cite only a very brief specimen i call him and think him the noblest of poets not because the impressions he produces are at all times the most profoundnot because the poetical excitement which he induces is at all times the most intensebut because it is at all times the most etherealin other words the most elevating and most pure no poet is so little of the earth earthy what i am about to read is from his last long poem the princess           tears idle tears i know not what they mean      tears from the depth of some divine despair      rise in the heart and gather to the eyes      in looking on the happy autumn fields      and thinking of the days that are no more           fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail      that brings our friends up from the underworld      sad as the last which reddens over one      that sinks with all we love below the verge      so sad so fresh the days that are no more           ah sad and strange as in dark summer dawns      the earliest pipe of halfawakend birds      to dying ears when unto dying eyes      the casement slowly grows a glimmering square      so sad so strange the days that are no more           dear as rememberd kisses after death      and sweet as those by hopeless fancy feignd      on lips that are for others deep as love      deep as first love and wild with all regret      o death in life the days that are no more  thus although in a very cursory and imperfect manner i have endeavored to convey to you my conception of the poetic principle it has been my purpose to suggest that while this principle itself is strictly and simply the human aspiration for supernal beauty the manifestation of the principle is always found in an elevating excitement of the soul quite independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the heart or of that truth which is the satisfaction of the reason for in regard to passion alas its tendency is to degrade rather than to elevate the soul love on the contrarylovethe true the divine erosthe uranian as distinguished from the diona an venusis unquestionably the purest and truest of all poetical themes and in regard to truth if to be sure through the attainment of a truth we are led to perceive a harmony where none was apparent before we experience at once the true poetical effect but this effect is referable to the harmony alone and not in the least degree to the truth which merely served to render the harmony manifest  we shall reach however more immediately a distinct conception of what the true poetry is by mere reference to a few of the simple elements which induce in the poet himself the poetical effect he recognizes the ambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine in heavenin the volutes of the flowerin the clustering of low shrubberiesin the waving of the grainfieldsin the slanting of tall eastern treesin the blue distance of mountainsin the grouping of cloudsin the twinkling of halfhidden brooksin the gleaming of silver riversin the repose of sequestered lakesin the starmirroring depths of lonely wells he perceives it in the songs of birdsin the harp of bolosin the sighing of the nightwindin the repining voice of the forestin the surf that complains to the shorein the fresh breath of the woodsin the scent of the violetin the voluptuous perfume of the hyacinthin the suggestive odour that comes to him at eventide from far distant undiscovered islands over dim oceans illimitable and unexplored he owns it in all noble thoughtsin all unworldly motivesin all holy impulsesin all chivalrous generous and selfsacrificing deeds he feels it in the beauty of womanin the grace of her stepin the lustre of her eyein the melody of her voicein her soft laughter in her sighin the harmony of the rustling of her robes he deeply feels it in her winning endearmentsin her burning enthusiasmsin her gentle charitiesin her meek and devotional endurancesbut above allah far above all he kneels to ithe worships it in the faith in the purity in the strength in the altogether divine majestyof her love  let me conclude bythe recitation of yet another brief poemone very different in character from any that i have before quoted it is by motherwell and is called the song of the cavalier with our modern and altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and impiety of warfare we are not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathize with the sentiments and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the poem to do this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul of the old cavalier       then mounte then mounte brave gallants all          and don your helmes amaine      deathes couriers fame and honor call          no shrewish teares shall fill your eye      when the swordhilts in our hand          heartwhole well part and no whit sighe      for the fayrest of the land          let piping swaine and craven wight      thus weepe and poling crye          our business is like men to fight     old english poetry   it should not be doubted that at least onethird of the affection with which we regard the elder poets of great britain should beattributed to what is in itself a thing apart from poetrywe mean to the simple love of the antiqueand that again a third of even the proper poetic sentiment inspired by their writings should be ascribed to a fact which while it has strict connection with poetry in the abstract and with the old british poems themselves should not be looked upon as a merit appertaining to the authors of the poems almost every devout admirer of the old bards if demanded his opinion of their productions would mention vaguely yet with perfect sincerity a sense of dreamy wild indefinite and he would perhaps say indefinable delight on being required to point out the source of this so shadowy pleasure he would be apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology and in general handling this quaintness is in fact a very powerful adjunct to ideality but in the case in question it arises independently of the authors will and is altogether apart from his intention words and their rhythm have varied verses which affect us today with a vivid delight and which delight in many instances may be traced to the one source quaintness must have worn in the days of their construction a very commonplace air this is of course no argument against the poems nowwe mean it only as against the poets thew there is a growing desire to overrate them the old english muse was frank guileless sincere and although very learned still learned without art no general error evinces a more thorough confusion of ideas than the error of supposing donne and cowley metaphysical in the sense wherein wordsworth and coleridge are so with the two former ethics were the endwith the two latter the means the poet of the creation wished by highly artificial verse to inculcate what he supposed to be moral truththe poet of the ancient mariner to infuse the poetic sentiment through channels suggested by analysis the one finished by complete failure what he commenced in the grossest misconception the other by a path which could not possibly lead him astray arrived at a triumph which is not the less glorious because hidden from the profane eyes of the multitude but in this view even the metaphysical verse of cowley is but evidence of the simplicity and singleheartedness of the man and he was in this but a type of his schoolfor we may as well designate in this way the entire class of writers whose poems are bound up in the volume before us and throughout all of whom there runs a very perceptible general character they used little art in composition their writings sprang immediately from the souland partook intensely of that souls nature nor is it difficult to perceive the tendency of this abandonto elevate immeasurably all the energies of mindbut again so to mingle the greatest possible fire force delicacy and all good things with the lowest possible bathos baldness and imbecility as to render it not a matter of doubt that the average results of mind in such a school will be found inferior to those results in one ceteris paribus more artificial  we can not bring ourselves to believe that the selections of the book of gems are such as will impart to a poetical reader the clearest possible idea of the beauty of the schoolbut if the intention had been merely to show the schools character the attempt might have been considered successful in the highest degree there are long passages now before us of the most despicable trash with no merit whatever beyond that of their antiquity the criticisms of the editor do not particularly please us his enthusiasm is too general and too vivid not to be false his opinion for example of sir henry wottons verses on the queen of bohemiathat there are few finer things in our language is untenable and absurd  in such lines we can perceive not one of those higher attributes of poesy which belong to her in all circumstances and throughout all time here every thing is art nakedly or but awkwardly concealed no prepossession for the mere antique and in this case we can imagine no other prepossession should induce us to dignify with the sacred name of poetry a series such as this of elaborate and threadbare compliments stitched apparently together without fancy without plausibility and without even an attempt at adaptation  in common with all the world we have been much delighted with the shepherds hunting by withersa poem partaking in a remarkable degree of the peculiarities of il penseroso speaking of poesy the author says       by the murmur of a spring      or the least boughs rustleling      by a daisy whose leaves spread      shut when titan goes to bed      or a shady bush or tree      she could more infuse in me      than all natures beauties can      in some other wiser man      by her help i also now      make this churlish place allow      something that may sweeten gladness      in the very gall of sadness      the dull loneness the black shade      that these hanging vaults have made      the strange music of the waves      beating on these hollow caves      this black den which rocks emboss      overgrown with eldest moss      the rude portals that give light      more to terror than delight      this my chamber of neglect       walled about with disrespect      from all these and this dull air      a fit object for despair      she hath taught me by her might      to draw comfort and delight  but these lines however good do not bear with them much of the general character of the english antique something more of this will be found in corbets farewell to the fairies we copy a portion of marvells maiden lamenting for her fawn which we prefernot only as a specimen of the elder poets but in itself as a beautiful poem abounding in pathos exquisitely delicate imagination and truthfulnessto anything of its species       it is a wondrous thing how fleet      twas on those little silver feet      with what a pretty skipping grace      it oft would challenge me the race      and whent had left me far away      twould stay and run again and stay      for it was nimbler much than hinds      and trod as if on the four winds      i have a garden of my own      but so with roses overgrown      and lilies that you would it guess      to be a little wilderness      and all the springtime of the year      it only loved to be there      among the beds of lilies i      have sought it oft where it should lie      yet could not till itself would rise      find it although before mine eyes      for in the flaxen lilies shade      it like a bank of lilies laid      upon the roses it would feed      until its lips even seemed to bleed      and then to me twould boldly trip      and print those roses on my lip      but all its chief delight was still      with roses thus itself to fill      and its pure virgin limbs to fold      in whitest sheets of lilies cold      had it lived long it would have been      lilies without roses within  how truthful an air of lamentations hangs here upon every syllable it pervades all it comes over the sweet melody of the wordsover the gentleness and grace which we fancy in the little maiden herselfeven over the halfplayful halfpetulant air with which she lingers on the beauties and good qualities of her favoritelike the cool shadow of a summer cloud over a bed of lilies and violets and all sweet flowers the whole is redolent with poetry of a very lofty order every line is an idea conveying either the beauty and playfulness of the fawn or the artlessness of the maiden or her love or her admiration or her grief or the fragrance and warmth and appropriateness of the little nestlike bed of lilies and roses which the fawn devoured as it lay upon them and could scarcely be distinguished from them by the once happy little damsel who went to seek her pet with an arch and rosy smile on her face consider the great variety of truthful and delicate thought in the few lines we have quoted the wonder of the little maiden at the fleetness of her favoritethe little silver feetthe fawn challenging his mistress to a race with a pretty skipping grace running on before and then with head turned back awaiting her approach only to fly from it againcan we not distinctly perceive all these things how exceedingly vigorous too is the line  and trod as if on the four winds  a vigor apparent only when we keep in mind the artless character of the speaker and the four feet of the favorite one for each wind then consider the garden of my own so overgrown entangled with roses and lilies as to be a little wildernessthe fawn loving to be there and there onlythe maiden seeking it where it should lieand not being able to distinguish it from the flowers

       eap  preface  these trifles are collected and republished chiefly with a view to their redemption from the many improvements to which they have been subjected while going at random the rounds of the press i am naturally anxious that what i have written should circulate as i wrote it if it circulate at all in defence of my own taste nevertheless it is incumbent upon me to say that i think nothing in this volume of much value to the public or very creditable to myself events not to be controlled have prevented me from making at any time any serious effort in what under happier circumstances would have been the field of my choice with me poetry has been not a purpose but a passion and the passions should be held in reverence they must notthey can not at will be excited with an eye to the paltry compensations or the more paltry commendations of mankind                             e a p     1845     poems of later life     the raven   once upon a midnight dreary while i pondered weak and weary  over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore  while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping  as of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door  tis some visiter i muttered tapping at my chamber door                           only this and nothing more   ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december  and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor  eagerly i wished the morrowvainly i had sought to borrow  from my books surcease of sorrowsorrow for the lost lenore  for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore                           nameless here for evermore   and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain  thrilled mefilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before  so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating  tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door  some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door                           this it is and nothing more   presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer  sir said i or madam truly your forgiveness i implore  but the fact is i was napping and so gently you came rapping  and so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door  that i scarce was sure i heard you here i opened wide the door                           darkness there and nothing more   deep into that darkness peering long i stood there wondering fearing  doubting dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before  but the silence was unbroken and the darkness gave no token  and the only word there spoken was the whispered word lenore  this i whispered and an echo murmured back the word lenore                           merely this and nothing more   back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning  soon i heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before  surely said i surely that is something at my window lattice  let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore  let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore                           tis the wind and nothing more   open here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter  in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore  not the least obeisance made he not an instant stopped or stayed he  but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door  perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door                           perched and sat and nothing more   then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling  by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore  though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou i said art sure no craven  ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore  tell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore                          quoth the raven nevermore   much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly  though its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore  for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being  ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door  bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door                          with such name as nevermore   but the raven sitting lonely on the placid bust spoke only  that one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour  nothing farther then he utterednot a feather then he fluttered  till i scarcely more than muttered other friends have flown before  on the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before                          then the bird said nevermore   startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken  doubtless said i what it utters is its only stock and store  caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster  followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore  till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore                          of nevernevermore   but the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling  straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door  then upon the velvet sinking i betook myself to linking  fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore  what this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore                          meant in croaking nevermore   this i sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing  to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core  this and more i sat divining with my head at ease reclining  on the cushions velvet lining that the lamplght gloated oer  but whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating oer                           she shall press ah nevermore   then methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer  swung by angels whose faint footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor  wretch i cried thy god hath lent theeby these angels he hath sent  thee  respiterespite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore  quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore                           quoth the raven nevermore   prophet said i thing of evilprophet still if bird or devil  whether tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore  desolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted  on this home by horror hauntedtell me truly i implore  is thereis there balm in gileadtell metell me i implore                           quoth the raven nevermore   prophet said i thing of evilprophet still if bird or devil  by that heaven that bends above usby that god we both adore  tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant aidenn  it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore  clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore                           quoth the raven nevermore   be that word our sign of parting bird or fiend i shrieked upstarting  get thee back into the tempest and the nights plutonian shore  leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken  leave my loneliness unbrokenquit the bust above my door  take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door                          quoth the raven nevermore   and the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting  on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door  and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming  and the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor  and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor                           shall be liftednevermore  published 1845     the bells

they were withering and sere      it was night in the lonesome october          of my most immemorial year      it was hard by the dim lake of auber          in the misty mid region of weir      it was down by the dank tarn of auber          in the ghoulhaunted woodland of weir       here once through an alley titanic          of cypress i roamed with my soul          of cypress with psyche my soul      there were days when my heart was volcanic          as the scoriac rivers that roll          as the lavas that restlessly roll      their sulphurous currents down yaanek          in the ultimate climes of the pole      that groan as they roll down mount yaanek          in the realms of the boreal pole       our talk had been serious and sober          but our thoughts they were palsied and sere          our memories were treacherous and sere      for we knew not the month was october          and we marked not the night of the year          ah night of all nights in the year      we noted not the dim lake of auber          though once we had journeyed down here      we remembered not the dank tarn of auber          nor the ghoulhaunted woodland of weir       and now as the night was senescent          and stardials pointed to morn          as the stardials hinted of morn      at the end of our path a liquescent          and nebulous lustre was born      out of which a miraculous crescent          arose with a duplicate horn      astartes bediamonded crescent          distinct with its duplicate horn       and i saidshe is warmer than dian          she rolls through an ether of sighs          she revels in a region of sighs      she has seen that the tears are not dry on          these cheeks where the worm never dies      and has come past the stars of the lion          to point us the path to the skies          to the lethean peace of the skies      come up in despite of the lion          to shine on us with her bright eyes      come up through the lair of the lion          with love in her luminous eyes       but psyche uplifting her finger          saidsadly this star i mistrust          her pallor i strangely mistrust      ah hastenah let us not linger          ah flylet us flyfor we must      in terror she spoke letting sink her          wings till they trailed in the dust      in agony sobbed letting sink her          plumes till they trailed in the dust          till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust       i repliedthis is nothing but dreaming          let us on by this tremulous light          let us bathe in this crystalline light      its sybillic splendor is beaming          with hope and in beauty tonight          seeit flickers up the sky through the night      ah we safely may trust to its gleaming          and be sure it will lead us aright      we safely may trust to a gleaming          that cannot but guide us aright          since it flickers up to heaven through the night       thus i pacified psyche and kissed her          and tempted her out of her gloom          and conquered her scruples and gloom      and we passed to the end of the vista          but were stopped by the door of a tomb          by the door of a legended tomb      and i saidwhat is written sweet sister          on the door of this legended tomb          she repliedulalumeulalume          t is the vault of thy lost ulalume       then my heart it grew ashen and sober          as the leaves that were crisped and sere          as the leaves that were withering and sere      and i criedit was surely october          on this very night of last year          that i journeyedi journeyed down here          that i brought a dread burden down here          on this night of all nights in the year          ah what demon has tempted me here      well i know now this dim lake of auber          this misty mid region of weir      well i know now this dank tarn of auber          this ghoulhaunted woodland of weir  1847     to helen       i saw thee onceonce onlyyears ago      i must not say how manybut not many      it was a july midnight and from out      a fullorbed moon that like thine own soul soaring      sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven      there fell a silverysilken veil of light      with quietude and sultriness and slumber      upon the upturned faces of a thousand      roses that grew in an enchanted garden      where no wind dared to stir unless on tiptoe      fell on the upturnd faces of these roses      that gave out in return for the lovelight      their odorous souls in an ecstatic death      fell on the upturnd faces of these roses      that smiled and died in this parterre enchanted      by thee and by the poetry of thy presence       clad all in white upon a violet bank      i saw thee half reclining while the moon      fell on the upturnd faces of the roses      and on thine own upturndalas in sorrow       was it not fate that on this july midnight      was it not fate whose name is also sorrow      that bade me pause before that gardengate      to breathe the incense of those slumbering roses      no footstep stirred the hated world an slept      save only thee and me oh heavenoh god      how my heart beats in coupling those two words      save only thee and me i pausedi looked      and in an instant all things disappeared      ah bear in mind this garden was enchanted       the pearly lustre of the moon went out      the mossy banks and the meandering paths      the happy flowers and the repining trees      were seen no more the very roses odors      died in the arms of the adoring airs      allall expired save theesave less than thou      save only the divine light in thine eyes      save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes      i saw but themthey were the world to me      i saw but themsaw only them for hours      saw only them until the moon went down      what wild hearthistories seemed to he enwritten       upon those crystalline celestial spheres      how dark a woe yet how sublime a hope      how silently serene a sea of pride      how daring an ambition yet how deep      how fathomless a capacity for love       but now at length dear dian sank from sight      into a western couch of thundercloud      and thou a ghost amid the entombing trees      didst glide away only thine eyes remained      they would not gothey never yet have gone      lighting my lonely pathway home that night      they have not left me as my hopes have since      they follow methey lead me through the years      they are my ministersyet i their slave      their office is to illumine and enkindle      my duty to be saved by their bright light      and purified in their electric fire      and sanctified in their elysian fire      they fill my soul with beauty which is hope      and are far up in heaventhe stars i kneel to      in the sad silent watches of my night      while even in the meridian glare of day      i see them stilltwo sweetly scintillant      venuses unextinguished by the sun     annabel lee       it was many and many a year ago          in a kingdom by the sea      that a maiden lived whom you may know          by the name of annabel lee      and this maiden she lived with no other thought          than to love and be loved by me       i was a child and she was a child          in this kingdom by the sea      but we loved with a love that was more than love          i and my annabel lee      with a love that the wingéd seraphs of heaven          coveted her and me       and this was the reason that long ago          in this kingdom by the sea      a wind blew out of a cloud by night          chilling my annabel lee      so that her highborn kinsmen came          and bore her away from me      to shut her up in a sepulchre          in this kingdom by the sea       the angels not half so happy in heaven          went envying her and me      yes that was the reason as all men know          in this kingdom

quenches all thirst       of a water that flows          with a lullaby sound      from a spring but a very few          feet under ground      from a cavern not very far          down under ground       and ah let it never          be foolishly said      that my room it is gloomy          and narrow my bed      for man never slept          in a different bed      and to sleep you must slumber

pansies       and so it lies happily          bathing in many      a dream of the truth          and the beauty of annie      drowned in a bath          of the tresses of annie       she tenderly kissed me          she fondly caressed      and then i fell gently          to sleep on her breast      deeply to sleep          from the heaven of her breast       when the light was extinguished          she covered me warm      and she prayed to the angels          to keep me from harm      to the queen of the angels          to shield me from harm       and i lie so composedly          now in my bed      knowing her love          that you fancy me dead      and i rest so contentedly          now in my bed      with her love at my breast          that you fancy me dead      that you shudder to look at me          thinking me dead       but my heart it is brighter          than all of the many      stars in the sky          for it sparkles with annie      it glows with the light          of the love of my annie      with the thought of the light          of the eyes of my annie  1849     to f       beloved amid the earnest woes          that crowd around my earthly path      drear

kingly halls      up fanesup babylonlike walls      up shadowy longforgotten bowers      of scultured ivy and stone flowers      up many and many a marvellous shrine      whose wreathed friezes

was first published on the 29th january 1845 in the new york evening mirrora paper its author was then assistant editor of it was prefaced by the following words understood to have been written by n p willis we are permitted to copy in advance of publication from the second number of the american review the following remarkable poem by edgar poe in our opinion it is the most effective single example of fugitive poetry ever published in this country and unsurpassed in english poetry for subtle conception masterly ingenuity of versification and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and pokerishness it is one of those dainties bred in a book which we feed on it will stick to the memory of everybody who reads it in the february number of the american review the poem was published as by quarles and it was introduced by the following note evidently suggested if not written by poe himself  the following lines from a correspondentbesides the deep quaint strain of the sentiment and the curious introduction of some ludicrous touches amidst the serious and impressive as was doubtless intended by the authorappears to us one of the most felicitous specimens of unique rhyming which has for some time met our eye the resources of english rhythm for varieties of melody measure and sound producing corresponding diversities of effect having been thoroughly studied much more perceived by very few poets in the language while the classic tongues especially the greek possess by power of accent several advantages for versification over our own chiefly through greater abundance of spondaic feet we have other and very great advantages of sound by the modern usage of rhyme alliteration is nearly the only effect of that kind which the ancients had in common with us it will be seen that much of the melody of the raven arises from alliteration and the studious use of similar sounds in unusual places in regard to its measure it may be noted that if all the verses were like the second they might properly be placed merely in short lines producing a not uncommon form but the presence in all the others of one linemostly the second in the verse stanzawhich flows continuously with only an aspirate pause in the middle like that before the short line in the sapphic adonic while the fifth has at the middle pause no similarity of sound with any part besides gives the versification an entirely different effect we could wish the capacities of our noble language in prosody were better understooded am rev  2 the bibliographical history of the bells is curious the subject and some lines of the original version having been suggested by the poets friend mrs shew poe when he wrote out the first draft of the poem headed it the bells by mrs m a shew this draft now the editors property consists of only seventeen lines and read thus                         i       the bellsah the bells      the little silver bells      how fairylike a melody there floats      from their throats      from their merry little throats      from the silver tinkling throats      of the bells bells bells      of the bells                         ii       the bellsah the bells

bells bells      of the bells  in the autumn of 1848 poe added another line to this poem and sent it to the editor of the union magazine it was not published so in the following february the poet forwarded to the same periodical a much enlarged and altered transcript three months having elapsed without publication another revision of the poem similar to the current version was sent and in the following october was published in the union magazine  3 this poem was first published in coltons american review for december 1847 as toulalume a ballad being reprinted immediately in the home journal it was copied into various publications with the name of the editor n p willis appended and was ascribed to him when first published it contained the following additional stanza which poe subsequently at the suggestion of mrs whitman wisely suppressed       said we thenwe two thenah can it      have been that the woodlandish ghouls      the pitiful the merciful ghouls      to bar up our path and to ban it      from the secret that lies in these wolds      had drawn up the spectre of a planet      from the limbo of lunary souls      this sinfully scintillant planet      from the hell of the planetary souls  4 to helen mrs s helen whitman was not published until november 1848 although written several months earlier it first appeared in the union magazine and with the omission contrary to the knowledge or desire of poe of the line oh god oh heavenhow my heart beats in coupling those two words  5 annabel lee was written early in 1849 and is evidently an expression of the poets undying love for his deceased bride although at least one of his lady admirers deemed it a response to her admiration poe sent a copy of the ballad to the union magazine in which publication it appeared in january 1850 three months after the authors death while suffering from hope deferred as to its fate poe presented a copy of annabel lee to the editor of the southern literary messenger who published it in the november number of his periodical a month after poes death in the meantime the poets own copy left among his papers passed into the hands of the person engaged to edit his works and he quoted the poem in an obituary of poe in the new york tribune before any one else had an opportunity of publishing it  6 a valentine one of three poems addressed to mrs osgood appears to have been written early in 1846  7 an enigma addressed to mrs sarah anna lewis stella was sent to that lady in a letter in november 1847 and the following march appeared in sartains union magazine  8 the sonnet to my mother maria clemm was sent for publication to the shortlived flag of our union early in 1849 but does not appear to have been issued until after its authors death when it appeared in the leaflets of memory for 1850  9 for annie was first published in the flag of our union in the spring of 1849 poe annoyed at some misprints in this issue shortly afterwards caused a corrected copy to be inserted in the home journal  10 to f frances sargeant osgood appeared in the broadway journal for april 1845 these lines are but slightly varied from those inscribed to mary in the southern literary messenger for july 1835 and subsequently republished with the two stanzas transposed in grahams magazine for march 1842 as to one departed  11 to fs s od a portion of the poets triune tribute to mrs osgood was published in the broadway journal for september 1845 the earliest version of these lines appeared in the southern literary messenger for september 1835 as lines written in an album and was addressed to eliza white the proprietors daughter slightly revised the poem reappeared in burtons gentlemans magazine for august 1839 as to  12 although eldorado was published during poes lifetime in 1849 in the flag of our union it does not appear to have ever received the authors finishing touches     poems of manhood     lenore       ah broken is the golden bowl the spirit flown forever

literary messenger for december 1835 and january 1836 being styled scenes from politian an unpublished drama these scenes were included unaltered in the 1845 collection of poems by poe the larger portion of the original draft subsequently became the property of the present editor but it is not considered just to the poets memory to publish it the work is a hasty and unrevised production of its authors earlier days of literary labor and beyond the scenes already known scarcely calculated to enhance his reputation as a specimen however of the parts unpublished the following fragment from the first scene of act ii may be offered the duke it should be premised is uncle to alessandra and father of castiglione her betrothed        duke why do you laugh        castiglione indeed    i hardly know myself stay was it not   on yesterday we were speaking of the earl   of the earl politian yes it was yesterday   alessandra you and 1 you must remember   we were walking in the garden        duke perfectly   i do remember itwhat of itwhat then        cas 0 nothingnothing at all        duke nothing at all   it is most singular that you should laugh   at nothing at all        cas most singularsingular        duke look you castiglione be so kind   as tell me sir at once what tis you mean   what are you talking of        cas was it not so   we differed in opinion touching him        duke himwhom        cas why sir the earl politian        duke the earl of leicester yesis it he you mean   we differed indeed if i now recollect   the words you used were that the earl you knew   was neither learned nor mirthful        cas ha hanow did i        duke that did you sir and well i knew at the time   you were wrong it being not the character   of the earlwhom all the world allows to be   a most hilarious man be not my son   too positive again        cas tis singular   most singular i could not think it possible   so little time could so much alter one   to say the truth about an hour ago   as i was walking with the count san ozzo   all arm in arm we met this very man   the earlhe with his friend baldazzar   having just arrived in rome hal ha he is altered   such an account he gave me of his journey   twould have made you die with laughtersuch tales he told   of his caprices and his merry freaks   along the roadsuch odditysuch humor   such witsuch whimsuch flashes of wild merriment   set off too in such full relief by the grave   demeanor of his friendwho to speak the truth   was gravity itself        duke did i not tell you        cas you didand yet tis strange but true as strange   how much i was mistaken i always thought   the earl a gloomy man        duke so so you see be not too positive whom have we here   it can not be the earl        cas the earl oh no tis not the earlbut yet it isand leaning   upon his friend baldazzar am welcome sir    enter politian and baldazzar   my lord a second welcome let me give you   to romehis grace the duke of broglio   father this is the earl politian earl   of leicester in great britain politian bows haughtily       that his friend   baldazzar duke of surrey the earl has letters   so please you for your grace

mirthful indeedwhich of us said   politian was a melancholy man    exeunt     poems of youth     introduction to poems1831     letter to mr b                                    west point 1831  dear b believing only a portion of my former volume to be worthy a second editionthat small portion i thought it as well to include in the present book as to republish by itself i have therefore herein combined al aaraaf and tamerlane with other poems hitherto unprinted nor have i hesitated to insert from the minor poems now omitted whole lines and even passages to the end that being placed in a fairer light and the trash shaken from them in which they were imbedded they may have some chance of being seen by posterity  it has been said that a good critique on a poem may be written by one who is no poet himself this according to your idea and mine of poetry i feel to be falsethe less poetical the critic the less just the critique and the converse on this account and because there are but few bs in the world i would be as much ashamed of the worlds good opinion as proud of your own another than yourself might here observe shakespeare is in possession of the worlds good opinion and yet shakespeare is the greatest of poets it appears then that the world judge correctly why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment the difficulty lies in the interpretation of the word judgment or opinion the opinion is the worlds truly but it may be called theirs as a man would call a book his having bought it he did not write the book but it is his they did not originate the opinion but it is theirs a fool for example thinks shakespeare a great poetyet the fool has never read shakespeare but the fools neighbor who is a step higher on the andes of the mind whose head that is to say his more exalted thought is too far above the fool to be seen or understood but whose feet by which i mean his everyday actions are sufficiently near to be discerned and by means of which that superiority is ascertained which but for them would never have been discoveredthis neighbor asserts that shakespeare is a great poetthe fool believes him and it is henceforward his opinion this neighbors own opinion has in like manner been adopted from one above him and so ascendingly to a few gifted individuals who kneel around the summit beholding face to face the master spirit who stands upon the pinnacle  you are aware of the great barrier in the path of an american writer he is read if at all in preference to the combined and established wit of the world i say established for it is with literature as with law or empirean established name is an estate in tenure or a throne in possession besides one might suppose that books like their authors improve by traveltheir having crossed the sea is with us so great a distinction our antiquaries abandon time for distance our very fops glance from the binding to the bottom of the titlepage where the mystic characters which spell london paris or genoa are precisely so many letters of recommendation  i mentioned just now a vulgar error as regards criticism i think the notion that no poet can form a correct estimate of his own writings is another i remarked before that in proportion to the poetical talent would be the justice of a critique upon poetry therefore a bad poet would i grant make a false critique and his selflove would infallibly bias his little judgment in his favor but a poet who is indeed a poet could not i think fail of makinga just critique whatever should be deducted on the score of selflove might be replaced on account of his intimate acquaintance with the subject in short we have more instances of false criticism than of just where ones own writings are the test simply because we have more bad poets than good there are of course many objections to what i say milton is a great example of the contrary but his opinion with respect to the paradise regained is by no means fairly ascertained by what trivial circumstances men are often led to assert what they do not really believe perhaps an inadvertent word has descended to posterity but in fact the paradise regained is little if at all inferior to the paradise lost and is only supposed so to be because men do not like epics whatever they may say to the contrary and reading those of milton in their natural order are too much wearied with the first to derive any pleasure from the second  i dare say milton preferred comus to either if sojustly  as i am speaking of poetry it will not be amiss to touch slightly upon the most singular heresy in its modern historythe heresy of what is called very foolishly the lake school some years ago i might have been induced by an occasion like the present to attempt a formal refutation of their doctrine at present it would be a work of supererogation the wise must bow to the wisdom of such men as coleridge and southey but being wise have laughed at poetical theories so prosaically exemplifled  aristotle with singular assurance has declared poetry the most philosophical of all writingsbut it required a wordsworth to pronounce it the most metaphysical he seems to think that the end of poetry is or should be instruction yet it is a truism that the end of our existence is happiness if so the end of every separate part of our existence everything connected with our existence should be still happiness therefore the end of instruction should be happiness and happiness is another name for pleasuretherefore the end of instruction should be pleasure yet we see the abovementioned opinion implies precisely the reverse  to proceed ceteris paribus he who pleases is of more importance to his fellowmen than he who instructs since utility is happiness and pleasure is the end already obtained which instruction is merely the means of obtaining  i see no reason then why our metaphysical poets should plume themselves so much on the utility of their works unless indeed they refer to instruction with eternity in view in which case sincere respect for their piety would not allow me to express my contempt for their judgment contempt which it would be difficult to conceal since their writings are professedly to be understood by the few and it is the many who stand in need of salvation in such case i should no doubt be tempted to think of the devil in melmoth who labors indefatigably through three octavo volumes to accomplish the destruction of one or two souls while any common devil would have demolished one or two thousand  against the subtleties which would make poetry a studynot a passionit becomes the metaphysician to reasonbut the poet to protest yet wordsworth and coleridge are men in years the one imbued in contemplation from his childhood the other a giant in intellect and learning the diffidence then with which i venture to dispute their authority would be overwhelming did i not feel from the bottom of my heart that learning has little to do with the imaginationintellect with the passionsor age with poetry       trifles like straws upon the surface flow      he who would search for pearls must dive below  are lines which have done much mischief as regards the greater truths men oftener err by seeking them at the bottom than at the top truth lies in the huge abysses where wisdom is soughtnot in the palpable palaces where she is found the ancients were not always right in hidingthe goddess in a well witness the light which bacon has thrown upon philosophy witness the principles of our divine faiththat moral mechanism by which the simplicity of a child may overbalance the wisdom of a man  we see an instance of coleridges liability to err in his biographia literariaprofessedly his literary life and opinions but in fact a treatise de omni scibili et quibusdam aliis he goes wrong by reason of his very profundity and of his error we have a natural type in the contemplation of a star he who regards it directly and intensely sees it is true the star but it is the star without a raywhile he who surveys it less inquisitively is conscious of all for which the star is useful to us belowits brilliancy and its beauty  as to wordsworth i have no faith in him that he had in youth the feelings of a poet i believefor there are glimpses of extreme delicacy in his writingsand delicacy is the poets own kingdomhis el doradobut they have the appearance of a better day recollected and glimpses at best are little evidence of present poetic fire we know that a few straggling flowers spring up daily in the crevices of the glacier  he was to blame in wearing away his youth in contemplation with the end of poetizing in his manhood with the increase of his judgment the light which should make it apparent has faded away his judgment consequently is too correct this may not be understoodbut the old goths of germany would have understood it who used to debate matters of importance to their state twice once when drunk and once when sobersober that they might not be deficient in formalitydrunk lest they should be destitute of vigor  the long wordy discussions by which he tries to reason us into admiration of his poetry speak very little in his favor they are full of such assertions as this i have opened one of his volumes at randomof genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is worthy to be done and what was never done beforeindeed then it follows that in doing what is unworthy to be done or what has been done before no genius can be evinced yet the picking of pockets is an unworthy act pockets have been picked time immemorial and barrington the pickpocket in point of genius would have thought hard of a comparison with william wordsworth the poet  again in estimating the merit of certain poems whether they be ossians or macphersons can surely be of little consequence yet in order to prove their worthlessness mr w has expended many pages in the controversy tantaene animis can great minds descend to such absurdity but worse still that he may bear down every argument in favor of these poems he triumphantly drags forward a passage in his abomination with which he expects the reader to sympathize it is the beginning of the epic poem temora the blue waves of ullin roll in light the green hills are covered with day trees shake their dusty heads in the breeze and this this gorgeous yet simple imagery where all is alive and panting with immortalitythis william wordsworth the author of peter bell has selected for his contempt we shall see what better he in his own person has to offer imprimis       and now shes at the ponys tail      and now shes at the ponys head      on that side now and now on this      and almost stifled with her bliss       a few sad tears does betty shed      she pats the pony where or when      she knows not happy betty foy      oh johnny never mind the doctor  secondly       the dew was falling fast thestars began to blink      i heard a voice it saiddrink pretty creature drink      and looking oer the hedge before me i espied      a snowwhite mountain lamb with amaiden at its side      no other sheep was nearthe lamb was all alone      and by a slender cord wastetherd to a stone  now we have no doubt this is all true we will believe it indeed we will mr w is it sympathy for the sheep you wish to excite i love a sheep from the bottom of my heart  but there are occasions dear b there are occasions when even wordsworth is reasonable even stamboul it is said shall have an end and the most unlucky blunders must come to a

pleasure being a poem only so far as this object is attained romance presenting perceptible images with definite poetry with indefinite sensations to which end music is an essential since the comprehension of sweet sound is our most indefinite conception music when combined with a pleasurable idea is poetry music without the idea is simply music the idea wi thout the music is prose from its very definitiveness  what was meant by the invective against him who had no music in his soul  to sum up this long rigmarole i have dear b what you no doubt perceive for the metaphysical poets as

1827 which was subsequently suppressed such poems from the first and second published volumes of 1829 and 1831 as have not already been given in their revised versions and a few others collected from various sources al aaraaf first appeared with the sonnet to silence prefixed to it in 1829 and is substantially as originally issued in the edition for 1831 however this poem its authors longest was introduced by the following twentynine lines which have been omitted inall subsequent collections       al aaraaf       mysterious star      thou wert my dream      all a long summer night      be now my theme      by this clear stream      of thee will i write      meantime from afar      bathe me in light i       thy world has not the dross of ours      yet all the beautyall the flowers      that list our love or deck our bowers      in dreamy gardens where do lie      dreamy maidens all the day      while the silver winds of circassy      on violet couches faint away      littleoh little dwells in thee      like unto what on earth we see      beautys eye is here the bluest      in the falsest and untrueston the sweetest      air doth float      the most sad and solemn note       if with thee be broken hearts      joy so peacefully departs      that its echo still doth dwell      like the murmur in the shell      thou thy truest type of grief      is the gently falling leaf      thy framing is so holy      sorrow is not melancholy  31 the earliest version of tamerlane was included in the suppressed volume of 1827 but differs very considerably from the poem as now published the present draft besides innumerable verbal alterations and improvements upon the original is more carefully punctuated and the lines being indented presents a more pleasing appearance to the eye at least  32 to helen first appeared in the 1831 volume as did also the valley of unrest as the valley nis israfel and one or two others of the youthful pieces the poem styled romance constituted the preface of the 1829 volume but with the addition of the following lines       succeeding years too wild for song      then rolled like tropic storms along      where through the garish lights that fly      dying along the troubled sky      lay bare through vistas thunderriven      the blackness of the general heaven      that very blackness yet doth ring      light on the lightnings silver wing       for being an idle boy lang syne      who read anacreon and drank wine      i early found anacreon rhymes      were almost passionate sometimes      and by strange alchemy of brain      his pleasures always turned to pain      his naiveté to wild desire      his wit to lovehis wine to fire      and so being young and dipt in folly      i fell in love with melancholy       and used to throw my earthly rest      and quiet all away in jest      i could not love except where death      was mingling his with beautys breath      or hymen time and destiny      were stalking between her and me         but now my soul hath too much room      gone are the glory and the gloom      the black hath mellowd into gray      and all the fires are fading away       my draught of passion hath been deep      i revelld and i now would sleep      and after drunkenness of soul      succeeds the glories of the bowl      an idle longing night and day      to dream my very life away       but dreamsof those who dream as i      aspiringly are damned and die      yet should i swear i mean alone      by notes so very shrilly blown      to break upon times monotone      while yet my vapid joy and grief      are tintless of the yellow leaf      why not an imp the graybeard hath      will shake his shadow in my path      and een the graybeard will oerlook      connivingly my dreamingbook     doubtful poems     alone       from childhoods hour i have not been      as others werei have not seen      as others sawi could not bring      my passions from a common spring      from the same source i have not taken      my sorrowi could not awaken      my heart to joy at the same tone      and all i lovdi lovd alone      thenin my childhoodin the dawn      of a most stormy lifewas drawn      from evry depth of good and ill      the mystery which binds me still      from the torrent or the fountain      from the red cliff of the mountain      from the sun that round me rolld      in its autumn tint of gold      from the lightning in the sky      as it passd me flying by      from the thunder and the storm      and the cloud that took the form      when the rest of heaven was blue      of a demon in my view   this poem is no longer considered doubtful as it was in 1903 liberty has been taken to replace the book version with an earlier perhaps more original manuscript versioned     to isadore               i       beneath the vineclad eaves          whose shadows fall before          thy lowly cottage door      under the lilacs tremulous leaves      within thy snowy claspeèd hand          the purple flowers it bore      last eve in dreams i saw thee stand      like queenly nymphs from fairyland      enchantress of the flowery wand          most beauteous isadore                ii       and when i bade the dream          upon thy spirit flee          thy violet eyes to me      upturned did overflowing seem      with the deep untold delight          of loves serenity      thy classic brow like lilies white      and pale as the imperial night      upon her throne with stars bedight          enthralled my soul to thee                   iii       ah i ever i behold          thy dreamy passionate eyes          blue as the languid skies       hung with the sunsets fringe of gold      now strangely clear thine image grows          and olden memories      are startled from their long repose      like shadows on the silent snows      when suddenly the nightwind blows          where quiet moonlight ties                iv       like music heard in dreams          like strains of harps unknown          of birds forever flown      audible as the voice of streams      that murmur in some leafy dell          i hear thy gentlest tone      and silence cometh with her spell      like that which on my tongue doth dwell      when tremulous in dreams i tell          my love to thee alone                v       in every valley heard          floating from tree to tree          less beautiful to me      the music of the radiant bird      than artless accents such as thine          whose echoes never flee      ah how for thy sweet voice i pine      for uttered in thy tones benign      enchantress this rude name of mine           doth seem a melody     the village street       in these rapid restless shadows          once i walked at eventide      when a gentle silent maiden          wal    ked in beauty at my side      she alone there walked beside me          all in beauty like a bride       pallidly the moon was shining          on the dewy meadows nigh      on the silvery silent rivers          on the mountains far and high      on the oceans starlit waters          where the winds aweary die       slowly silently we wandered      from the open cottage door      underneath the elms long branches      to the pavement bending oer      underneath the mossy willow      and the dying sycamore       with the myriad stars in beauty      all bedight the heavens were seen      radiant hopes were bright around me      like the light of stars serene      like the mellow midnight splendor      of the nights irradiate queen       audibly the elmleaves whispered          peaceful pleasant melodies      like the distant murmured music          of unquiet lovely seas      while the winds were hushed in slumber          in the fragrant flowers and trees       wondrous and unwonted beauty          still adorning all did seem      while i told my love in fables          neath the willows by the stream      would the heart have kept unspoken          love that was its rarest dream       instantly away we wandered          in the shadowy twilight tide      she the silent scornful maiden          walking calmly at my side      with a step serene and stately          all in beauty all in pride       vacantly i walked beside her          on the earth mine eyes were cast      swift and keen there came unto me          ritter memories of the past      on me like the rain in autumn          on the dead leaves cold and fast       underneath the elms we parted          by the lowly cottage door      one brief word alone was uttered          never on our lips before      and away i walked forlornly          brokenhearted evermore       slowly silently i loitered          homeward in the night alone      sudden anguish bound my spirit          that my youth had never known      wild unrest like that which cometh          when the nights first dream hath flown       now to me the elmleaves whisper          mad discordant melodies      and keen melodies like shadows          haunt the moaning willow trees      and the sycamores with laughter          mock me in the nightly breeze       sad and pale the autumn moonlight          through the sighing foliage streams      and each morning midnight shadow          shadow of my sorrow seems      strive 0 heart forget thine idol          and 0 soul forget thy dreams     the forest reverie       tis said that when      the hands of men      tamed this primeval wood      and hoary trees with groans of woe      like warriors by an unknown foe      were in their strength subdued      the virgin earth gave instant birth      to springs that neer did flow      that in the sun did rivulets run      and all around rare flowers did blow      the wild rose pale perfumed the gale      and the queenly lily adown the dale      whom the sun and the dew      and the winds did woo      with the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew       so when in tears      the love of years      is wasted like the snow      and the fine fibrils of its life      by the rude wrong of instant strife      are broken at a blow      within the heart      do springs upstart      of which it doth now know      and strange sweet dreams      like silent streams      that from new fountains overflow      with the earlier tide      of rivers glide      deep in the heart whose hope has died      quenching the fires its ashes hide      its ashes whence will spring and grow      sweet flowers ere long      the rare and radiant flowers of song    notes  of the many verses from time to time ascribed to the pen of edgar poe and not included among his known writings the lines entitled alone have the chief claim to our notice facsimile copies of this piece had been in possession of the present editor some time previous to its publication in scribners magazine for september 1875 but as proofs of the authorship claimed for it were not forthcoming he refrained from publishing it as requested the desired proofs have not yet been adduced and there is at present nothing but internal evidence to guide us alone is stated to have been written by poe in the album of a baltimore lady mrs balderstone on march 17th 1829 and the facsimile given in scribners is alleged to be of his handwriting if the caligraphy be poes it is different in all essential respects from all the many specimens known to us and strongly resembles that of the writer of the heading and dating of the manuscript both of which the contributor of the poem acknowledges to have been recently added the lines however if not by poe are the most successful imitation of his early mannerisms yet made public and in the opinion of one well qualified to speak are not unworthy on the whole of the parentage claimed for them  while edgar poe was editor of the broadway journal some lines to isadore appeared therein and like several of his known pieces bore no signature they were at once ascribed to poe and in order to satisfy questioners an editorial paragraph subsequently appeared saying they were by a ide junior two previous poems had appeared in the broadway journal over the signature of a m ide and whoever wrote them was also the author of the lines to isadore in order doubtless to give a show of variety poe was then publishing some of his known works in his journal over noms de plume and as no other writings whatever can be traced to any person bearing the name of a m ide it is not impossible that the poems now republished in this collection may be by the author of the raven having been published without his usual elaborate revision poe may have wished to hide his hasty work under an assumed name the three pieces are included in the present collection so the reader can judge for himself what pretensions they possess to be by the author of the raven
