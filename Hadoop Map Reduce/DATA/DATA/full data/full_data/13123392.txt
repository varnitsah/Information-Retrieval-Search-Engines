redforth hes my cousin and shaking the table on purpose wanted to be the editor of it but i said he shouldnt because he couldnt he has no idea of being an editor  illustration  nettie ashford is my bride we were married in the righthand closet in the corner of the dancingschool where first we met with a ring a green one from wilkingwaters toyshop i owed for it out of my pocketmoney when the rapturous ceremony was over we all four went up the lane and let off a cannon brought loaded in bob redforths waistcoatpocket to announce our nuptials it flew right up when it went off and turned over next day lieutenantcolonel robin redforth was united with similar ceremonies to alice rainbird this time the cannon bust with a most terrific explosion and made a puppy bark  my peerless bride was at the period of which we now treat in captivity at miss grimmers drowvey and grimmer is the partnership and opinion is divided which is the greatest beast the lovely bride of the colonel was also immured in the dungeons of the same establishment a vow was entered into between the colonel and myself that we would cut them out on the following wednesday when walking two and two  under the desperate circumstances of the case the active brain of the colonel combining with his lawless pursuit he is a pirate suggested an attack with fireworks this however from motives of humanity was abandoned as too expensive  lightly armed with a paperknife buttoned up under his jacket and waving the dreaded black flag at the end of a cane the colonel took command of me at 2 pm on the eventful and appointed day he had drawn out the plan of attack on a piece of paper which was rolled up round a hoopstick he showed it to me my position and my fulllength portrait but my real ears dont stick out horizontal was behind a cornerlamppost with written orders to remain there till i should see miss drowvey fall the drowvey who was to fall was the one in spectacles not the one with the large lavender bonnet at that signal i was to rush forth seize my bride and fight my way to the lane there a junction would be effected between myself and the colonel and putting our brides behind us between ourselves and the palings we were to conquer or die  illustration  illustration waving his black flag the colonel attacked  the enemy appearedapproached waving his black flag the colonel attacked confusion ensued anxiously i awaited my signal but my signal came not so far from falling the hated drowvey in spectacles appeared to me to have muffled the colonels head in his outlawed banner and to be pitching into him with a parasol the one in the lavender bonnet also performed prodigies of valour with her fists on his back seeing that all was for the moment lost i fought my desperate way hand to hand to the lane through taking the back road i was so fortunate as to meet nobody and arrived there uninterrupted  illustration  it seemed an age ere the colonel joined me he had been to the jobbingtailors to be sewn up in several places and attributed our defeat to the refusal of the detested drowvey to fall finding her so obstinate he had said to her in a loud voice die recreant but had found her no more open to reason on that point than the other  my blooming bride appeared accompanied by the colonels bride at the dancingschool next day what was her face averted from me hah even so with a look of scorn she put into my hand a bit of paper and took another partner on the paper was pencilled heavens can i write the word is my husband a cow  illustration sewn up in several places  in the first bewilderment of my heated brain i tried to think what slanderer could have traced my family to the ignoble animal mentioned above vain were my endeavours at the end of that dance i whispered the colonel to come into the cloakroom and i showed him the note  illustration  there is a syllable wanting said he with a gloomy brow  hah what syllable was my inquiry  she asks can she write the word and no you see she couldnt said the colonel pointing out the passage  and the word was said i  cowcowcoward hissed the piratecolonel in my ear and gave me back the note  feeling that i must for ever tread the earth a branded boyperson i meanor that i must clear up my honour i demanded to be tried by a courtmartial the colonel admitted my right to be tried some difficulty was found in composing the court on account of the emperor of frances aunt refusing to let him come out he was to be the president ere yet we had appointed a substitute he made his escape over the back wall and stood among us a free monarch  illustration the court was held on the grass by the pond  the court was held on the grass by the pond i recognised in a certain admiral among my judges my deadliest foe a cocoanut had given rise to language that i could not brook but confiding in my innocence and also in the knowledge that the president of the united states who sat next him owed me a knife i braced myself for the ordeal  illustration two executioners with pinafores reversed  it was a solemn spectacle that court two executioners with pinafores reversed led me in under the shade of an umbrella i perceived my bride supported by the bride of the piratecolonel the president having reproved a little female ensign for tittering on a matter of life or death called upon me to plead coward or no coward guilty or not guilty i pleaded in a firm tone no coward and not guilty the little female ensign being again reproved by the president for misconduct mutinied left the court and threw stones  my implacable enemy the admiral conducted the case against me the colonels bride was called to prove that i had remained behind the cornerlamppost during the engagement i might have been spared the anguish of my own brides being also made a witness to the same point but the admiral knew where to wound me be still my soul no matter the colonel was then brought forward with his evidence  it was for this point that i had saved myself up as the turningpoint of my case shaking myself free of my guardswho had no business to hold me the stupids unless i was found guiltyi asked the colonel what he considered the first duty of a soldier ere he could reply the president of the united states rose and informed the court that my foe the admiral had suggested bravery and that prompting a witness wasnt fair the president of the court immediately ordered the admirals mouth to be filled with leaves and tied up with string i had the satisfaction of seeing the sentence carried into effect before the proceedings went further  i then took a paper from my trouserspocket and asked what do you consider colonel redforth the first duty of a soldier is it obedience  it is said the colonel  is that paperplease to look at itin your hand  it is said the colonel  is it a military sketch  it is said the colonel  of an engagement  quite so said the colonel  of the late engagement  of the late engagement  please to describe it and then hand it to the president of the court  from that triumphant moment my sufferings and my dangers were at an end the court rose up and jumped on discovering that i had strictly obeyed orders my foe the admiral who though muzzled was malignant yet contrived to suggest that i was dishonoured by having quitted the field but the colonel himself had done as much and gave his opinion upon his word and honour as a pirate that when all was lost the field might be quitted without disgrace i was going to be found no coward and not guilty and my blooming bride was going to be publicly restored to my arms in a procession when an unlookedfor event disturbed the general rejoicing this was no other than the emperor of frances aunt catching hold of his hair the proceedings abruptly terminated and the court tumultuously dissolved  illustration the piratecolonel with his bride and yesterdays gallant prisoner with his bride  it was when the shades of the next evening but one were beginning to fall ere yet the silver beams of luna touched the earth that four forms might have been descried slowly advancing towards the weeping willow on the borders of the pond the now deserted scene of the day before yesterdays agonies and triumphs on a nearer approach and by a practised eye these might have been identified as the forms of the piratecolonel with his bride and of the day before yesterdays gallant prisoner with his bride  on the beauteous faces of the nymphs dejection sat enthroned all four reclined under the willow for some minutes without speaking till at length the bride of the colonel poutingly observed its of no use pretending any more and we had better give it up  hah exclaimed the pirate pretending  dont go on like that you worry me returned his bride  the lovely bride of tinkling echoed the incredible declaration the two warriors exchanged stoney glances  if said the bride of the piratecolonel grownup people wont do what they ought to do and will put us out what comes of our pretending  we only get into scrapes said the bride of tinkling  you know very well pursued the colonels bride that miss drowvey wouldnt fall you complained of it yourself and you know how disgracefully the courtmartial ended as to our marriage would my people acknowledge it at home  or would my people acknowledge ours said the bride of tinkling  again the two warriors exchanged stoney glances  if you knocked at the door and claimed me after you were told to go away said the colonels bride you would only have your hair pulled or your ears or your nose  if you persisted in ringing at the bell and claiming me said the bride of tinkling to that gentleman you would have things dropped on your head from the window over the handle or you would be played upon by the gardenengine  and at your own homes resumed the bride of the colonel it would be just as bad you would be sent to bed or something equally undignified again how would you support us  the piratecolonel replied in a courageous voice by rapine but his bride retorted suppose the grownup people wouldnt be rapined then said the colonel they should pay the penalty in blood but suppose they should object retorted his bride and wouldnt pay the penalty in blood or anything else  a mournful silence ensued  then do you no longer love me alice asked the colonel  redforth i am ever thine returned his bride  then do you no longer love me nettie asked the present writer  tinkling i am ever thine returned my bride  we all four embraced let me not be misunderstood by the giddy the colonel embraced his own bride and i embraced mine but two times two make four  nettie and i said alice mournfully have been considering our position the grownup people are too strong for us they make us ridiculous besides they have changed the times william tinklings babybrother was christened yesterday what took place was any king present answer william  i said no unless disguised as greatuncle chopper  any queen  there had been no queen that i knew of at our house there might have been one in the kitchen but i didnt think so or the servants would have mentioned it  any fairies  none that were visible  we had an idea among us i think said alice with a melancholy smile we four that miss grimmer would prove to be the wicked fairy and would come in at the christening with her crutchstick and give the child a bad gift was there anything of that sort answer william  illustration we had an idea among us  that miss grimmer would prove to be the wicked fairy  i said that ma had said afterwards and so she had that greatuncle choppers gift was a shabby one but she hadnt said a bad one she had called it shabby electrotyped secondhand and below his income  it must be the grownup people who have changed all this said alice we couldnt have changed it if we had been so inclined and we never should have been or perhaps miss grimmer is a wicked fairy after all and wont act up to it because the grownup people have persuaded her not to either way they would make us ridiculous if we told them what we expected  tyrants muttered the piratecolonel  nay my redforth said alice say not so call not names my redforth or they will apply to pa  let em said the colonel i dont care whos he  tinkling here undertook the perilous task of remonstrating with his lawless friend who consented to withdraw the moody expressions above quoted  what remains for us to do alice went on in her mild wise way we must educate we must pretend in a new manner we must wait  the colonel clenched his teethfour out in front and a piece off another and he had been twice dragged to the door of a dentistdespot but had escaped from his guards how educate how pretend in a new manner how wait  educate the grownup people replied alice we part tonight yes redforthfor the colonel tucked up his cuffspart tonight let us in these next holidays now going to begin throw our thoughts into something educational for the grownup people hinting to them how things ought to be let us veil our meaning under a mask of romancea you i and nettie william tinkling being the plainest and quickest writer shall copy out is it agreed  the colonel answered sulkily i dont mind he then asked how about pretending  we will pretend said alice that we are children not that we are those grownup people who wont help us out as they ought and who understand us so badly  the colonel still much dissatisfied growled how about waiting  we will wait answered little alice taking netties hand in hers and looking up to the sky we will waitever constant and truetill the times have got so changed as that everything helps us out and nothing makes us ridiculous and the fairies have come back we will waitever constant and truetill we are eighty ninety or one hundred and then the fairies will send us children and we will help them out poor pretty little creatures if they pretend ever so much  illustration  so we will dear said nettie ashford taking her round the waist with both arms and kissing her and now if my husband will go and buy some cherries for us i have got some money  in the friendliest manner i invited the colonel to go with me but he so far forgot himself as to acknowledge the invitation by kicking out behind and then lying down on his stomach on the grass pulling it up and chewing it when i came back however alice had nearly brought him out of his vexation and was soothing him by telling him how soon we should all be ninety  as we sat under the willowtree and ate the cherries fair for alice shared them out we played at being ninety nettie complained that she had a bone in her old back and it made her hobble and alice sang a song in an old womans way but it was very pretty and we were all merry at least i dont know about merry exactly but all comfortable  there was a most tremendous lot of cherries and alice always had with her some neat little bag or box or case to hold things in it that night was a tiny wineglass so alice and nettie said they would make some cherrywine to drink our love at parting  illustration there was a most tremendous lot of cherries  each of us had a glassful and it was delicious and each of us drank the toast our love at parting the colonel drank his wine last and it got into my head directly that it got into his directly anyhow his eyes rolled immediately after he had turned the glass upside down and he took me on one side and proposed in a hoarse whisper that we should cut em out still  how did he mean i asked my lawless friend  cut our brides out said the colonel and then cut our way without going down a single turning bang to the spanish main  we might have tried it though i didnt think it would answer only we looked round and saw that there was nothing but moonlight under the willowtree and that our pretty pretty wives were gone we burst out crying the colonel gave in second and came to first but he gave in strong  we were ashamed of our red eyes and hung about for half an hour to whiten them likewise a piece of chalk round the rims i doing the colonels and he mine but afterwards found in the bedroom lookingglass not natural besides inflammation our conversation turned on being ninety the colonel told me he had a pair of boots that wanted soleing and heeling but he thought it hardly worth while to mention it to his father as he himself should so soon be ninety when he thought shoes would be more convenient the colonel also told me with his hand upon his hip that he felt himself already getting on in life and turning rheumatic and i told him the same and when they said at our house at supper they are always bothering about something that i stooped i felt so glad  this is the end of the beginningpart that you were to believe most                      the end                                       footnote a the titles of the romances by which alice rainbird nettie ashford and the piratecolonel sought to veil their meanings will be found on page 31
