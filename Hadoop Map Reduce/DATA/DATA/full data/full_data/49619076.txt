one an absolute necessity to move and what is more to move in some particular direction a double necessity then to get on the move and to know whither  why cant one sit still here in sicily it is so pleasant the sunny ionian sea the changing jewel of calabria like a fireopal moved in the light italy and the panorama of christmas clouds night with the dogstar laying a long luminous gleam across the sea as if baying at us orion marching above how the dogstar sirius looks at one looks at one he is the hound of heaven green glamorous and fierceand then oh regal evening star hung westward flaring over the jagged dark precipices of tall sicily then etna that wicked witch resting her thick white snow under heaven and slowly slowly rolling her orangecoloured smoke they called her the pillar of heaven the greeks it seems wrong at first for she trails up in a long magical flexible line from the seas edge to her blunt cone and does not seem tall she seems rather low under heaven but as one knows her better oh awe and wizardy remote under heaven aloof so near yet never with us the painters try to paint her and the photographers to photograph her in vain because why because the near ridges with their olives and white houses these are with us because the riverbed and naxos under the lemon groves greek naxos deep under darkleaved manyfruited lemon groves etnas skirts and skirtbottoms these still are our world our own world even the high villages among the oaks on etna but etna herself etna of the snow and secret changing winds she is beyond a crystal wall when i look at her low white witchlike under heaven slowly rolling her orange smoke and giving sometimes a breath of rosered flame then i must look away from earth into the ether into the low empyrean and there in that remote region etna is alone if you would see her you must slowly take off your eyes from the world and go a naked seer to the strange chamber of the empyrean pedestal of heaven the greeks had a sense of the magic truth of things thank goodness one still knows enough about them to find ones kinship at last there are so many photographs there are so infinitely many watercolour drawings and oil paintings which purport to render etna but pedestal of heaven you must cross the invisible border between the foreground which is our own and etna pivot of winds in lower heaven there is a dividing line you must change your state of mind a metempsychosis it is no use thinking you can see and behold etna and the foreground both at once never one or the other foreground and a transcribed etna or etna pedestal of heaven  why then must one go why not stay ah what a mistress this etna with her strange winds prowling round her like circes panthers some black some white with her strange remote communications and her terrible dynamic exhalations she makes men mad such terrible vibrations of wicked and beautiful electricity she throws about her like a deadly net nay sometimes verily one can feel a new current of her demon magnetism seize ones living tissue and change the peaceful life of ones active cells she makes a storm in the living plasm and a new adjustment and sometimes it is like a madness  this timeless grecian etna in her lowerheaven loveliness so lovely so lovely what a torturer not many men can really stand her without losing their souls she is like circe unless a man is very strong she takes his soul away from him and leaves him not a beast but an elemental creature intelligent and soulless intelligent almost inspired and soulless like the etna sicilians intelligent daimons and humanly according to us the most stupid people on earth ach horror how many men how many races has etna put to flight it was she who broke the quick of the greek soul and after the greeks she gave the romans the normans the arabs the spaniards the french the italians even the english she gave them all their inspired hour and broke their souls  perhaps it is she one must flee from at any rate one must go and at once after having come back only at the end of october already one must dash away and it is only the third of january and one cannot afford to move yet there you are at the etna bidding one goes                                       where does one go there is girgenti by the south there is tunis at hand girgenti and the sulphur spirit and the greek guarding temples to make one madder never neither syracuse and the madness of its great quarries tunis africa not yet not yet not the arabs not yet naples rome florence no good at all where then  where then spain or sardinia spain or sardinia sardinia which is like nowhere sardinia which has no history no date no race no offering let it be sardinia they say neither romans nor phoenicians greeks nor arabs ever subdued sardinia it lies outside outside the circuit of civilisation like the basque lands sure enough it is italian now with its railways and its motoromnibuses but there is an uncaptured sardinia still it lies within the net of this european civilisation but it isnt landed yet and the net is getting old and tattered a good many fish are slipping through the net of the old european civilisation like that great whale of russia and probably even sardinia sardinia then let it be sardinia                                       there is a fortnightly boat sailing from palermonext wednesday three days ahead let us go then away from abhorred etna and the ionian sea and these great stars in the water and the almond trees in bud and the orange trees heavy with red fruit and these maddening exasperating impossible sicilians who never knew what truth was and have long lost all notion of what a human being is a sort of sulphureous demons andiamo  but let me confess in parenthesis that i am not at all sure whether i dont really prefer these demons to our sanctified humanity  why does one create such discomfort for oneself to have to get up in the middle of the nighthalf past oneto go and look at the clock of course this fraud of an american watch has stopped with its impudent phosphorescent face half past one half past one and a dark january night ah well half past one and an uneasy sleep till at last it is five oclock then light a candle and get up  the dreary black morning the candlelight the house looking nightdismal ah well one does all these things for ones pleasure so light the charcoal fire and put the kettle on the queen bee shivering round half dressed fluttering her unhappy candle  its fun she says shuddering  great say i grim as death  first fill the thermos with hot tea then fry bacongood english bacon from malta a godsend indeedand make bacon sandwiches make also sandwiches of scrambled eggs make also bread and butter also a little toast for breakfastand more tea but ugh who wants to eat at this unearthly hour especially when one is escaping from bewitched sicily  fill the little bag we call the kitchenino methylated spirit a small aluminium saucepan a spiritlamp two spoons two forks a knife two aluminium plates salt sugar teawhat else the thermos flask the various sandwiches four apples and a little tin of butter so much for the kitchenino for myself and the queen bee then my knapsack and the qbs handbag  under the lid of the halfcloudy night sky far away at the rim of the ionian sea the first light like metal fusing so swallow the cup of tea and the bit of toast hastily wash up so that we can find the house decent when we come back shut the doorwindows of the upper terrace and go down lock the door the upper half of the house made fast  the sky and sea are parting like an oyster shell with a low red gape looking across from the veranda at it one shivers not that it is cold the morning is not at all cold but the ominousness of it that long red slit between a dark sky and a dark ionian sea terrible old bivalve which has held life between its lips so long and here at this house we are ledged so awfully above the dawn naked to it  fasten the doorwindows of the lower veranda one wont fasten at all the summer heat warped it one way the masses of autumn rain warped it another put a chair against it lock the last door and hide the key sling the knapsack on ones back take the kitchenino in ones hand and look round the dawnred widening between the purpling sea and the troubled sky a light in the capucin convent across there cocks crowing and the long howling hiccuping melancholy bray of an ass all females are dead all femalesoch och ochhoooo ahaatheres one left so he ends on a moaning grunt of consolation this is what the arabs tell us an ass is howling when he brays                                       very dark under the great carob tree as we go down the steps dark still the garden scent of mimosa and then of jasmine the lovely mimosa tree invisible dark the stony path the goat whinnies out of her shed the broken roman tomb which lolls right over the garden track does not fall on me as i slip under its massive tilt ah dark garden dark garden with your olives and your wine your medlars and mulberries and many almond trees your steep terraces ledged high up above the sea i am leaving you slinking out out between the rosemary hedges out of the tall gate on to the cruel steep stony road so under the dark big eucalyptus trees over the stream and up towards the village there i have got so far                                       it is full dawndawn not morning the sun will not have risen the village is nearly all dark in the red light and asleep still no one at the fountain by the capucin gate too dark still one man leading a horse round the corner of the palazzo corvaia one or two dark men along the corso and so over the brow down the steep cobblestone street between the houses and out to the naked hill front this is the dawncoast of sicily nay the dawncoast of europe steep like a vast cliff dawnforward a red dawn with mingled curdling dark clouds and some gold it must be seven oclock the station down below by the sea and noise of a train yes a train and we still high on the steep track winding downwards but it is the train from messina to catania half an hour before ours which is from catania to messina                                       so jolt and drop and jolt down the old road that winds on the cliff face etna across there is smothered quite low quite low in a dense puther of inkblack clouds playing some devilry in private no doubt the dawn is angry red and yellow above the sea takes strange colors i hate the station pigmy drawn out there beside the sea on this steep face especially in the windless nooks the almond blossom is already out in little puffs and specks and stars it looks very like bits of snow scattered by winter bits of snow bits of blossom fourth day of the year 1921 only blossom and etna indescribably cloaked and secretive in her dense black clouds she has wrapped them quite round her quite low round her skirts                                       at last we are down we pass the pits where men are burning limeredhot round pitsand are out on the highway nothing can be more depressing than an italian highroad from syracuse to airolo it is the same horrible dreary slummy highroads the moment you approach a village or any human habitation here there is an acrid smell of lemon juice there is a factory for making citrate the houses flush on the road under the great limestone face of the hill open their slummy doors and throw out dirty water and coffee dregs we walk over the dirty water and coffee dregs mules rattle past with carts other people are going to the station we pass the dazio and are there                                       humanity is externally too much alike internally there are insuperable differences so one sits and thinks watching the people on the station like a line of caricatures between oneself and the naked sea and the uneasy clouding dawn  you would look in vain this morning for the swarthy feline southerner of romance it might as far as features are concerned be an early morning crowd waiting for the train on a north london suburb station as far as features go for some are fair and some colorless and none racially typical the only one that is absolutely like a race caricature is a tall stout elderly fellow with spectacles and a short nose and a bristling moustache and he is the german of the comic papers of twenty years ago but he is pure sicilian  they are mostly young fellows going up the line to messina to their job not artizans lower middle class and externally so like any other clerks and shopmen only rather more shabby much less socially selfconscious they are lively they throw their arms round one anothers necks they all but kiss one poor chap has had earache so a black kerchief is tied round his face and his black hat is perched above and a comic sight he looks no one seems to think so however yet they view my arrival with a knapsack on my back with cold disapprobation as unseemly as if i had arrived riding on a pig i ought to be in a carriage and the knapsack ought to be a new suitcase i know it but am inflexible  that is how they are each one thinks he is as handsome as adonis and as fetching as don juan extraordinary at the same time all flesh is grass and if a few trouserbuttons are missing or if a black hat perches above a thick black facemuffle and a long excruciated face it is all in the course of nature they seize the blackedged one by the arm and in profound commiseration do you suffer are you suffering they ask  and that also is how they are so terribly physically all over one another they pour themselves one over the other like so much melted butter over parsnips they catch each other under the chin with a tender caress of the hand and they smile with sunny melting tenderness into each others face never in the world have i seen such melting gay tenderness as between casual sicilians on railway platforms whether they be young leancheeked sicilians or huge stout sicilians  there must be something curious about the proximity of a volcano naples and catania alike the men are hugely fat with great macaroni paunches they are expansive and in a perfect drip of casual affection and love but the sicilians are even more wildly exuberant and fat and all over one another than the neapolitans they never leave off being amorously friendly with almost everybody emitting a relentless physical familiarity that is quite bewildering to one not brought up near a volcano  this is more true of the middle classes than of the lower the working men are perforce thinner and less exuberant but they hang together in clusters and can never be physically near enough                                       it is only thirty miles to messina but the train takes two hours it winds and hurries and stops beside the lavender grey morning sea a flock of goats trail over the beach near the lapping waves edge dismally great wide deserts of stony riverbeds run down to the sea and men on asses are picking their way across and women are kneeling by the small streamchannel washing clothes the lemons hang pale and innumerable in the thick lemon groves lemon trees like italians seem to be happiest when they are touching one another all round solid forests of not very tall lemon trees lie between the steep mountains and the sea on the strip of plain women vague in the orchard undershadow are picking the lemons lurking as if in the undersea there are heaps of pale yellow lemons under the trees they look like pale primrosesmouldering fires curious how like fires the heaps of lemons look under the shadow of foliage seeming to give off a pallid burning amid the suave naked greenish trunks when there comes a cluster of orange trees the oranges are red like coals among the darker leaves but lemons lemons innumerable speckled like innumerable tiny stars in the green firmament of leaves so many lemons think of all the lemonade crystals they will be reduced to think of america drinking them up next summer                                       i always wonder why such vast wide riverbeds of pale boulders come out of the heart of the highrearing dramatic stone mountains a few miles to the sea a few miles only and never more than a few threading watertrickles in riverbeds wide enough for the rhine but that is how it is the landscape is ancient and classicromantic as if it had known faroff days and fiercer rivers and more verdure steep craggy wild the land goes up to its points and precipices a tangle of heights but all jammed on top of one another and in old landscapes as in old people the flesh wears away and the bones become prominent rock sticks up fantastically the jungle of peaks in this old sicily                                       the sky is all grey the straits are grey reggio just across the water is white looking under the great dark toe of calabria the toe of italy on aspromonte there is grey cloud it is going to rain after such marvelous ringing blue days it is going to rain what luck                                       aspromonte garibaldi i could always cover my face when i see it aspromonte i wish garibaldi had been prouder why did he go off so humbly with his bag of seedcorn and a flea in his ear when his majesty king victor emmanuel arrived with his little short legs on the scene poor garibaldi he wanted to be a hero and a dictator of free sicily well one cant be a dictator and humble at the same time one must be a hero which he was and proud which he wasnt besides people dont nowadays choose proud heroes for governors anything but they prefer constitutional monarchs who are paid servants and who know it that is democracy democracy admires its own servants and nothing else and you couldnt make a real servant even of garibaldi only of his majesty king victor emmanuel so italy chose victor emmanuel and garibaldi went off with a corn bag and a whack on the behind like a humble ass                                       it is rainingdismally dismally raining and this is messina coming oh horrible messina earthquakeshattered and renewing your youth like a vast mining settlement with rows and streets and miles of concrete shanties squalor and a big street with shops and gaps and broken houses still just back of the tramlines and a dreary squalid earthquakehopeless port in a lovely harbor people dont forget and dont recover the people of messina seem to be today what they were nearly twenty years ago after the earthquake people who have had a terrible shock and for whom all lifes institutions are really nothing neither civilization nor purpose the meaning of everything all came down with a smash in that shuddering earthquake and nothing remains but money and the throes of some sort of sensation messina between the volcanoes etna and stromboli having known the deathagonys terror i always dread coming near the awful place yet i have found the people kind almost feverishly so as if they knew the awful need for kindness                                       raining raining hard clambering down on to the wet platform and walking across the wet lines to the cover many human beings scurrying across the wet lines among the wet trains to get out into the ghastly town beyond thank heaven one need not go out into the town two convicts chained together among the crowdand two soldiers the prisoners wear fawny homespun clothes of cloth such as the peasants weave with irregularly occurring brown stripes rather nice handmade rough stuff but linked together dear god and those horrid caps on their hairless foreheads no hair probably they are going to a convict station on the lipari islands the people take no notice  no but convicts are horrible creatures at least the old one is with his long nasty face his long cleanshaven horrible face without emotions or with emotions one cannot follow something cold sightless a sightless ugly look i should loathe to have to touch him of the other i am not so sure he is younger and with dark eyebrows but a roundish softish face with a sort of leer no evil is horrible i used to think there was no absolute evil now i know there is a great deal so much that it threatens life altogether that ghastly abstractness of criminals they dont know any more what other people feel yet some horrible force drives them  it is a great mistake to abolish the death penalty if i were dictator i should order the old one to be hung at once i should have judges with sensitive living hearts not abstract intellects and because the instinctive heart recognised a man as evil i would have that man destroyed quickly because good warm life is now in danger                                       standing on messina stationdreary dreary holeand watching the winter rain and seeing the pair of convicts i must remember again oscar wilde on reading platform a convict what a terrible mistake to let oneself be martyred by a lot of canaille a man must say his say but noli me tangere  curious these people are up and down up and down go a pair of officials the young one in a black goldlaced cap talks to the elder in a scarlet goldlaced cap and he walks the young one with a mad little hop and his fingers fly as if he wanted to scatter them to the four winds of heaven and his words go off like fireworks with more than sicilian speed on and on up and down and his eye is dark and excited and unseeing like the eye of a fleeing rabbit strange and beside itself is humanity                                       what a lot of officials you know them by their caps elegant tubby little officials in kidandpatent boots and goldlaced caps tall longnosed ones in more goldlaced caps like angels in and out of the gates of heaven they thread in and out of the various doors as far as i can see there are three scarlet stationmasters five blackandgold substationmasters and a countless number of principalities and powers in more or less broken boots and official caps they are like bees round a hive humming in an important conversazione and occasionally looking at some paper or other and extracting a little official honey but the conversazione is the affair of affairs to an italian official life seems to be one long and animated conversationthe italian word is betterinterrupted by casual trains and telephones and besides the angels of heavens gates there are the mere ministers porters lampcleaners etc these stand in groups and talk socialism a lampman slashes along swinging a couple of lamps bashes one against a barrow smash goes the glass looks down as if to say what do you mean by it glances over his shoulder to see if any member of the higher hierarchies is looking seven members of higher hierarchies are assiduously not looking on goes the minister with the lamp blithely another pane or two gone vogue la galère  passengers have gathered again some in hoods some in nothing youths in thin paltry clothes stand out in the pouring rain as if they did not know it was raining one sees their coatshoulders soaked and yet they do not trouble to keep under shelter two large station dogs run about and trot through the standing trains just like officials they climb up the footboard hop into a train and hop out casually when they feel like it two or three portporters in canvas hats as big as umbrellas literally spreading like huge fins over their shoulders are looking into more empty trains more and more people appear more and more official caps stand about it rains and rains the train for palermo and the train for syracuse are both an hour late already coming from the port fleabite though these are the great connections from rome  loose locomotives trundle back and forth vaguely like black dogs running and turning back the port is only four minutes walk if it were not raining so hard we would go down walk along the lines and get into the waiting train down there anybody may please himself there is the funnel of the great unwieldy ferryobjectshe is just edging in that means the connection from the mainland at last but it is cold standing here we eat a bit of bread and butter from the kitchenino in resignation after all what is an hour and a half it might just as easily be five hours as it was the last time we came down from rome and the wagonlit booked to syracuse calmly left stranded in the station of messina to go no further all get out and find yourselves rooms for the night in vile messina syracuse or no syracuse malta boat or no malta boat we are the ferrovia dello stato  but there why grumble noi italiani siamo così buoni take it from their own mouth                                       ecco finalmente the crowd is quite joyful as the two express trains surge proudly in after their halfamile creep plenty of room for once though the carriage floor is a puddle and the roof leaks this is second class                                       slowly with two engines we grunt and chuff and twist to get over the breakneck heights that shut messina in from the north coast the windows are opaque with steam and drops of rain no mattertea from the thermos flask to the great interest of the other two passengers who had nervously contemplated the unknown object  ha says he with joy seeing the hot tea come out it has the appearance of a bomb  beautiful hot says she with real admiration all apprehension at once dissipated peace reigns in the wet misthidden compartment we run through miles and miles of tunnel the italians have made wonderful roads and railways                                       if one rubs the window and looks out lemon groves with many wetwhite lemons earthquakebroken houses new shanties a grey weary sea on the right hand and on the left the dim grey complication of steep heights from which issue stone riverbeds of inordinate width and sometimes a road a man on a mule sometimes near at hand longhaired melancholy goats leaning sideways like tilted ships under the eaves of some scabby house they call the houseeaves the dogs umbrellas in town you see the dogs trotting close under the wall out of the wet here the goats lean like rock listing inwards to the plaster wall why look out  sicilian railways are all single line hence the coincidenza a coincidenza is where two trains meet in a loop you sit in a world of rain and waiting until some silly engine with four trucks puffs alongside ecco la coincidenza then after a brief conversazione between the two trains diretto and merce express and goods the tin horn sounds and away we go happily towards the next coincidence clerks away ahead joyfully chalk up our hours of lateness on the announcement slate all adds to the adventurous flavour of the journey dear heart we come to a station where we find the other diretto the express from the other direction awaiting our coincidential arrival the two trains run alongside one another like two dogs meeting in the street and snuffing one another every official rushes to greet every other official as if they were all david and jonathan meeting after a crisis they rush into each others arms and exchange cigarettes and the trains cant bear to part and the station cant bear to part with us the officials tease themselves and us with the word pronto meaning ready pronto and again pronto and shrill whistles anywhere else a train would go off its tormented head but no here only that angels trump of an official little horn will do the business and get them to blow that horn if you can they cant bear to part                                       rain continual rain a level grey wet sky a level grey wet sea a wet and misty train winding round and round the little bays diving through tunnels ghosts of the unpleasantlooking lipari islands standing a little way out to sea heaps of shadow deposited like rubbish heaps in the universal greyness                                       enter more passengers an enormously large woman with an extraordinarily handsome face an extraordinarily large man quite young and a diminutive servant a little girlchild of about thirteen with a beautiful facebut the junoit is she who takes my breath away she is quite young in her thirties still she has that queenly stupid beauty of a classic hera a pure brow with level dark brows large dark bridling eyes a straight nose a chiselled mouth an air of remote selfconsciousness she sends ones heart straight back to pagan days andandshe is simply enormous like a house she wears a black toque with stickingup wings and a black rabbit fur spread on her shoulders she edges her way in carefully and once seated is terrified to rise to her feet she sits with that motionlessness of her type closed lips face muted and expressionless and she expects me to admire her i can see that she expects me to pay homage to her beauty just to that not homage to herself but to her as a bel pezzo she casts little aloof glances at me under her eyelids  it is evident she is a country beauty become a bourgeoise she speaks unwillingly to the other squinteyed passenger a young woman who also wears a blackrabbit fur but without pretensions  the husband of juno is a freshfaced bourgeois young fellow and he also is simply huge his waistcoat would almost make the overcoat of the fourth passenger the unshaven companion of the squinting young woman the young jupiter wears kid gloves a significant fact here he too has pretensions but he is quite affable with the unshaven one and speaks italian unaffectedly whereas juno speaks the dialect with affectation  no one takes any notice of the little maid she has a gentle virgin moonface and those lovely grey sicilian eyes that are translucent and into which the light sinks and becomes black sometimes sometimes dark blue she carries the bag and the extra coat of the huge juno and sits on the edge of the seat between me and the unshaven juno having motioned her there with a regal inclination of the head  the little maid is rather frightened perhaps she is an orphan childprobably her nutbrown hair is smoothly parted and done in two pigtails she wears no hat as is proper for her class on her shoulders one of those little knitted grey shouldercapes that one associates with orphanages her stuff dress is dark grey her boots are strong  the smooth moonlike expressionless virgin face rather pale and touching rather frightened of the girlchild a perfect face from a mediaeval picture it moves one strangely why it is so unconscious as we are conscious like a little muted animal it sits there in distress she is going to be sick she goes into the corridor and is sickvery sick leaning her head like a sick dog on the windowledge jupiter towers above hernot unkind and apparently feeling no repugnance the physical convulsion of the girl does not affect him as it affects us he looks on unmoved merely venturing to remark that she had eaten too much before coming on to the train an obviously true remark after which he comes and talks a few commonplaces to me by and by the girlchild creeps in again and sits on the edge of the seat facing juno but no says juno if she is sick she will be sick over me so jupiter accommodatingly changes places with the girlchild who is thus next to me she sits on the edge of the seat with folded little red hands her face pale and expressionless beautiful the thin line of her nutbrown eyebrows the dark lashes of the silent pellucid dark eyes silent motionless like a sick animal  but juno tells her to wipe her splashed boots the child gropes for a piece of paper juno tells her to take her pocket handkerchief feebly the sick girlchild wipes her boots then leans back but no good she has to go in the corridor and be sick again  after a while they all get out queer to see people so natural neither juno nor jupiter is in the least unkind he even seems kind but they are just not upset not half as upset as we arethe qb wanting to administer tea and so on we should have to hold the childs head they just quite naturally leave it alone to its convulsions and are neither distressed nor repelled it just is so  their naturalness seems unnatural to us yet i am sure it is best sympathy would only complicate matters and spoil that strange remote virginal quality the qb says it is largely stupidity                                       nobody washes out the corner of the corridor though we stop at stations long enough and there are two more hours journey train officials go by and stare passengers step over and stare newcomers stare and step over somebody asks who nobody thinks of just throwing a pail of water why should they it is all in the course of natureone begins to be a bit chary of this same nature in the south                                       enter two fresh passengers a blackeyed roundfaced brightsharp man in corduroys and with a gun and a longfaced freshcolored man with thick snowy hair and a new hat and a long black overcoat of smooth black cloth lined with rather ancient once expensive fur he is extremely proud of this long black coat and ancient fur lining childishly proud he wraps it again over his knee and gloats the beady blackeyes of the hunter look round with pleased alertness he sits facing the one in the overcoat who looks like the last sprout of some norman blood the hunter in corduroys beams abroad with beady black eyes in a round red face curious and the other tucks his furlined long coat between his legs and gloats to himself all to himself gloating and looking as if he were deaf but no hes not he wears muddy highlow boots  at termini it is already lamplight business men crowd in we get five business men all stout respected palermitans the one opposite me has whiskers and a manycolored patched traveling rug over his fat knees queer how they bring that feeling of physical intimacy with them you are never surprised if they begin to take off their boots or their collarandtie the whole world is a sort of bedroom to them one shrinks but in vain  there is some conversation between the blackeyed beady hunter and the business men also the young whitehaired one the aristocrat tries to stammer out at great length a few words as far as i can gather the young one is mador derangedand the other the hunter is his keeper they are traveling over europe together there is some talk of the count and the hunter says the unfortunate has had an accident but that is a southern gentleness presumably a form of speech anyhow it is queer and the hunter in his corduroys with his round ruddy face and strange blackbright eyes and thin black hair is a puzzle to me even more than the albino longcoated longfaced freshcomplexioned queer last remnant of a baron as he is they are both muddy from the land and pleased in a little mad way of their own  but it is halfpast six we are at palermo capital of sicily the hunter slings his gun over his shoulder i my knapsack and in the throng we all disappear into the via maqueda                                       palermo has two great streets the via maqueda and the corso which cross each other at rightangles the via maqueda is narrow with narrow little pavements and is always choked with carriages and footpassengers  it had ceased raining but the narrow road was paved with large convex slabs of hard stone inexpressibly greasy to cross the via maqueda therefore was a feat however once accomplished it was done the near end of the street was rather dark and had mostly vegetable shops abundance of vegetablespiles of whiteandgreen fennel like celery and great sheaves of young purplish seadustcolored artichokes nodding their buds piles of big radishes scarlet and bluey purple carrots long strings of dried figs mountains of big oranges scarlet large peppers a last slice of pumpkin a great mass of colors and vegetable freshnesses a mountain of blackpurple cauliflowers like niggers heads and a mountain of snowwhite ones next to them how the dark greasy nightstricken street seems to beam with these vegetables all this fresh delicate flesh of luminous vegetables piled there in the air and in the recesses of the windowless little caverns of the shops and gleaming forth on the dark air under the lamps the qb at once wants to buy vegetables look look at the snowwhite broccoli look at the huge finocchi why dont we get them i must have some look at those great clusters of datesten francs a kilo and we pay sixteen its monstrous our place is simply monstrous  for all that one doesnt buy vegetables to take to sardinia  cross the corso at that decorated maelstrom and deathtrap of the quattro canti i of course am nearly knocked down and killed somebody is nearly knocked down and killed every two minutes but therethe carriages are light and the horses curiously aware creatures they would never tread on one  the second part of the via maqueda is the swell part silks and plumes and an infinite number of shirts and ties and cufflinks and mufflers and mens fancies one realises here that mandrapery and manunderwear is quite as important as womans if not more  i of course in a rage the qb stares at every rag and stitch and crosses and recrosses this infernal dark stream of a via maqueda which as i have said is choked solid with strollers and carriages be it remembered that i have on my back the brown knapsack and the qb carries the kitchenino this is enough to make a travelling menagerie of us if i had my shirt sticking out behind and if the qb had happened merely to catch up the tablecloth and wrap it round her as she came out all well and good but a big brown knapsack and a basket with thermos flask etc no one could not expect such things to pass in a southern capital  but i am casehardened and i am sick of shops true we have not been in a town for three months but can i care for the innumerable fantasias in the drapery line every wretched bit of wouldbeextra chic is called a fantasia the word goes lugubriously to my bowels  suddenly i am aware of the qb darting past me like a storm suddenly i see her pouncing on three giggling young hussies just in frontthe inevitable black velveteen tam the inevitable white curly muffler the inevitable lowerclass flappers did you want something have you something to say is there something that amuses you ohh you must laugh must you ohlaugh ohh why why you ask why havent i heard you ohyou spik ingleesh you spik ingleesh yeswhy thats why yes thats why  the three giggling young hussies shrink together as if they would all hide behind one another after a vain uprearing and a demand why madam tells them why so they uncomfortably squeeze together under the unexpected strokes of the qbs sledgehammer italian and more than sledgehammer retaliation there full in the via maqueda they edge round one another each attempting to get back of the other away from the looming qb i perceive that this rotary motion is equivalent to a standstill so feel called upon to say something in the manly line  beastly palermo badmanners i say and throw a nonchalant ignoranti at the end in a tone of dismissal  which does it off they go downstream still huddling and shrinking like boats that are taking sails in and peeping to see if we are coming yes my dears we are coming  why do you bother say i to the qb who is towering with rage  theyve followed us the whole length of the streetwith their sacco militario and their parlano inglese and their you spik ingleesh and their jeering insolence but the english are fools they always put up with this italian impudence  which is perhaps truebut this knapsack it might be full of bronzeroaring geese it would not attract more attention  however and however it is seven oclock and the shops are beginning to shut no more shopgazing only one lovely place raw ham boiled ham chickens in aspic chicken volauvents sweet curds curdcheese rustic cheesecake smoked sausages beautiful fresh mortadella huge mediterranean red lobsters and those lobsters without claws so good so good we stand and cry it aloud  but this shop too is shutting i ask a man for the hotel pantechnico and treating me in that gentle strangely tender southern manner he takes me and shows me he makes me feel such a poor frail helpless leaf a foreigner you know a bit of an imbecile poor dear hold his hand and show him the way                                       to sit in the room of this young american woman with its blue hangings and talk and drink tea till midnght ah these naïve americansthey are a good deal older and shrewder than we once it nears the point and they all seem to feel as if the world were coming to an end and they are so truly generous of their hospitality in this cold world     ii  the sea   the fat old porter knocks ah me once more it is dark get up again before dawn a dark sky outside cloudy the thrilling tinkle of innumerable goatbells as the first flock enters the city such a rippling sound well it must be morning even if one shivers at it and at least it does not rain                                       that pale bluish theatrical light outside of the first dawn and a cold wind we come on to the wide desolate quay the curve of the harbour panormus that horrible dawnpallor of a cold sea out there and here port mud greasy and fish and refuse the american girl is with us wrapped in her sweater a coarse cold blackslimy world she seems as if she would melt away before it but these frail creatures what a lot they can go through  illustration map for sea and sardinia  across the great wide badly paved mudgreasy despairing road of the quay side and to the sea there lies our steamer over there in the dawndusk of the basin half visible that one who is smoking her cigarette says the porter she looks little beside the huge city of trieste who is lying up next her                                       our rowboat is hemmed in by many empty boats huddled to the side of the quay she works her way out like a sheepdog working his way out of a flock of sheep or like a boat through packice we are on the open basin the rower stands up and pushes the oars from him he gives a long melancholy cry to someone on the quay the water goes chockchock against the urging bows the wind is chill the fantastic peaks behind palermo show halfghostly in a halfdark sky the dawn seems reluctant to come our steamer still smokes her cigarettemeaning the funnelsmokeacross there so one sits still and crosses the level space of halfdark water masts of sailingships and spars cluster on the left on the undarkening sky                                       climb up climb up this is our ship up we go up the ladder oh but says the american girl isnt she small isnt she impossibly small oh my will you go in such a little thing oh dear thirty two hours in such a little boat why no i wouldnt care for it at all  a bunch of stewards cooks waiters engineers pancleaners and whatnot mostly in black canvas jackets nobody else on the ship a little black bunch of loutish crew with nothing to do and we the first passengers served up to be jeered at there you are in the grey light  who is going  we twothe signorina is not going  tickets  these are casual proletarian manners  we are taken into the one long room with a long table and many maplegolden doors alternate panels having a wedgewood blueandwhite picture inserteda wouldbe goddess of white marble on a blue ground like a healthsalts hygeia advertisement one of the plain panels opensour cabin  oh dear why it isnt as big as a chinacloset however will you get in cries the american girl  one at a time say i  but its the tiniest place i ever saw  it really was tiny one had to get into a bunk to shut the door that did not matter to me i am no titanic american i pitched the knapsack on one bunk the kitchenino on the other and we shut the door the cabin disappeared into a maplewood panel of the long subterranean stateroom  why is this the only place youve got to sit in cried the american girl but how perfectly awful no air and so dark and smelly why i never saw such a boat will you really go will you really  the stateroom was truly rather subterranean and stuffy with nothing but a long table and an uncanny company of screwpin chairs seated thereat and no outlet to the air at all but it was not so bad otherwise to me who have never been out of europe those maplewood panels and ebony curvesand those hygeias they went all round even round the curve at the dim distant end and back up the near side yet how beautiful old goldcoloured maplewood is how very lovely with the ebony curves of the door arch there was a wonderful oldfashioned victorian glow in it and a certain splendour even one could bear the hygeias let in under glassthe colour was right that wedgewood and white in such lovely gold lustre there was a certain homely grandeur still in the days when this ship was built a richness of choice material and healthsalts hygeias wedgewood greek goddesses on advertisement placards yet they werent advertisements that was what really worried me they never had been perhaps weegos health salts stole her later                                       we have no coffeethat goes without saying nothing doing so early the crew still stands in a gang exactly like a gang of louts at a streetcorner and theyve got the street all to themselvesthis ship we climb to the upper deck                                       she is a long slender old steamer with one little funnel and she seems so deserted now that one cant see the streetcorner gang of the casual crew they are just below our ship is deserted  the dawn is wanly blueing the sky is a curdle of cloud there is a bit of pale gold eastwards beyond monte pellegrino the wind blows across the harbour the hills behind palermo prick up their ears on the skyline the city lies unseen near us and level therea big ship is coming in the naples boat  and the little boats keep putting off from the near quay and coming to us we watch a stout officer cavalry in grayeygreen with a big darkblue cloak lined with scarlet the scarlet lining keeps flashing he has a little beard and his uniform is not quite clean he has big wooden chests tied with rope for luggage poor and of no class yet that scarlet splendid lining and the spurs it seems a pity they must go secondclass yet so it is he goes forward when the dock porter has hoisted those wooden boxes no fellowpassenger yet  boats still keep coming haha here is the commissariat various sides of kid ready for roasting various chickens fennel like celery wine in a bottiglione new bread packages hand them up hand them up good food cries the qb in anticipation  it must be getting near time to go two more passengersyoung thick men in black broadcloth standing up in the stern of a little boat their hands in their pockets looking a little cold about the chin not quite italian too sturdy and manly sardinians from cagliari as a matter of fact                                       we go down from the chill upperdeck it is growing full day bits of pale gold are flying among delicate but cold flakes of cloud from the east over monte pellegrino bits of very new turquoise sky come out palermo on the left crouches upon her allharboura little desolate disorderly endoftheworld endofthesea along her quay front even from here we can see the yellow carts rattling slowly the mules nodding their high weird plumes of scarlet along the broad weary harbourside oh painted carts of sicily with all history on your panels                                       arrives an individual at our side the captain fears it will not be possible to start there is much wind outside much wind  how they love to come up with alarming disquieting or annoying news the joy it gives them what satisfaction on all the faces of course all the other loafers are watching us the streetcorner loungers of this deck but we have been many times bitten  ah ma say i looking at the sky not so much wind as all that  an air of quiet shrugging indifference is most effectual as if you knew all about it a good deal more than they knew  ah si molto vento molto vento outside outside  with a long face and a dramatic gesture he points out of the harbour to the grey sea i too look out of the harbour at the pale line of sea beyond the mole but i do not trouble to answer and my eye is calm so he goes away only half triumphant                                       things seem to get worse and worse cries the american friend what will you do on such a boat if you have an awful time out in the mediterranean here oh nowill you risk it really wont you go from cività vecchia  how awful it will be cries the qb looking round the grey harbour the many masts clustering in the grey sky on the right the big naples boat turning her posterior to the quayside a little way off and cautiously budging backwards the almost entirely shutin harbour the bits of blue and flying white cloud overhead the little boats like beetles scuttling hither and thither across the basin the thick crowd on the quay come to meet the naples boat                                       time time the american friend must go she bids us goodbye more than sympathetically  i shall be awfully interested to hear how you get on  so down the side she goes the boatman wants twenty francswants morebut doesnt get it he gets ten which is five too much and so sitting rather small and pinched and coldlooking huddled in her sweater she bibbles over the ripply water to the distant stone steps we wave farewell but other traffic comes between us and the qb feeling nervous is rather cross because the american friends ideas of luxury have put us in such a poor light we feel like the poorest of poor seafaring relations                                       our ship is hooting for all shes worth an important lastminuter comes surging up the rope hawsers are being wound clankily in seagullsthey are never very many in the mediterraneanseagulls whirl like a few flakes of snow in the upper chill air clouds spin and without knowing it we are evaporating away from the shore from our mooring between the great city of trieste and another big black steamer that lies like a wall we breathe towards this second black wall of steamer distinctly and of course an individual in an official cap is standing on the bottom of our departure ladder just above the water yelling barca barcashouting for a boat and an old man on the sea stands up to his oars and comes pushing his clumsy boat with gathering speed between us and the other black wall there he stands away below there small firing his clumsy boat along remote as if in a picture on the dark green water and our black side insidiously and evilly aspires to the other huge black wall he rows in the canyon between and is nearly here  when lo the individual on the bottom step turns in the other direction another boat from the open basin is sweeping up it is a race she is near she is nearer she is up with a curvet the boat from the open rounds up at the ladder the boat between the gulf backs its oars the official individual shouts and waves the old man backing his oars in the gulf below yells expostulation the boat from the open carries off its prey our ship begins slowly to puddlepuddlepuddle working her screw the man in the gulf of green water rows for his lifewe are floating into the open basin  slowly slowly we turn round and as the ship turns our hearts turn palermo fades from our consciousness the naples boat the disembarking crowds the rattling carriages to the landthe great city of triesteall fades from our heart we see only the open gap of the harbour entrance and the level palegrey void of the sea beyond there are wisps of gleamy lightout there  and out there our heart watchesthough palermo is near us just behind we look round and see it all behind usbut already it is gone gone from our heart the fresh wind the gleamy wisps of light the running open sea beyond the harbour bars                                       and so we steam out and almost at once the ship begins to take a long slow dizzy dip and a fainting swoon upwards and a long slow dizzy dip slipping away from beneath one the qb turns pale up comes the deck in that fainting swoon backwardsthen down it fades in that indescribable slither forwards it is all quite gentlequite quite gentle but oh so long and so slow and so dizzy  rather pleasant say i to the qb  yes rather lovely really she answers wistfully to tell the truth there is something in the long slow lift of the ship and her long slow slide forwards which makes my heart beat with joy it is the motion of freedom to feel her come upthen slide slowly forward with a sound of the smashing of waters is like the magic gallop of the sky the magic gallop of elemental space that long slow waveringly rhythmic rise and fall of the ship with waters snorting as it were from her nostrils oh god what a joy it is to the wild innermost soul one is free at lastand lilting in a slow flight of the elements winging outwards oh god to be free of all the hemmedin lifethe horror of human tension the absolute insanity of machine persistence the agony which a train is to me really and the longdrawnout agony of a life among tense resistant people on land and then to feel the long slow lift and drop of this almost empty ship as she took the waters ah god liberty liberty elemental liberty i wished in my soul the voyage might last forever that the sea had no end that one might float in this wavering tremulous yet long and surging pulsation while ever time lasted space never exhausted and no turning back no looking back even                                       the ship was almost emptysave of course for the streetcorner louts who hung about just below on the deck itself we stood alone on the weatherfaded little promenade deck which has old oak seats with old carved little lions at the ends for armrestsand a little cabin mysteriously shut which much peeping determined as the wireless office and the operators little curtained bedniche                                       cold fresh wind a blackblue translucent rolling sea on which the wake rose in snapping foam and sicily on the left monte pellegrino a huge inordinate mass of pinkish rock hardly crisped with the faintest vegetation looming up to heaven from the sea strangely large in mass and bulk monte pellegrino looks and bare like a sahara in heaven and oldlooking these coasts of sicily are very imposing terrific fortifying the interior and again one gets the feeling that age has worn them bare as if old old civilisations had worn away and exhausted the soil leaving a terrifying blankness of rock as at syracuse in plateaus and here in a great mass                                       there seems hardly any one on board but ourselves we alone on the little promenade deck strangely lonely floating on a bare old ship past the great bare shores on a rolling sea stooping and rising in the wind the wood of the fittings is all bare and weathersilvered the cabin the seats even the little lions of the seats the paint wore away long ago and this timber will never see paint any more strange to put ones hand on the old oaken wood so seafibred good old delicatethreaded oak i swear it grew in england and everything so carefully done so solidly and everlastingly i look at the lions with the perfectfitting oaken pins through their paws clinching them down and their little mouths open they are as solid as they were in victorian days as immovable they will never wear away what a joy in the careful thorough manly everlasting work put into a ship at least into this sixtyyearold vessel every bit of this old oak wood so sound so beautiful and the whole welded together with joints and wooden pins far more beautifully and livingly than iron welds rustless lifeborn livingtissued old wood rustless as flesh is rustless and happyseeming as iron never can be she rides so well she takes the sea so beautifully as a matter of course                                       various members of the crew wander past to look at us this little promenade deck is over the firstclass quarters full in the stern so we see first one head then another come up the laddermostly bare heads and one figure after another slouches past smoking a cigarette all crew at last the qb stops one of themit is what they are all waiting for an opportunity to talkand asks if the weird object on the top of pellegrino is a ruin could there be a more touristy question no it is the semaphore station slap in the eye for the qb she doesnt mind however and the member of the crew proceeds to converse he is a weedy hollowcheeked townproduct a palermitan he wears faded blue overalls and informs us he is the ships carpenter happily unemployed for the rest of his life apparently and taking it as rather less than his dues the ship once did the naplespalermo coursea very important coursein the old days of the general navigation company the general navigation company sold her for eighty thousand liras years ago and now she was worth two million we pretend to believe but i make a poor show i am thoroughly sick to death of the sound of liras no man can overhear ten words of italian today without two thousand or two million or ten or twenty or two liras flying like venomous mosquitoes round his ears lirasliraslirasnothing else romantic poetic cypressandorangetree italy is gone remains an italy smothered in the filthy smother of innumerable lira notes ragged unsavoury paper money so thick upon the air that one breathes it like some greasy fog behind this greasy fog some people may still see the italian sun i find it hard work through this murk of liras you peer at michael angelo and at botticelli and the rest and see them all as through a glass darkly for heavy around you is italys afterthewar atmosphere darkly pressing you squeezing you milling you into dirty paper notes king harry was lucky that they only wanted to coin him into gold italy wants to mill you into filthy paper liras                                       another headand a black alpaca jacket and a serviette this timeto tell us coffee is ready not before it is time too we go down into the subterranean stateroom and sit on the screwpin chairs while the ship does the slideandslope trot under us and we drink a couple of cups of coffeeandmilk and eat a piece of bread and butter at least one of the innumerable members of the crew gives me one cup then casts me off it is most obviously his intention that i shall get no more because of course the innumerable members of the crew could all just do with another coffee and milk however though the ship heaves and the alpaca coats cluster menacingly in the doorway i balance my way to the tin buffet and seize the coffee pot and the milk pot and am quite successful in administering to the qb and myself having restored the said vessels to their tin altar i resume my spin chair at the long and desert board the qb and i are alonesave that in the distance a very fat back with goldbraid collar sits sideways and a fat hand disposes of various papershe is part of the oneandonly table of course the tall lean alpaca jacket with a face of yellow stone and a big black moustache moves from the outer doorway glowers at our filled cups and goes to the tin altar and touches the handles of the two vessels just touches them to an arrangement as one who should say these are mine what dirty foreigner dares help himself                                       as quickly as possible we stagger up from the long dungeon where the alpaca jackets are swooping like bluebottles upon the coffee pots into the air there the carpenter is waiting for us like a spider  isnt the sea a little quieter says the qb wistfully she is growing paler  no signorahow should it be says the gauntfaced carpenter the wind is waiting for us behind cape gallo you see that cape he points to a tall black clifffront in the sea ahead when we get to that cape we get the wind and the sea here he makes a gestureit is moderate  ugh says the qb turning paler im going to lie down  she disappears the carpenter finding me stony ground goes forward and i see him melting into the crowd of the innumerable crew that hovers on the lowerdeck passage by the kitchen and the engines                                       the clouds are flying fast overhead and sharp and isolated come drops of rain so that one thinks it must be spray but no it is a handful of rain the ship swishes and sinks forward gives a hollow thudding and rears slowly backward along this pinkish lofty coast of sicily that is just retreating into a bay from the open sea comes the rain come the long waves                                       no shelter one must go down the qb lies quietly in her bunk the stateroom is stale like a passage on the underground railway no shelter save near the kitchen and the engines where there is a bit of warmth the cook is busy cleaning fish making the whiting bite their tails venomously at a little board just outside his kitchenhole a slow stream of kitchenfilth swilkers back and forth along the ships side a gang of the crew leans near mea larger gang further down heaven knows what they can all bebut they never do anything but stand in gangs and talk and eat and smoke cigarettes they are mostly youngmostly palermitanwith a couple of unmistakable neapolitans having the peculiar neapolitan hangdog good looks the chiselled cheek the little black moustache the large eyes but they chew with their cheeks bulged out and laugh with their fine semisarcastic noses the whole gang looks continually sideways nobody ever commands themthere seems to be absolutely no control only the fat engineer in grey linen looks as clean and as competent as his own machinery queer how machinecontrol puts the pride and selfrespect into a man                                       the rain over i go and squat against the canvas that is spread over the arched skylights on the small promenade deck sitting on the seat that is fixed to the skylight sides the wind is cold there are snatches of sun and spits of rain the big cape has come and is being left behind we are heading for a faroff cape like a cloud in the grey air a dimness comes over ones mind a sort of stupefaction owing to the wind and the relentless slitherandrearing of the ship not a sickness but a sort of dim faintness so much motion such moving powerful air and withal a constant triumph in the long slow seagallop of the ship                                       a great loud bell midday and the crew going to eat rushing to eat after some time we are summoned the signora isnt eating asks the waiter eagerly hoping she is not yes she is eating say i i fetch the qb from her berth rather wanly she comes and gets into her spin chair bash comes a huge plate of thick oily cabbage soup very full swilkering over the sides we do what we can with it so does the third passenger a young woman who never wears a hat thereby admitting herself simply as one of the people but who has an expensive complicated dress niggercoloured thin silk stockings and suede highheeled shoes she is handsome sturdy with large dark eyes and a robust frank manner far too robustly downright for italy she is from cagliariand cant do much with the cabbage soup and tells the waiter so in her deep hailfellowwellmet voice in the doorway hovers a little cloud of alpaca jackets grinning faintly with malignant anticipation of food hoping like blowflies we shall be too ill to eat away goes the soup and appears a massive yellow omelette like some log of bilious wood it is hard and heavy and cooked in the usual ranktasting olive oil the young woman doesnt have much truck with it neither do we to the triumph of the blowflies who see the yellow monster borne to their altar after which a long long slab of the inevitable meat cut into innumerable slices tasting of dead nothingness and having a thick sauce of brown neutrality sufficient for twelve people at least this with masses of strongtasting greenish cauliflower liberally weighted with oil on a ship that was already heaving its heart out made up the dinner accumulating malevolent triumph among the blowflies in the passage so on to a dessert of oranges pears with wooden hearts and thick yellowish washleather flesh and apples then coffee  and we had sat through it which is something the alpaca bluebottles buzzed over the masses of food that went back on the dishes to the tin altar surely it had been made deliberately so that we should not eat it the cagliarese young woman talked to us yes she broke into that awful language which the italiansthe quite ordinary onescall french and which they insist on speaking for their own glorification yea when they get to heavens gate they will ask st peter for  oon bigliay pour ungtrozzième classe  fortunately or unfortunately her inquisitiveness got the better of her and she fell into her native italian what were we where did we come from where were we going why were we going had we any children did we want any etc after every answer she nodded her head and said ahu and watched us with energetic dark eyes then she ruminated over our nationalities and said to the unseeing witnesses una bella coppia a fine couple as at the moment we felt neither beautiful nor coupled we only looked greener the grim manatarms coming up to ask us again if we werent going to have a little wine she lapsed into her tenpounder french which was most difficult to follow and she said that on a seavoyage one must eat one must eat if only a little butand she lapsed into italianone must by no means drink winenono one didnt want to said i sadly whereupon the grim manatarms whom of course we had cheated out of the bottle we refused to have opened for us said with a lost sarcasm that wine made a man of a man etc etc i was too weary of that underground however all i knew was that he wanted wine wine wine and we hadnt ordered any he didnt care for food  the cagliarese told us she came now from naples and her husband was following in a few days he was doing business in naples i nearly asked if he was a little dogfishthis being the italian for profiteer but refrained in time so the two ladies retired to lie down i went and sat under my tarpaulin                                       i felt very dim and only a bit of myself and i dozed blankly the afternoon grew more sunny the ship turned southwards and with the wind and waves behind it became much warmer much smoother the sun had the lovely strong winey warmth golden over the darkblue sea the old oakwood looked almost white the afternoon was sweet upon the sea and in the sunshine and the swishing of the sea the speedier running of the empty ship i slept a warm sweet hour away and awoke new to see ahead pale uplooming islands upon the right the windy egades and on the right a mountain or high conical hill with buildings on the summit and in front against the sea still rather far away buildings rising upon a quay within a harbor and a mole and a castle forward to sea all small and far away like a view the buildings were square and fine there was something impressivemagical under the far sunshine and the keen wind the square and wellproportioned buildings waiting far off waiting like a lost city in a story a rip van winkle city i knew it was trapani the western port of sicily under the western sun                                       and the hill near us was mount eryx i had never seen it before so i had imagined a mountain in the sky but it was only a hill with undistinguishable cluster of a village on the summit where even now cold wisps of vapour caught they say it is 2500 feet high still it looks only a hill  but why in the name of heaven should my heart stand still as i watch that hill which rises above the sea it is the etna of the west but only a towncrowned hill to men it must have had a magic almost greater than etnas watching africa africa showing her coast on clear days africa the dreaded and the great watchtemple of the summit worldsacred worldmystic in the world that was venus of the aborigines older than greek aphrodite venus of the aborigines from her watchtemple looking at africa beyond the egatian isles the worldmystery the smiling astarte this one of the world centres older than old and the womangoddess watching africa erycina ridens laughing the womangoddess at this centre of an ancient quitelost world  i confess my heart stood still but is mere historical fact so strong that what one learns in bits from books can move one so or does the very word call an echo out of the dark blood it seems so to me it seems to me from the darkest recesses of my blood comes a terrible echo at the name of mount eryx something quite unaccountable the name of athens hardly moves me at eryxmy darkness quivers eryx looking west into africas sunset erycina ridens  there is a ticktocking in the little cabin against which i lean the wireless operator is busy communicating with trapani no doubt he is a fat young man with fairish curly hair and an important bearing give a man control of some machine and at once his air of importance and morethanhuman dignity develops one of the unaccountable members of the crew lounges in the little doorway like a chicken on one foot having nothing to do the girl from cagliari comes up with two young menalso sardinians by their thickset independent look and the touch of pride in their dark eyes she has no wraps at all just her elegant finecloth dress her bare head from which the wisps of hair blow across her brow and the transparent nigger silk stockings yet she does not seem cold she talks with great animation sitting between the two young men and she holds the hand of the one in the overcoat affectionately she is always holding the hand of one or other of the two young men and wiping wisps of windblown hair from her brow and talking in her strong nonchalant voice rapidly ceaselessly with massive energy heaven knows if the two young menthey are thirdclass passengerswere previous acquaintances but they hold her hand like brothersquite simply and nicely not at all sticky and libidinous it all has an air of why not  she shouts at me as i pass in her powerful extraordinary french  madame votre femme elle est au lit  i say she is lying down  ah she nods elle a le mal de mer  no she is not seasick just lying down  the two young men between whom she is sitting as between two pillows watch with the curious sardinian dark eyes that seem alert and show the white all round they are pleasanta bit like seals and they have a numb look for the moment impressed by this strange language she proceeds energetically to translate into sardinian as i pass on  we do not seem to be going to trapani there lies the town on the left under the hill the square buildings that suggest to me the factories of the east india company shining in the sun along the curious closedin harbour beyond the running dark blue sea we seem to be making for the island bulk of levanzo perhaps we shall steer away to sardinia without putting in to trapani  on and on we runand always as if we were going to steer between the pale blue heapedup islands leaving trapani behind us on our left the town has been in sight for an hour or more and still we run out to sea towards levanzo and the wirelessoperator busily ticktocks and throbs in his little cabin on this upper deck peeping in one sees his bed and chair behind a curtain screened off from his little office and all so tidy and pleasedlooking  from the islands one of the mediterranean sailing ships is beating her way across our track to trapani i dont know the name of ships but the carpenter says she is a schooner he says it with that italian misgiving which doesnt really know but which cant bear not to know anyhow on she comes with her tall ladder of square sails white in the afternoon light and her lovely prow curved in with a perfect hollow running like a wild animal on a scent across the waters therethe scent leads her north again she changes her tack from the harbour mouth and goes coursing away passing behind us lovely she is nimble and quick and palpitating with all her sails white and bright and eager  we are changing our course we have all the time been heading for the south of levanzo now i see the island slowly edging back as if clearing out of the way for us like a man in the street the island edges and turns aside and walks away and clearly we are making for the harbour mouth we have all this time been running out at sea round the back of the harbour now i see the fortresscastle an old thing out forward to sea and a little lighthouse and the way in and beyond the townfront with great palm trees and other curious dark trees and behind these the large square buildings of the south rising imposingly as if severe big palaces upon the promenade it all has a stately southern imposing appearance withal remote from our modern centuries standing back from the tides of our industrial life  i remember the crusaders how they called here so often on their way to the east and trapani seems waiting for them still with its palm trees and its silence full in the afternoon sun it has not much to do but wait apparently  the qb emerges into the sun crying out how lovely and the sea is quieter we are already in the lea of the harbourcurve from the north the manysailed ship from the islands is running down towards us with the wind and away on the south on the sealevel numerous short windmills are turning their sails briskly windmill after windmill rather stumpy spinning gaily in the blue silent afternoon among the saltlagoons stretching away towards marsala but there is a whole legion of windmills and don quixote would have gone off his head there they spin hither and thither upon the paleblue sealevels and perhaps one catches a glitter of white saltheaps for these are the great saltlagoons which make trapani rich                                       we are entering the harbourbasin however past the old castle out on the spit past the little lighthouse then through the entrance slipping quietly on the now tranquil water oh and how pleasant the fulness of the afternoon sun flooding this round fastsleeping harbour along whose side the tall palms drowse and whose waters are fast asleep it seems quite a small cosy harbour with the great buildings warmcolored in the sun behind the dark treeavenue of the marina the same silent sleeping endlessly sunwarmed stateliness  in the midst of this tranquillity we slowly turn round upon the shining water and in a few moments are moored there are other ships moored away to the right all asleep apparently in the flooding of the afternoon sun beyond the harbour entrance runs the great sea and the wind here all is still and hot and forgotten  vous descendez en terre shouts the young woman in her energetic frenchshe leaves off holding the young mens hands for the moment we are not quite sure and we dont want her to come with us anyhow for her french is not our french  the land sleeps on nobody takes any notice of us but just one boat paddles out the dozen yards to our side we decide to set foot on shore                                       one should not and we knew it one should never enter into these southern towns that look so nice so lovely from the outside however we thought we would buy some cakes so we crossed the avenue which looks so beautiful from the sea and which when you get into it is a cross between an outside place where you throw rubbish and a humpy unmade road in a raw suburb with a few iron seats and litter of old straw and rag indescribably dreary in itself yet with noble trees and lovely sunshine and the sea and the islands gleaming magic beyond the harbour mouth and the sun the eternal sun full focussed a few mangy nothingtodo people stand disconsolately about in southern fashion as if they had been left there waterlogged by the last flood and were waiting for the next flood to wash them further round the corner along the quay a norwegian steamer dreams that she is being loaded in the muddle of the small port                                       we looked at the cakesheavy and wan they appeared to our searolled stomachs so we strolled into a main street dark and dank like a sewer a tram bumped to a standstill as if now at last was the end of the world children coming from school ecstatically ran at our heels with bated breath to hear the vocal horrors of our foreign speech we turned down a dark side alley about forty paces deep and were on the northern bay and on a black stench that seemed like the perpetual sewer a bank of mud  so we got to the end of the black main street and turned in haste to the sun ahin a moment we were in it there rose the palms there lay our ship in the shining curving basinand there focussed the sun so that in a moment we were drunk or dazed by it dazed we sat on an iron seat in the rubbishdesolate sunstricken avenue  a ragged and dirty girl was nursing a fat and moist and immovable baby and tending to a grimy fat infant boy she stood a yard away and gazed at us as one would gaze at a pig one was going to buy she came nearer and examined the qb i had my big hat down over my eyes but no she had taken her seat at my side and poked her face right under my hat brim so that her towzled hair touched me and i thought she would kiss me but again no with her breath on my cheek she only gazed on my face as if it were a wax mystery i got up hastily  too much for me said i to the qb  she laughed and asked what the baby was called the baby was called beppina as most babies are  driven forth we wandered down the desolate avenue of shade and sun towards the ship and turned once more into the town we had not been on shore more than ten minutes this time we went to the right and found more shops the streets were dark and sunless and cold and trapani seemed to me to sell only two commodities cured rabbit skins and catskins and great hideous modern bedspread arrangements of heavy flowered silk and fabulous price they seem to think nothing of thousands of liras in trapani  but most remarkable was bunny and pussy bunny and pussy flattened out like pressed leaves dangling in clusters everywhere furs white bunny black bunny in great abundance piebald bunny grey bunnythen pussy tabby pussy and tortoiseshell pussy but mostly black pussy in a ghastly semblance of life all flat of course just single furs clusters bunches heaps and dangling arrays of plainsuperficies puss and bunbun puss and bun by the dozen and the twenty like dried leaves for your choice if a cat from a ship should chance to find itself in trapani streets it would give a mortal yell and go mad i am sure  we strolled for ten more minutes in this narrow tortuous unreal town that seemed to have plenty of flourishing inhabitants and a fair number of socialists if one was to judge by the great scrawlings on the walls w lenin and abasso la borghesia dont imagine by the way that lenin is another wille on the list the apparent initial stands for evviva the double v                                       cakes one dared not buy after looking at them but we found macaroon biscuits and a sort of flat plastercasts of the infant jesus under a dove of which we bought two the qb ate her macaroon biscuits all through the streets and we went towards the ship the fat boatman hailed us to take us back it was just about eight yards of water to row the ship being moored on the quay one could have jumped it i gave the fat boatman two liras two francs he immediately put on the socialistworkman indignation and thrust the note back at me sixty centimes more the fee was thirteen sous each way in venice or syracuse it would be two sous i looked at him and gave him the money and said per dio we are in trapani he muttered back something about foreigners but the hateful unmanly insolence of these lords of toil now they have their various unions behind them and their rights as working men sends my blood black they are ordinary men no more the human happy italian is most marvellously vanished new honors come upon them etc the dignity of human labour is on its hind legs busy giving every poor innocent who isnt ready for it a kick in the mouth                                       but once more in parenthesis let me remind myself that it is our own english fault we have slobbered about the nobility of toil till at last the nobles naturally insist on eating the cake and more than that we have set forth politically on such a high and galahad quest of holy liberty and been caught so shamelessly filling our pockets that no wonder the naïve and idealistic south turns us down with a bang                                       well we are back on the ship and we want tea on the list by the door it says we are to have coffee milk and butter at 830 luncheon at 1130 tea coffee or chocolate at 300 and dinner at 630 and moreover the company will feed the passengers for the normal duration of the voyage only very wellvery well then where is tea not any signs and the alpaca jackets giving us a wide berth but we find our man and demand our rights at least the qb does  the tickets from palermo to cagliari cost together 583 liras of this 250 liras was for the ticket and 40 liras each for the food this for two tickets would make 580 liras the odd three for usual stamps the voyage was supposed to last about thirty or thirtytwo hours from eight of the morning of departure to two or four of the following afternoon surely we pay for our tea  the other passengers have emerged a large pale fat handsome palermitan who is going to be professor at cagliari his large fat but highcoloured wife and three children a boy of fourteen like a thin frail fatherly girl a little boy in a rabbitskin overcoat coming rather unfluffed and a girlchild on the mothers knee the oneyearold girlchild being of course the only man in the party  they have all been sick all day and look washed out we sympathise they lament the cruelties of the journeyand senza servizio senza servizio without any maid servant the mother asks for coffee and a cup of milk for the children then seeing our tea with lemon and knowing it by repute she will have tea but the rabbitboy will have coffeecoffee and milkand nothing else and an orange and the baby will have lemon pieces of lemon and the fatherly young miss of an adolescent brother laughs indulgently at all the whims of these two young ones the father laughs and thinks it all adorable and expects us to adore he is almost too washedout to attend properly to give the full body of his attention  so the mother gets her cup of teaand puts a piece of lemon inand then milk on top of that the rabbit boy sucks an orange slobbers in the tea insists on coffee and milk tries a piece of lemon and gets a biscuit the baby with weird faces chews pieces of lemon and drops them in the family cup and fishes them out with a little sugar and dribbles them across the table to her mouth throws them away and reaches for a new sour piece they all think it humorous and adorable arrives the milk to be treated as another loving cup mingled with orange lemon sugar tea biscuit chocolate and cake father mother and elder brother partake of nothing they havent the stomach but they are charmed of course by the pretty pranks and messes of the infants they have extraordinary amiable patience and find the young ones a perpetual source of charming amusement they look at one another the elder ones and laugh and comment while the two young ones mix themselves and the table into a lemonmilkorangeteasugarbiscuitcakechocolate mess this inordinate italian amiable patience with their young monkeys is astonishing it makes the monkeys more monkeylike and selfconscious incredibly so that a baby has all the tricks of a babylonian harlot making eyes and trying new pranks till at last one sees the southern holy family as an unholy triad of imbecility  meanwhile i munched my infantjesusanddove arrangement which was rather like eating thin glass so hard and sharp it was made of almond and white of egg presumably and was not so bad if you could eat it at all it was a christmas relicand i watched the holy family across the narrow board and tried not to look all i felt                                       going on deck as soon as possible we watched the loading of barrels of wine into the holda mild and happygolucky process the ship seemed to be almost as empty of cargo as of passengers of the latter we were apparently twelve adults all told and the three children and as for cargo there were the wooden chests of the officer and these fourteen barrels of wine from trapani the last were at length settled more or less firm the owner or the responsible landsman seeing to it no one on the ship seemed to be responsible for anything and four of the innumerable crew were replacing the big planks over the hold it was curious how forlorn the ship seemed to feel now she was ready for sea again her innumerable crew did not succeed in making her alive she ran her course like a lost soul across the midmediterranean                                       outside the harbour the sun was sinking gorgeous gold and red the sky and vast beyond the darkening islands of the egades group coming as we did from the east side of the island where dawn beyond the ionian sea is the days great and familiar event so decisive an event that as the light appears along the seas rim so do my eyes invariably open and look at it and know it is dawn and as the nightpurple is fused back and a little scarlet thrills towards the zenith invariably day by day i feel i must get up coming from the east shut off hermetically from the west by the steep spikes of the mountains at our back we felt this sunset in the african sea terrible and dramatic it seemed much more magnificent and tragic than our ionian dawn which has always a suggestion of a flower opening but this great red trumpetflaring sunset had something african halfsinister upon the sea and it seemed so far off in an unknown land whereas our ionian dawn always seems near and familiar and happy  a different goddess the eryx astarte the woman ashtaroth erycina ridens must have been in her prehstoric dark smiling watching the fearful sunsets beyond the egades from our goldlighted apollo of the ionian east she is a strange goddess to me this erycina venus and the west is strange and unfamiliar and a little fearful be it africa or be it america  slowly at sunset we moved out of the harbour and almost as we passed the bar away in front we saw among the islands the pricking of a quick pointed light looking back we saw the light at the harbour entrance twitching and the remote lost town beginning to glimmer and night was settling down upon the sea through the crimsoned purple of the last afterglow  the islands loomed big as we drew nearer dark in the thickening darkness overhead a magnificent eveningstar blazed above the open sea giving me a pang at the heart for i was so used to see her hang just above the spikes of the mountains that i felt she might fall having the space beneath  levanzo and the other large island were quite dark absolutely dark save for one beam of a lighthouse low down in the distance the wind was again strong and cold the ship had commenced her old slither and heave slither and heave which mercifully we had forgotten overhead were innumerable great stars active as if they were alive in the sky i saw orion high behind us and the dogstar glaring and swish went the sea as we took the waves then after a long trough swish this curious rhythmic swishing and hollow drumming of a steamer at sea has a narcotic almost maddening effect on the spirit a long hissing burst of waters then the hollow roll and again the upheaval to a sudden hissssss  a bell had clanged and we knew the crew were once more feeding at every moment of the day and presumably of the night feeding was going onor coffeedrinking                                       we were summoned to dinner our young woman was already seated and a fat uniformed mate or purser or official of some sort was finishing off in the distance the pale professor also appeared and at a certain distance down the table sat a little hardheaded grey man in a long grey alpaca travelling coat appeared the beloved macaroni with tomato sauce no food for the sea i put my hopes on the fish had i not seen the cook making whiting bite their own tails viciouslythe fish appeared and what was it fried inkpots a calamaio is an inkpot also it is a polyp a little octopus which alas frequents the mediterranean and squirts ink if offended this polyp with its tentacles is cut up and fried and reduced to the consistency of boiled celluloid it is esteemed a delicacy but is tougher than indiarubber gristly through and through  i have a peculiar aversion to these inkpots once in liguria we had a boat of our own and paddled with the peasant paddlers alessandro caught inkpots and like this he tied up a female by a string in a cavethe string going through a convenient hole in her end there she lived like an amphitrites wirehaired terrier tied up till alessandro went afishing then he towed her like a poodle behind and thus like a poodlybitch she attracted hangerson in the briny seas and these poor polyp inamorati were the victims they were lifted as prey on board where i looked with horror on their grey translucent tentacles and large cold stony eyes the shepolyp was towed behind again but after a few days she died  and i think even for creatures so awfullooking this method is indescribably base and shows how much lower than an octopus even is lordly man  well we chewed a few ends of oilfried inkpots and gave it up the cagliari girl gave up too the professor had not even tried only the hardheaded grey man in the alpaca coat chewed animatedly with bouncing jaws mountains of calamaio remained for the joyous bluebottles  arrived the inevitable meatthis long piece of completely tasteless undercut in innumerable greybrown slices oh italy the professor fled  arrived the washleather pears the apples the orangeswe saved an apple for a happier hour  arrived coffee and as a magnificent treat a few wellknown pastries they all taste wearily alike the young woman shakes her head i shake mine but the qb like a child is pleased most pleased of all however are the bluebottles who dart in a blackalpaca bunch to the tin altar and there loudly buzz wildly above the sallow cakes  the citroncheeked dry one however cares darkly nothing for cakes he comes once more to twit us about wine so much so that the cagliari girl orders a glass of marsala and i must second her so there we are three little glasses of brown liquid the cagliari girl sips hers and suddenly flees the qb sips hers with infinite caution and quietly retires i finish the qbs little glass and my own and the voracious blowflies buzz derisively and excited the yellowcheeked one has disappeared with the bottle  from the professorial cabin faint wails sometimes almost fierce as one or another is going to be ill only a thin door is between this stateroom and them the most downtrodden frayed ancient rag of a man goes discreetly with basins trying not to let out glimpses of the awful within i climb up to look at the vivid drenching stars to breathe the cold wind to see the dark sea sliding then i too go to the cabin and watch the sea run past the porthole for a minute and insert myself like the meat in a sandwich into the tight lower bunk oh infinitesimal cabin where we sway like two matches in a match box oh strange but even yet excellent gallop of a ship at sea                                       i slept not so badly through the stifled rolling nightin fact later on slept soundly and the day was growing bright when i peered through the porthle the sea was much smoother it was a brilliant clear morning i made haste and washed myself cursorily in the saucer that dribbled into a pail in a corner there was not space even for one chair this saucer was by my bunkhead and i went on deck  ah the lovely morning away behind us the sun was just coming above the seas horizon and the sky all golden all a joyous fireheated gold and the sea was glassy bright the wind gone still the waves sunk into long low undulations the foam of the wake was pale iceblue in the yellow air sweet sweet wide morning on the sea with the sun coming swimming up and a tall sailing bark with her flat foreladder of sails delicately across the light and a farfar steamer on the electric vivid morning horizon  the lovely dawn the lovely pure wide morning in the midsea so goldenaired and delighted with the sea like sequins shaking and the sky far far far above unfathomably clear how glad to be on a ship what a golden hour for the heart of man ah if one could sail for ever on a small quiet lonely ship from land to land and isle to isle and saunter through the spaces of this lovely world always through the spaces of this lovely world sweet it would be sometimes to come to the opaque earth to block oneself against the stiff land to annul the vibration of ones flight against the inertia of our terra firma but life itself would be in the flight the tremble of space ah the trembling of neverended space as one moves in flight space and the frail vibration of space the glad lonely wringing of the heart not to be clogged to the land any more not to be any more like a donkey with a log on its leg fastened to weary earth that has no answer now but to be off  to find three masculine worldlost souls and worldlost saunter and saunter on along with them across the dithering space as long as life lasts why come to anchor there is nothing to anchor for land has no answer to the soul any more it has gone inert give me a little ship kind gods and three worldlost comrades hear me and let me wander aimless across this vivid outer world the world empty of man where space flies happily                                       the lovely celandineyellow morning of the open sea paling towards a rare sweet blue the sun stood above the horizon like the great burning stigma of the sacred flower of day mediterranean sailingships so mediaeval hovered on the faint morning wind as if uncertain which way to go curious oddwinged insects of the flower the steamer hulldown was sinking towards spain space rang clear about us the level sea  appeared the cagliari young woman and her two friends she was looking handsome and restored now the sea was easy her two male friends stood touching her one at either shoulder  bonjour monsieur she barked across at me vous avez pris le café  pas encore et vous  non madame votre femme  she roared like a mastiff dog and then translated with unction to her two uninitiated friends how it was they did not understand her french i do not know it was so like travestied italian  i went below to find the qb                                       when we came up the faint shape of land appeared ahead more transparent than thin pearl already sardinia magic are high lands seen from the sea when they are far far off and ghostly translucent like icebergs this was sardinia looming like fascinating shadows in midsea and the sailing ships as if cut out of frailest pearl translucency were wafting away towards naples i wanted to count their sailsfive square ones which i call the ladder one above the otherbut how many wingblades that remained yet to be seen                                       our friend the carpenter spied us out at least he was not my friend he didnt find me simpatico i am sure but up he came and proceeded to entertain us with weary banality again the young woman called had we had coffee we said we were just going down and then she said that whatever we had today we had to pay for our food ended with the one day at which the qb was angry feeling swindled but i had known before                                       we went down and had our coffee notwithstanding the young woman came down and made eyes at one of the alpaca bluebottles after which we saw a cup of coffee and milk and two biscuits being taken to her into her cabin discreetly when italians are being discreet and on the sly the very air about them becomes telltale and seems to shout with a thousand tongues so with a thousand invisible tongues clamouring the fact the young woman had her coffee secretly and gratis in her cabin                                       but the morning was lovely the qb and i crept round the bench at the very stern of the ship and sat out of the wind and out of sight just above the foaming of the wake before us was the open morningand the glisten of our ships track like a snails path trailing across the sea straight for a little while then giving a bend to the left always a bend towards the left and coming at us from the pure horizon like a bright snailpath happy it was to sit there in the stillness with nothing but the humanless sea to shine about us  but no we were found out arrived the carpenter  ah you have found a fine place  molto bello this from the qb i could not bear the irruption  he proceeded to talkand as is inevitable the war ah the warit was a terrible thing he had become illvery ill because you see not only do you go without proper food without proper rest and warmth but you see you are in an agony of fear for your life all the time an agony of fear for your life and thats what does it six months in hospital the qb of course was sympathetic  the sicilians are quite simple about it they just tell you they were frightened to death and it made them ill the qb womanlike loves them for being so simple about it i feel angry somewhere for they expect a fullblown sympathy and however the great god mars may have shrunk and gone wizened in the world it still annoys me to hear him so blasphemed                                       near us the automatic log was spinning the thin rope trailing behind us in the sea erratically it jerked and spun with spasmodic torsion he explained that the little screw at the end of the line spun to the speed of travelling we were going from ten to twelve italian miles to the hour ah yes we could go twenty but we went no faster than ten or twelve to save the coal  the coalil carbone i knew we were in for it englandlinghilterra she has the coal and what does she do she sells it very dear particularly to italy italy won the war and now cant even have coal because why the price the exchange il cambio now i am doubly in for it two countries had been able to keep their money highengland and america the english sovereignla sterlinaand the american dollarsa these were money the english and the americans flocked to italy with their sterline and their dollari and they bought what they wanted for nothing for nothing ecco whereas we poor italianswe are in a state of ruinationproper ruination the allies etc etc  i am so used to iti am so wearily used to it i cant walk a stride without having this wretched cambio the exchange thrown at my head and this with an injured petulant spitefulness which turns my blood for i assure them whatever i have in italy i pay for and i am not england i am not the british isles on two legs  germanyla germaniashe did wrong to make the war butthere you are that was war italy and germanylitalia e la germaniathey had always been friends in palermo  my god i felt i could not stand it another second to sit above the foam and have this miserable creature stuffing wads of chewed newspaper into my earno i could not bear it in italy there is no escape say two words and the individual starts chewing old newspaper and stuffing it into you no escape you becomeif you are englishlinghilterra il carbone and il cambio and as england coal and exchange you are treated it is more than useless to try to be human about it you are a state usury system a coal fiend and an exchange thief every englishman has disappeared into this triple abstraction in the eyes of the italian of the proletariat particularly try and get them to be human try and get them to see that you are simply an individual if you can after all i am no more than a single human man wandering my lonely way across these years but noto an italian i am a perfected abstraction englandcoalexchange the germans were once devils for inhuman theoretic abstracting of living beings but now the italians beat them i am a walking column of statistics which adds up badly for italy only this and nothing more which being so i shut my mouth and walk away                                       for the moment the carpenter is shaken off but i am in a rage fool that i am it is like being pestered by their mosquitoes the sailing ships are nearand i count fifteen sails beautiful they look yet if i were on board somebody would be chewing newspaper at me and addressing me as englandcoalexchange  the mosquito hoversand hovers but the stony blank of the side of my cheek keeps him away yet he hovers and the qb feels sympathetic towards him quite sympathetic because of course he treats hera bel pezzoas if he would lick her boots or anything else that she would let him lick                                       meanwhile we eat the apples from yesterdays dessert and the remains of the qbs infantjesusanddove cake the land is drawing nearerwe can see the shape of the end promontory and peninsulaand a white speck like a church the bulk of the land is forlorn and rather shapeless coming towards us but attractive  looking ahead towards the land gives us away the mosquito swoops on us yeshe is not surehe thinks the white speck is a churchor a lighthouse when you pass the cape on the right and enter the wide bay between cape spartivento and cape carbonara then you have two hours sail to cagliari we shall arrive between two and three oclock it is now eleven  yes the sailing ships are probably going to naples there is not much wind for them now when there is wind they go fast faster than our steamer ah naplesbella bella eh a little dirty say i but what do you want says he a great city palermo of course is better  ahthe neapolitan womenhe says à propos or not they do their hair so fine so neat and beautifulbut underneathsottosottothey are dirty this being received in cold silence he continues noi giriamo il mondo noi chi giriamo conosciamo il mondo we travel about and we know the world who we are i do not know his highness the palermitan carpenter lout no doubt but we who travel know the world he is preparing his shot the neapolitan women and the english women in this are equal that they are dirty underneath underneath they are dirty the women of london  but it is getting too much for me  you who look for dirty women say i find dirty women everywhere  he stops short and watches me  no no you have not understood me no i dont mean that i mean that the neapolitan women and the english women have dirty underclothing  to which he gets no answer but a cold look and a cold cheek whereupon he turns to the qb and proceeds to be simpatica and after a few moments he turns again to me  il signore is offended he is offended with me  but i turn the other way and at last he clears out in triumph i must admit like a mosquito that has bitten one in the neck as a matter of fact one should never let these fellows get into conversation nowadays they are no longer human beings they hate ones englishness and leave out the individual                                       we walk forward towards the foredeck where the captains lookout cabin is the captain is an elderly man silent and crushed with the look of a gentleman but he looks beaten down another still another member of the traycarrying department is just creeping up his ladder with a cup of black coffee returning we peep down the skylight into the kitchen and there we see roast chicken and sausagesroast chicken and sausages ah this is where the sides of kid and the chickens and the good things go all down the throats of the crew there is no more food for us until we land                                       we have passed the capeand the white thing is a lighthouse and the fattish handsome professor has come up carrying the little girlchild while the femalish elder brother leads the rabbitfluffy small boy by the hand so en famille so terribly en famille they deposit themselves near us and it threatens another conversation but not for anything my dears  the sailorsnot sailors some of the streetcorner loafers are hoisting the flag the redwhiteandgreen italian tricolor it floats at the masthead and the femalish brother in a fine burst of feeling takes off his funny hat with a flourish and cries  ecco la bandiera italiana  ach the hateful sentimentalism of these days  the land passes slowly very slowly it is hilly but barren looking with few trees and it is not spikey and rather splendid like sicily sicily has style we keep along the east side of the bayaway in the west is cape spartivento and still no sight of cagliari  two hours yet cries the cagliari girl two hours before we eat ah when i get on land what a good meal i shall eat  the men haul in the automatic log the sky is clouding over with that icy curd which comes after midday when the bitter north wind is blowing it is no longer warm                                       slowly slowly we creep along the formless shore an hour passes we see a little fort ahead done in enormous blackandwhite checks like a fragment of gigantic chessboard it stands at the end of a long spit of landa long barish peninsula that has no houses and looks as if it might be golflinks but it is not golflinks  and suddenly there is cagliari a naked town rising steep steep goldenlooking piled naked to the sky from the plain at the head of the formless hollow bay it is strange and rather wonderful not a bit like italy the city piles up lofty and almost miniature and makes me think of jerusalem without trees without cover rising rather bare and proud remote as if back in history like a town in a monkish illuminated missal one wonders how it ever got there and it seems like spainor malta not italy it is a steep and lonely city treeless as in some old illumination yet withal rather jewellike like a sudden rosecut amber jewel naked at the depth of the vast indenture the air is cold blowing bleak and bitter the sky is all curd and that is cagliari it has that curious look as if it could be seen but not entered it is like some vision some memory something that has passed away impossible that one can actually walk in that city set foot there and eat and laugh there ah no yet the ship drifts nearer nearer and we are looking for the actual harbour                                       the usual seafront with dark trees for a promenade and palatial buildings behind but here not so pink and gay more reticent more sombre of yellow stone the harbour itself a little basin of water into which we are slipping carefully while three saltbarges laden with salt as white as snow creep round from the left drawn by an infinitesimal tug there are only two other forlorn ships in the basin it is cold on deck the ship turns slowly round and is being hauled to the quay side i go down for the knapsack and a fat bluebottle pounces at me  you pay nine francs fifty  i pay them and we get off that ship     iii  cagliari   there is a very little crowd waiting on the quay mostly men with their hands in their pockets but thank heaven they have a certain aloofness and reserve they are not like the touristparasites of these postwar days who move to the attack with a terrifying cold vindictiveness the moment one emerges from any vehicle and some of these men look really poor there are no poor italians any more at least loafers  strange the feeling round the harbour as if everybody had gone away yet there are people about it is festa however epiphany but it is so different from sicily none of the suave greekitalian charms none of the airs and graces none of the glamour rather bare rather stark rather cold and yellowsomehow like malta without maltas foreign liveliness thank goodness no one wants to carry my knapsack thank goodness no one has a fit at the sight of it thank heaven no one takes any notice they stand cold and aloof and dont move  we make our way through the customs then through the dazio the city customshouse then we are free we set off up a steep new broad road with little trees on either side but stone arid new wide stone yellowish under the cold skyand abandonedseeming though of course there are people about the north wind blows bitingly  we climb a broad flight of steps always upwards up the wide precipitous dreary boulevard with sprouts of trees looking for the hotel and dying with hunger                                       at last we find it the scala di ferro through a courtyard with green plants and at last a little man with lank black hair like an esquimo comes smiling he is one brand of sardinianesquimo looking there is no room with two beds only single rooms and thus we are led off if you please to the bagnio the bathingestablishment wing on the dank ground floor cubicles on either side a stone passage and in every cubicle a dark stone bath and a little bed we can have each a little bath cubicle if theres nothing else for it there isnt but it seems dank and cold and horrid underground and one thinks of all the unsavory assignations at these old bagnio places true at the end of the passage are seated two carabinieri but whether to ensure respectibility or not heaven knows we are in the baths thats all  illustration isili  the esquimo returns after five minutes however there is a bedroom in the house he is pleased because he didnt like putting us into the bagnio where he found the bedroom i dont know but there it was large sombre cold and over the kitchen fumes of a small inner court like a well but perfectly clean and all right and the people seemed warm and goodnatured like human beings one has got so used to the nonhuman ancientsouled sicilians who are suave and so completely callous                                       after a really good meal we went out to see the town it was after three oclock and everywhere was shut up like an english sunday cold stony cagliari in summer you must be sizzling hot cagliari like a kiln the men stood about in groups but without the intimate italian watchfulness that never leaves a passerby alone  strange stony cagliari we climbed up a street like a corkscrew stairway and we saw announcements of a childrens fancydress ball cagliari is very steep halfway up there is a strange place called the bastions a large level space like a drillground with trees curiously suspended over the town and sending off a long shoot like a wide viaduct across above the corkscrew street that comes climbing up above this bastion place the town still rises steeply to the cathedral and the fort what is so curious is that this terrace or bastion is so large like some big recreation ground that it is almost dreary and one cannot understand its being suspended in midair down below is the little circle of the harbour to the left a low malariallooking sea plain with tufts of palm trees and arablooking houses from this runs out the long spit of land towards that blackandwhite watchfort the white road trailing forth on the right most curiously a long strange spit of sand runs in a causeway far across the shallows of the bay with the open sea on one hand and vast endoftheworld lagoons on the other there are peaky dark mountains beyond thisjust as across the vast bay are gloomy hills it is a strange strange landscape as if here the world left off the bay is vast in itself and all these curious things happening at its head this curious craggystudded town like a great stud of housecovered rock jutting up out of the bay flats around it on one side the weary arablooking palmdesolated malarial plain and on the other side great salt lagoons dead beyond the sandbar these backed again by serried clustered mountains suddenly while away beyond the plain hills rise to sea again land and sea both seem to give out exhausted at the bay head the worlds end and into this worlds end starts up cagliari and on either side sudden serpentcrest hills  but it still reminds me of malta lost between europe and africa and belonging to nowhere belonging to nowhere never having belonged to anywhere to spain and the arabs and the phoenicians most but as if it had never really had a fate no fate left outside of time and history  the spirit of the place is a strange thing our mechanical age tries to override it but it does not succeed in the end the strange sinister spirit of the place so diverse and adverse in differing places will smash our mechanical oneness into smithereens and all that we think the real thing will go off with a pop and we shall be left staring                                       on the great parapet above the municipal hall and above the corkscrew highstreet a thick fringe of people is hanging looking down we go to look too and behold below there is the entrance to the ball yes there is a china shepherdess in pale blue and powdered hair crook ribbons marie antoinette satin daintiness and all slowly and haughtily walking up the road and gazing superbly round she is not more than twelve years old moreover two servants accompany her she gazes supremely from right to left as she goes mincingly and i would give her the prize for haughtiness she is perfecta little too haughty for watteau but marquise to a t the people watch in silence there is no yelling and screaming and running they watch in a suitable silence  comes a carriage with two fat bay horses slithering almost swimming up the corkscrew highstreet that in itself is a tourdeforce for cagliari doesnt have carriages imagine a street like a corkscrew stair paved with slippery stone and imagine two bay horses rowing their way up it they did not walk a single stride but they arrived and there fluttered out three strangely exquisite children two frail white satin pierrots and a white satin pierrette they were like fragile winter butterflies with black spots they had a curious indefinable remote elegance something conventional and findesiècle but not our century the wonderful artificial delicacy of the eighteenth the boys had big perfect ruffs round their necks and behind were slung old creamcolored spanish shawls for warmth they were frail as tobacco flowers and with remote cold elegance they fluttered by the carriage from which emerged a large blacksatin mama fluttering their queer little butterfly feet on the pavement hovering round the large mama like three frailtissued ghosts they found their way past the solid seated carabinieri into the hall  arrived a primrosebrocade beau with ruffles and his hat under his arm about twelve years old walking statelily without a qualm up the steep twist of the street or perhaps so perfect in his selfconsciousness that it became an elegant aplomb in him he was a genuine eighteenthcentury exquisite rather stiffer than the french maybe but completely in the spirit curious curious children they had a certain standoffish superbness and not a single trace of misgiving for them their noblesse was indisputable for the first time in my life i recognized the true cold superbness of the old noblesse they had not a single qualm about their own perfect representing of the higher order of being  followed another white satin marquise with a maidservant they are strong on the eighteenth century in cagliari perhaps it is the last bright reality to them the nineteenth hardly counts                                       curious the children in cagliari the poor seem thoroughly poorbarefooted urchins gay and wild in the narrow dark streets but the more welltodo children are so fine so extraordinarily elegantly dressed it quite strikes one of a heap not so much the grownups the children all the chic all the fashion all the originality is expended on the children and with a great deal of success better than kensington gardens very often and they promenade with papa and mama with such alert assurance having quite brought it off their fashionable getup who would have expected it                                       oh narrow dark and humid streets going up to the cathedral like crevices i narrowly miss a huge pail of slopwater which comes crashing down from heaven a small boy who was playing in the street and whose miss is not quite a clean miss looks up with that naïve impersonal wonder with which children stare at a star or a lamplighter  the cathedral must have been a fine old pagan stone fortress once now it has come as it were through the mincing machine of the ages and oozed out baroque and sausagey a bit like the horrible baldachins in st peters at rome none the less it is homely and holeandcornery with a rather ragged high mass trailing across the pavement towards the high altar since it is almost sunset and epiphany it feels as if one might squat in a corner and play marbles and eat bread and cheese and be at home a comfortable oldtime churchey feel  there is some striking filet lace on the various altarcloths and st joseph must be a prime saint he has an altar and a verse of invocation praying for the dying  oh st joseph true potential father of our lord what can it profit a man i wonder to be the potential father of anybody for the rest i am not baedeker                                       the top of cagliari is the fortress the old gate the old ramparts of honeycombed fine yellowish sandstone up in a great sweep goes the rampart wall spanish and splendid dizzy and the road creeping down again at the foot down the back of the hill there lies the country that dead plain with its bunch of palms and a fainting sea and inland again hills cagliari must be on a single loose lost bluff of rock  from the terrace just below the fortress above the town not behind it we stand and look at the sunset it is all terrible taking place beyond the knotted serpentcrested hills that lie bluey and velvety beyond the waste lagoons dark sultry heavy crimson the west is hanging sinisterly with those gloomy blue cloudbars and cloudbanks drawn across all behind the bluegloomy peaks stretches the curtain of sinister smouldering red and away to the sea deep below lie the seameres they seem miles and miles and utterly waste but the sandbar crosses like a bridge and has a road all the air is dark a sombre bluish tone the great west burns inwardly sullenly and gives no glow yet a deep red it is cold  we go down the steep streets smelly dark dank and very cold no wheeled vehicle can scramble up them presumably people live in one room men are combing their hair or fastening their collars in the doorways evening is here and it is a feast day                                       at the bottom of the street we come to a little bunch of masked youths one in a long yellow frock and a frilled bonnet another like an old woman another in red twill they are arm in arm and are accosting the passersby the qb gives a cry and looks for escape she has a terror of maskers a terror that comes from childhood to say the truth so have i we hasten invisibly down the far side of the street and come out under the bastions then we go down our own familiar wide short cold boulevard to the sea  at the bottom again is a carriage with more maskers carnival is beginning a man dressed as a peasant woman in native costume is clambering with his great wide skirts and wide strides on to the box and flourishing his ribboned whip is addressing a little crowd of listeners he opens his mouth wide and goes on with a long yelling harangue of taking a drive with his motheranother man in oldwomans gaudy finery and wig who sits already bobbing on the box the wouldbe daughter flourishes yells and prances up there on the box of the carriage the crowd listens attentively and mildly smiles it all seems real to them the qb hovers in the distance halffascinated and watches with a great flourish of whip and legsshowing his frilled drawersthe masker pulls round to drive along the boulevard by the seathe only place where one can drive                                       the big street by the sea is the via roma it has the cafés on one side and across the road the thick tufts of trees intervening between the sea and us among these thick tufts of seafront trees the little steam tram like a little train bumps to rest after having wound round the back of the town  the via roma is all social cagliari including the cafés with their outdoor tables on the one side of the road and the avenue strand on the other it is very wide and at evening it contains the whole town here and here alone carriages can spank along very slowly officers can ride and the people can promenade en masse  we were amazed at the sudden crowd we found ourselves amongstlike a short dense river of people streaming slowly in a mass there is practically no vehicular trafficonly the steady dense streams of human beings of all sorts all on a human footing it must have been something like this in the streets of imperial rome where no chariots might drive and humanity was all on foot  little bunches of maskers and single maskers danced and strutted along in the thick flow under the trees if you are a mask you dont walk like a human being you dance and prance along extraordinarily like the lifesize marionettes conducted by wires from above that is how you go with that odd jauntiness as if lifted and propelled by wires from the shoulders in front of me went a charming coloured harlequin all in diamondshaped colours and beautiful as a piece of china he tripped with the light fantastic trip quite alone in the thick crowd and quite blithe came two little children hand in hand in brilliant scarlet and white costumes sauntering calmly they did not do the mask trip after a while a skyblue girl with a high hat and full skirts very short that went flipflipflip as a ballet dancers whilst she strutted after her a spanish grandee capering like a monkey they threaded among the slow stream of the crowd appeared dante and beatrice in paradise apparently all in white sheetrobes and with silver wreaths on their heads arm in arm and prancing very slowly and majestically yet with the long lilt as if hitched along by wires from above they were very good all the wellknown vision come to life dante incorporate and white as a shroud with his towhaired silvercrowned immortal beatrice on his arm strutting the dark avenues he had the nose and cheekbones and banded cheek and the stupid wooden look and offered a modern criticism on the inferno                                       it had become quite dark the lamps were lighted we crossed the road to the café roma and found a table on the pavement among the crowd in a moment we had our tea the evening was cold with ice in the wind but the crowd surged on back and forth back and forth slowly at the tables were seated mostly men taking coffee or vermouth or aqua vitae all familiar and easy without the modern selfconsciousness there was a certain pleasant natural robustness of spirit and something of a feudal freeandeasiness then arrived a family with children and nurse in her native costume they all sat at table together perfectly easy with one another though the marvellous nurse seemed to be seated below the salt she was bright as a poppy in a rosescarlet dress of fine cloth with a curious little waistcoat of emerald green and purple and a bodice of soft homespun linen with great full sleeves on her head she had a rosescarlet and white headdress and she wore great studs of gold filigree and similar earrings the feudalbourgeois family drank its syrupdrinks and watched the crowd most remarkable is the complete absence of selfconsciousness they all have a perfect natural sangfroid the nurse in her marvellous native costume is as thoroughly at her ease as if she were in her own village street she moves and speaks and calls to a passerby without the slightest constraint and much more without the slightest presumption she is below the invisible salt the invisible but insuperable salt and it strikes me the saltbarrier is a fine thing for both parties they both remain natural and human on either side of it instead of becoming devilish scrambling and pushing at the barricade                                       the crowd is across the road under the trees near the sea on this side stroll occasional pedestrians and i see my first peasant in costume he is an elderly upright handsome man beautiful in the blackandwhite costume he wears the fullsleeved white shirt and the close black bodice of thick native frieze cut low from this sticks out a short kilt or frill of the same black frieze a band of which goes between the legs between the full loose drawers of coarse linen the drawers are banded below the knee into tight black frieze gaiters on his head he has the long black stocking cap hanging down behind how handsome he is and so beautifully male he walks with his hands loose behind his back slowly upright and aloof the lovely unapproachableness indomitable and the flash of the black and white the slow stride of the full white drawers the black gaiters and black cuirass with the bolero then the great white sleeves and white breast again and once more the black capwhat marvellous massing of the contrast marvellous and superb as on a magpiehow beautiful maleness is if it finds its right expressionand how perfectly ridiculous it is made in modern clothes  there is another peasant too a young one with a swift eye and hard cheek and hard dangerous thighs he has folded his stocking cap so that it comes forward to his brow like a phrygian cap he wears close knee breeches and close sleeved waistcoat of thick brownish stuff that looks like leather over the waistcoat a sort of cuirass of black rusty sheepskin the curly wool outside so he strides talking to a comrade how fascinating it is after the soft italians to see these limbs in their close kneebreeches so definite so manly with the old fierceness in them still one realises with horror that the race of men is almost extinct in europe only christlike heroes and womanworshipping don juans and rabid equalitymongrels the old hardy indomitable male is gone his fierce singleness is quenched the last sparks are dying out in sardinia and spain nothing left but the herdproletariat and the herdequality mongrelism and the wistful poisonous selfsacrificial cultured soul how detestable  but that curious flashing blackandwhite costume i seem to have known it before to have worn it even to have dreamed it to have dreamed it to have had actual contact with it it belongs in some way to something in meto my past perhaps i dont know but the uneasy sense of bloodfamiliarity haunts me i know i have known it before it is something of the same uneasiness i feel before mount eryx but without the awe this time                                       in the morning the sun was shining from a blue blue sky but the shadows were deadly cold and the wind like a flat blade of ice we went out running to the sun the hotel could not give us coffee and milk only a little black coffee so we descended to the seafront again to the via roma and to our café it was friday people seemed to be bustling in from the country with huge baskets  the café roma had coffee and milk but no butter we sat and watched the movement outside tiny sardinian donkeys the tiniest things ever seen trotted their infinitesimal little paws along the road drawing little wagons like handcarts their proportion is so small that they make a boy walking at their side look like a tall man while a natural man looks like a cyclops stalking hugely and cruelly it is ridiculous for a grown man to have one of these little creatures hardly bigger than a fly hauling his load for him one is pulling a chest of drawers on a cart and it seems to have a whole house behind it nevertheless it plods bravely away beneath the load a wee thing  they tell me there used to be flocks of these donkeys feeding half wild on the wild moorlike hills of sardinia but the warand also the imbecile wantonness of the warmastersconsumed these flocks too so that few are left the same with the cattle sardinia home of cattle hilly little argentine of the mediterranean is now almost deserted it is war say the italianaand also the wanton imbecile foul lavishness of the warmasters it was not alone the war which exhausted the world it was the deliberate evil wastefulness of the warmakers in their own countries italy ruined italy                                       two peasants in blackandwhite are strolling in the sun flashing and my dream of last evening was not a dream and my nostalgia for something i know not what was not an illusion i feel it again at once at the sight of the men in frieze and linen a heart yearning for something i have known and which i want back again  it is market day we turn up the largo carlofelice the second wide gap of a street a vast but very short boulevard like the end of something cagliari is like that all bits and bobs and by the side of the pavement are many stalls stalls selling combs and collarstuds cheap mirrors handkerchiefs shoddy manchester goods bedticking bootpaste poor crockery and so on but we see also madame of cagliari going marketing with a servant accompanying her carrying a huge grasswoven basket or returning from marketing followed by a small boy supporting one of these huge grasswoven basketslike huge disheson his head piled with bread eggs vegetables a chicken and so forth therefore we follow madame going marketing and find ourselves in the vast market house and it fairly glows with eggs eggs in these great round dishbaskets of golden grass but eggs in piles in mounds in heaps a sierra nevada of eggs glowing warm white how they glow i have never noticed it before but they give off a warm pearly effulgence into the air almost a warmth a pearlygold heat seems to come out of them myriads of eggs glowing avenues of eggs  and they are marked60 centimes 65 centimes ah cries the qb i must live in cagliarifor in sicily the eggs cost 150 each  this is the meat and poultry and bread market there are stalls of new variousshaped bread brown and bright there are tiny stalls of marvellous native cakes which i want to taste there is a great deal of meat and kid and there are stalls of cheese all cheeses all shapes all whitenesses all the creamcolours on into daffodil yellow goat cheese sheeps cheese swiss cheese parmegiano stracchino caciocavallo torolone how many cheeses i dont know the names of but they cost about the same as in sicily eighteen francs twenty francs twentyfive francs the kilo and there is lovely hamthirty and thirtyfive francs the kilo there is a little fresh butter toothirty or thirtytwo francs the kilo most of the butter however is tinned in milan it costs the same as the fresh there are splendid piles of salted black olives and huge bowls of green salted olives there are chickens and ducks and wildfowl at eleven and twelve and fourteen francs a kilo there is mortadella the enormous bologna sausage thick as a church pillar 16 francs and there are various sorts of smaller sausage salami to be eaten in slices a wonderful abundance of food glowing and shining we are rather late for fish especially on friday but a barefooted man offers us two weird objects from the mediterranean which teems with marine monsters  the peasant women sit behind their wares their homewoven linen skirts hugely full and of various colours ballooning round them the yellow baskets give off a glow of light there is a sense of profusion once more but alas no sense of cheapness save the eggs every month up goes the price of everything  i must come and live in cagliari to do my shopping here says the qb i must have one of those big grass baskets  we went down to the little streetbut saw more baskets emerging from a broad flight of stone stairs enclosed so up we wentand found ourselves in the vegetable market here the qb was happier still peasant women sometimes barefoot sat in their tight little bodices and voluminous coloured skirts behind the piles of vegetables and never have i seen a lovelier show the intense deep green of spinach seemed to predominate and out of that came the monuments of curdwhite and blackpurple cauliflowers but marvellous cauliflowers like a flowershow the purple ones intense as great bunches of violets from this green white and purple massing struck out the vivid rosescarlet and blue crimson of radishes large radishes like little turnips in piles then the long slim greypurple buds of artichokes and dangling clusters of dates and piles of sugardusty white figs and sombrelooking black figs and bright burnt figs basketfuls and basketfuls of figs a few baskets of almonds and many huge walnuts basketpans of native raisins scarlet peppers like trumpets magnificent fennels so white and big and succulent baskets of new potatoes scaly kohlrabi wild asparagus in bunches yellowbudding sparacelli big cleanfleshed carrots feathery salads with white hearts long brownpurple onions and then of course pyramids of big oranges pyramids of pale apples and baskets of brilliant shiny mandarini the little tangerine orange with their greenblack leaves the green and vividcoloured world of fruitgleams i have never seen in such splendour as under the market roof at cagliari so raw and gorgeous and all quite cheap the one remaining cheapness except potatoes potatoes of any sort are 140 or 150 the kilo  oh cried the qb if i dont live at cagliari and come and do my shopping here i shall die with one of my wishes unfulfilled                                       but out of the sun it was cold nevertheless we went into the streets to try and get warm the sun was powerful but alas as in southern towns generally the streets are sunless as wells  so the qb and i creep slowly along the sunny bits and then perforce are swallowed by shadow we look at the shops but there is not much to see little frowsy provincial shops on the whole  but a fair number of peasants in the streets and peasant women in rather ordinary costume tightbodiced volumeskirted dresses of handwoven linen or thickish cotton the prettiest is of darkblueandred stripesandlines intermingled so made that the darkblue gathers round the waist into one colour the myriad pleats hiding all the rosy red but when she walks the fullpetticoated peasant woman then the red goes flashflashflash like a bird showing its colours pretty that looks in the sombre street she has a plain light bodice with a peak sometimes a little vest and great full white sleeves and usually a handkerchief or shawl loose knotted it is charming the way they walk with quick short steps when all is said and done the most attractive costume for women in my eye is the tight little bodice and the manypleated skirt full and vibrating with movement it has a charm which modern elegance lacks completelya birdlike play in movement                                       they are amusing these peasant girls and women so brisk and defiant they have straight backs like little walls and decided welldrawn brows and they are amusingly on the alert there is no eastern creeping like sharp brisk birds they dart along the streets and you feel they would fetch you a bang over the head as leave as look at you tenderness thank heaven does not seem to be a sardinian quality italy is so tenderlike cooked macaroniyards and yards of soft tenderness ravelled round everything here men dont idealise women by the looks of things here they dont make these great leering eyes the inevitable yourstocommand look of italian males when the men from the country look at these women then it is mindyourself my lady i should think the grovelling madonnaworship is not much of a sardinian feature these women have to look out for themselves keep their own backbone stiff and their knuckles hard man is going to be male lord if he can and woman isnt going to give him too much of his own way either so there you have it the fine old martial split between the sexes it is tonic and splendid really after so much sticky intermingling and backboneless madonnaworship the sardinian isnt looking for the noble woman nobly planned no thank you he wants that young madam over there a young stiffnecked generation that she is far better sport than with the noblyplanned sort hollow frauds that they are better sport too than with a carmen who gives herself away too much in these women there is something shy and defiant and ungetatable the defiant splendid split between the sexes each absolutely determined to defend his side her side from assault so the meeting has a certain wild salty savour each the deadly unknown to the other and at the same time each his own her own native pride and courage taking the dangerous leap and scrambling back  give me the old salty way of love how i am nauseated with sentiment and nobility the macaroni slitheryslobbery mess of modern adorations                                       one sees a few fascinating faces in cagliari those great dark unlighted eyes there are fascinating dark eyes in sicily bright big with an impudent point of light and a curious roll and long lashes the eyes of old greece surely but here one sees eyes of soft blank darkness all velvet with no imp looking out of them and they strike a stranger older note before the soul became selfconscious before the mentality of greece appeared in the world remote always remote as if the intelligence lay deep within the cave and never came forward one searches into the gloom for one second while the glance lasts but without being able to penetrate to the reality it recedes like some unknown creature deeper into its lair there is a creature dark and potent but what  sometimes velasquez and sometimes goya gives us a suggestion of these large dark unlighted eyes and they go with fine fleecy black hairalmost as fine as fur i have not seen them north of cagliari                                       the qb spies some of the blueandred stripeandline cotton stuff of which the peasants make their dress a large roll in the doorway of a dark shop in we go and begin to feel it it is just soft thickish cotton stufftwelve francs a metre like most peasant patterns it is much more complicated and subtle than appears the curious placing of the stripes the subtle proportion and a white thread left down one side only of each broad blue block the stripes moreover run across the cloth not lengthwise with it but the width would be just long enough for a skirtthough the peasant skirts have almost all a band at the bottom with the stripes running roundways  the manhe is the esquimo type simple frank and aimiablesays the stuff is made in france and this the first roll since the war it is the old old pattern quite correctbut the material not quite so good the qb takes enough for a dress  he shows us also cashmeres orange scarlet skyblue royal blue good purewool cashmeres that were being sent to india and were captured from a german mercantile submarine so he says fifty francs a metrevery very wide but they are too much trouble to carry in a knapsack though their brilliance fascinates                                       so we stroll and look at the shops at the filigree gold jewelling of the peasants at a good bookshop but there is little to see and therefore the question is shall we go on shall we go forward  there are two ways of leaving cagliari for the north the state railway that runs up the west side of the island and the narrowgauge secondary railway that pierces the centre but we are too late for the big trains so we will go by the secondary railway wherever it goes  there is a train at 230 and we can get as far as mandas some fifty miles in the interior when we tell the queer little waiter at the hotel he says he comes from mandas and there are two inns so after luncha strictly fish menuwe pay our bill it comes to sixty odd francsfor three good meals each with wine and the nights lodging this is cheap as prices now are in italy  pleased with the simple and friendly scala di ferre i shoulder my sack and we walk off to the second station the sun is shining hot this afternoonburning hot by the sea the road and the buildings look dry and desiccated the harbour rather weary and end of the world  there is a great crowd of peasants at the little station and almost every man has a pair of woven saddlebagsa great flat strip of coarsewoven wool with flat pockets at either end stuffed with purchases these are almost the only carrying bags the men sling them over their shoulder so that one great pocket hangs in front one behind  these saddle bags are most fascinating they are coarsely woven in bands of raw blackrusty wool with varying bands of raw white wool or hemp or cottonthe bands and stripes of varying widths going crosswise and on the pale bands are woven sometimes flowers in most lovely colours rosered and blue and green peasant patternsand sometimes fantastic animals beasts in dark wool again so that these striped zebra bags some wonderful gay with flowery colours on their stripes some weird with fantastic griffinlike animals are a whole landscape in themselves  the train has only first and third class it costs about thirty francs for the two of us third class to mandas which is some sixty miles in we crowd with the joyful saddlebags into the wooden carriage with its many seats  and wonder of wonders punctually to the second off we go out of cagliari en route again     iv  mandas   the coach was fairly full of people returning from market on these railways the third class coaches are not divided into compartments they are left open so that one sees everybody as down a room the attractive saddlebags bercole were disposed anywhere and the bulk of the people settled down to a lively conversazione it is much nicest on the whole to travel third class on the railway there is space there is air and it is like being in a lively inn everybody in good spirits  at our end was plenty of room just across the gangway was an elderly couple like two children coming home very happily he was fat fat all over with a white moustache and a little notunamiable frown she was a tall lean brown woman in a brown fullskirted dress and black apron with huge pocket she wore no head covering and her iron grey hair was parted smoothly they were rather pleased and excited being in the train she took all her money out of her big pocket and counted it and gave it to him all the ten lira notes and the five lira and the two and the one peering at the dirty scraps of pinkbacked onelira notes to see if they were good then she gave him her halfpennies and he stowed them away in the trouser pocket standing up to push them down his fat leg and then one saw to ones amazement that the whole of his shirttail was left out behind like a sort of apron worn backwards whya mystery he was one of those fat goodnatured unheeding men with a little masterful frown such as usually have tall lean hardfaced obedient wives  they were very happy with amazement he watched us taking hot tea from the thermos flask i think he too had suspected it might be a bomb he had blue eyes and standingup white eyebrows  beautiful hot he said seeing the tea steam it is the inevitable exclamation does it do you good  yes said the qb much good and they both nodded complacently they were going home                                       the train was running over the malariallooking seaplainpast the downatheel palm trees past the mosquelooking buildings at a level crossing the woman crossingkeeper darted out vigorously with her red flag and we rambled into the first village it was built of sundried brickadobe houses thick adobe gardenwalls with tile ridges to keep off the rain in the enclosures were dark orange trees but the claycoloured villages claydry looked foreign the next thing to mere earth they seem like foxholes or coyote colonies  looking back one sees cagliari bluff on her rock rather fine with the thin edge of the seas blade curving round it is rather hard to believe in the real sea on this sort of claypale plain                                       but soon we begin to climb to the hills and soon the cultivation begins to be intermittent extraordinary how the heathy moorlike hills come near the sea extraordinary how scrubby and uninhabited the great spaces of sardinia are it is wild with heath and arbutus scrub and a sort of myrtle breasthigh sometimes one sees a few head of cattle and then again come the greyish arablepatches where the corn is grown it is like cornwall like the lands end region here and there in the distance are peasants working on the lonely landscape sometimes it is one man alone in the distance showing so vividly in his blackandwhite costume small and faroff like a solitary magpie and curiously distinct all the strange magic of sardinia is in this sight among the low moorlike hills away in a hollow of the wide landscape one solitary figure small but vivid blackandwhite working alone as if eternally there are patches and hollows of grey arable land good for corn sardinia was once a great granary  usually however the peasants of the south have left off the costume usually it is the invisible soldiers greygreen cloth the italian khaki wherever you go wherever you be you see this khaki this greygreen warclothing how many millions of yards of the thick excellent but hateful material the italian government must have provided i dont know but enough to cover italy with a felt carpet i should think it is everywhere it cases the tiny children in stiff and neutral frocks and coats it covers their extinguished fathers and sometimes it even encloses the women in its warmth it is symbolic of the universal grey mist that has come over men the extinguishing of all bright individuality the blotting out of all wild singleness oh democracy oh khaki democracy                                       this is very different from italian landscape italy is almost always dramatic and perhaps invariably romantic there is drama in the plains of lombardy and romance in the venetian lagoons and sheer scenic excitement in nearly all the hilly parts of the peninsula perhaps it is the natural floridity of limestone formations but italian landscape is really eighteenthcentury landscape to be represented in that romanticclassic manner which makes everything rather marvelous and very topical aqueducts and ruins upon sugarloaf mountains and craggy ravines and wilhelm meister waterfalls all up and down  sardinia is another thing much wider much more ordinary not upanddown at all but running away into the distance unremarkable ridges of moorlike hills running away perhaps to a bunch of dramatic peaks on the southwest this gives a sense of space which is so lacking in italy lovely space about one and traveling distancesnothing finished nothing final it is like liberty itself after the peaky confinement of sicily roomgive me roomgive me room for my spirit and you can have all the toppling crags of romance  so we ran on through the gold of the afternoon across a wide almost celtic landscape of hills our little train winding and puffing away very nimbly only the heath and scrub breasthigh manhigh is too big and brigandlike for a celtic land the horns of black wildlooking cattle show sometimes  after a long pull we come to a station after a stretch of loneliness each time it looks as if there were nothing beyondno more habitations and each time we come to a station  most of the people have left the train and as with men driving in a gig who get down at every publichouse so the passengers usually alight for an airing at each station our old fat friend stands up and tucks his shirttail comfortably in his trousers which trousers all the time make one hold ones breath for they seem at each very moment to be just dropping right down and he clambers out followed by the long brown stalk of a wife  so the train sits comfortably for five or ten minutes in the way the trains have at last we hear whistles and horns and our old fat friend running and clinging like a fat crab to the very end of the train as it sets off at the same instant a loud shriek and a bunch of shouts from outside we all jump up there down the line is the long brown stork of a wife she had just walked back to a house some hundred yards off for a few words and has now seen the train moving  now behold her with her hands thrown to heaven and hear the wild shriek madonna through all the hubbub but she picks up her two skirtknees and with her thin legs in grey stockings starts with a mad rush after the train in vain the train inexorably pursues its course prancing she reaches one end of the platform as we leave the other end then she realizes it is not going to stop for her and then oh horror her long arms thrown out in wild supplication after the retreating train then flung aloft to god then brought down in absolute despair on her head and this is the last sight we have of her clutching her poor head in agony and doubling forward she is leftshe is abandoned  the poor fat husband has been all the time on the little outside platform at the end of the carriage holding out his hand to her and shouting frenzied scolding to her and frenzied yells for the train to stop and the train has not stopped and she is leftleft on that godforsaken station in the waning light  so his face all bright his eyes round and bright as two stars absolutely transfigured by dismay chagrin anger and distress he comes and sits in his seat ablaze stiff speechless his face is almost beautiful in its blaze of conflicting emotions for some time he is as if unconscious in the midst of his feelings then anger and resentment crop out of his consternation he turns with a flash to the longnosed insidious phoenicianlooking guard why couldnt they stop the train for her and immediately as if someone had set fire to him off flares the guard hehthe train cant stop for every persons convenience the train is a trainthe timetable is a timetable what did the old woman want to take her trips down the line for heh she pays the penalty for her own inconsiderateness had she paid for the trainheh and the fat man all the time firing off his unheeding and unheeded answers one minuteonly one minuteif he the conductor had told the driver if he the conductor had shouted a poor woman not another train what was she going to do her ticket and no money a poor woman  there was a train back to cagliari that night said the conductor at which the fat man nearly burst out of his clothing like a bursting seedpod he bounced on his seat what good was that what good was a train back to cagliari when their home was in snelli making matters worse  so they bounced and jerked and argued at one another to their hearts content then the conductor retired smiling subtly in a way they have our fat friend looked at us with hot angry ashamed grieved eyes and said it was a shame yes we chimed it was a shame whereupon a selfimportant miss who said she came from some collegio at cagliari advanced and asked a number of impertinent questions in a tone of pert sympathy after which our fat friend left alone covered his clouded face with his hand turned his back on the world and gloomed  it had all been so dramatic that in spite of ourselves we laughed even while the qb shed a few tears                                       well the journey lasted hours we came to a station and the conductor said we must get out these coaches went no further only two coaches would proceed to mandas so we climbed out with our traps and our fat friend with his saddlebag the picture of misery  the one coach into which we clambered was rather crowded the only other coach was most of it firstclass and the rest of the train was freight we were two insignificant passenger wagons at the end of a long string of freightvans and trucks  there was an empty seat so we sat on it only to realize after about five minutes that a thin old woman with two childrenher grandchildrenwas chuntering her head off because it was her seatwhy she had left it she didnt say and under my legs was her bundle of bread she nearly went off her head and over my head on the little rack was her bercola her saddlebag fat soldiers laughed at her goodnaturedly but she fluttered and flipped like a tart featherless old hen since she had another seat and was quite comfortable we smiled and let her chunter so she clawed her bread bundle from under my legs and clutching it and a fat child sat tense                                       it was getting quite dark the conductor came and said that there was no more paraffin if what there was in the lamps gave out we should have to sit in the dark there was no more paraffin all along the lineso he climbed on the seats and after a long struggle with various boys striking matches for him he managed to obtain a light as big as a pea we sat in this clairobscur and looked at the sombreshadowed faces round us the fat soldier with a gun the handsome soldier with huge saddlebags the weird dark little man who kept exchanging a baby with a solid woman who had a white cloth tied round her head a tall peasantwoman in costume who darted out at a dark station and returned triumphant with a piece of chocolate a young and interested young man who told us every station and the man who spat there is always one  gradually the crowd thinned at a station we saw our fat friend go by bitterly like a betrayed soul his bulging saddlebag hanging before and after but no comfort in it nowno comfort the pea of light from the paraffin lamp grew smaller we sat in incredible dimness and the smell of sheepswool and peasant with only our fat and stoic young man to tell us where we were the other dusky faces began to sink into a dead gloomy silence some took to sleep and the little train ran on and on through unknown sardinian darkness in despair we drained the last drop of tea and ate the last crusts of bread we knew we must arrive some time                                       it was not much after seven when we came to mandas mandas is a junction where these little trains sit and have a long happy chat after their arduous scramble over the downs it had taken us somewhere about five hours to do our fifty miles no wonder then that when the junction at last heaves in sight everybody bursts out of the train like seeds from an exploding pod and rushes somewhere for something to the station restaurant of course hence there is a little station restaurant that does a brisk trade and where one can have a bed  a quite pleasant woman behind the little bar a brown woman with brown parted hair and brownish eyes and brownish tanned complexion and tight brown velveteen bodice she led us up a narrow winding stone stair as up a fortress leading on with her candle and ushered us into the bedroom it smelled horrid and sourish as shutup bedrooms do we threw open the window there were big frosty stars snapping ferociously in heaven  the room contained a huge bed big enough for eight people and quite clean and the table on which stood the candle actually had a cloth but imagine that cloth i think it had been originally white now however it was such a web of timeeaten holes and mournful black inkstains and poor dead wine stains that it was like some 2000 bc mummycloth i wonder if it could have been lifted from that table or if it was mummified on to it i for one made no attempt to try but that tablecover impressed me as showing degrees i had not imagineda tablecloth  we went down the fortressstair to the eatingroom here was a long table with soupplates upside down and a lamp burning an uncanny naked acetylene flame we sat at the cold table and the lamp immediately began to wane the roomin fact the whole of sardiniawas stone cold stone stone cold outside the earth was freezing inside there was no thought of any sort of warmth dungeon stone floors dungeon stone walls and a dead corpselike atmosphere too heavy and icy to move  the lamp went quite out and the qb gave a cry the brown woman poked her head through a hole in the wall beyond her we saw the flames of the cooking and two devilfigures stirring the pots the brown woman came and shook the lampit was like a stodgy porcelain mantelpiece vaseshook it well and stirred up its innards and started it going once more then she appeared with a bowl of smoking cabbage soup in which were bits of macaroni and would we have wine i shuddered at the thought of deathcold red wine of the country so asked what else there was there was malvagiamalvoisie the same old malmsey that did for the duke of clarence so we had a pint of malvagia and were comforted at least we were being so when the lamp went out again the brown woman came and shook and smacked it and started it off again but as if to say shant for you it whipped out again  then came the host with a candle and a pin a large genial sicilian with pendulous mustaches and he thoroughly pricked the wretch with the pin shook it and turned little screws so up flared the flame we were a little nervous he asked us where we came from etc and suddenly he asked us with an excited gleam were we socialists aha he was going to hail us as citizens and comrades he thought we were a pair of bolshevist agents i could see it and as such he was prepared to embrace us but no the qb disclaimed the honor i merely smiled and shook my head it is a pity to rob people of their exciting illusions  ah there is too much socialism everywhere cried the qb  maperhaps perhaps said the discreet sicilian she saw which way the land lay and added  si vuole un pocchetino di socialismo one wants a tiny bit of socialism in the world a tiny bit but not much not much at present there is too much  our host twinkling at this speech which treated of the sacred creed as if it were a pinch of salt in the broth believing the qb was throwing dust in his eyes and thoroughly intrigued by us as a pair of deep ones retired no sooner had he gone than the lampflame stood up at its full length and started to whistle the qb drew back not satisfied by this another flame suddenly began to whip round the bottom of the burner like a lion lashing its tail unnerved we made room the qb cried again in came the host with a subtle smile and a pin and an air of benevolence and tamed the brute  what else was there to eat there was a piece of fried pork for me and boiled eggs for the qb as we were proceeding with these in came the remainder of the nights entertainment three station officials two in scarlet peaked caps one in a blackandgold peaked cap they sat down with a clamour in their caps as if there was a sort of invisible screen between us and them they were young the black cap had a lean and sardonic look one of the redcaps was little and ruddy very young with a little mustache we called him the maialino the gay little black pig he was so plump and foodnourished and frisky the third was rather puffy and pale and had spectacles they all seemed to present us the blank side of their cheek and to intimate that no they were not going to take their hats off even if it were dinnertable and a strange signora and they made rough quips with one another still as if we were on the other side of the invisible screen  determined however to remove this invisible screen i said goodevening and it was very cold they muttered goodevening and yes it was fresh an italian never says it is cold it is never more than fresco but this hint that it was cold they took as a hint at their caps and they became very silent till the woman came in with the soupbowl then they clamoured at her particularly the maialino what was there to eat she told thembeefsteaks of pork whereat they pulled faces or bits of boiled pork they sighed looked gloomy cheered up and said beefsteaks then  and they fell on their soup and never from among the steam have i heard a more joyful trio of soupswilkering they sucked it in from their spoons with long gustorich sucks the maialino was the treblehe trilled his soup into his mouth with a swift sucking vibration interrupted by bits of cabbage which made the lamp start to dither again blackcap was the baritone good rolling spoonsucks and the one in spectacles was the bass he gave sudden deep gulps all was led by the long trilling of the maialino then suddenly to vary matters he cocked up his spoon in one hand chewed a huge mouthful of bread and swallowed it down with a smacksmacksmack of his tongue against his palate as children we used to call this clapping  mother shes clapping i would yell with anger against my sister the german word is schmatzen  so the maialino clapped like a pair of cymbals while baritone and bass rolled on then in chimed the swift bright treble  at this rate however the soup did not last long arrived the beefsteaks of pork and now the trio was a trio of castanet smacks and cymbal claps triumphantly the maialino looked around he outsmacked all  the bread of the country is rather coarse and brown with a hard hard crust a large rock of this is perched on every damp serviette the maialino tore his rock asunder and grumbled at the blackcap who had got a weird sort of threecornered loafroll of pure white breadstarch white he was a swell with this white bread  suddenly blackcap turned to me where had we come from where were we going what for but in laconic sardonic tone  i like sardinia cried the qb  why he asked sarcastically and she tried to find out  yes the sardinians please me more than the sicilians said i  why he asked sarcastically  they are more openmore honest he seemed to turn his nose down  the padrone is a sicilian said the maialino stuffing a huge block of bread into his mouth and rolling his insouciant eyes of a gay wellfed little black pig towards the background we werent making much headway  youve seen cagliari the blackcap said to me like a threat  yes oh cagliari pleases mecagliari is beautiful cried the qb who travels with a vial of melted butter ready for her parsnips  yescagliari is sosocagliari is very fair said the black cap cagliari è discreto he was evidently proud of it  and is mandas nice asked the qb  in what way nice they asked with immense sarcasm  is there anything to see  hens said the maialino briefly they all bristled when one asked if mandas was nice  what does one do here asked the qb  niente at mandas one does nothing at mandas one goes to bed when its dark like a chicken at mandas one walks down the road like a pig that is going nowhere at mandas a goat understands more than the inhabitants understand at mandas one needs socialism  they all cried out at once evidently mandas was more than flesh and blood could bear for another minute to these three conspirators  then you are very bored here say i  yes  and the quiet intensity of that naked yes spoke more than volumes  you would like to be in cagliari  yes  silence intense sardonic silence had intervened the three looked at one another and made a sour joke about mandas then the blackcap turned to me  can you understand sardinian he said  somewhat more than sicilian anyhow  but sardinian is more difficult than sicilian it is full of words utterly unknown to italian  yes but say i it is spoken openly in plain words and sicilian is spoken all stuck together none of the words there at all  he looks at me as if i were an imposter yet it is true i find it quite easy to understand sardinian as a matter of fact it is more a question of human approach than of sound sardinian seems open and manly and downright sicilian is gluey and evasive as if the sicilian didnt want to speak straight to you as a matter of fact he doesnt he is an overcultured sensitive ancient soul and he has so many sides to his mind that he hasnt got any definite one mind at all hes got a dozen minds and uneasily hes aware of it and to commit himself to anyone of them is merely playing a trick on himself and his interlocutor the sardinian on the other hand still seems to have one downright mind i bump up against a downright smackout belief in socialism for example the sicilian is much too old in our culture to swallow socialism whole much too ancient and rusé not to be sophisticated about any and every belief hell go off like a squib and then hell smoulder acridly and sceptically even against his own fire one sympathizes with him in retrospect but in daily life it is unbearable  where do you find such white bread say i to the black cap because he is proud of it  it comes from my home and then he asks about the bread of sicily is it any whiter than thisthe mandas rock yes it is a little whiter at which they gloom again for it is a very sore point this bread bread means a great deal to an italian it is verily his staff of life he practically lives on bread and instead of going by taste he now like all the world goes by eye he has got it into his head that bread should be white so that every time he fancies a darker shade in the loaf a shadow falls on his soul nor is he altogether wrong for although personally i dont like white bread any more yet i do like my brown bread to be made of pure unmixed flour the peasants in sicily who have kept their own wheat and make their own natural brown bread ah it is amazing how fresh and sweet and clean their loaf seems so perfumed as homebread used all to be before the war whereas the bread of the commune the regulation supply is hard and rather coarse and rough so rough and harsh on the palate one gets tired to death of it i suspect myself the maize meal mixed in but i dont know and finally the bread varies immensely from town to town from commune to commune the socalled just and equal distribution is all myeye one place has abundance of good sweet bread another scrapes along always stinted on an allowance of harsh coarse stuff and the poor suffer bitterly really from the breadstinting because they depend so on this one food they say the inequality and the injustice of distribution comes from the camorrala grande camorrawhich is no more nowadays than a profiteering combine which the poor hate but for myself i dont know i only know that one townvenice for exampleseems to have an endless supply of pure bread of sugar of tobacco of saltwhile florence is in one continual ferment of irritation over the stinting of these supplieswhich are all government monopoly doled out accordingly  we said goodnight to our three railway friends and went up to bed we had only been in the room a minute or two when the brown woman tapped and if you please the blackcap had sent us one of his little white loaves we were really touched such delicate little generosities have almost disappeared from the world  it was a queer little breadthreecornered and almost as hard as ships biscuit made of starch flour not strictly bread at all                                       the night was cold the blankets flat and heavy but one slept quite well till dawn at seven oclock it was a clear cold morning the sun not yet up standing at the bedroom window looking out i could hardly believe my eyes it was so like england like cornwall in the bleak parts or derbyshire uplands there was a little paddockgarden at the back of the station rather tumbledown with two sheep in it there were several forlornlooking outbuildings very like cornwall and then the wide forlorn country road stretched away between borders of grass and low drystone walls towards a grey stone farm with a tuft of trees and a naked stone village in the distance the sun came up yellow the bleak country glimmered bluish and reluctant the low green hillslopes were divided into fields with low drystone walls and ditches here and there a stone barn rose alone or with a few bare windy trees attached two roughcoated winter horses pastured on the rough grass a boy came along the naked wide grassbordered highroad with a couple of milk cans drifting in from nowhere and it was all so like cornwall or a part of ireland that the old nostalgia for the celtic regions began to spring up in me ah those old drystone walls dividing the fieldspale and graniteblenched ah the dark sombre grass the naked sky the forlorn horses in the wintry morning strange is a celtic landscape far more moving disturbing than the lovely glamor of italy and greece before the curtains of history lifted one feels the world was like thisthis celtic bareness and sombreness and air but perhaps it is not celtic at all iberian nothing is more unsatisfactory than our conception of what is celtic and what is not celtic i believe there never were any celts as a raceas for the iberians  illustration tonara  wonderful to go out on a frozen road to see the grass in shadow bluish with hoarfrost to see the grass in the yellow wintersunrise beams melting and going coldtwinkly wonderful the bluish cold air and things standing up in cold distance after two southern winters with roses blooming all the time this bleakness and this touch of frost in the ringing morning goes to my soul like an intoxication i am so glad on this lonely naked road i dont know what to do with myself i walk down in the shallow grassy ditches under the loose stone walls i walk on the little ridge of grass the little bank on which the wall is built i cross the road across the frozen cowdroppings and it is all so familiar to my feet my very feet in contact that i am wild as if i had made a discovery and i realize that i hate limestone to live on limestone or marble or any of those limey rocks i hate them they are dead rocks they have no lifethrills for the feet even sandstone is much better but granite granite is my favorite it is so live under the feet it has a deep sparkle of its own i like its roundnessesand i hate the jaggy dryness of limestone that burns in the sun and withers                                       after coming to a deep well in a grassy plot in a wide space of the road i go back across the sunny naked upland country towards the pink station and its outbuildings an engine is steaming its white clouds in the new light away to the left there is even a row of small houses like a row of railwaymens dwellings strange and familiar sight and the station precincts are disorderly and rather dilapidated i think of our sicilian host  the brown woman gives us coffee and very strong rich goats milk and bread after which the qb and i set off once more along the road to the village she too is thrilled she too breathes deep she too feels space around her and freedom to move the limbs such as one does not feel in italy and sicily where all is so classic and fixed  the village itself is just a long winding darkish street in shadow of houses and shops and a smithy it might almost be cornwall not quite something i dont know what suggests the stark burning glare of summer and then of course there is none of the cosiness which climbing roses and lilac trees and cottage shops and haystacks would give to an english scene this is harder barer starker more dreary an ancient man in the blackandwhite costume comes out of a hovel of a cottage the butcher carries a huge side of meat the women peer at usbut more furtive and reticent than the howling stares of italy  so we go on down the roughcobbled street through the whole length of the village and emerging on the other side past the last cottage we find ourselves again facing the open country on the gentle downslope of the rolling hill the landscape continues the same low rolling upland hills dim under the yellow sun of the january morning stone fences fields greyarable land a man slowly slowly ploughing with a pony and a darkred cow the road trailing empty across the distance and then the one violently unfamiliar note the enclosed cemetery lying outside on the gentle hillside closed in all round very compact with high walls and on the inside face of the enclosure wall the marble slabs like shut drawers of the sepulchres shining white the wall being like a chest of drawers or pigeon holes to hold the dead tufts of dark and plumy cypresses rise among the flat graves of the enclosure in the south cemeteries are walled off and isolated very tight the dead as it were are kept fast in pound there is no spreading of graves over the face of the country they are penned in a tight fold with cypresses to fatten on the bones this is the one thoroughly strange note in the landscape but allpervading there is a strangeness that strange feeling as if the depths were barren which comes in the south and the east sunstricken sunstricken and the heart eaten out by the dryness  i like it i like it cries the qb  but could you live here she would like to say yes but darent  we stray back the qb wants to buy one of those saddlebag arrangements i say what for she says to keep things in ach but peeping in the shops we see one and go in and examine it it is quite a sound one properly made but plain quite plain on the white crossstripes there are no lovely colored flowers of rose and green and magenta the three favorite sardinian colors nor are there any of the fantastic and griffinlike beasts so it wont do how much does it cost fortyfive francs  there is nothing to do in mandas so we will take the morning train and go to the terminus to sorgono thus we shall cross the lower slopes of the great central knot of sardinia the mountain knot called gennargentu and sorgono we feel will be lovely  back at the station we make tea on the spirit lamp fill the thermos pack the knapsack and the kitchenino and come out into the sun of the platform the qb goes to thank the blackcap for the white bread whilst i settle the bill and ask for food for the journey the brown woman fishes out from a huge black pot in the background sundry hunks of coarse boiled pork and gives me two of these hot with bread and salt this is the luncheon i pay the bill which amounts to twentyfour francs for everything one says francs or liras irrespective in italy at that moment arrives the train from cagliari and men rush in roaring for the soupor rather for the broth ready ready she cries going to the black pot     v  to sorgono   the various trains in the junction squatted side by side and had long long talks before at last we were off it was wonderful to be running in the bright morning towards the heart of sardinia in the little train that seemed so familiar we were still going third class rather to the disgust of the railway officials at mandas  at first the country was rather open always the long spurs of hills steepsided but not high and from our little train we looked across the country across hill and dale in the distance was a little town on a low slope but for its compact fortified look it might have been a town on the english downs a man in the carriage leaned out of the window holding out a white cloth as a signal to someone in the far off town that he was coming the wind blew the white cloth the town in the distance glimmered small and alone in its hollow and the little train pelted along  it was rather comical to see it we were always climbing and the line curved in great loops so that as one looked out of the window time and again one started seeing a little train running in front of us in a diverging direction making big puffs of steam but lo it was our own little engine pelting off around a loop away ahead we were quite a long train but all trucks in front only our two passenger coaches hitched on behind and for this reason our own engine was always running fussily into sight like some dog scampering in front and swerving about us while we followed at the tail end of the thin string of trucks  i was surprised how well the small engine took the continuous steep slopes how bravely it emerged on the skyline it is a queer railway i would like to know who made it it pelts up hill and down dale and round sudden bends in the most unconcerned fashion not as proper big railways do grunting inside deep cuttings and stinking their way through tunnels but running up the hill like a panting small dog and having a look round and starting off in another direction whisking us behind unconcernedly this is much more fun than the tunnelandcutting system  they told me that sardinia mines her own coal and quite enough for her own needs but very soft not fit for steampurposes i saw heaps of it small dull dirtylooking stuff truckloads of it too and truckloads of grain  at every station we were left ignominiously planted while the little enginesthey had gay gold names on their black little bodiesstrolled about along the sidelines and snuffed at the various trucks there we sat at every station while some truck was discarded and some other sorted out like a branded sheep from the sidings and hitched on to us it took a long time this did                                       all the stations so far had had wire netting over the windows this means malariamosquitoes the malaria climbs very high in sardinia the shallow upland valleys moorland with their intense summer sun and the riverless boggy behaviour of the water breed the pest inevitably but not very terribly as far as one can make out august and september being the danger months the natives dont like to admit there is any malaria a tiny bit they say a tiny bit as soon as you come to the trees there is no more so they say for many miles the landscape is moorland and downlike with no trees but wait for the trees ah the woods and forests of gennargentu the woods and forests higher up no malaria there  the little engine whisks up and up around its loopy curves as if it were going to bite its own tail we being the tail then suddenly dives over the skyline out of sight and the landscape changes the famous woods begin to appear at first it is only hazelthickets miles of hazelthickets all wild with a few black cattle trying to peep at us out of the green myrtle and arbutus scrub which forms the undergrowth and a couple of rare wild peasants peering at the train they wear the black sheepskin tunic with the wool outside and the long stocking caps like cattle they too peer out from between deep bushes the myrtle scrub here rises manhigh and cattle and men are smothered in it the big hazels rise bare above it must be difficult getting about in these parts  sometimes in the distance one sees a blackandwhite peasant riding lonely across a more open place a tiny vivid figure i like so much the proud instinct which makes a living creature distinguish itself from its background i hate the rabbity khaki protectioncolouration a blackandwhite peasant on his pony only a dot in the distance beyond the foliage still flashes and dominates the landscape haha proud mankind there you ride but alas most of the men are still khakimuffled rabbitindistinguishable ignominious the italians look curiously rabbity in the greygreen uniform just as our sandcolored khaki men look doggy they seem to scuffle rather abased ignominious on the earth give us back the scarlet and gold and devil take the hindmost                                       the landscape really begins to change the hillsides tilt sharper and sharper a man is ploughing with two small red cattle on a craggy treehanging slope as sharp as a roofside he stoops at the small wooden plough and jerks the ploughlines the oxen lift their noses to heaven with a strange and beseeching snakelike movement and taking tiny little steps with their frail feet move slantingly across the slopeface between rocks and treeroots little frail jerky steps the bullocks take and again they put their horns back and lift their muzzles snakily to heaven as the man pulls the line and he skids his wooden plough round another scoop of earth it is marvellous how they hang upon that steep craggy slope an english labourers eyes would bolt out of his head at the sight  there is a stream actually a long tress of a waterfall pouring into a little gorge and a streambed that opens a little and shows a marvellous cluster of naked poplars away below they are like ghosts they have a ghostly almost phosphorescent luminousness in the shadow of the valley by the stream of water if not phosphorescent then incandescent a grey goldishpale incandescence of naked limbs and myriad coldglowing twigs gleaming strangely if i were a painter i would paint them for they seem to have living sentient flesh and the shadow envelopes them  another naked tree i would paint is the gleaming mauvesilver fig which burns its cold incandescence tangled like some sensitive creature emerged from the rock a fig tree come forth in its nudity gleaming over the dark winterearth is a sight to behold like some white tangled sea anemone ah if it could but answer or if we had treespeech                                       yes the steep valley sides become almost gorges and there are trees not forests such as i had imagined but scattered grey smallish oaks and some lithe chestnuts chestnuts with their long whips and oaks with their stubby boughs scattered on steep hillsides where rocks crop out the train perilously winding round half way up then suddenly bolting over a bridge and into a completely unexpected station what is more men crowd inthe station is connected with the main railway by a post motoromnibus  an unexpected irruption of menthey may be miners or navvies or landworkers they all have huge sacks some lovely saddlebags with rosecoloured flowers across the darkness one old man is in full blackandwhite costume but very dirty and coming to pieces the others wear the tight madderbrown breeches and sleeved waistcoats some have the sheepskin tunic and all wear the long stocking cap and how they smell of sheepwool and of men and goat a rank scent fills the carriage  they talk and are very lively and they have mediaeval faces rusé never really abandoning their defences for a moment as a badger or a polecat never abandons its defences there is none of the brotherliness and civilised simplicity each man knows he must guard himself and his own each man knows the devil is behind the next bush they have never known the postrenaissance jesus which is rather an eyeopener  not that they are suspicious or uneasy on the contrary noisy assertive vigorous presences but with none of that implicit belief that everybody will be and ought to be good to them which is the mark of our era they dont expect people to be good to them they dont want it they remind me of halfwild dogs that will love and obey but which wont be handled they wont have their heads touched and they wont be fondled one can almost hear the halfsavage growl  the long stocking caps they wear as a sort of crest as a lizard wears his crest at mating time they are always moving them settling them on their heads one fat fellow young with sly brown eyes and a young beard round his face folds his stockingfoot in three so that it rises over his brow martial and handsome the old boy brings his stockingfoot over the left ear a handsome fellow with a jaw of massive teeth pushes his cap back and lets it hang a long way down his back then he shifts it forward over his nose and makes it have two stickingout points like foxears above his temples it is marvellous how much expression these caps can take on they say that only those born to them can wear them they seem to be just long bags nearly a yard long of black stockinette stuff  the conductor comes to issue them their tickets and they all take out rolls of paper money even a little mothy rat of a man who sits opposite me has quite a pad of tenfranc notes nobody seems short of a hundred francs nowadays nobody  they shout and expostulate with the conductor full of coarse life they are but so coarse the handsome fellow has his sleeved waistcoat open and his shirtbreast has come unbuttoned not looking it seems as if he wears a black undervest then suddenly one sees it is his own hair he is quite black inside his shirt like a black goat  but there is a gulf between oneself and them they have no inkling of our crucifixion our universal consciousness each of them is pivoted and limited to himself as the wild animals are they look out and they see other objects objects to ridicule or mistrust or to sniff curiously at but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself has never entered their souls at all not even the thin end of it they might love their neighbour with a hot dark unquestioning love but the love would probably leave off abruptly the fascination of what is beyond them has not seized on them their neighbour is a mere external their life is centripetal pivoted inside itself and does not run out towards others and mankind one feels for the first time the real old mediaeval life which is enclosed in itself and has no interest in the world outside  and so they lie about on the seats play a game shout and sleep and settle their long stockingcaps and spit it is wonderful in them that at this time of day they still wear the long stockingcaps as part of their inevitable selves it is a sign of obstinate and powerful tenacity they are not going to be broken in upon by worldconsciousness they are not going into the worlds common clothes coarse vigorous determined they will stick to their own coarse dark stupidity and let the big world find its own way to its own enlightened hell their hell is their own hell they prefer it unenlightened  and one cannot help wondering whether sardinia will resist right through will the last waves of enlightenment and worldunity break over them and wash away the stockingcaps or is the tide of enlightenment and worldunity already receding fast enough  certainly a reaction is setting in away from the old universality back away from cosmopolitanism and internationalism russia with her third international is at the same time reacting most violently away from all other contact back recoiling on herself into a fierce unapproachable russianism which motion will conquer the workmans international or the centripetal movement into national isolation are we going to merge into one grey proletarian homogeneityor are we going to swing back into moreorless isolated separate defiant communities  probably both the workmans international movement will finally break the flow towards cosmopolitanism and worldassimilation and suddenly in a crash the world will fly back into intense separations the moment has come when america that extremist in worldassimilation and worldoneness is reacting into violent egocentricity a truly amerindian egocentricity as sure as fate we are on the brink of american empire  for myself i am glad i am glad that the era of love and oneness is over hateful homogeneous worldoneness i am glad that russia flies back into savage russianism scythism savagely selfpivoting i am glad that america is doing the same i shall be glad when men hate their common worldalike clothes when they tear them up and clothe themselves fiercely for distinction savage distinction savage distinction against the rest of the creeping world when america kicks the billycock and the collarandtie into limbo and takes to her own national costume when men fiercely react against looking all alike and being all alike and betake themselves into vivid clan or nationdistinctions  the era of love and oneness is over the era of worldalike should be at an end the other tide has set in men will set their bonnets at one another now and fight themselves into separation and sharp distinction the day of peace and oneness is over the day of the great fight into multifariousness is at hand hasten the day and save us from proletarian homogeneity and khaki allalikeness  i love my indomitable coarse men from mountain sardinia for their stockingcaps and their splendid animalbright stupidity if only the last wave of allalikeness wont wash those superb crests those caps away                                       we are struggling now among the gennargentu spurs there is no single peakno etna of sardinia the train like the plough balances on the steep steep sides of the hillspurs and winds around and around above and below the steep slopes are all bosky these are the woods of gennargentu but they arent woods in my sense of the word they are thin sprinkles of oaks and chestnuts and corktrees over steep hillslopes and corktrees i see curious slim oakylooking trees that are stripped quite naked below the boughs standing brownruddy curiously distinct among the bluey grey pallor of the others they remind me again and again of glowing coffeebrown naked aborigines of the south seas they have the naked suavity skinbare and an intense coffeered colour of unclothed savages and these are the stripped corktrees some are much stripped some little some have the whole trunk and part of the lower limbs ruddy naked some only a small part of the trunk                                       it is well on in the afternoon a peasant in black and white and his young handsome woman in rosered costume with gorgeous apron bordered deep with grassgreen and a little darkpurple waistcoat over her white full bodice are sitting behind me talking the workmen peasants are subsiding into sleep it is well on in the afternoon we have long ago eaten the meat now we finish the white loaf the gift and the tea suddenly looking out of the window we see gennargentus mass behind us a thick snowdeep knotsummit beautiful beyond the long steep spurs among which we are engaged we lose the white mountain mass for half an hour when suddenly it emerges unexpectedly almost in front the great snowheaved shoulder  how different it is from etna that lonely selfconscious wonder of sicily this is much more human and knowable with a deep breast and massive limbs a powerful mountainbody it is like the peasants                                       the stations are far betweenan hour from one to another ah how weary one gets of these journeys they last so long we look across a valleya stones throw but alas the little train has no wings and cant jump so back turns the line back and back towards gennargentu a long rocky way till it comes at length to the poor valleyhead this it skirts fussily and sets off to pelt down on its traces again gaily and a man who was looking at us doing our roundabout has climbed down and crossed the valley in five minutes  the peasants nearly all wear costumes now even the women in the fields the little fields in the halfpopulated valleys these gennargentu valleys are all halfpopulated more than the moors further south  it is past three oclock and cold where there is no sun at last only one more station before the terminus and here the peasants wake up sling the bulging sacks over their shoulders and get down we see tonara away above we see our old grimy blackandwhite peasant greeted by his two women who have come to meet him with the ponydaughters handsome in vivid rose and green costume peasants men in black and white men in madderbrown with the close breeches on their compact thighs women in roseandwhite ponies with saddlebags all begin to trail up the hillroad in silhouette very handsome towards the faroff perched sunbright village of tonara a big village shining like a new jerusalem                                       the train as usual leaves us standing and shuffles with truckswater sounds in the valley there are stacks of cork on the station and coal an idiot girl in a great full skirt entirely made of coloured patches mops and mows her little waistcoat thing is also incredibly old and shows faint signs of having once been a lovely purple and black brocade the valley and steep slopes are open about us an old shepherd has a lovely flock of delicate merino sheep  and at last we move in one hour we shall be there as we travel among the tree slopes many brown corktrees we come upon a flock of sheep two peasants in our carriage looking out give the most weird unnatural highpitched shrieks entirely unproduceable by any ordinary being the sheep know however and scatter and after ten minutes the shrieks start again for three young cattle whether the peasants do it for love i dont know but it is the wildest and weirdest inhuman shepherd noise i have ever heard                                       it is saturday afternoon and four oclock the country is wild and uninhabited the train almost empty yet there is the leavingoffwork feeling in the atmosphere oh twisty wooded steep slopes oh glimpses of gennargentu oh niggerstripped corktrees oh smell of peasants oh wooden wearisome railway carriage we are so sick of you nearly seven hours of this journey already and a distance of sixty miles  but we are almost therelook look sorgono nestling beautifully among the wooded slopes in front oh magic little town ah you terminus and ganglion of the inland roads we hope in you for a pleasant inn and happy company perhaps we will stay a day or two at sorgono  the train gives a last sigh and draws to a last standstill in the tiny terminus station an old fellow fluttering with rags as a hen in the wind flutters asked me if i wanted the albergo the inn i said yes and let him take my knapsack pretty sorgono as we went down the brief muddy lane between hedges to the village highroad we seemed almost to have come to some little town in the english westcountry or in hardys country there were glades of stripling oaks and big slopes with oak trees and on the right a sawmill buzzing and on the left the town white and close nestling round a baroque churchtower and the little lane was muddy  three minutes brought us to the highroad and a great pinkwashed building blank on the road facing the station lane and labelled in huge letters ristorante risveglio the letter n being printed backwards risveglio if you please which means waking up or rousing like the word reveille into the doorway of the risveglio bolted the flutterer half a minute said i where is the albergo ditalia i was relying on baedeker  non cè più replied my ragfeather there isnt it any more this answer being very frequent nowadays is always most disconcerting  well then what other hotel  there is no other  risveglio or nothing in we go we pass into a big dreary bar where are innumerable bottles behind a tin counter flutterjack yells and at length appears mine host a youngish fellow of the esquimo type but rather bigger in a dreary black suit and a cutaway waistcoat suggesting a dinnerwaistcoat and innumerable winestains on his shirt front i instantly hated him for the filthy appearance he made he wore a battered hat and his face was long unwashed  was there a bedroom  yes  and he led the way down the passage just as dirty as the road outside up the hollow wooden stairs also just as clean as the passage along a hollow drumrearing dirty corridor and into a bedroom well it contained a large bed thin and flat with a greywhite counterpane like a large poor marbleslabbed tomb in the rooms sordid emptiness one dilapidated chair on which stood the miserablest weed of a candle i have ever seen a broken washsaucer in a wire ring and for the rest an expanse of wooden floor as dirtygreyblack as it could be and an expanse of wall charted with the bloody deaths of mosquitoes the window was about two feet above the level of a sort of stableyard outside with a fowlhouse just by the sash there at the window flew lousy feathers and dirty straw the ground was thick with chickendroppings an ass and two oxen comfortably chewed hay in an open shed just across and plump in the middle of the yard lay a bristly black pig taking the last of the sun smells of course were varied  the knapsack and the kitchenino were dropped on the repulsive floor which i hated to touch with my boots even i turned back the sheets and looked at other peoples stains  there is nothing else  niente said he of the lank low forehead and beastly shirtbreast and he sullenly departed i gave the flutterer his tip and he too ducked and fled then the queenbee and i took a few mere sniffs  dirty disgusting swine said i and i was in a rage  i could have forgiven him anything i think except his horrible shirtbreast his personal shamelessness  we strolled roundsaw various other bedrooms some worse one really better but this showed signs of being occupied all the doors were open the place was quite deserted and open to the road the one thing that seemed definite was honesty it must be a very honest place for every footed beast man or animal could walk in at random and nobody to take the slightest regard  so we went downstairs the only other apartment was the open public bar which seemed like part of the road a muleteer leaving his mules at the corner of the risveglio was drinking at the counter                                       this famous inn was at the end of the village we strolled along the road between the houses downhill a dreary hole a cold hopeless lifeless saturday afternoonweary village rather sordid with nothing to say for itself no real shops at all a wearylooking church and a clutch of disconsolate houses we walked right through the village in the middle was a sort of open space where stood a great grey motoromnibus and a busdriver looking rather weary  where did the bus go  it went to join the main railway  when  at halfpast seven in the morning  only then  only then  thank god we can get out anyhow said i  we passed on and emerged beyond the village still on the descending great highroad that was mended with loose stones pitched on it this wasnt good enough besides we were out of the sun and the place being at a considerable elevation it was very cold so we turned back to climb quickly uphill into the sun                                       we went up a little sideturning past a bunch of poor houses towards a steep little lane between banks and before we knew where we were we were in the thick of the public lavatory in these villages as i knew there are no sanitary arrangements of any sort whatever every villager and villageress just betook himself at need to one of the sideroads it is the immemorial italian custom why bother about privacy the most sociallyconstituted people on earth they even like to relieve themselves in company  we found ourselves in the full thick of one of these meetingplaces to get out at any price so we scrambled up the steep earthen banks to a stubble field above and by this time i was in a greater rage                                       evening was falling the sun declining below us clustered the sodomapple of this vile village around were fair treeclad hills and dales already bluish with the frostshadows the air bit cold and strong in a very little time the sun would be down we were at an elevation of about 2500 feet above the sea  no denying it was beautiful with the oakslopes and the wistfulness and the faroff feeling of loneliness and evening but i was in too great a temper to admit it we clambered frenziedly to get warm and the sun immediately went right down and the iceheavy blue shadow fell over us all the village began to send forth blue woodsmoke and it seemed more than ever like the twilit west country  but thank youwe had to get back and run the gauntlet of that stinking stinking lane never towering with furyquite unreasonable but there you arei marched the qb down a declivity through a wood over a ploughed field along a carttrack and so to the great highroad above the village and above the inn  it was cold and evening was falling into dusk down the highroad came wild halfragged men on ponies in all degrees of costume and notcostume came four wideeyed cows stepping downhill round the corner and three delicate beautiful merino sheep which stared at us with their prominent goldcurious eyes came an ancient ancient man with a stick came a stoutchested peasant carrying a long woodpole came a straggle of alert and triumphant goats longhorned longhaired jingling their bells everybody greeted us hesitatingly and everything came to a halt at the risveglio corner while the men had a nip  i attacked the spottybreast again  could i have milk  no perhaps in an hour there would be milk perhaps not  was there anything to eat  noat half past seven there would be something to eat  was there a fire  nothe man hadnt made the fire  nothing to do but to go to that foul bedroom or walk the highroad we turned up the highroad again animals stood about the road in the frostheavy air with heads sunk passively waiting for the men to finish their drinks in the beastly barwe walked slowly up the hill in a field on the right a flock of merino sheep moved mistily uneasily climbing at the gaps in the broken road bank and sounding their innumerable small fine bells with a frosty ripple of sound a figure which in the dusk i had really thought was something inanimate broke into movement in the field it was an old shepherd very old in very ragged dirty blackandwhite who had been standing like a stone there in the open fieldend for heaven knows how long utterly motionless leaning on his stick now he broke into a dreammotion and hobbled after the wistful feminine inquisitive sheep the red was fading from the faroff west at the corner climbing slowly and wearily we almost ran into a grey and lonely bull who came stepping downhill in his measured fashion like some god he swerved his head and went round us  we reached a place which we couldnt make out then saw it was a corkshed there were stacks and stacks of corkbark in the dusk like crumpled hides  now im going back said the qb flatly and she swung round the last red was smouldering beyond the lost thinwooded hills of this interior a fleece of blue halfluminous smoke floated over the obscure village the highway wound downhill at our feet pale and blue  and the qb was angry with me for my fury  why are you so indignant anyone would think your moral self had been outraged why take it morally you petrify that man at the inn by the very way you speak to him such condemnation why dont you take it as it comes its all life  but no my rage is black black black why heaven knows but i think it was because sorgono had seemed so fascinating to me when i imagined it beforehand oh so fascinating if i had expected nothing i should not have been so hit blessed is he that expecteth nothing for he shall not be disappointed  i cursed the degenerate aborigines the dirtybreasted host who dared to keep such an inn the sordid villagers who had the baseness to squat their beastly human nastiness in this upland valley all my praise of the long stockingcapyou remembervanished from my mouth i cursed them all and the qb for an interfering female                                       in the bar a wretched candle was weeping lightuneasy gloomy men were drinking their saturdayeveninghomecoming dram cattle lay down in the road in the cold air as if hopeless  had the milk come  no  when would it come  he didnt know  well what were we to do was there no room was there nowhere where we could sit  yes there was the stanza now  now taking the only weed of a candle and leaving the drinkers in the dark he led us down a dark and stumbly earthen passage over loose stones and an odd plank as it would seem underground to the stanza the room  the stanza it was pitch darkbut suddenly i saw a big fire of oakroot a brilliant flamy rich fire and my rage in that second disappeared  the host and the candle forsook us at the door the stanza would have been in complete darkness save for that rushing bouquet of new flames in the chimney like fresh flowers by this firelight we saw the room it was like a dungeon absolutely empty with an uneven earthen floor quite dry and high bare walls gloomy with a handbreadth of window high up there was no furniture at all save a little wooden bench a foot high before the fire and several homemadelooking rush mats rolled up and leaning against the walls furthermore a chair before the fire on which hung wet tablenapkins apart from this it was a high dark naked prisondungeon  but it was quite dry it had an open chimney and a gorgeous new fire rushing like a waterfall upwards among the craggy stubs of a pile of dry oak roots i hastily put the chair and the wet corpsecloths to one side we sat on the low bench side by side in the dark in front of this rippling rich fire in front of the cavern of the open chimney and we did not care any more about the dungeon and the darkness man can live without food but he cant live without fire it is an italian proverb we had found the fire like new gold and we sat in front of it a little way back side by side on the low form our feet on the uneven earthen floor and felt the flamelight rippling upwards over our faces as if we were bathing in some gorgeous stream of fieriness i forgave the dirtybreasted host everything and was as glad as if i had come into a kingdom  so we sat alone for half an hour smiling into the flames bathing our faces in the glow from time to time i was aware of steps in the tunnellike passage outside and of presences peering but no one came i was aware too of the faint steaming of the beastly tablenapkins the only other occupants of the room                                       in dithers a candle and an elderly bearded man in goldcoloured corduroys and an amazing object on a long long spear he put the candle on the mantelledge and crouched at the side of the fire arranging the oakroots he peered strangely and fixedly in the fire and he held up the speared object before our faces  it was a kid that he had come to roast but it was a kid opened out made quite flat and speared like a flat fan on a long iron stalk it was a really curious sight and it must have taken some doing the whole of the skinned kid was there the head curled in against a shoulder the stubby cut ears the eyes the teeth the few hairs of the nostrils and the feet curled curiously round like an animal that puts its forepaw over its ducked head and the hindlegs twisted indescribably up and all skewered flatwise upon the long iron rod so that it was a complete flat pattern it reminded me intensely of those distorted slimlimbed doglike animals which figure on the old lombard ornaments distorted and curiously infolded upon themselves celtic illuminations also have these distorted involuted creatures  the old man flourished the flat kid like a bannerette whilst he arranged the fire then in one side of the fireplace wall he poked the point of the rod he himself crouched on the hearthend in the halfshadow at the other side of the fireplace holding the further end of the long iron rod the kid was thus extended before the fire like a handscreen and he could spin it round at will  illustration sorongo  but the hole in the masonry of the chimneypiece was not satisfactory the point of the rod kept slipping and the kid came down against the fire he muttered and muttered to himself and tried again then at length he reared up the kidbanner whilst he got large stones from a dark corner he arranged these stones so that the iron point rested on them he himself sat away on the opposite side of the fireplace on the shadowy hearthend and with queer spellbound black eyes and completely immovable face he watched the flames and the kid and held the handle end of the rod  we asked him if the kid was for the evening mealand he said it was it would be good and he said yes and looked with chagrin at the bit of ash on the meat where it had slipped it is a point of honour that it should never touch the ash did they do all their meat this way he said they did and wasnt it difficult to put the kid thus on the iron rod he said it was not easy and he eyed the joint closely and felt one of the forelegs and muttered that was not fixed properly  he spoke with a very soft mutter hard to catch and sideways never to us direct but his manner was gentle soft muttering reticent sensitive he asked us where we came from and where we were going always in his soft mutter and what nation were we were we french then he went on to say there was a warbut he thought it was finished there was a war because the austrians wanted to come into italy again but the french and the english came to help italy a lot of sardinians had gone to it but let us hope it is all finished he thought it wasyoung men of sorgono had been killed he hoped it was finished  then he reached for the candle and peered at the kid it was evident he was the born roaster he held the candle and looked for a long time at the sizzling side of the meat as if he would read portents then he held his spit to the fire again and it was as if time immemorial were roasting itself another meal i sat holding the candle                                       a young woman appeared hearing voices her head was swathed in a shawl one side of which was brought across right over the mouth so that only her two eyes and her nose showed the qb thought she must have toothachebut she laughed and said no as a matter of fact that is the way a headdress is worn in sardinia even by both sexes it is something like the folding of the arabs burnoose the point seems to be that the mouth and chin are thickly covered also the ears and brow leaving only the nose and eyes exposed they say it keeps off the malaria the men swathe shawls round their heads in the same way it seems to me they want to keep their heads warm dark and hidden they feel secure inside  she wore the workaday costume a full darkbrown skirt the full white bodice and a little waistcoat or corset this little waistcoat in her case had become no more than a shaped belt sending up graceful stiffened points under the breasts like long leaves standing up it was prettybut all dirty she too was pretty but with an impudent not quite pleasant manner she fiddled with the wet napkins asked us various questions and addressed herself rather jerkily to the old man who answered hardly at allthen she departed again the women are selfconscious in a rather smirky way bouncy  when she was gone i asked the old man if she was his daughter he said very brusquely in his soft mutter no she came from a village some miles away he did not belong to the inn he was as far as i understood the postman but i may have been mistaken about the word  but he seemed laconic unwilling to speak about the inn and its keepers there seemed to be something queer and again he asked where we were going he told me there were now two motorbuses a new one which ran over the mountains to nuoro much better go to nuoro than to abbasanta nuoro was evidently the town towards which these villages looked as a sort of capital                                       the kidroasting proceeded very slowly the meat never being very near the fire from time to time the roaster arranged the cavern of redhot roots then he threw on more roots it was very hot and he turned the long spit and still i held the candle  other people came strolling in to look at us but they hovered behind us in the dark so i could not make out at all clearly they strolled in the gloom of the dungeonlike room and watched us one came forwarda fat fat young soldier in uniform i made place for him on the benchbut he put out his hand and disclaimed the attention then he went away again  the old man propped up the roast and then he too disappeared for a time the thin candle guttered the fire was no longer flamy but red the roaster reappeared with a new shorter spear thinner and a great lump of raw hogfat spitted on it this he thrust into the red fire it sizzled and smoked and spit fat and i wondered he told me he wanted it to catch fire it refused he groped in the hearth for the bits of twigs with which the fire had been started these twigstumps he stuck in the fat like an orange stuck with cloves then he held it in the fire again now at last it caught and it was a flaming torch running downwards with a thin shower of flaming fat and now he was satisfied he held the fattorch with its yellow flares over the browning kid which he turned horizontal for the occasion all over the roast fell the flaming drops till the meat was all shiny and browny he put it to the fire again holding the diminishing fat still burning bluish over it all the time in the upper air                                       while this was in process a man entered with a loud good evening we replied goodeveningand evidently he caught a strange note he came and bent down and peered under my hatbrim then under the qbs hatbrim we still wore hats and overcoats as did everybody then he stood up suddenly and touched his cap and said scusiexcuse me i said niente which one always says and he addressed a few jovial words to the crouching roaster who again would hardly answer him the omnibus was arrived from oristano i made outwith few passengers  this man brought with him a new breezy atmosphere which the roaster did not like however i made place on the low bench and the attention this time was accepted sitting down at the extreme end he came into the light and i saw a burly man in the prime of life dressed in dark brown velvet with a blond little moustache and twinkling blue eyes and a tipsy look i thought he might be some local tradesman or farmer he asked a few questions in a boisterous familiar fashion then went out again he appeared with a small iron spit a slim rod in one hand and in the other hand two joints of kid and a handful of sausages he stuck his joints on his rod but our roaster still held the interminable flat kid before the now red flameless fire the fattorch was burnt out the cinder pushed in the fire a moments spurt of flame then red intense redness again and our kid before it like a big dark hand  eh said the newcomer whom i will call the girovago its done the kids done its done  the roaster slowly shook his head but did not answer he sat like time and eternity at the hearthend his face flameflushed his dark eyes still fireabstract still sacredly intent on the roast  nanana said the girovago let another body see the fire and with his pieces of meat awkwardly skewered on his iron stick he tried to poke under the authorised kid and get at the fire in his soft mutter the old man bade him wait for the fire till the fire was ready for him but the girovago poked impudently and good humouredly and said testily that the authorised kid was done  yes surely it is done said i for it was already a quarter to eight  the old roasting priest muttered and took out his knife from his pocket he pressed the blade slowly slowly deep into the meat as far as a knife will go in a piece of kid he seemed to be feeling the meat inwardly and he said it was not done he shook his head and remained there like time and eternity at the end of the rod  the girovago said sangue di dio but couldnt roast his meat and he tried to poke his skewer near the coals so doing his pieces fell off into the ashes and the invisible onlookers behind raised a shout of laughter however he raked it out and wiped it with his hand and said no matter nothing lost  then he turned to me and asked the usual whence and whither questions these answered he said wasnt i german i said no i was english he looked at me many times shrewdly as if he wanted to make out something then he asked where were we domiciledand i said sicily and then very pertinently why had we come to sardinia i said for pleasure and to see the island  ah per divertimento he repeated halfmusingly not believing me in the least  various men had now come into the room though they all remained indistinct in the background the girovago talked and jested abroad in the company and the halfvisible men laughed in a rather hostile manner  at last the old roaster decided the kid was done he lifted it from the fire and scrutinised it thoroughly holding the candle to it as if it were some wonderful epistle from the flames to be sure it looked marvellous and smelled so good brown and crisp and hot and savoury not burnt in any place whatever it was eight oclock  its done its done go away with it go said the girovago pushing the old roaster with his hand and at last the old man consented to depart holding the kid like a banner  it looks so good cried the qb and i am so hungry  haha it makes one hungry to see good meat signora now it is my turn hehgino the girovago flourished his arm and a handsome unwashed man with a black moustache came forward rather sheepishly he was dressed in soldiers clothes neutral grey and was a big robust handsome fellow with dark eyes and mediterranean sheepishness here take it thou said the girovago pressing the long spit into his hand it is thy business cook the supper thou art the womanbut ill keep the sausages and do them  the socalled woman sat at the end of the hearth where the old roaster had sat and with his brown nervous hand piled the remaining coals together the fire was no longer flamy and it was sinking the darkbrowed man arranged it so that he could cook the meat he held the spit negligently over the red mass a joint fell off the men laughed its lost nothing said the darkbrowed man as the girovago had said before and he skewered it on again and thrust it to the fire but meanwhile he was looking up from under his dark lashes at the girovago and at us  the girovago talked continually he turned to me holding the handful of sausages  this makes the tasty bit he said  oh yesgood salsiccia said i  you are eating the kid you are eating at the inn he said i replied that i was  no he said you stay and eat with me you eat with me the sausage is good the kid will soon be done the fire is grateful  i laughed not quite understanding him he was certainly a bit tipsy  signora he said turning to the qb she did not like him he was impudent and she shut a deaf ear to him as far as she could signora he said do you understand me what i say  she replied that she did  signora he said i sell things to the women i sell them things  what do you sell she asked in astonishment  saints he said  saints she cried in more astonishment  yes saints he said with tipsy gravity  she turned in confusion to the company in the background the fat soldier came forward he was the chief of the carabinieri  also combs and bits of soap and little mirrors he explained sarcastically  saints said the girovago once more and also ragazzinialso youngsterswherever i go there is a little one comes running calling babbo babbo daddy daddy wherever i goyoungsters and im the babbo  all this was received with a kind of silent sneer from the invisible assembly in the background the candle was burning low the fire was sinking too in vain the darkbrowed man tried to build it up the qb became impatient for the food she got up wrathfully and stumbled into the dark passage exclaimingdont we eat yet  ehpatience patience signora it takes time in this house said the man in the background  the darkbrowed man looked up at the girovago and said  are you going to cook the sausages with your fingers  he too was trying to be assertive and jesting but he was the kind of person no one takes any notice of the girovago rattled on in dialect poking fun at us and at our being there in this inn i did not quite follow  signora said the girovago do you understand sardinian  i understand italianand some sardinian she replied rather hotly and i know that you are trying to laugh at usto make fun of us  he laughed fatly and comfortably  ah signora he said we have a language that you wouldnt understandnot one word nobody here would understand it but me and him he pointed to the blackbrowed one everybody would want an interpretereverybody  but he did not say interpreterhe said intreprete with the accent on the penultimate as if it were some sort of priest  a what said i  he repeated with tipsy unction and i saw what he meant  why said i is it a dialect what is your dialect  my dialect he said is sassari i come from sassari if i spoke my dialect they would understand something but if i speak this language they would want an interpreter  what language is it then  he leaned up to me laughing  it is the language we use when the women are buying things and we dont want them to know what we say me and him  oh said i i know we have that language in england it is called thieves latinlatino dei furbi  the men at the back suddenly laughed glad to turn the joke against the forward girovago he looked down his nose at me but seeing i was laughing without malice he leaned to me and said softly secretly  what is your affair then what affair is it yours  how what i exclaimed not understanding  che genere di affari what sort of business  howaffari said i still not grasping  what do you sell he said flatly and rather spitefully what goods  i dont sell anything replied i laughing to think he took us for some sort of strolling quacks or commercial travellers  clothor something he said cajolingly slyly as if to worm my secret out of me  but nothing at all nothing at all said i we have come to sardinia to see the peasant costumes i thought that might sound satisfactory  ah the costumes he said evidently thinking i was a deep one and he turned bandying words with his darkbrowed mate who was still poking the meat at the embers and crouching on the hearth the room was almost quite dark the mate answered him back and tried to seem witty too but the girovago was the commanding personality rather too much so too impudent for the qb though rather after my own secret heart the mate was one of those handsome passive stupid men  him said the girovago turning suddenly to me and pointing at the mate hes my wife  your wife said i  yes hes my wife because were always together  there had become a sudden dead silence in the background in spite of it the mate looked up under his black lashes and said with a half smile  dont talk or i shall give thee a good bacio tonight  there was an instants fatal pause then the girovago continued  tomorrow is festa of sant antonio at tonara tomorrow we are going to tonara where are you going  to abbasanta said i  ah abbasanta you should come to tonara at tonara there is a brisk tradeand there are costumes you should come to tonara come with him and me to tonara tomorrow and we will do business together  i laughed but did not answer  come said he you will like tonara ah tonara is a fine place there is an inn you can eat well sleep well i tell you because to you ten francs dont matter isnt that so ten francs dont matter to you well then come to tonara what what do you say  i shook my head and laughed but did not answer  to tell the truth i should have liked to go to tonara with him and his mate and do the brisk trade if only i knew what trade it would be  you are sleeping upstairs he said to me  i nodded  this is my bed he said taking one of the homemade rush mats from against the wall i did not take him seriously at any point  do they make those in sorgono i said  yes in sorgonothey are the beds you see and you roll up this end a bitso and that is the pillow  he laid his cheek sideways  not really said i  he came and sat down again next to me and my attention wandered the qb was raging for her dinner it must be quite halfpast eight the kid the perfect kid would be cold and ruined both fire and candle were burning low someone had been out for a new candle but there was evidently no means of replenishing the fire the mate still crouched on the hearth the dull red fireglow on his handsome face patiently trying to roast the kid and poking it against the embers he had heavy strong limbs in his khaki clothes but his hand that held the spit was brown and tender and sensitive a real mediterranean hand the girovago blond roundfaced mature and aggressive with all his liveliness was more like a northerner in the background were four or five other men of whom i had distinguished none but a stout soldier probably chief carabiniere                                       just as the qb was working up to the rage i had at last calmed down from appeared the shawlswathed girl announcing pronto  pronto pronto said everybody  high time too said the qb springing from the low bench before the fire where do we eat is there another room  there is another room signora said the carabiniere  so we trooped out of the firewarmed dungeon leaving the girovago and his mate and two other men muleteers from the road behind us i could see that it irked my girovago to be left behind he was by far the strongest personality in the place and he had the keenest intelligence so he hated having to fall into the background when he had been dragging all the limelight on to himself all the evening to me too he was something of a kindred soul that night but there we are fate in the guise of that mysterious division between a respectable life and a scamps life divided us there was a gulf between me and him between my way and his he was a kindred spiritbut with a hopeless difference there was something a bit sordid about himand he knew it that is why he was always tipsy yet i like the lone wolf souls bestbetter than the sheep if only they didnt feel mongrel inside themselves presumably a scamp is bound to be mongrel it is a pity the untamable lonewolf souls should always become pariahs almost of choice mere scamps  top and bottom of it is i regretted my girovago though i knew it was no good thinking of him his way was not my way yet i regretted him i did                                       we found ourselves in a dining room with a long white table and inverted soupplates tombcold lighted by an acetylene flare three men had accompanied us the carabiniere a little dark youth with a small black moustache in a soldiers short woollined greatcoat and a young man who looked tired round his blue eyes and who wore a darkblue overcoat quite smart the beshawled damsel came in with the inevitable bowl of minestrone soup with cabbage and cauliflower and other things we helped ourselves and the fat carabiniere started the conversation with the usual questionsand where were we going tomorrow  i asked about buses then the responsiblelooking tiredeyed youth told me he was the busdriver he had come from oristano on the main line that day it is a distance of some forty miles next morning he was going on over the mountains to nuoroabout the same distance again the youth with the little black moustache and the greek large eyes was his mate the conductor this was their run from oristano to nuoroa course of ninety miles or more and every day on on on no wonder he looked nervetired yet he had that kind of dignity the wistful seriousness and pride of a man in machine control the only godlike ones today those who pull the iron levers and are the gods in the machine  they repeated what the old roaster said much nicer for us to go to nuoro than to abbasanta so to nuoro we decided to go leaving at halfpast nine in the morning                                       every other night the driver and his mate spent in this benighted risveglio inn it must have been their bedroom we saw clean and tidy i said was the food always so late was everything always as bad as today alwaysif not worse they said making light of it with sarcastic humor against the risveglio you spent your whole life at the risveglio sitting waiting and going blockcold unless you were content to drink aqua vitae like those in there the driver jerked his head towards the dungeon  who were those in there said i  the one who did all the talking was a mercante a mercante girovago a wandering peddler this was my girovago a wandering peddler selling saints and youngsters the other was his mate who helped carry the pack they went about together oh my girovago was a known figure all over the countryand where would they sleep there in the room where the fire was dying  they would unroll the mats and lie with their feet to the hearth for this they paid threepence or at most fourpence and they had the privilege of cooking their own food the risveglio supplied them with nothing but the fire the roof and the rush matand of course the drink oh we need have no sympathy with the girovago and his sort they lacked for nothing they had everything they wanted everything and money in abundance they lived for the aqua vitae they drank that was all they wanted their continual allowance of aqua vitae and they got it ah they were not cold if the room became cold during the night if they had no coverings at all pah they waited for morning and as soon as it was light they drank a large glass of aqua vitae that was their fire their hearth and their home drink aqua vitae was hearth and home to them  i was surprised at the contempt tolerant and yet profound with which these three men in the diningroom spoke of the others in the stanza how contemptuous almost bitter the driver was against alcohol it was evident he hated it and though we all had our bottles of deadcold dark wine and though we all drank still the feeling of the three youths against actual intoxication was deep and hostile with a certain burning moral dislike that is more northern than italian and they curled their lip with real dislike of the girovago his forwardness his impudent aggressiveness                                       as for the inn yes it was very bad it had been quite good under the previous proprietors but nowthey shrugged their shoulders the dirtybreast and the shawled girl were not the owners they were merely conductors of the hotel here a sarcastic curl of the lip the owner was a man in the villagea young man a week or two back at christmas time there had been a roomful of men sitting drinking and roistering at this very table when in had come the proprietor maddrunk swinging a litre bottle round his head and yelling out out out all of you out every one of you i am proprietor here and when i want to clear my house i clear my house every man obeyswho doesnt obey has his brains knocked out with this bottle out out i sayout everyone and the men all cleared out but said the busdriver i told him that when i had paid for my bed i was going to sleep in it i was not going to be turned out by him or anybody and so he came down                                       there was a little silence from everybody after this story evidently there was more to it that we were not to be told especially the carabiniere was silent he was a fat not very brave fellow though quite nice  ah butsaid the little dark busconductor with his smallfeatured swarthy greek faceyou must not be angry with them true the inn was very bad very badbut you must pity them for they are only ignorant poor things they are ignoranti why be angry  the other two men nodded their heads in agreement and repeated ignoranti they are ignoranti it is true why be angry  and here the modern italian spirit came out the endless pity for the ignorant it is only slackness the pity makes the ignorant more ignorant and makes the risveglio daily more impossible if somebody let a bottle buzz round the ears of the dirtybreast and whipped the shawl from the head of the pert young madam and sent her flying down the tunnel with a flea in her ear we might get some attention and they might find a little selfrespect but no pity them poor ignoranti while they pull life down and devour it like vermin pity them what they need is not pity but prods they and all their myriad of likes                                       the beshawled appeared with a dish of kid needless to say the ignoranti had kept all the best portions for themselves what arrived was five pieces of cold roast one for each of us mine was a sort of large comb of ribs with a thin web of meat perhaps an ounce that was all we got after watching the whole process there was moreover a dish of strong boiled cauliflower which one ate with the coarse bread out of sheer hunger after this a bilious orange simply one is not fed nowadays in the good hotels and in the bad one is given paltry portions of unnourishing food and one goes unfed                                       the busdriver the only one with an earnest soul was talking of the sardinians ah the sardinians they were hopeless whybecause they did not know how to strike they too were ignoranti but this form of ignorance he found more annoying they simply did not know what a strike was if you offered them one day ten francs a stinthe was speaking now of the miners of the iglesias regionno no no they would not take it they wanted twelve francs go to them the next day and offer them four francs for half a stint and yes yes yes they would take it and there they were ignorant ignorant sardinians they absolutely did not know how to strike he was quite sarcastically hot about it the whole tone of these three young men was the tone of sceptical irony common to the young people of our day the world over only they hador at least the driver hadsome little fervour for his strikes and his socialism but it was a pathetic fervour a pisaller fervour                                       we talked about the land the war has practically gutted sardinia of her cattle so they said and now the land is being deserted the arable land is going back to fallow why why says the driver because the owners of the land wont spend any capital they have got the capital locked up and the land is dead they find it cheaper to let all the arable go back to fallow and raise a few head of cattle rather than to pay high wages grow corn and get small returns  yes and also chimes in the carabiniere the peasants dont want to work the land they hate the land theyll do anything to get off the land they want regular wages short hours and devil take the rest so they will go into france as navvies by the hundred they flock to rome they besiege the labor bureaus they will do the artificial government navvywork at a miserable five francs a daya railway shunter having at least eighteen francs a dayanything anything rather than work the land  yes and what does the government do replies the busdriver they pull the roads to pieces in order to find work for the unemployed remaking them across the campagna but in sardinia where roads and bridges are absolutely wanting will they do anything no  there it is however the busdriver with dark shadows under his eyes represents the intelligent portion of the conversation the carabiniere is soft and will go any way though always with some interest the little greeklooking conductor just does not care                                       enters another belated traveller and takes a seat at the end of the table the beshawled brings him soup and a skinny bit of kid he eyes this last with contempt and fetches out of his bag a large hunk of roast pork and bread and black olives thus proceeding to make a proper meal  illustration fonni  we being without cigarettes the busdriver and his companion press them on us their beloved macedonia cigarettes the driver says they are squisitissimimost most exquisiteso exquisite that all foreigners want them in truth i believe they are exported to germany now and they are quite good when they really have tobacco in them usually they are hollow tubes of paper which just flare away under ones nose and are done  we decide to have a round drink they choose the precious aqua vitae the white sort i think at last it arriveswhen the little darkeyed one has fetched it and it tastes rather like sweetened petroleum with a dash of aniseed filthy most italian liquors are now sweet and filthy  at length we rise to go to bed we shall all meet in the morning and this room is dead cold with frost outside going out we glance into the famous stanza one figure alone lies stretched on the floor in the almost complete darkness a few embers still glow the other men no doubt are in the bar  ah the filthy bedroom the qb ties up her head in a large clean white kerchief to avoid contact with the unsavory pillow it is a cold hard flat bed with two cold hard flat blankets but we are very tired just as we are going to sleep however weird highpitched singing starts below very uncannywith a refrain that is a yelpyelpyelp almost like a dog in angry pain weird almost gruesome this singing goes on first one voice and then another and then a tangle of voices again we are roused by the pounding of heavy feet on the corridor outside which is as hollow and resonant as a drum and then in the infernal crewyard outside a cock crows throughout the nightyea through all the black and frosty hours this demoniac bird screams its demon griefs                                       however it is morning i gingerly wash a bit of myself in the broken basin and dry that bit on a muslin veil which masquerades upon the chair as a towel the qb contents herself with a dry wipe and we go downstairs in hopes of the lastnights milk  there is no one to be seen it is a cold froststrong clear morning there is no one in the bar we stumble down the dark tunnel passage the stanza is as if no man had ever set foot in it very dark the mats against the wall the fireplace grey with a handful of long dead ash just like a dungeon the diningroom has the same long table and eternal tableclothand our serviettes still wet lying where we shovelled them aside so back again to the bar  and this time a man is drinking aqua vitae and the dirtyshirt is officiating he has no hat on and extraordinary he has no brow at all just flat straight black hair slanting to his eyebrows no forehead at all  is there coffee  no there is no coffee  why  because they cant get sugar  ho laughs the peasant drinking aqua vitae you make coffee with sugar  here say i they make it with nothingis there milk  no  no milk at all  no  why not  nobody brings it  yes yesthere is milk if they like to get it puts in the peasant but they want you to drink aqua vitae  i see myself drinking aqua vitae my yesterdays rage towers up again suddenly till it quite suffocates me there is something in this unsavoury black winedabbled thick greasy young man that does for me  why say i lapsing into the italian rhetorical manner why do you keep an inn why do you write the word ristorante so large when you have nothing to offer people and dont intend to have anything why do you have the impudence to take in travellers what does it mean that this is an inn what say what does it mean say thenwhat does it mean what does it mean your ristorante risveglio written so large  getting all this out in one breath my indignation now stifled me him of the shirt said nothing at all the peasant laughed i demanded the bill it was twentyfive francs odd i picked up every farthing of the change  wont you leave any tip at all asks the qb  tip say i speechless  so we march upstairs and make tea to fill the thermos flask then with sack over my shoulder i make my way out of the risveglio                                       it is sunday morning the frozen village street is almost empty we march down to the wider space where the bus stands i hope they havent the impudence to call it a piazza  is this the nuoro bus i ask of a bunch of urchins  and even they begin to jeer but my sudden upstarting flare quenches them at once one answers yes and they edge away i stow the sack and the kitchenino in the firstclass part the firstclass is in front we shall see better  there are men standing about with their hands in their pocketsthose who are not in costume some wear the blackandwhite all wear the stocking caps and all have the wide shirtbreasts white their waistcoats being just like evening dress waistcoats imagine one of these soft white shirt fronts well slobbered and you have mine host of the risveglio but these lounging static whitebreasted men are snowily clean this being sunday morning they smoke their pipes on the frosty air and are none too friendly                                       the bus starts at halfpast nine the campanile is clanging nine two or three girls go down the road in their sunday costume of purplish brown we go up the road into the clear ringing frosty air to find the lane  and again from above how beautiful it is in the sharp morning the whole village lies in bluish shadow the hills with their thin pale oak trees are in bluish shadow still only in the distance the frostglowing sun makes a wonderful jewellike radiance on the pleasant hills wild and thinlywooded of this interior region real fresh wonderbeauty all around and such humanity  returning to the village we find a little shop and get biscuits and cigarettes and we find our friends the busmen they are shy this morning they are ready for us when we are ready so in we get joyfully to leave sorgono  one thing i say for it it must be an honest place for people leave their sacks about without a qualm                                       up we go up the road only to stop alas at the risveglio the little conductor goes down the lane towards the station the driver goes and has a little drink with a comrade there is quite a crowd round the dreary entrances of the inn and quite a little bunch of people to clamber up into the second class behind us  we wait and wait then in climbs an old peasant in full blackandwhite costume smiling in the pleased naïve way of the old after him climbs a freshfaced young man with a suitcase  na said the young man now you are in the automobile  and the old man gazes round with the wondering vacant naïve smile  one is all right here eh the young citizen persists patronizing  but the old man is too excited to answer he gazes hither and thither then he suddenly remembers he had a parcel and looks for it in fear the brightfaced young man picks it from the floor and hands it him ah it is all right  i see the little conductor in his dashing sheeplined short military overcoat striding briskly down the little lane with the postbag the driver climbs to his seat in front of me he has a muffler round his neck and his hat pulled down to his ears he pips at the horn and our old peasant cranes forward to look how he does it  and so with a jerk and a spurt we start uphill  ehwhats that said the peasant frightened  were starting explained the brightfaced young man  starting didnt we start before  the bright face laughs pleasedly  no he said did you think we had been going ever since you got in  yes says the old man simply since the door was shut  the young citizen looks at us for our joyful approval     vi  to nuoro   these automobiles in italy are splendid they take the steep looping roads so easily they seem to run so naturally and this one was comfortable too  the roads of italy always impress me they run undaunted over the most precipitous regions and with curious ease in england almost any such road among the mountains at least would be labelled three times dangerous and would be famous throughout the land as an impossible climb here it is nothing up and down they go swinging about with complete sangfroid there seems to have been no effort in their construction they are so good naturally that one hardly notices what splendid gestures they represent of course the surface is now often intolerably bad and they are most of them roads which with ten years neglect will become ruins for they are cut through overhanging rock and scooped out of the sides of hills but i think it is marvellous how the italians have penetrated all their inaccessible regions of which they have so many with great highroads and how along these highroads the omnibuses now keep up a perfect communication the precipitous and craggilyinvolved land is threaded through and through with roads there seems to be a passion for highroads and for constant communication in this the italians have a real roman instinct now for the roads are new  the railways too go piercing through rock for miles and miles and nobody thinks anything of it the coast railway of calabria down to reggio would make us stand on our heads if we had it in england here it is a matter of course in the same way i always have a profound admiration for their drivingwhether of a great omnibus or of a motorcar it all seems so easy as if the man were part of the car there is none of that beastly grinding uneasy feeling one has in the north a car behaves like a smooth live thing sensibly  all the peasants have a passion for a highroad they want their land opening out opening out they seem to hate the ancient italian remoteness they all want to be able to get out at a moments notice to get awayquick quick a village which is two miles off the highroad even if it is perched like a hawks nest on a peak still chafes and chafes for the great road to come to it chafes and chafes for the daily motorbus connection with the railway there is no placidity no rest in the heart of the land there is a fever of restless irritation all the time  and yet the permanent way of almost every railway is falling into bad disrepair the roads are shocking and nothing seems to be done is our marvellous mechanical era going to have so short a bloom is the marvellous openness the openedout wonder of the land going to collapse quite soon and the remote places lapse back into inaccessibility again who knows i rather hope so                                       the automobile took us rushing and winding up the hill sometimes through cold solidseeming shadow sometimes across a patch of sun there was thin bright ice in the ruts and deep grey hoarfrost on the grass i cannot tell how the sight of the grass and bushes heavy with frost and wildin their own primitive wildness charmed me the slopes of the steep wild hills came down shaggy and bushy with a few berries lingering and the long grassstalks sere with the frost again the dark valley sank below like a ravine but shaggy bosky unbroken it came upon me how i loved the sight of the blueshadowed tawnytangled winter with its frosty standstill the young oaks keep their brown leaves and doing so surely they are best with a thin edge of rime  one begins to realize how old the real italy is how mangripped and how withered england is far more wild and savage and lonely in her country parts here since endless centuries man has tamed the impossible mountain side into terraces he has quarried the rock he has fed his sheep among the thin woods he has cut his boughs and burnt his charcoal he has been half domesticated even among the wildest fastnesses this is what is so attractive about the remote places the abruzzi for example life is so primitive so pagan so strangely heathen and halfsavage and yet it is human life and the wildest country is half humanized half brought under it is all conscious wherever one is in italy either one is conscious of the present or of the mediaeval influences or of the far mysterious gods of the early mediterranean wherever one is the place has its conscious genus man has lived there and brought forth his consciousness there and in some way brought that place to consciousness given it its expression and really finished it the expression may be proserpine or pan or even the strange shrouded gods of the etruscans or the sikels none the less it is an expression the land has been humanised through and through and we in our own tissued consciousness bear the results of this humanisation so that for us to go to italy and to penetrate into italy is like a most fascinating act of selfdiscoveryback back down the old ways of time strange and wonderful chords awake in us and vibrate again after many hundreds of years of complete forgetfulness  and thenand thenthere is a final feeling of sterility it is all worked out it is all known connu connu  this sunday morning seeing the frost among the tangled still savage bushes of sardinia my soul thrilled again this was not all known this was not all worked out life was not only a process of rediscovering backwards it is that also and it is that intensely italy has given me back i know not what of myself but a very very great deal she has found for me so much that was lost like a restored osiris but this morning in the omnibus i realize that apart from the great rediscovery backwards which one must make before one can be whole at all there is a move forwards there are unknown unworked lands where the salt has not lost its savour but one must have perfected oneself in the great past first                                       if one travels one eats we immediately began to munch biscuits and the old peasant in his white baggy breeches and black cuirass his old face smiling wonderingly under his old stocking cap although he was only going to tonara some seven or eight miles began to peel himself a hardboiled egg which he got out of his parcel with calm wastefulness he peeled away the biggest part of the white of the egg with the shellbecause it came away so the citizen of nuoro for such the brightfaced young man was said to himbut see how you waste itha said the old peasant with a reckless indifferent wave of the hand what did he care how much he wasted since he was en voyage and riding for the first time in his life in an automobile  the citizen of nuoro told us he had some sort of business in sorgono so he came back and forth constantly the peasant did some work or other for himor brought him something down from tonara he was a pleasant brighteyed young man and he made nothing of eight hours in a motorbus  he told us there was still game among these hills wild boars which were hunted in big hunts and many hares it was a curious and beautiful sight he said to see a hare at night fascinated by the flare of the lamps of the automobile racing ahead with its ears back always keeping in front inside the beam and flying like mad on and on ahead till at some hill it gathered speed and melted into the dark                                       we descended into a deep narrow valley to the roadjunction and the canteenhouse then up again up and up sharp to tonara our village we had seen in the sun yesterday but we were approaching it from the back as we swerved into the sunlight the road took a long curve on to the open ridge between two valleys and there in front we saw a glitter of scarlet and white it was in slow motion it was a faroff procession scarlet figures of women and a tall image moving away from us slowly in the sunday morning it was passing along the level sunlit ridge above a deep hollow valley a close procession of women glittering in scarlet white and black moving slowly in the distance beneath the greyyellow buildings of the village on the crest towards an isolated old church and all along this narrow upland saddle as on a bridge of sunshine itself  were we not going to see any more the bus turned again and rushed along the now level road and then veered and there beyond a little below we saw the procession coming the bus faded to a standstill and we climbed out above us old and mellowed among the smooth rocks and the bits of flat grass was the church tanging its bell just in front above were old halfbroken houses of stone the road came gently winding up to us from what was evidently two villages ledged one above the other upon the steep summit of the south slope far below was the south valley with a white puff of engine steam  and slowly chanting in the near distance curving slowly up to us on the white road between the grass came the procession the high morning was still we stood all on this ridge above the world with the deeps of silence below on the right and in a strange brief staccato monody chanted the men and in quick light rustle of womens voices came the responses again the mens voices the white was mostly men not women the priest in his robes his boys near him was leading the chanting immediately behind him came a small cluster of bareheaded tall sunburnt men all in goldenvelveteen corduroy mountainpeasants bowing beneath a great lifesize seated image of saint anthony of padua after these a number of men in the costume but with the white linen breeches hanging wide and loose almost to the ankles instead of being tucked into the black gaiters so they seemed very white beneath the back kilt frill the black frieze bodyvest was cut low like an evening suit and the stocking caps were variously perched the men chanted in low hollow melodic tones then came the rustling chime of the women and the procession crept slowly aimlessly forward in time with the chant the great image rode rigid and rather foolish  after the men was a little gapand then the brilliant wedge of the women they were packed two by two close on each others heels chanting inadvertently when their turn came and all in brilliant beautiful costume in front were the little girlchildren two by two immediately following the tall men in peasant blackandwhite children demure and conventional in vermilion white and greenlittle girlchildren with long skirts of scarlet cloth down to their feet greenbanded near the bottom with white aprons bordered with vivid green and mingled colour having little scarlet purplebound open boleros over the full white shirts and black headcloths folded across their little chins just leaving the lips clear the face framed in black wonderful little girlchildren perfect and demure in the stiffish brilliant costume with black headdress stiff as velasquez princesses the bigger girls followed and then the mature women a close procession the long vermilion skirts with their green bands at the bottom flashed a solid moving mass of colour softly swinging and the white aprons with their band of brilliant mingled green seemed to gleam at the throat the fullbosomed white shirts were fastened with big studs of gold filigree two linked filigree globes and the great white sleeves billowed from the scarlet purplishandgreenedged boleros the faces came nearer to us framed all round in the dark cloths all the lips still sang responses but all the eyes watched us so the softlyswaying coloured body of the procession came up to us the poppyscarlet smooth cloth rocked in fusion the bands and bars of emerald green seemed to burn across the red and the showy white the dark eyes peered and stared at us from under the black snood gazed back at us with raging curiosity while the lips moved automatically in chant the bus had run into the inner side of the road and the procession had to press round it towards the skyline the great valley lying below  the priest stared hideous st anthony cockled a bit as he passed the butt end of the big grey automobile the peasant men in goldcoloured corduroy old washed soft were sweating under the load and still singing with opened lips the loose white breeches of the men waggled as they walked on with their hands behind their backs turning again to look at us the big hard hands folded behind black kiltfrill the women too shuffled slowly past rocking the scarlet and the bars of green and all twisting as they sang to look at us still more and so the procession edged past the bus and was trailing upwards curved solid against the skyline towards the old church from behind the geranium scarlet was intense one saw the careful curiously cut backs of the shapen boleros poppyred edged with mauvepurple and green and the white of the shirt just showing at the waist the full sleeves billowed out the black headcloths hung down to a point the pleated skirts swing slowly the broad band of green accentuating the motion indeed that is what it must be for this thick rich band of jewel green to throw the wonderful horizontal motion back and forth back and forth of the suave vermilion and give that static demeta splendor to a peasant motion so magnificent in colour geranium and malachite  all the costumes were not exactly alike some had more green some had less in some the sleeveless boleros were of a darker red and some had poorer aprons without such gorgeous bands at the bottom and some were evidently old probably thirty years old still perfect and in keeping reserved for sunday and high holidays a few were darker ruddier than the true vermilion this varying of the tone intensified the beauty of the shuffling womanhost                                       when they had filed into the grey forlorn little church on the ridgetop just above us the bus started silently to run on to the restpoint below whilst we climbed back up the little rocktrack to the church when we came to the sidedoor we found the church quite full level with us as we stood in the open side doorway we saw kneeling on the bare stoneflags the little girlchildren and behind them all the women clustered kneeling upon their aprons with hands negligently folded filling the church to the further doorway where the sun shone the bigger westend doorway in the shadow of the whitewashed bare church all these kneeling women with their colour and their black headcloths looked like some thick bed of flowers geranium black hooded above they all knelt on the naked solid stone of the pavement  there was a space in front of the geranium little girlchildren then the men in corduroys goldsoft with dark round heads kneeling awkwardly in reverence and then the queer black cuirasses and full white sleeves of greyheaded peasant men many bearded then just in front of them the priest in his white vestment standing exposed and just baldly beginning an address at the side of the altar was seated large and important the modern simpering blackgowned anthony of padua nursing a boychild he looked a sort of male madonna  now the priest was saying blessed saint anthony shows you in what way you can be christians it is not enough that you are not turks some think they are christians because they are not turks it is true you are none of you turks but you have still to learn how to be good christians and this you can learn from our blessed saint anthony saint anthony etc etc  the contrast between turks and christians is still forceful in the mediterranean where the mohammedans have left such a mark but how the word cristiani cristiani spoken with a peculiar priestly unction gets on my nerves the voice is barren in its homily and the women are all intensely watching the qb and me in the doorway their folded hands are very negligently held together  come away say i come away and let them listen                                       we left the church crowded with its kneeling host and dropped down past the broken houses towards the omnibus which stood on a sort of level outlook place a levelled terrace with a few trees standing silent over the valley it should be picketed with soldiers having arquebuses and i should have welcomed a few thoroughpaced infidels as a leaven to this dreary christianity of ours  but it was a wonderful place usually the lifelevel is reckoned as sealevel but here in the heart of sardinia the lifelevel is high as the goldenlit plateau and the sealevel is somewhere far away below in the gloom it does not signify the lifelevel is high up high and sunsweetened and among rocks  we stood and looked below at the puff of steam far down the wooded valley where we had come yesterday there was an old low house on this eagleperching piazza i would like to live there the real villageor rather two villages like an earring and its pendantlay still beyond in front ledging near the summit of the long long steep wooded slope that never ended till it ran flush to the depths away below there in shadow  and yesterday up this slope the old peasant had come with his two brilliant daughters and the packpony  and somewhere in those ledging pearly villages in front must be my girovago and his wife i wish i could see their stall and drink aqua vitae with them  how beautiful the procession says the qb to the driver  ah yesone of the most beautiful costumes of sardinia this of tonara he replied wistfully                                       the bus sets off againminus the old peasant we retrace our road a woman is leading a bay pony past the church striding with long strides so that her maroon skirt swings like a fan and hauling the halter rope apparently the geranium red costume is sunday only the weekday is this maroon or puce or madderbrown  quickly and easily the bus slips down the hill into the valley wild narrow valleys with trees and brownlegged cork trees across the other side a black and white peasant is working alone on a tiny terrace of the hillside a small solitary figure for all the world like a magpie in the distance these people like being alonesolitaryone sees a single creature so often isolated among the wilds this is different from sicily and italy where the people simply cannot be alone they must be in twos and threes  but it is sunday morning and the worker is exceptional along the road we pass various pedestrians men in their black sheepskins boys in their soldiers remains they are trudging from one village to another across the wild valleys and there is a sense of sunday morning freedom of roving as in an english countryside only the one old peasant works alone and a goatherd watching his longhaired white goats  beautiful the goats are and so swift they fly like white shadows along the road from us then dart downhill i see one standing on a bough of an oaktree right in the tree an enormous white treecreature complacently munching up aloft then rearing on her hind legs so lengthy and putting her slim paws far away on an upper forward branch                                       whenever we come to a village we stop and get down and our little conductor disappears into the postoffice for the postbag this last is usually a limp affair containing about three letters the people crowd roundand many of them in very ragged costume they look poor and not attractive perhaps a bit degenerate it would seem as if the italian instinct to get into rapid touch with the world were the healthy instinct after all for in these isolated villages which have been since time began far from any lifecentre there is an almost sordid look on the faces of the people we must remember that the motorbus is a great innovation it has been running for five weeks only i wonder for how many months it will continue  for i am sure it cannot pay our firstclass tickets cost i believe about twentyseven francs each the second class costs about threequarters the first some parts of the journey we were very few passengers the distance covered is so great the population so thin that even granted the passion for getting out of their own villages which possesses all people now still the bus cannot earn much more than an average of two hundred to three hundred francs a day which with two mens wages and petrol at its enormous price and the cost of wearandtear cannot possibly pay  i asked the driver he did not tell me what his wages were i did not ask him but he said the company paid for the keep and lodging for himself and mate at the stoppingplaces this being sunday fewer people were travelling a statement hard to believe once he had carried fifty people all the way from tonara to nuoro once but it was in vain he protested ah well he said the bus carried the post and the government paid a subsidy of so many thousands of lire a year a goodly number apparently then the government was the loser as usual and there are hundreds if not thousands of these omnibuses running the lonely districts of italy and sicilysardinia had a network of systems they are splendidand they are perhaps an absolute necessity for a nervous restless population which simply cannot keep still and which finds some relief in being whirled about even on the autovie as the bussystem is called  the autovie are run by private companies only subsidised by the government                                       on we rush through the morningand at length see a large village high on the summit beyond stony on the high upland but it has a magical look as these tiny summitcities have from the distance they recall to me always my childish visions of jerusalem high against the air and seeming to sparkle and built in sharp cubes  it is curious what a difference there is between the high fresh proud villages and the valley villages those that crown the world have a bright flashing air as tonara had those that lie down below infolded in the shadow have a gloomy sordid feeling and a repellent population like sorgono and other places at which we had halted the judgment may be all wrong but this was the impression i got  we were now at the highest point of the journey the men we saw on the road were in their sheepskins and some were even walking with their faces shawlmuffled glancing back we saw up the valley clefts the snow of gennargentu once more a white mantle on broad shoulders the very core of sardinia the bus slid to a standstill in a high valley beside a stream where the road from fonni joined ours there was waiting a youth with a bicycle i would like to go to fonni they say it is the highest village in sardinia                                       in front on the broad summit reared the towers of gavoi this was the halfway halt where the buses had their coincidenza and where we would stay for an hour and eat we wound up and up the looping road and at last entered the village women came to the doors to look they were wearing the dark madderbrown costume men were hastening smoking their pipes towards our stopping place  we saw the other busa little crowd of peopleand we drew up at last we were tired and hungry we were at the door of the inn and we entered quickly and in an instant what a difference at the clean little bar men were drinking cheerfully a side door led into the common room and how charming it was in a very wide chimney white and stoneclean with a lovely shallow curve above was burning a fire of long cleansplit faggots laid horizontally on the dogs a clean clear bright fire with odd little chairs in front very low for us to sit on the funny low little chairs seem a specialty of this region  the floor of this room was paved with round dark pebbles beautifully clean on the walls hung brilliant copper fans glittering against the whitewash and under the long horizontal window that looked on the street was a stone slab with sockets for little charcoal fires the curve of the chimney arch was wide and shallow the curve above the window was still wider and of a similar delicate shallowness the white roof rose delicately vaulted with the glitter of copper the expanse of dark rosecoloured pebbled floor the space the few low cleangleaming faggots it was really beautiful we sat and warmed ourselves welcomed by a plump hostess and a pleasant daughter both in madderbrown dress and full white shirt people strayed in and out through the various doors the houses are built without any plan at all the rooms just happening here or there a bitch came from an inner darkness and stood looking at the fire then looked up at me smiling in her bitchlike complacent fashion                                       but we were dying with hunger what was there to eatand was it nearly ready there was cinghiale the pleasant hardcheeked girl told us and it was nearly ready cinghiale being wild boar we sniffed the air the girl kept tramping rather fecklessly back and forth with a plate or a serviette and at last it was served we went through the dark inner place which was apparently the windowless bit left over inside when the haphazard rooms were made round about and from thence into a large bare darkish pebbled room with a white table and inverted soupplates it was deathly cold the window looked north over the wintry landscape of the highlands fields stone walls and rocks ah the cold motionless air of the room  but we were quite a party the second busdriver and his mate a bearded traveller on the second bus with his daughter ourselves the brightfaced citizen from nuoro and our driver our little darkeyed conductor did not come it dawned on me later he could not afford to pay for this meal which was not included in his wage  the nuoro citizen conferred with our driverwho looked tired round the eyesand made the girl produce a tin of sardines these were opened at table with a large pocketknife belonging to the second conductor he was a reckless odd hotfoot fellow whom i liked very much but i was terrified at the way he carved the sardinebox with his jackknife however we could eat and drink  then came the brodo the broth in a great bowl this was boiling hot and very very strong it was perfectly plain strong meatstock without vegetables but how good and invigorating it was and what an abundance we drank it down and ate the good cold bread  then came the boar itself alas it was a bowl of hunks of dark rather coarse boiled meat from which the broth had been made it was quite dry without fat i should have been very puzzled to know what meat it was if i had not been told sad that the wild boar should have received so little culinary attention however we ate the hunks of hot dry meat with bread and were glad to get them they were filling at least and there was a bowl of rather bitter green olives for a condiment  the nuoro citizen now produced a huge bottle of wine which he said was finissimo and refused to let us go on with the dark wine on the table of which every guest was served with a bottle so we drank up and were replenished with the redder lighter finer sorgono wine it was very good  the second busconductor also did not eat the inn meal he produced a vast piece of bread good homemade bread and at least half of a roast lamb and a large paper of olives this lamb he insisted on sending round the table waving his knife and fork with dramatic gestures at every guest insisting that every guest should take a hunk so one by one we all helped ourselves to the extraordinarily good cold roast lamb and to the olives then the busconductor fell to as well there was a mass of meat still left to him  it is extraordinary how generous and from the inside wellbred these men were to be sure the second conductor waved his knife and fork and made bitter faces if one of us took only a little bit of the lamb he wanted us to take more but the essential courtesy in all of them was quite perfect so manly and utterly simple just the same with the qb they treated her with a sensitive manly simplicity which one could not but be thankful for they made none of the odious politenesses which are so detestable in wellbroughtup people they made no advances and did none of the hateful homage of the adulating male they were quiet and kind and sensitive to the natural flow of life and quite without airs i liked them extremely men who can be quietly kind and simple to a woman without wanting to show off or to make an impression they are men still they were neither humble nor conceited they did not show off and oh god what a blessed relief to be with people who dont bother to show off we sat at that table quietly and naturally as if we were by ourselves and talked or listened to their talk just as it happened when we did not want to talk they took no notice of us and that i call good manners middleclass showing off people would have found them uncouth i found them almost the only really wellbred people i have met they did not show off in any way at all not even a show of simplicity they knew that in the beginning and in the end a man stands alone his soul is alone in itself and all attributes are nothingand this curious final knowledge preserved them in simplicity  when we had had coffee and were going out i found our own conductor in a little chair by the fire he was looking a bit pathetic i had enough sense to give him a coffee which brightened him but it was not till afterwards putting things together that i realized he had wanted to be with us all at table but that his conductors wages probably did not allow him to spend the money my bill for the dinner was about fifteen francs for the two of us                                       in the bus again we were quite crowded a peasant girl in nuoro costume sat facing me and a darkbearded middleaged man in a brown velveteen suit was next me and glowering at her he was evidently her husband i did not like him one of the jealous carping sort she in her way was handsome but a bit of a devil as well in all probability there were two village women become fine in town dress and black silk scarves over their heads fancying themselves then there was a wild scuffle and three bouncing village lasses were pushed in laughing and wild with excitement there were wild farewells and the bus rolled out of gavoi between the desolate mountain fields and the rocks on a sort of tableland we rolled on for a mile or so then stopped and the excited lasses got down i gathered they had been given a little ride for a sunday treat delighted they were and they set off with other bareheaded women in costume along a bare path between flat outcropping rocks and cold fields                                       the girl facing me was a study she was not more than twenty years old i should say or was she did the delicate and fine complication of lines against her eyes mean thirtyfive but anyhow she was the wife of the velveteen man he was thickset and had white hairs in his coarse black beard and little irritable brown eyes under his irritable brows he watched her all the time perhaps she was after all a young new girlwife she sat with that expressionless look of one who is watched and who appears not to know it she had her back to the engine  illustration gavoi  she wore her black headcloth from her brow and her hair was taken tight back from her rather hard broad wellshaped forehead her dark eyebrows were very finely drawn above her large darkgrey pellucid eyes but they were drawn with a peculiar obstinate and irritating lift her nose was straight and small her mouth wellshut and her big rather hostile eyes had a withheld look in them obstinate yet being newly wed and probably newlyawakened her eyes looked sometimes at me with a provoking look curious as to what i was in the husband line challenging rather defiantly with her new secrets obstinate in opposition to the male authority and yet intrigued by the very fact that one was man the velveteen husbandhis velveteens too had gone soft and goldfaded yet somehow they made him look ugly commonhe watched her with his irritable yellowbrown eyes and seemed to fume in his stiff beard  she wore the costume the fullgathered shirt fastened at the throat with the two gold filigree globes a little dark braided stiff bolero just fastened at the waist leaving a pretty pattern of white breast and a dark maroon skirt as the bus rushed along she turned somewhat pale with the obstinate pinched look of a woman who is in opposition to her man at length she flung him a few words which i did not catchand her forehead seemed to go harder as she drooped her lashes occasionally over her wide alert obstinate rather treacherous eyes she must have been a difficult piece of goods to deal with and she sat with her knees touching mine rocking against mine as the bus swayed                                       we came to a village on the road the landscape had now become wider much more open at the inn door the bus stopped and the velveteen husband and the girl got down it was coldbut in a minute i got down too the bus conductor came to me and asked anxiously if the qb were ill the qb said no why because there was a signora whom the motion of the bus made ill this was the girl  there was a crowd and a great row at this inn in the second dark room which was bare of furniture a man sat in a corner playing an accordion men in the close breeches were dancing together then they fell to wrestling wildly crashing about among the others with shouts and yells men in the blackandwhite but untidy with the wide white drawers left hanging out over the black gaiters surged here and there all were rowdy with drink this again was rather a squalid inn but roaring with violent crude male life  the nuoro citizen said that here was very good wine and we must try it i did not want it but he insisted so we drank little glasses of merely moderate red wine the sky had gone all grey with the afternoon curdclouds it was very cold and raw wine is no joy cold dead wine in such an atmosphere  the nuoro citizen insisted on paying he would let me pay he said when he came to england in him and in our bus men the famous sardinian hospitality and generosity still lingers                                       when the bus ran on again the qb told the peasant girl who again had the pinched look to change places with me and sit with her face to the engine this the young woman did with that rather hard assurance common to these women but at the next stop she got down and made the conductor come with us into the compartment whilst she sat in front between the driver and the citizen of nuoro that was what she wanted all the time now she was all right she had her back to the velveteen husband she sat close between two strange young men who were condoling with her and velveteens eyed her back and his little eyes went littler and more pinpointed and his nose seemed to curl with irritation  the costumes had changed again there was again the scarlet but no green the green had given place to mauve and rose the women in one cold stony rather humbled broken place were most brilliant they had the geranium skirts but their sleeveless boleros were made to curl out strangely from the waist and they were edged with a puckered rosepink a broad edge with lines of mauve and lavender as they went up between the houses that were dark and grisly under the blank cold sky it is amazing how these women of vermilion and rosepink seemed to melt into an almost impossible blare of colour what a risky blend of colours yet how superb it could look that dangerous hard assurance of these women as they strode along so blaring i would not like to tackle one of them                                       wider and colder the landscape grew as we topped a hill at the end of a village we saw a long string of wagons each with a pair of oxen and laden with large sacks curving upwards in the cold pallid sunday afternoon seeing us the procession came to a standstill at the curve of the road and the pale oxen the pale low wagons the pale full sacks all in the blenched light each one headed by a tall man in shirtsleeves trailing a static procession on the hillside seemed like a vision like a doré drawing the bus slid past the man holding the wagonpole while some oxen stood like rock some swayed their horns the qb asked the velveteener what they were carrying for a long time he took no notice of the question then he volunteered in a snappy voice that it was the government grain being distributed to the communes for bread on sunday afternoon too  oh this government corn what a problem those sacks represent                                       the country became wider as we dropped lower but it was bleak and treeless once more stones cropped up in the wide hollow dales men on ponies passed forlorn across the distances men with bundles waited at the crossroads to pick up the bus we were drawing near to nuoro it was past three in the afternoon cold with a blenched light the landscape seemed bare and stony wide different from any before  we came to the valley where the branchline runs to nuoro i saw little pink railwaycabins at once lonely along the valley bed turning sharp to the right we ran in silence over the moorlandseeming slopes and saw the town beyond clustered beyond a little below at the end of the long declivity with sudden mountains rising around it there it lay as if at the end of the world mountains rising sombre behind  so we stop at the dazio the towns customs hut and velveteens has to pay for some meat and cheese he is bringing in after which we slip into the cold highstreet of nuoro i am thinking that this is the home of grazia deledda the novelist and i see a barbers shop de ledda and thank heaven we are at the end of the journey it is past four oclock  the bus has stopped quite close to the door of the inn star of italy was it in we go at the open door nobody about free access to anywhere and everywhere as usual testifying again to sardinian honesty we peer through a doorway to the leftthrough a rough little room ah there in a dark biggish room beyond is a whitehaired old woman with a long ivorycoloured face standing at a large table ironing one sees only the large whiteness of the table and the long pallid face and the querulous paleblue eye of the tall old woman as she looks up questioning from the gloom of the inner place  is there a room signora  she looks at me with a pale cold blue eye and shouts into the dark for somebody then she advances into the passage and looks us up and down the qb and me  are you husband and wife she demands challenge  yes how shouldnt we be say i  a tiny maid of about thirteen but sturdy and brisklooking has appeared in answer to the shout  take them to number seven says the old dame and she turns back to her gloom and seizes the flat iron grimly  we follow up two flights of cold stone stairs disheartening narrow staircase with a cold iron rail and corridors opening off gloomily and rather disorderly these houses give the effect inside of never having been properly finished as if long long ago the inmates had crowded in pigsty fashion without waiting for anything to be brought into order and there it had been left dreary and chaotic  thumbelina the little maid threw open the door of number seven with eclat and we both exclaimed how fine it seemed to us palatial two good thick white beds a table a chest of drawers two mats on the tiled floor and gorgeous oleographs on the walland two good washbowls side by sideand all perfectly clean and nice what were we coming to we felt we ought to be impressed                                       we pulled open the latticed window doors and looked down on the street the only street and it was a river of noisy life a band was playing rather terribly round the corner at the end and up and down the street jigged endless numbers of maskers in their carnival costume with girls and young women strolling arminarm to participate and how frisky they all were how bubbly and unselfconscious  the maskers were nearly all womenthe street was full of women so we thought at first then we saw looking closer that most of the women were young men dressed up all the maskers were young men and most of these young men of course were masquerading as women as a rule they did not wear facemasks only little dominoes of black cloth or green cloth or white cloth coming down to the mouth which is much better for the old modelled halfmasks with the lace frill the awful proboscis sticking forward white and ghastly like the beaks of corpsebirdssuch as the old venice masksthese i think are simply horrifying and the more modern faces are usually only repulsive while the simple little pink halfmasks with the end of black or green or white cloth these just form a human disguise  it was quite a game sorting out the real women from the false some were easy they had stuffed their bosoms and stuffed their bustles and put on hats and very various robes and they minced along with little jigging steps like little dolls that dangle from elastic and they put their heads on one side and dripped their hands and danced up to flurry the actual young ladies and sometimes they received a good clout on the head when they broke into wild and violent gestures whereat the actual young ladies scuffled wildly  they were very lively and naïvebut some were more difficult every conceivable sort of woman was there broad shouldered and with rather large feet the most usual was the semipeasant with a very full bosom and very full skirt and a very downright bearing but one was a widow in weeds drooping on the arm of a robust daughter and one was an ancient crone in a crochet bedcover and one was in an old skirt and blouse and apron with a broom wildly sweeping the street from end to end he was an animated rascal he swept with very sarcastic assiduity in front of two townmisses in fur coats who minced very importantly along he swept their way very humbly facing them and going backwards sweeping and bowing whilst they advanced with their noses in the air he made his great bow and they minced past daughters of dogfish pescecarne no doubt then he skipped with a bold gambolling flurry behind them and with a perfectly mad frenzy began to sweep after them as if to sweep their tracks away he swept so madly and so blindly with his besom that he swept on to their heels and their ankles they shrieked and glowered round but the blind sweeper saw them not he swept and swept and pricked their thin silk ankles and they scarlet with indignation and rage gave hot skips like cats on hot bricks and fled discomfited forwards he bowed once more after them and started mildly and innocently to sweep the street a pair of lovers of fifty years ago she in a half crinoline and poke bonnet and veil hanging on his arm came very coyly past oh so simpering and it took me a long time to be sure that the girl was a youth an old woman in a long nightdress prowled up and down holding out her candle and peering in the street as if for burglars she would approach the real young women and put her candle in their faces and peer so hard as if she suspected them of something and they blushed and turned their faces away and protested confusedly this old woman searched so fearfully in the face of one strapping lass in the pink and scarlet costume who looked for all the world like a bunch of red and rosepink geraniums with a bit of whitea real peasant lassthat the latter in a panic began to beat him with her fist furiously quite aroused and he made off running comically in his long white nightdress  there were some really beautiful dresses of rich old brocade and some gleaming old shawls a shimmer of lavender and silver or of dark rich shot colours with deep borders of white silver and primrose gold very lovely i believe two of them were actual womenbut the qb says no there was a victorian gown of thick green silk with a creamy blotched crossover shawl about her we both were doubtful there were two wistful droopinglily sisters all in white with big feet and there was a very successful tall miss in a narrow hobbleskirt of black satin and a toque with ospreys the way she minced and wagged her posterior and went on her toes and peered over her shoulder and kept her elbows in was an admirable caricature especially the curious sagging heaving movement of bustle region a movement very characteristic of modern feminism was hit off with a bit of male exaggeration which rejoiced me at first she even took me in  we stood outside our window and leaned on the little balcony rail looking down at this flow of life directly opposite was the chemists house facing our window the best bedroom of the chemist with a huge white matrimonial bed and muslin curtains in the balcony sat the chemists daughters very elegant in highheeled shoes and black hair done in the fluffy fashion with a big sweep sideways oh very elegant they eyed us a little and we eyed them but without interest the river of life was down below                                       it was very cold and the day was declining we too were cold we decided to go into the street and look for the café in a moment we were out of doors walking as inconspicuously as possible near the wall of course there was no pavement these maskers were very gentle and whimsical no touch of brutality at all now we were level with them how odd and funny they were one youth wore a thin white blouse and a pair of his sisters wide calico knickers with needlework frills near the ankle and white stockings he walked artlessly and looked almost pretty only the qb winced with pain not because of the knickers but because of that awful length coming well below the knee another young man was wound into a sheet and heavens knows if he could ever get out of it another was involved in a complicated entanglement of white crochet antimacassars very troublesome to contemplate i did not like him at all like a fish in a net but he strode robustly about  we came to the end of the street where there is a wide desolate sort of gap here the little band stood braying away there was a thick crowd of people and on a slanting place just above a little circle where youths and men maskers and one or two girls were dancing so crowded together and such a small ring that they looked like a jiggly set of upright rollers all turning rickettily against one another they were doing a sort of intense jigging waltz why do they look so intense perhaps because they were so tight all together like too many fish in a globe slipping through one another  there was a café in this sort of piazzanot a piazza at all a formless gap but young men were drinking little drinks and i knew it would be hopeless to ask for anything but cold drinks or black coffee which we did not want so we continued forwards up the slope of the village street these towns soon come to an end already we were wandering into the open on a ledge above a peasant family was making a huge bonfire a tower of orangecoloured rippling flame little impish boys were throwing on more rubbish everybody else was in town why were these folk at the townend making this fire alone  we came to the end of the houses and looked over the roadwall at the hollow deep interesting valley below away on the other side rose a blue mountain a steep but stumpy cone high land reared up dusky and darkblue all around somewhere far off the sun was setting with a bit of crimson it was a wild unusual landscape of unusual shape the hills seemed so untouched darkblue virginwild the hollow cradle of the valley was cultivated like a tapestry away below and there seemed so little outlying life nothing no castles even in italy and sicily castles perching everywhere in sardinia nonethe remote ungrappled hills rising darkly standing outside of life                                       as we went back it was growing dark and the little band was about to leave off its brass noise but the crowd still surged the maskers still jigged and frisked unweariedly oh the good old energy of the bygone days before men became so selfconscious here it was still on the hop  we found no café that looked any good coming to the inn we asked if there was a fire anywhere there wasnt we went up to our room the chemistdaughters had lighted up opposite one saw their bedroom as if it were ones own in the dusk of the street the maskers were still jigging all the youths still joyfully being women but a little more roughly now away over the housetops the purplered of a dying sunset and it was very cold  there was nothing for it but just to lie in bed the qb made a little tea on the spiritlamp and we sat in bed and sipped it then we covered ourselves up and lay still to get warm outside the noise of the street came unabated it grew quite dark the lights reflected into the room there was the sound of an accordion across the hoarseness of the many voices and movements in the street and then a solid strong singing of mens voices singing a soldier song  quando torniamo in casa nostra  we got up to look under the small electric lights the narrow cobbled street was still running with a river of people but fewer maskers two maskers beating loudly at a heavy closed door they beat and beat at last the door opens a crack they rush to try to get inbut in vain it had shut the moment it saw them they are foiled on they go down the street the town is full of men many peasants come in from the outlying parts the black and white costume now showing in the streets  we retire to bed again out of the cold comes a knock and thumbelina bursts in in the darkness  siamo qua says the qb  thumbelina dashes at the windowdoors and shuts them and shuts the casement then she dashes to my bedhead and turns on the light looking down at me as if i were a rabbit in the grass then she flings a can of water against the washbowlscold water icy alas after which small and explosive she explodes her way out of the room again and leaves us in the glaring light having replied that it is now a little after six oclock and dinner is half past seven  so we lie in bed warm and in peace but hungry waiting for half past seven                                       when the qb can stand it no more she flounces up though the clock from the campanile has struck seven only a few minutes before dashing downstairs to reconnoitre she is back in a breath to say that people are eating their heads off in the long dining room in the next breath we are downstairs too  the room was brightly lighted and at many white tables sat diners all men it was quite citylike everyone was in convivial mood the qb spied men opposite having chicken and saladand she had hopes but they were brief when the soup came the girl announced that there was only bistecca which meant a bit of fried cow so it did a quite quite small bit of fried beef a few potatoes and a bit of cauliflower really it was not enough for a child of twelve but that was the end of it a few mandarinitangerine orangesrolled on a plate for dessert and theres the long and short of these infernal dinners was there any cheese no there was no cheese so we merely masticated bread  there came in three peasants in the black and white costume and sat at the middle table they kept on their stocking caps and queer they looked coming in with slow deliberate tread of these elderly men and sitting rather remote with a gap of solitude around them the peculiar ancient loneliness of the sardinian hills clings to them and something stiff static preworld                                       all the men at our end of the room were citizensemployees of some sortand they were all acquaintances a large dog very large indeed with a great muzzle padded slowly from table to table and looked at us with big wistful topaz eyes when the meal was almost over our busdriver and conductor came inlooking faint with hunger and cold and fatigue they were quartered at this house they had eaten nothing since the boarbroth at gavoi  in a very short time they were through their portions and was there nothing else nothing but they were half starved they ordered two eggs each in padella i ordered coffeeand asked them to come and take it with us and a brandy so they came when their eggs were finished  a diversion was now created at the other side of the room the red wine which is good in sardinia had been drunk freely directly facing us sat a rather stout man with pleasant blue eyes and a nicely shaped head dressed like any other town man on a sunday the dog had waddled up to him and sat down statuesque in front of him and the fat man being mellow began to play with the big gentle brindled animal he took a piece of bread and held it before the dogs noseand the dog tried to take it but the man like a boy now he was ripe with wine put the mastiff back with a restraining finger and told him not to snatch then he proceeded with a little conversation with the animal the dog again tried to snatch gently and again the man started saved the bread and startled the dog which backed and gave a sharp sad yelp as if to say why do you tease me  now said the man you are not to snatch come here come here vieni qua and he held up the piece of bread the animal came near now said the man i put this bread on your nose and you dont move unha  the dog had tried to snatch the bread the man had shouted and jerked it away the animal had recoiled and given another expostulating yelp  the game continued all the room was watching smiling the dog did not understand at all it came forward again troubled the man held the bread near its nose and held up a warning finger the beast dropped its head mournfully cocking up its eye at the bread with varied feelings  now said the man not until i say threeunodue the dog could bear it no longer the man in jerking let go the bread and yelled at the top of his voicee tre the dog gulped the piece of bread with a resigned pleasure and the man pretended it had all happened properly on the word three  so he started again vieni qua vieni qua the dog which had backed away with the bread came hesitating cringing forward dropping its hindquarters in doubt as dogs do advancing towards the new nugget of bread the man preached it a little sermon  you sit there and look at this bread i sit here and look at you and i hold this bread and you stop still and i stop still while i count three now thenuno the dog couldnt bear these numerals with their awful slowness he snatched desperately the man yelled and lost the bread the dog gulping turned to creep away  then it began again  come here come here didnt i tell thee i would count three già i said i would count three not one but three and to count three you need three numbers ha steady three numbers unodue e tre the last syllables were yelled so that the room rang again the dog gave a mournful howl of excitement missed the bread groped for it and fled  the man was red with excitement his eyes shining he addressed the company at large i had a dog he said ah a dog and i would put a piece of bread on his nose and say a verse and he looked at me so the man put his face sideways and he looked at me so he gazed up under his brows and he talked to me soo zieu zieubut he never moved no he never moved if he sat with that bread on his nose for half an hour and if tears ran down his face he never movednot till i said three thenah the man tossed up his face snapped the air with his mouth and gulped an imaginary crust ah that dog was trained the man of forty shook his head  vieni qua come here tweet come here  he patted his fat knee and the dog crept forward the man held another piece of bread  now he said to the dog listen listen i am going to tell you something      il soldato va alla guerra  nono not yet when i say three      il soldato va alla guerra     mangia male dorme in terra  listen be still quiet now unodueetre  it came out in one simultaneous yell from the man the dog in sheer bewilderment opened his jaws and let the bread go down his throat and wagged his tail in agitated misery  ah said the man you are learning come come here come now then now you know so so look at me so  the stout goodlooking man of forty bent forward his face was flushed the veins in his neck stood out he talked to the dog and imitated the dog and very well indeed he reproduced something of the big gentle wistful subservience of the animal the dog was his totemthe affectionate selfmistrustful warmhearted hound  so he started the rigmarole again we put it into english  listen now listen let me tell it you      so the soldier goes to the war     his food is rotten he sleeps on the floor  now now no you are not keeping quiet now now      il soldate va alla guerra     mangia male dorme in terra  the verses known to every italian were sung out in a singsong fashion the audience listened as one manor as one childthe rhyme chiming in every heart they waited with excitement for the onetwoand three the last two words were always ripped out with a tearing yell i shall never forget the force of those syllablese tre but the dog made a poor showhe only gobbled the bread and was uneasy  this game lasted us a full hour a full hour by the clock sat the whole room in intense silence watching the man and the dog                                       our friends told us the man was the businspectortheir inspector but they liked him un brav uomo un bravo uomo eh si perhaps they were a little uneasy seeing him in his cups and hearing him yell so nakedly and three  we talked rather sadly wistfully young people especially nice ones like the driver are too sad and serious these days the little conductor made big brown eyes at us wistful too and sad we were going  for in the morning they were driving back again to sorgono over the old road and we were going on to terranova the port but we promised to come back in the summer when it was warmer then we should all meet again  perhaps you will find us on the same course still who knows said the driver sadly     vii  to terranova and the steamer   the morning was very clear and blue we were up betimes the old dame of the inn very friendly this morning we were going already oh but we hadnt stayed long in nuoro didnt we like it  yes we like it we would come back in the summer when it was warmer  ah yes she said artists came in the summer yes she agreed nuoro was a nice placesimpatico molto simpatico and really it is and really she was an awfully nice capable human old woman and i had thought her a beldame when i saw her ironing  she gave us good coffee and milk and bread and we went out into the town there was the real monday morning atmosphere of an old sameasever provincial town the vacant feeling of work resumed after sunday rather reluctantly nobody buying anything nobody quite at grips with anything the doors of the oldfashioned shops stood open in nuoro they have hardly reached the stage of windowdisplays one must go inside into the dark caves to see what the goods are near the doorways of the drapers shops stood rolls of that fine scarlet cloth for the womens costumes in a large tailors window four women sat sewing tailoring and looking out of the window with eyes still sundayemancipate and mischievous detached men some in the black and white stood at the street corners as if obstinately avoiding the current of work having had a day off the salt taste of liberty still lingering on their lips they were not going to be dragged so easily back into harness i always sympathise with these rather sulky forlorn males who insist on making another day of it it shows a spark of spirit still holding out against our overharnessed world  there is nothing to see in nuoro which to tell the truth is always a relief sights are an irritating bore thank heaven there isnt a bit of perugino or anything pisan in the place that i know of happy is the town that has nothing to show what a lot of stunts and affectations it saves life is then life not museumstuffing one could saunter along the rather inert narrow mondaymorning street and see the women having a bit of a gossip and see an old crone with a basket of bread on her head and see the unwilling ones hanging back from work and the whole current of industry disinclined to flow life is life and things are things i am sick of gaping things even peruginos i have had my thrills from carpaccio and botticelli but now ive had enough but i can always look at an old greybearded peasant in his earthy white drawers and his black waistfrill wearing no coat or overgarment but just crooking along beside his little oxwagon i am sick of things even perugino                                       the sight of the woman with the basket of bread reminded us that we wanted some food so we searched for bread none if you please it was monday morning eaten out there would be bread at the forno the oven where was the oven up the road and down a passage i thought we should smell it but no we wandered back our friends had told us to take tickets early for perhaps the bus would be crowded so we bought yesterdays pastry and little cakes and slices of native sausage and still no bread i went and asked our old hostess  there is no fresh bread it hasnt come in yet she said  never mind give me stale  so she went and rummaged in a drawer  oh dear oh dear the women have eaten it all but perhaps over there she pointed down the streetthey can give you some  they couldnt  i paid the billabout twentyeight francs i thinkand went out to look for the bus there it was in a dark little hole they gave me the long ticketstrips firstclass to terranova they cost some seventy francs the two the qb was still vainly aimlessly looking along the street for bread  ready when you are said our new driver rather snappily he was a pale crosslooking young man with brown eyes and fair ginger hair so in we clambered waved farewell to our old friends whose bus was ready to roll away in the opposite direction as we bumped past the piazza i saw velveteens standing there isolate and still apparently scowling with unabated irritation  i am sure he has money why the first class yesterday otherwise and im sure she married him because he is a townsman with property                                       out we rolled on our last sardinian drive the morning was of a belllike beauty blue and very lovely below on the right stretched the concave valley tapestried with cultivation up into the morning light rose the high humanless hills with wild treeless moorslopes  but there was no glass in the left window of the coupé and the wind came howling in cold enough i stretched myself on the front seat the qb screwed herself into a corner and we watched the land flash by how well this new man drove the longnosed freckled one with his gloomy brown eyes how cleverly he changed gear so that the automobile mewed and purred comfortably like a live thing enjoying itself and how dead he was to the rest of the world wrapped in his gloom like a young busdriving hamlet his answers to his mate were monosyllabicor just no answers at all he was one of those responsible capable morose souls who do their work with silent perfection and look as if they were driving along the brink of doom say a word to them and theyll go over the edge but gentle au fond of course fiction used to be fond of them a sort of gingerhaired young mechanic mr rochester who has even lost the jane illusion  perhaps it was not fair to watch him so closely from behind  his mate was a bit of a bounder with one of those rakish military caps whose soft tops cock sideways or backwards he was in italian khaki ridingbreeches and puttees he smoked his cigarette bounderishly but at the same time with peculiar gentleness he handed one to the ginger hamlet hamlet accepted it and his mate held him a light as the bus swung on they were like man and wife the mate was the alert and wideeyed jane eyre whom the ginger mr rochester was not going to spoil in a hurry                                       the landscape was different from yesterdays as we dropped down the shallow winding road from nuoro quite quickly the moors seemed to spread on either side treeless bushy rocky desert how hot they must be in summer one knows from grazia deleddas books  a pony with a low trap was prancing unhappily in the roadside we slowed down and slid harmlessly past then again on we whizzed down the looped road which turned back on itself as sharply as a snake that has been wounded hamlet darted the bus at the curves then softly padded round like an angel then off again for the next parabola  we came out into wide rather desolate moorland valley spaces with low rocks away to the left and steep slopes rockybushy on the right sometimes groups of blackandwhite men were working in the forlorn distances a woman in the madder costume led a panniered ass along the wastes the sun shone magnificently already it was hotter here the landscape had quite changed these slopes looked east and south to the sea they were sunwild and seawild  the first stop was where a wild rough lane came down the hill to our road at the corner stood a lonely houseand in the roadside the most battered lifeweary old carriage i have ever seen the jaunty mate sorted out the postthe boy with the tatteredbattered brown carriage and brown pony signed the book as we all stood in the roadway there was a little wait for a man who was fetching up another parcel the postbag and parcels from the tattered carriage were received and stowed and signed for we walked up and down in the sun to get warm the landscape was wild and open round about  pip goes mr rochester peremptorily at the horn amazing how obediently we scuffle in away goes the bus rushing towards the sea already one felt that peculiar glare in the halfway heavens that intensification of the light in the lower sky which is caused by the sea to sunward  away in front three girls in brown costume are walking along the side of the white highroad going with panniers towards a village up a slight incline they hear us turn round and instantly go off their heads exactly like chickens in the road they fly towards us crossing the road and swifter than any rabbits they scuttle one after another into a deep sidetrack like a deep ditch at right angles to the road there as we roll past they are all crouched peering out at us fearfully like creatures from their hole the bus mate salutes them with a shout and we roll on towards the village on the low summit                                       it is a small stony henscratched place of poor people we roll on to a standstill there is a group of poor people the women wear the darkbrown costume and again the bolero has changed shape it is a rather fantastic low corset curiously shapen and originally apparently made of wonderful elaborate brocade but look at it now  there is an altercation because a man wants to get into the bus with two little black pigs each of which is wrapped in a little sack with its face and ears appearing like a flower from a wrapped bouquet he is told that he must pay the fare for each pig as if it were a christian cristo del mondo a pig a little pig and paid for as if it were a christian he dangles the pigbouquets one from each hand and the little pigs open their black mouths and squeal with selfconscious appreciation of the excitement they are causing dio benedetto it is a chorus but the bus mate is inexorable every animal even if it were a mouse must be paid for and have a ticket as if it were a christian the pigmaster recoils stupified with indignation a pigbouquet under each arm how much do you charge for the fleas you carry asks a sarcastic youth  a woman sitting sewing a soldiers tunic into a little jacket for her urchin and thus beating the sword into a ploughshare stitches unconcernedly in the sun roundcheeked but rather slatternly damsels giggle the pigmaster speechless with fury slings the pigbouquets like two bottles one on either side the saddle of the ass whose halter is held by a grinning but also malevolent girl malevolent against pigprices that is the pigs looking abroad from their new situation squeal the eternal pigprotest against an insufferable humanity  andiamo andiamo says ginger mr rochester in his quiet but intense voice the busmate scrambles up and we charge once more into the strong light to seaward                                       in we roll into orosei a dilapidated sunsmitten godforsaken little town not far from the sea we descend in piazza there is a great false baroque façade to a church up a wavering vast mass of steps and at the side a wonderful jumble of roundnesses with a jumble of round tiled roofs peaked in the centre it must have been some sort of convent but it is eminently what they call a painters bitthat pallid big baroque face at the top of the slow incline and the very curious dark building at the side of it with its several darktiled round roofs like pointed hats at varying altitudes the whole space has a strange spanish look neglected arid yet with a bigness and a dilapidated dignity and a stoniness which carry one back to the middle ages when life was violent and orosei was no doubt a port and a considerable place probably it had bishops  illustration nuoro   the sun came hot into the wide piazza with its pallid heavy façade up on the stony incline on one side and arches and a dark great courtyard and outer stairways of some unknown building away on the other the road entering downhill from the inland and dropping out below to the seamarshes and with the impression that once some single power had had the place in grip had given this centre an architectural unity and splendour now lost and forgotten orosei was truly fascinating  but the inhabitants were churlish we went into a sort of barplace very primitive and asked for bread  bread alone said the churl  if you please  there isnt any he answered  ohwhere can we get some then  you cant get any  really  and we couldnt people stood about glum not friendly  there was a second great automobile ready to set off for tortolì far to the south on the east coast mandas is the railway junction both for sorgono and tortolì the two buses stood near and communed we prowled about the dead almost extinct townor call it village then mr rochester began to pip his horn peremptorily so we scuffled in  the post was stowed away a native in black broadcloth came running and sweating carrying an oxblood suitcase and said we must wait for his brotherinlaw who was a dozen yards away ginger mr rochester sat on his drivers throne and glared in the direction whence the brotherinlaw must come his brow knitted irritably his long sharp nose did not promise much patience he made the horn roar like a seacow but no brotherinlaw  im going to wait no longer said he  oh a minute a minute that wont do us any harm expostulated his mate no answer from the long faced longnosed ginger hamlet he sat statuesque but with black eyes looking daggers down the still void road  eh va bene he murmured through closed lips and leaned forward grimly for the starting handle  patiencepatiencepatience a momentwhy cried the mate  per lamor di dio cried the black broadcloth man simply sizzling and dancing in anguish on the road round the suitcase which stood in the dust dont go gods love dont start hes got to catch the boat hes got to be in rome tomorrow he wont be a second hes here hes here hes here  this startled the fatefixed sharpnosed driver he released the handle and looked round with dark and glowering eyes no one in sight the few glum natives stood round unmoved thunder came into the gloomy dark eyes of the rochester absolutely nobody in sight click went his face into a look of almost seraphic peace as he pulled off the brakes we were on an incline and insidiously oh most subtly the great bus started to lean forwards and steal into motion  oh ma chewhat a will youve got cried the mate clambering in to the side of the now seraphiclooking rochester  love of godgod yelled the broadcloth seeing the bus melt forwards and gather momentum he put his hands up as if to arrest it and yelled in a wild howl o beppin beppino  but in vain already we had left the little groups of onlookers behind we were rolling downwards out of the piazza broadcloth had seized the bag and was running beside us in agony out of the piazza we rolled rochester had not put on the engines and we were just simply rolling down the gentle incline by the will of god into the dark outletstreet we melted towards the still invisible sea  suddenly a yellooahh  È qua È qua È qua È qua gasped broadcloth four times hes here and then beppinshes going shes going  beppin appeared a middleaged man also in black broadcloth with a very scrubby chin and a bundle running towards us on fat legs he was perspiring but his face was expressionless and innocentlooking with a sardonic flicker of a grin half of spite half of relief rochester put on the brakes again and we stopped in the street a woman tottered up panting and holding her breast now for farewells  andiamo said rochester curtly looking over his shoulder and making his fine nose curl with malice and instantly he took off the brakes again the fat woman shoved beppin in gasping farewells the brotherinlaw handed in the oxbloodred suitcase tottering behind and the bus surged savagely out of orosei                                       almost in a moment we had left the town on its slope and there below us was a river winding through marshy flats to the sea to where small white surf broke on a flat isolated beach a quarter of a mile away the river ran rapidly between stones and then between belts of high sere reeds high as a man these tall reeds advanced almost into the slow horizontal sea from which stood up a white glare of light massive light over the low mediterranean  quickly we came down to the riverlevel and rolled over a bridge before us between us and the sea rose another hill almost like a wall with a flat top running horizontal perfectly flat parallel with the seaedge a sort of narrow long plateau for a moment we were in the wide scoop of the riverbed orosei stood on the bluff behind us  away to the right the flat rivermarshes with the thick dead reeds met the flat and shining sea river and sea were one water the waves rippled tiny and softfoot into the stream to the left there was great loveliness the bed of the river curved upwards and inland and there was cultivation but particularly there were noble almond trees in full blossom how beautiful they were their pure silvery pink gleaming so nobly like a transfiguration tall and perfect in that strange cradled riverbed parallel with the sea almond trees were in flower beneath grey orosei almond trees came near the road and we could see the hot eyes of the individual blossoms almond trees stood on the upward slope before us and they had flowered in such noble beauty there in that trough where the sun fell magnificent and the seaglare whitened all the air as with a sort of godpresence they gleamed in their incandescent skyrosiness one could hardly see their iron trunks in this weird valley  but already we had crossed and were charging up the great road that was cut straight slantwise along the side of the seahill like a stairway outside the side of the house so the bus turned southward to run up this stairway slant to get to the top of the seas long tableland so we emerged and there was the mediterranean rippling against the black rocks not so very far away below on our right for once on the long tableland the road turned due north a long white deadstraight road running between strips of moorland wild and bushy the sea was in the near distance blue blue and beating with light it seemed more light than watery and on the left was the wide trough of the valley where almond trees like clouds in a wind seemed to poise skyrosy upon the pale sunpale land and beyond which orosei clustered its lost grey houses on the bluff oh wonderful orosei with your almonds and your reedy river throbbing throbbing with light and the seas nearness and all so lost in a world long gone by lingering as legends linger on it is hard to believe that it is real it seems so long since life left it and memory transfigured it into pure glamour lost away like a lost pearl on the east sardinian coast yet there it is with a few grumpy inhabitants who wont even give you a crust of bread and probably there is malariaalmost sure and it would be hell to have to live there for a month yet for a moment that january morning how wonderful oh the timeless glamour of those middle ages when men were lordly and violent and shadowed with death      timor mortis conturbat me  the road ran along by the sea above the sea swinging gently up and down and running on to a seaencroaching hilly promontory in the distance there were no high lands the valley was left behind and moors surrounded us wild desolate uninhabited and uninhabitable moors sweeping up gently on the left and finishing where the land dropped low and clifflike to the sea on the right no life was now in sight even no ship upon the pale blue sea the great globe of the sky was unblemished and royal in its blueness and its ringing cerulean light over the moors a great hawk hovered rocks cropped out it was a savage darkbushed skyexposed land forsaken to the sea and the sun                                       we were alone in the coupé the busmate had made one or two sets at us but he rather confused us he was youngabout twentytwo or three he was quite goodlooking with his rakish military cap and his wellknitted figure in military clothes but he had dark eyes that seemed to ask too much and his manner of approach was abrupt persistent and disconcerting already he had asked us where we were going where we lived whence we came of what nationality we were and was i a painter already he knew so much further we rather fought shy of him we ate those pale nuoro pastriesthey were just flaky pastry good but with nothing inside but a breath of air and we gnawed slices of very highlyflavoured nuoro sausage and we drank the tea and we were very hungry for it was past noon and we had eaten as good as nothing the sun was magnificent in heaven we rushed at a great purring speed along that moorland road just above the sea  and then the busmate climbed in to share the coupé with us he put his dark beseeching and yet persistent eyes on us sat plumb in front of us his knees squared and began to shout awkward questions in a strong curious voice of course it was very difficult to hear for the great rushing bus made much noise we had to try to yell in our italianand he was as awkward as we were  however although it said smoking forbidden he offered us both cigarettes and insisted we should smoke with him easiest to submit he tried to point us out features in the landscape but there were none to point except that where the hill ran to sea out of the moor and formed a cape he said there was a house away under the cliffs where coastguards lived nothing else  then however he launched he asked once more was i english and was the qb german we said it was so and then he started the old story nations popped up and down again like punch and judy italylitaliashe had no quarrel with la germanianever had hadnono good friends the two nations but once the war was started italy had to come in for why germany would beat france occupy her lands march down and invade italy best then join the war whilst the enemy was only invading somebody elses territory  they are perfectly naïve about it thats what i like he went on to say that he was a soldier he had served eight years in the italian cavalry yes he was a cavalryman and had been all through the war but he had not therefore any quarrel with germany nowar was war and it was over so let it be over  but francema la francia here he sat forward on his seat with his face near ours and his pleadingdogs eyes suddenly took a look of quite irrational blazing rage france there wasnt a man in italy who wasnt dying to get at the throat of france france let there be war and every italian would leap to arms even the old even the oldanche i vecchi yes there must be warwith france it was coming it was bound to come every italian was waiting for it waiting to fly at the french throat for why why he had served two years on the french front and he knew why ah the french for arrogance for insolence diothey were not to be borne the frenchthey thought themselves lords of the worldsignori del mondo lords of the world and masters of the world yes they thought themselves no lessand what are they monkeys monkeys not better than monkeys but let there be war and italy would show them italy would give them signori del mondo italy was pining for warall all pining for war with no one with no one but france ah with no oneitaly loved everybody elsebut france france  we let him shout it all out till he was at the end of it the passion and energy of him was amazing he was like one possessed i could only wonder and wonder again for it is curious what fearful passions these pleading wistful souls fall into when they feel they have been insulted it was evident he felt he had been insulted and he went just beside himself but dear chap he shouldnt speak so loudly for all italyeven the old the bulk of italian men are only too anxious to beat their bayonets into cigaretteholders and smoke the cigarette of eternal and everlasting peace to coincide at all with our friend yet there he wasraging at me in the bus as we dashed along the coast  and then after a space of silence he became sad again wistful and looked at us once more with those pleading brown eyes beseeching beseechinghe knew not what and im sure i didnt know perhaps what he really wants is to be back on a horse in a cavalry regiment even at war  but no it comes out what he thinks he wants  when are we going to london and are there many motorcars in englandmany many in america too do they want men in america i say no they have unemployment out there they are going to stop immigration in april or at least cut it down why he asks sharply because they have their own unemployment problem and the qb quotes how many millions of europeans want to emigrate to the united states his eye becomes gloomy are all nations of europe going to be forbidden he asks yesand already the italian government will give no more passports for americato emigrants no passports then you cant go you cant go say i  by this time his hotsouled eagerness and his hot beseeching eyes have touched the qb she asks him what he wants and from his gloomy face it comes out in a rap andare fuori dellitalia to go out of italy to go outawayto go awayto go away it has become a craving a neurasthenia with them  where is his home his home is at a village a few miles aheadhere on this coast we are coming to it soon there is his home and a few miles inland from the village he also has a property he also has land but he doesnt want to work it he doesnt want it in fact he wont bother with it he hates the land he detests looking after vines he cant even bring himself to try any more  what does he want then  he wants to leave italy to go abroadas a chauffeur again the long beseeching look as of a distraught pleading animal he would prefer to be the chauffeur of a gentleman but he would drive a bus he would do anythingin england  now he has launched it yes i say but in england also we have more men than jobs still he looks at me with his beseeching eyesso desperate tooand so youngand so full of energyand so longing to devote himselfto devote himself or else to go off in an unreasonable paroxysm against the french to my horror i feel he is believing in my goodness of heart and as for motorcars it is all i can do to own a pair of boots so how am i to set about employing a chauffeur                                       we have all gone quiet again so at last he climbs back and takes his seat with the driver once more the road is still straight swinging on through the moorland strip by the sea and he leans to the silent nervetense mr rochester pleading again and at length mr rochester edges aside and lets him take the driving wheel and so now we are all in the hands of our friend the busmate he drivesnot very well it is evident he is learning the bus cant quite keep in the grooves of this wild bare road and he shuts off when we slip down a hilland there is a great muddle on the upslope when he tries to change gear but mr rochester sits squeezed and silently attentive in his corner he puts out his hand and swings the levers there is no fear that he will let anything go wrong i would trust him to drive me down the bottomless pit and up the other side but still the beseeching mate holds the steering wheel and on we rush rather uncertainly and hesitatingly now and thus we come to the bottom of a hill where the road gives a sudden curve my heart rises an inch in my breast i know he cant do it and he cant oh lordbut the quiet hand of the freckled rochester takes the wheel we swerve on and the busmate gives up and the nervesilent driver resumes control                                       but the busmate now feels at home with us he clambers back into the coupé and when it is too painfully noisy to talk he simply sits and looks at us with brown pleading eyes miles and miles and miles goes this coast road and never a village once or twice a sort of lonely watchhouse and soldiers lying about by the road but never a halt everywhere moorland and desert uninhabited  and we are faint with fatigue and hunger and this relentless travelling when oh when shall we come to siniscola where we are due to eat our midday meal oh yes says the mate there is an inn at siniscola where we can eat what we like siniscolasiniscola we feel we must get down we must eat it is past one oclock and the glaring light and the rushing loneliness are still about us                                       but it is behind the hill in front we see the hill yes behind it is siniscola and down there on the beach are the bagni di siniscola where many forestieri strangers come in the summer therefore we set high hopes on siniscola from the town to the sea two miles the bathers ride on asses sweet place and it is coming nearreally near there are stonefenced fieldseven stretches of moor fenced off there are vegetables in a little field with a stone wallthere is a strange white track through the moor to a forsaken seacoast we are near  over the brow of the low hilland there it is a grey huddle of a village with two towers there it is we are there over the cobbles we bump and pull up at the side of the street this is siniscola and here we eat  we drop out of the weary bus the mate asks a man to show us the innthe man says he wont muttering so a boy is deputedand he consents this is the welcome  and i cant say much for siniscola it is just a narrow crude stony place hot in the sun cold in the shade in a minute or two we were at the inn where a fat young man was just dismounting from his brown pony and fastening it to a ring beside the door  the inn did not look promisingthe usual cold room opening gloomily on the gloomy street the usual long table with this time a foully blotched tablecloth and two young peasant madams in charge in the brown costume rather sordid and with folded white cloths on their heads the younger was in attendance she was a fullbosomed young hussy and would be very queenly and cocky she held her nose in the air and seemed ready to jibe at any order it takes one some time to get used to this cocky assertive behaviour of the young damsels the wholltreadonthetailofmyskirt bearing of the hussies but it is partly a sort of crude defensiveness and shyness partly it is barbaric méfiance or mistrust and partly without doubt it is a tradition with sardinian women that they must hold their own and be ready to hit first this young sludgequeen was all hit she flounced her posterior round the table planking down the lumps of bread on the foul cloth with an air of takeitasacondescensionthatiwaitonyou a subdued grin lurking somewhere on her face it is not meant to be offensive yet it is so truly it is just uncouthness but when one is tired and hungry  we were not the only feeders there was the man off the pony and a sort of workman or porter or dazio official with himand a smart young man and later our hamlet driver bit by bit the young damsel planked down bread plates spoons glasses bottles of black wine whilst we sat at the dirty table in uncouth constraint and looked at the hideous portrait of his reigning majesty of italy and at length came the inevitable soup and with it the sucking chorus the little maialino at mandas had been a good one but the smart young man in the country beat him as water clutters and slavers down a choky gutter so did his soup travel upwards into his mouth with one long sucking stream of noise intensified as the bits of cabbage etc found their way through the orifice  they did all the talkingthe young men they addressed the sludgequeen curtly and disrespectfully as if to say whats she up to her airs were finely thrown away still she showed off what else was there to eat there was the meat that had been boiled for the soup we knew what that meant i had as lief eat the foot of an old worsted stocking nothing else you sludge queen no what do you want anything else forbeefsteakwhats the good of asking for beefsteak or any other steak on a monday go to the butchers and see for yourself  the hamlet the pony rider and the porter had the faded and tired chunks of boiled meat the smart young man ordered eggs in padellatwo eggs fried with a little butter we asked for the same the smart young man got his firstand of course they were warm and liquid so he fell upon them with a fork and once he had got hold of one end of the eggs he just sucked them up in a prolonged and violent suck like a long thin ropy drink being sucked upwards from the little pan it was a genuine exhibition then he fell upon the bread with loud chews  what else was there a miserable little common orange so much for the dinner was there cheese no but the sludgequeenthey are quite goodnatured reallyheld a conversation in dialect with the young men which i did not try to follow our pensive driver translated that there was cheese but it wasnt good so they wouldnt offer it us and the pony man interpolated that they didnt like to offer us anything that was not of the best he said it in all sincerityafter such a meal this roused my curiosity so i asked for the cheese whether or not and it wasnt so bad after all  this meal cost fifteen francs for the pair of us                                       we made our way back to the bus through the uncouth men who stood about to tell the truth strangers are not popular nowadaysnot anywhere everybody has a grudge against them at first sight this grudge may or may not wear off on acquaintance  the afternoon had become hothot as an english june and we had various other passengersfor one a darkeyed longnosed priest who showed his teeth when he talked there was not much room in the coupé so the goods were stowed upon the little rack  with the strength of the sun and the six or seven people in it the coupé became stifling the qb opened her window but the priest one of the loudtalking sort said that a draught was harmful very harmful so he put it up again he was one of the gregarious sort a loud talker nervy really very familiar with all the passengers and everything did one harmfa male fa male a draught fa male fa molto male non è vero this to all the men from siniscola and they all said yesyes  the busmate clambered into the coupé to take the tickets of the secondclass passengers in the rotondo through the little wicket there was great squeezing and shouting and reckoning change and then we stopped at a halt and he dashed down with the post and the priest got down for a drink with the other men the hamlet driver sat stiff in his seat he pipped the horn he pipped again with decision men came clambering in but it looked as if the offensive priest would be left behind the bus started venomously the priest came running his gown flapping wiping his lips  he dropped into his seat with a cackling laugh showing his long teeth and he said that it was as well to take a drink to fortify the stomach to travel with the stomach uneasy did one harm fa male fa malenon è vero chorus of yes  the busmate resumed his taking the tickets through the little wicket thrusting his rear amongst us as he stood like this down fell his sheepskinlined military overcoat on the qbs head he was filled with grief he folded it and placed it on the seat as a sort of cushion for her oh so gently and how he would love to devote himself to a master and mistress  he sat beside me facing the qb and offered us an acid drop we took the acid drop he smiled with zealous yearning at the qb and resumed his conversations then he offered us cigarettesinsisted on our taking cigarettes  the priest with the long teeth looked sideways at the qb seeing her smoking then he fished out a long cigar bit it and spat he was offered a cigarettebut no cigarettes were harmful fanno male the paper was bad for the health oh very bad a pipe or a cigar so he lit his long cigar and spat large spits on the floor continually  beside me sat a big brighteyed rather goodlooking but foolish man hearing me speak to the qb he said in confidence to the priest here are two germanseh look at them the woman smoking these are a couple of those that were interned here sardinia can do without them now  germans in italy at the outbreak of the war were interned in sardinia and as far as one hears they were left very free and happy and treated very well the sardinians having been generous as all proud people are but now our brighteyed fool made a great titter through the bus quite unaware that we understood he said nothing offensive but that sort of tittering exultation of common people who think they have you at a disadvantage annoyed me however i kept still to hear what they would say but it was only trivialities about the germans having nearly all gone now their being free to travel their coming back to sardinia because they liked it better than germany oh yesthey all wanted to come back they all wanted to come back to sardinia oh yes they knew where they were well off they knew their own advantage sardinia was this that and the other of advantageousness and the sardi were decent people it is just as well to put in a word on ones own behalf occasionally as for la germaniashe was down down bassa what did one pay for bread in germany five francs a kilo my boy                                       the bus stopped again and they trooped out into the hot sun the priest scuffled round the corner this time not to go round the corner was no doubt harmful we waited a frown came between the bus hamlets brows he looked nerveworn and tired it was about three oclock we had to wait for a man from a village with the post and he did not appear  i am going i wont wait said the driver  waitwait a minute said the mate pouring oil and he went round to look but suddenly the bus started with a vicious lurch the mate came flying and hung on to the footboard he had really almost been left the driver glanced round sardonically to see if he were there the bus flew on the mate shook his head in deprecation  hes a bit nervoso the driver said the qb a bit out of temper  ah poor chap said the goodlooking young mate leaning forward and making such beseeching eyes of hot tolerance one has to be sorry for him persons like him they suffer so much from themselves how should one be angry with them poverino we must have sympathy  never was such a language of sympathy as the italian poverino poverino they are never happy unless they are sympathising pityingly with somebody and i rather felt that i was thrown in with the poverini who had to be pitied for being nervosi which did not improve my temper  however the busmate suddenly sat on the opposite seat between the priest and the qb he turned over his official note book and began to write on the back cover very carefully in the flourishing italian hand then he tore off what he had written and with a very bright and zealous look he handed me the paper saying you will find me a post in england when you go in the summer you will find me a place in london as a chauffeur  if i can said i but it is not easy  he nodded his head at me with the most complete bright confidence quite sure now that he had settled his case perfectly  on the paper he had written his name and his address and if anyone would like him as chauffeur they have only to say so on the back of the scrap of paper the inevitable goodwill auguri infiniti e buon viaggio infinite good wishes and a good journey  i folded the paper and put it in my waistcoat pocket feeling a trifle disconcerted by my new responsibility he was such a dear fellow and such bright trustful eyes                                       this much achieved there was a moment of silence and the busmate turned to take a ticket of a fat comfortable man who had got in at the last stop there was a bit of flying conversation  where are they from asked the goodlooking stupid man next to me inclining his head in our direction  londra said our friend with stern satisfaction and they have said so often to one another that london is the greatest city in the world that now the very word londra conveys it all you should have seen the blank littleboy look come over the face of the big handsome fellow on hearing that we were citizens of the greatest city in the world  and they understand italian he asked rather nipped  sicuro said our friend scornfully how shouldnt they  ah my large neighbour left his mouth open for a few moments and then another sort of smile came on to his face he began to peep at us sideways from his brown eyes brightly and was henceforth itching to get into conversation with the citizens of the worlds mistresscity his look of semiimpudence was quite gone replaced by a look of ingratiating admiration  now i ask you is this to be borne here i sit and he talks halfimpudently and patronisingly about me and here i sit and he is glegging at me as if he saw signs of an aureole under my grey hat all in ten minutes and just because instead of la germania i turn out to be linghilterra i might as well be a place on a map or a piece of goods with a trademark so little perception of the actual me so much going by labels i now could have kicked him harder i would have liked to say i was ten times german to see the fool change his smirk again                                       the priest now chimed up that he had been to america he had been to america and hence he dreaded not the crossing from terranuova di sardegna to cività vecchia for he had crossed the great atlantic  apparently however the natives had all heard this song of the raven before so he spat largely on the floor whereupon the new fat neighbour asked him was it true that the catholic church was now becoming the one church in the united states and the priest said there was no doubt about it                                       the hot afternoon wore on the coast was rather more inhabited but we saw practically no villages the view was rather desolate from time to time we stopped at a sordidlooking canteen house from time to time we passed natives riding on their ponies and sometimes there was an equestrian exhibition as the rough strong little beasts reared and travelled rapidly backwards away from the horrors of our great automobile but the male riders sat heavy and unshakeable with sardinian male force everybody in the bus laughed and we passed looking back to see the pony still corkscrewing but in vain in the middle of the lonely grassbordered highroad                                       the busmate climbed in and out coming in to sit near us he was like a dove which has at last found an olive bough to nest in and we were the olive bough in this world of waste waters alas i felt a broken reed but he sat so serenely near us now like a dog that has found a master  the afternoon was declining the bus pelted on at a great rate ahead we saw the big lump of the island of tavolara a magnificient mass of rock which fascinated me by its splendid weighty form it looks like a headland for it apparently touches the land there it rests at the seas edge in this lost afternoon world strange how this coastcountry does not belong to our presentday world as we rushed along we saw steamers two steamers steering south and one sailing ship coming from italy and instantly the steamers seemed like our own familiar world but still this coastcountry was forsaken forgotten not included it just is not included                                       how tired one gets of these long long rides it seemed we should never come up to tavolara but we did we came right near to it and saw the beach with the waves rippling undisturbed saw the narrow waters between the rocklump and the beach for now the road was down at sealevel and we were not very far from terranova yet all seemed still forsaken outside of the worlds life  the sun was going down very red and strong away inland in the bus all were silent subsiding into the pale travelsleep we charged along the flat road down on a plain now and dusk was gathering heavily over the land  we saw the highroad curve flat upon the plain it was the harbour head we saw a magic landlocked harbour with masts and dark land encircling a glowing basin we even saw a steamer lying at the end of a long thin bank of land in the shallow shining wide harbour as if wrecked there and this was our steamer but no it looked in the powerful glow of the sunset like some lonely steamer laid up in some landlocked bay away at spitzbergen towards the north pole a solemn mysterious bluelanded bay lost lost to mankind                                       our busmate came and told us we were to sit in the bus till the postwork was done then we should be driven to the hotel where we could eat and then he would accompany us on the town omnibus to the boat we need not be on board till eight oclock and now it was something after five so we sat still while the bus rushed and the road curved and the view of the weird landlocked harbour changed though the bare masts of ships in a bunch still pricked the upper glow and the steamer lay away out as if wrecked on a sandbank and dark mysterious land with bunchy hills circled round dark blue and wintry in a golden afterlight while the great shallowseeming bay of water shone like a mirror  in we charged past a railway along the flat darkening road into a flat godlost town of dark houses on the marshy bayhead it felt more like a settlement than a town but it was terranovapausanias and after bumping and rattling down a sombre uncouth barrenseeming street we came up with a jerk at a doorwaywhich was the postoffice urchins mudlarks were screaming for the luggage everybody got out and set off towards the sea the urchins carrying luggage we sat still                                       till i couldnt bear it i did not want to stay in the automobile another moment and i did not i did not want to be accompanied by our newfound friend to the steamer so i burst out and the qb followed she too was relieved to escape the new attachment though she had a great tendre for him but in the end one runs away from ones tendres much harder and more precipitately than from ones durs  the mudlarking urchins fell upon us had we any more luggagewere we going to the steamer i asked how one went to the steamerdid one walk i thought perhaps it would be necessary to row out you go on foot or in a carriage or in an aeroplane said an impudent brat how far ten minutes could one go on board at once yes certainly  so in spite of the qbs protests i handed the sack to a wicked urchin to be led she wanted us to go alonebut i did not know the way and am wary of stumbling into entanglements in these parts  i told the bushamlet who was abstract with nerve fatigue please to tell his comrade that i would not forget the commission and i tapped my waistcoat pocket where the paper lay over my heart he briefly promisedand we escaped we escaped any further friendship                                       i bade the mudlark lead me to the telegraph office which of course was quite remote from the postoffice shouldering the sack and clamouring for the kitchenino which the qb stuck to he marched forward by his height he was ten years old by his face with its evil mudlark pallor and goodlooks he was forty he wore a cutdown soldiers tunic which came nearly to his knees was barefoot and sprightly with that alert mudlarking quickness which has its advantages  so we went down a passage and climbed a stair and came to an office where one would expect to register births and deaths but the urchin said it was the telegraphoffice no sign of life peering through the wicket i saw a fat individual seated writing in the distance feeble lights relieved the big barren official spacesi wonder the fat official wasnt afraid to be up here alone  he made no move i banged the shutter and demanded a telegraph blank his shoulders went up to his ears and he plainly intimated his intention to let us wait but i said loudly to the urchin is that the telegraph official and the urchin said si signoreso the fat individual had to come                                       after which considerable delay we set off again the bus thank heaven had gone the savage dark street was empty of friends we turned away to the harbour front it was dark now i saw a railway near at handa bunch of dark maststhe steamer showing a few lights far down at the tip of a long spit of land remote in midharbour and so off we went the barefoot urchin twinkling a few yards ahead on the road that followed the spit of land the spit was wide enough to carry this road and the railway on the right was a silent house apparently built on piles in the harbour away far down in front leaned our glimmering steamer and a little train was shunting trucks among the low sheds beside it night had fallen and the great stars flashed orion was in the air and his dogstar after him we followed on down the dark bar between the silent lustrous water the harbour was smooth as glass and gleaming like a mirror hills came round encircling it entirelydark land ridging up and lying away out even to seaward one was not sure which was exactly seaward the dark encircling of the land seemed stealthy the hills had a remoteness guarding the waters in the silence perhaps the great mass away beyond was tavolara again it seemed like some lumpish berg guarding an arctic lockedup bay where ships lay dead  illustration terranova  on and on we followed the urchin till the town was left behind until it also twinkled a few meagre lights out of its low confused blackness at the bayhead across the waters we lad left the shipmasts and the settlement the urchin padded on only turning now and again and extending a thin eager hand toward the kitchenino especially when some men were advancing down the railway he wanted it the qbs carrying it was a slur on his prowess so the kitchenino was relinquished and the lark strode on satisfied                                       till at last we came to the low sheds that squatted between the steamer and the railwayend the lark led me into one where a redcap was writing the cap let me wait some minutes before informing me that this was the goods officethe ticket office was further on the lark flew at him and said then youve changed it have you and he led me on to another shed which was just going to shut up here they finally had the condescension to give me two ticketsa hundred and fifty francs the two so we followed the lark who strode like scipio africanus up the gangway with the sack                                       it was quite a small ship the steward put me in number one cabinthe qb in number seven each cabin had four berths consequently man and woman must separate rigorously on this ship here was a blow for the qb who knows what italian female fellowpassengers can be however there we were all the cabins were down below and all for some mysterious reason insideno portholes outside it was hot and close down below already i pitched the sack on my berth and there stood the lark on the red carpet at the door  i gave him three francs he looked at it as if it were my deathwarrant he peered at the paper in the light of the lamp then he extended his arm with a gesture of superb insolence flinging me back my gold without a word  how said i three francs are quite enough  three francstwo kilometersand three pieces of luggage no signore no five francs cinque franchi and averting his pallid old mudlarking face and flinging his hand out at me he stood the image of indignant repudiation and truly he was no taller than my upper waistcoat pocket the brat the brat he was such an actor and so impudent that i wavered between wonder and amusement and a great inclination to kick him up the steps i decided not to waste my energy being angry  what a beastly little boy what a horrid little boy what a horrid little boy reallya little thief a little swindler i mused aloud  swindler he quavered after me and he was beaten swindler doubled him up that and the quiet mildness of my tone of invocation now he would have gone with his three francs and now in final contempt i gave him the other two  he disappeared like a streak of lightning up the gangway terrified lest the steward should come and catch him at his tricks for later on i saw the steward send other larks flying for demanding more than onefifty the brat                                       the question was now the cabin for the qb simply refused to entertain the idea of sharing a cabin with three italian women who would all be sick simply for the fuss of it though the sea was smooth as glass we hunted up the steward he said all the firstclass cabins had four berthsthe second had three but much smaller how that was possible i dont know however if no one came he would give us a cabin to ourselves  the ship was clean and civilised though very poky and there we were                                       we went on deck would we eat on board asked another person no we wouldnt we went out to a fourth little shed which was a refreshment stall and bought bread and sardines and chocolate and apples then we went on the upper deck to make our meal in a sheltered place i lit the spirit lamp and put on water to boil the water we had taken from the cabin then we sat down alone in the darkness on a seat which had its back against the deck cabins now appropriated by the staff a thin cold wind was travelling we wrapped the one plaid round us both and snugged together waiting for the tea to boil i could just see the point of the spiritflame licking up from where we sat                                       the stars were marvellous in the soundless sky so big that one could see them hanging orblike and alone in their own space yet all the myriads particularly bright the eveningstar and he hung flashing in the lower night with a power that made me hold my breath grand and powerful he sent out his flashes so sparkling that he seemed more intense than any sun or moon and from the dark uprising land he sent his way of light to us across the water a marvellous starroad so all above us the stars soared and pulsed over that silent nightdark landlocked harbour                                       after a long time the water boiled and we drank our hot tea and ate our sardines and bread and bits of remaining nuoro sausage sitting there alone in the intense starry darkness of that upper deck i said alone but no two ghoulish ships cats came howling at us for the bits and even when everything was eaten and the sardinetin thrown in the sea still they circled and prowled and howled  we sat on resting under the magnificent deep heavens wrapped together in the old shepherds shawl for which i have blessed so often a scottish friend half sheltered from the cold night wind and recovering somewhat from the sixty miles busride we had done that day  as yet there was nobody on the shipwe were the very first at least in the first class above all was silent and deserted below all was litup and deserted but it was a little ship with accommodation for some thirty firstclass and forty secondclass passengers  in the low deck forward stood two rows of cattleeighteen cattle they stood tied up side by side and quite motionless as if stupefied only two had lain down the rest stood motionless with tails dropped and heads dropped as if drugged or gone insensible these cattle on the ship fascinated the qb she insisted on going down to them and examining them minutely but there they werestiff almost as noahs ark cows what she could not understand was that they neither cried nor struggled motionlessterribly motionless in her idea cattle are wild and indomitable creatures she will not realise the horrid strength of passivity and inertia which is almost the preponderant force in domesticated creatures men and beast alike there are fowls too in various coopsflappy and agitated these                                       at last at about half past seven the train from the island arrived and the people surged out in a mass we stood hanging over the end of the upper deck looking down on they poured in a thick mass up the gangway with all conceivable sorts of luggage bundles embroidered carryalls bags saddlebagsthe qb lamenting she had not bought onea sudden surging mass of people and goods there are soldiers toobut these are lined upon the bit of a quay to wait  our interest is to see whether there will be any more firstclass passengers coming up the wide board which serves as gangway each individual hands a ticket to the man at the top and is shooed away to his own regionusually second class there are three sorts of ticketsgreen firstclass white second and pink third the secondclass passengers go aft the third class go forward along the passage past our cabins into the steerage and so we watch and watch the excited people come on board and divide nearly all are secondclassand a great many are women we have seen a few firstclass men but as yet no women and every hat with ospreys gives the qb a qualm  for a long time we are safe the women flood to the secondclass one who is third begs and beseeches to go with her friends in the second i am glad to say without success and then alas an elderly man with a daughter firstclass they are very respectable and pleasant looking but the qb wails im sure she will be sick                                       towards the end come three convicts chained together they wear the brownish striped homespun and do not look evil they seem to be laughing together not at all in distress the two young soldiers who guard them and who have guns look nervous so the convicts go forward to the steerage past our cabins                                       at last the soldiers are straightened up and turned on board there almost at once they start making a tent drawing a huge tarpaulin over a cross rope in the middeck below us between the first and second class regions the great tarpaulin is pulled down well on either side and fastened down and it makes a big dark tent the soldiers creep in and place their bundles  and now it is the soldiers who fascinate the qb she hangs over the bar above and peers in the soldiers arrange themselves in two rows they will sleep with their heads on their bundles on either side of the tent the two rows of feet coming together inwards but first they must eat for it is eight oclock and more  out come their suppers a whole roast fowl hunks of kid legs of lamb huge breads the fowl is dismembered with a jackknife in a twinkling and shared everything among the soldiers is shared there they sit in their penthouse with its open ends crowded together and happy chewing with all their might and clapping one another on the shoulder lovingly and taking swigs at the wine bottles we envy them their good food                                       at last all are on boardthe omnibus has driven up from town and gone back a last young lout dashes up in a carriage and scuffles aboard the crew begins to run about the quayporters have trotted on board with the last bales and packagesall is stowed safely the steamer hoots and hoots two men and a girl kiss their friends all round and get off the ship the night reechoes the steamers hoots the sheds have gone all dark far off the town twinkles very sparsely all is nightdeserted and so the gangway is hauled up and the rope hawsers quickly wound in we are drifting away from the quay side the few watchers wave their white handkerchiefs standing diminutive and forlorn on the dark little quay in the heart of the dark deserted harbour one woman cries and waves and weeps a man makes exaggerated flagwagging signals with his white handky and feels important we driftand the engines begin to beat we are moving in the landlocked harbour                                       everybody watches the commander and the crew shout orders and so very slowly and without any fuss at all like a man wheeling a barrow out of a yard gate we throb very slowly out of the harbour past one point then past another away from the encircling hills away from the great lump of tavolara which is to southward away from the outreaching land to the north and over the edge of the open sea                                       and now to try for a cabin to ourselves i approach the steward yes he says he has it in mind but there are eighty secondclass passengers in an accommodation space for forty the transitcontroller is now considering it most probably he will transfer some secondclass women to the vacant firstclass cabins if he does not do so then the steward will accommodate us  i know what this meansthis equivocation we decide not to bother any more so we make a tour of the shipto look at the soldiers who have finished eating sitting yarning to one another while some are already stretched out in the shadow for sleep then to look at the cattle which stand rooted to the deckwhich is now all messy to look at the unhappy fowls in their coops and a peep at the thirdclassrather horrifying  and so to bed already the other three berths in my cabin are occupied the lights are switched off as i enter i hear one young man tenderly enquiring of the berth below dost thou feel ill ernot muchnot much says the other faintly  yet the sea is like glass so smooth  i am quickly rolled in my lower berth where i feel the trembling of the machineimpelled ship and hear the creaking of the berth above me as its occupant rolls over i listen to the sighs of the others the wash of dark water and so uneasily rather hot and very airless uneasy with the machinethrobbing and the sighing of my companions and with a cock that crows shrilly from one of the coops imagining the ships lights to be dawn the night goes by one sleepsbut a bad sleep if only there were cold air not this lowerberth inside cabin airlessness     viii  back   the sea being steady as a level road nobody succeeded in being violently sick my young men rose at dawni was not long in following it was a gray morning on deck a gray sea a gray sky and a gray spidercloth unimportant coast of italy not far away the qb joined me and quite delighted with her fellowpassenger such a nice girl she said who when she let down her ordinarylooking brown hair it reached rippling right to her feet voilà you never know your luck  the cock that had crowed all night crowed again hoarsely with a sore throat the miserable cattle looked more wearily miserable but still were motionless as sponges that grow at the bottom of the sea the convicts were out for air grinning someone told us they were wardeserters considering the light in which these people look on war desertion seemed to me the only heroism but the qb brought up in a military air gazed upon them as upon men miraculously alive within the shadow of death according to her code they had been shot when recaptured the soldiers had unslung the tarpaulin their home for the night had melted with the darkness they were mere fragments of gray transit smoking cigarettes and staring overboard  we drew near to cività vecchia the old mediaeval looking port with its castle and a round fortressbarracks at the entrance soldiers aboard shouted and waved to soldiers on the ramparts we backed insignificantly into the rather scrubby insignificant harbour and in five minutes we were out and walking along the wide desolate boulevard to the station the cabmen looked hard at us but no doubt owing to the knapsack took us for poor germans                                       coffee and milkand then only about threequarters of an hour late the train from the north it is the night express from turin there was plenty of roomso in we got followed by half a dozen sardinians we found a large heavy torinese in the carriage his eyes dead with fatigue it seemed quite a new world on the mainland and at once one breathed again the curious suspense that is in the air once more i read the corriere della sera from end to end once more we knew ourselves in the real active world where the air seems like a lively wine dissolving the pearl of the old order i hope dear reader you like the metaphor yet i cannot forbear repeating how strongly one is sensible of the solvent property of the atmosphere suddenly arriving on the mainland again and in an hour one changes ones psyche the human being is a most curious creature he thinks he has got one soul and he has got dozens i felt my sound sardinian soul melting off me i felt myself evaporating into the real italian uncertainty and momentaneity so i perused the corriere whilst the metamorphosis took place i like italian newspapers because they say what they mean and not merely what is most convenient to say we call it naïvetéi call it manliness italian newspapers read as if they were written by men and not by calculating eunuchs                                       the train ran very heavily along the maremma it began to rain then we stopped at a station where we should not stopsomewhere in the maremma country the invisible sea not far off the low country cultivated and yet forlorn oh how the turin man sighed and wearily shifted his feet as the train stood meaningless there it satin the rain oh express  at last on again till we were winding through the curious long troughs of the roman campagna there the shepherds minded the sheep the slenderfooted merino sheep in sardinia the merinos were very white and glistening so that one thought of the scriptural white as wool and the black sheep among the flock were very black but these campagna were no longer white but dingy and though the wildness of the campagna is a real wildness still it is a historic wildness familiar in its way as a fireside is familiar  so we approach the hopeless sprawling of modern romeover the yellow tiber past the famous pyramid tomb skirting the walls of the city till at last we plunge in into the wellknown station out of all the chaos  we are late it is a quarter to twelve and i have to go out and change money and i hope to find my two friendsthe qb and i dash down the platformno friends at the barrier the station moderately empty we bolt across to the departure platforms the naples train stands ready in we pitch our bags ask a naval man not to let anyone steal them then i fly out into town while the qb buys food and wine at the buffet  it no longer rains and rome feels as everrather holidaylike and not inclined to care about anything i get a hundred and three lira for each pound note pocket my money at two minutes past twelve and bolt back out of the piazza delle terme aha there are the two missing ones just descending vaguely from a carriage the one gazing inquiringly through his monocle across the tramlines the other very tall and alert and elegant looking as if he expected us to appear out of the air for his convenience  which is exactly what happens we fly into each others arms oh there you are wheres the qb why are you here weve been to the arrival platformno sign of you of course i only got your wire half an hour ago we flew here well how nice to see youoh let the man waitwhat going on at once to naples but must you oh but how flighty you are birds of passage veramente then let us find the qb quickand they wont let us on the platform no theyre not issuing platform tickets todayoh merely the guests returning from that savoybavarian wedding in the north a few royal duchesses about oh well we must try and wangle him  at the barrier a woman trying in vain to be let on to the station but what a roman matron cant do an elegant young englishman can so our two heroes wangle their way in and fall into the arms of the qb by the naples train well now tell us all about it so we rush into a fourbranched candlestick of conversation in my ear murmurs he of the monocle about the saharahe is back from the sahara a week ago the winter sun in the sahara he with the smears of paint on his elegant trousers is giving the qb a sketchy outline of his now grande passion click goes the exchange and him of the monocle is detailing to the qb his trip to japan on which he will start in six weeks time while him of the paintsmears is expatiating on the thrills of the etching needle and concocting a plan for a month in sardinia in may with me doing the scribbles and he the pictures what sort of pictures out flies the name of goyaand well now a general rush into oneness and wont they come down to sicily to us for the almond blossom in about ten days time yes they willwire when the almond blossom is just stepping on the stage and making its grand bow and they will come next day somebody has smitten the wheel of a coach two ringing smacks with a hammer this is a sign to get in the qb is terrified the train will slip through her fingers im frightened i must get invery well then youre sure you have everything you want everything a fiasco of vino oh two all the better well thenten days time all rightquite surehow nice to have seen you if only a glimpseyes yes poor qb yes youre quite safe goodbye goodbye  the door is shutwe are seatedthe train moves out of the station and quickly on this route rome disappears we are out on the wintry campagna where crops are going away on the left we see the tivoli hills and think of the summer that is gone the heat the fountains of the villa deste the train rolls heavily over the campagna towards the alban mounts homewards                                       so we fall on our food and devour the excellent little beefsteaks and rolls and boiled eggs apples and oranges and dates and drink the good red wine and wildly discuss plans and the latest news and are altogether thrilled about things so thrilled that we are well away among the romantic mountains of the southcentre before we realise that there are other passengers besides ourselves in the carriage half the journey is over why there is the monastery on its high hill in a wild moment i suggest we shall get down and spend a night up there at montecassino and see the other friend the monk who knows so much about the world being out of it but the qb shudders thinking of the awful winter coldness of that massive stone monastery which has no spark of heating apparatus and therefore the plan subsides and at cassino station i only get down to procure coffee and sweet cakes they always have good things to eat at cassino station in summer big fresh ices and fruits and iced water in winter toothsome sweet cakes which make an awfully good finish to a meal                                       i count cassino half way to naples after cassino the excitement of being in the north begins quite to evaporate the southern heaviness descends upon us also the sky begins to darken and the rain falls i think of the night before us on the sea again and i am vaguely troubled lest we may not get a berth however we may spend the night in naples or even sit on in this train which goes forward all through the long long night to the straits of messina we must decide as we near naples  half dozing one becomes aware of the people about one we are travelling second class opposite is a little holdyourown schoolmistressy young person in pincenez next her a hollowcheeked white soldier with ribbons on his breast then a fat man in a corner then a naval officer of low rank the naval officer is coming from fiume and is dead with sleep and perhaps mortification dannunzio has just given up two compartments away we hear soldiers singing martial still though bruised with fatigue the dannunziobragging songs of fiume they are soldiers of the dannunzio legion and one of them i hear the sick soldier saying is very hot and republican still private soldiers are not allowed with their reduced tickets to travel on the express trains but these legionaries are not penniless they have paid the excess and come along for the moment they are sent to their homes and with heads dropping with fatigue we hear them still defiantly singing down the carriage for dannunzio  a regular officer went alonga captain of the italian not the fiume army he heard the chants and entered the carriage the legionaries were quiet but they lounged and ignored the entry of the officer on your feet he yelled italian fashion the vehemence did it reluctantly as may be they stood up in the compartment salute and though it was bitter up went their hands in the salute whilst he stood and watched them and then very superb he sauntered away again they sat down glowering of course they were beaten didnt they know it the men in our carriage smiled curiously in slow and futile mockery of both parties  the rain was falling outside the windows were steamed quite dense so that we were shut in from the world throughout the length of the train which was not very full could be felt the exhausted weariness and the dispirited dejection of the poor dannunzio legionaries in the afternoon silence of the mistenclosed halfempty train the snatches of song broke out again and faded in sheer dispirited fatigue we ran on blindly and heavily but one young fellow was not to be abashed he was wellbuilt and his thick black hair was brushed up like a great fluffy crest upon his head he came slowly and unabated down the corridor and on every big mistopaque pane he scrawled with his finger w dannunzio gabrielew dannunzio gabriele  the sick soldier laughed thinly saying to the schoolmistress oh yes they are fine chaps but it was folly dannunzio is a world poeta world wonderbut fiume was a mistake you know and these chaps have got to learn a lesson they got beyond themselves oh they arent short of money dannunzio had wagonloads of money there in fiume and he wasnt altogether mean with it the schoolmistress who was one of the sharp ones gave a little disquisition to show why it was a mistake and wherein she knew better than the worlds poet and wonder  it always makes me sick to hear people chewing over newspaper pulp  the sick soldier was not a legionary he had been wounded through the lung but it was healed he said he lifted the flap of his breast pocket and there hung a little silver medal it was his woundmedal he wore it concealed and over the place of the wound he and the schoolmistress looked at one another significantly  then they talked pensions and soon were on the old topic the schoolmistress had her figures pat as a schoolmistress should why the ticketcollector the man who punches ones tickets on the train now had twelve thousand lira a year twelve thousand lira monstrous whilst a fullyqualified professore a schoolmaster who had been through all his training and had all his degrees was given five thousand five thousand for a fully qualified professore and twelve thousand for a ticket puncher the soldier agreed and quoted other figures but the railway was the outstanding grievance every boy who left school now said the schoolmistress wanted to go on the railway oh butsaid the soldierthe trainmen                                       the naval officer who collapsed into the most uncanny positions blind with sleep got down at capua to get into a little train that would carry him back to his own station where our train had not stopped at caserta the sick soldier got out down the great avenue of trees the rain was falling a young man entered remained also the schoolmistress and the stout man knowing we had been listening the schoolmistress spoke to us about the soldier thenshe had said she was catching the night boat for palermoi asked her if she thought the ship would be very full oh yes very full she said why hers was one of the last cabin numbers and she had got her ticket early that morning the fat man now joined in he too was crossing to palermo the ship was sure to be quite full by now were we depending on booking berths at the port of naples we were whereupon he and the schoolmistress shook their heads and said it was more than doubtfulnay it was as good as impossible for the boat was the renowned città di trieste that floating palace and such was the fame of her gorgeousness that everybody wanted to travel by her  first and second class alike i asked  oh yes also first class replied the schoolmarm rather spitefully so i knew she had a white ticketsecond  i cursed the città di trieste and her gorgeousness and looked down my nose we had now two alternatives to spend the night in naples or to sit on all through the night and next morning and arrive home with heavens aid in the early afternoon though these longdistance trains think nothing of six hours late but we were tired already what we should be like after another twentyfour hours sitting heaven knows and yet to struggle for a bed in a naples hotel this night in the rain all the hotels being at present crammed with foreigners that was no rosy prospect oh dear  however i was not going to take their discouragement so easily one has been had that way before they love to make the case look desperate  were we english asked the schoolmistress we were ah a fine thing to be english in italy now whyrather tart from me because of the cambio the exchange you english with your money exchange you come here and buy everything for nothing you take the best of everything and with your money you pay nothing for it whereas we poor italians we pay heavily for everything at an exaggerated price and we can have nothing ah it is all very nice to be english in italy now you can travel you go to the hotels you can see everything and buy everything and it costs you nothing what is the exchange today she whipped it out a hundred and four twenty  this she told me to my nose and the fat man murmured bitterly già giàay ay her impertinence and the fat mans quiet bitterness stirred my bile has not this song been sung at me once too often by these people  you are mistaken said i to the schoolmistress we dont by any means live in italy for nothing even with the exchange at a hundred and three we dont live for nothing we pay and pay through the nose for whatever we have in italy and you italians see that we pay what you put all the tariff you do on foreigners and then say we live here for nothing i tell you i could live in england just as well on the same moneyperhaps better compare the cost of things in england with the cost here in italy and even considering the exchange italy costs nearly as much as england some things are cheaper herethe railway comes a little cheaper and is infinitely more miserable travelling is usually a misery but other things clothes of all sorts and a good deal of food is even more expensive here than in england exchange considered  oh yes she said england had had to bring her prices down this last fortnight in her own interests indeed  this last fortnight this last six months said i whereas prices rise every single day here  here a word from the quiet young man who had got in at caserta  yes he said yes i say every nation pays in its own money no matter what the exchange and it works out about equal  but i felt angry am i always to have the exchange flung in my teeth as if i were a personal thief but the woman persisted  ah she said we italians we are so nice we are so good noi siamo così buoni we are so goodnatured but others they are not buoni they are not goodnatured to us and she nodded her head and truly i did not feel at all goodnatured towards her which she knew and as for the italian goodnature it forms a sound and unshakeable basis nowadays for their extortion and selfjustification and spite                                       darkness was falling over the rich flat plains that lie around naples over the tall uncanny vines with their brown thongs in the intensely cultivated black earth it was night by the time we were in that vast and thievish station about halfpast five we were not very late should we sit on in our present carriage and go down in it to the port along with the schoolmistress and risk it but first look at the coach which was going on to sicily so we got down and ran along the train to the syracuse coach hubbub confusion a wedge in the corridor and for sure no room certainly no room to lie down a bit we could not sit tight for twentyfour hours more  so we decided to go to the portand to walk heaven knows when the railway carriage would be shunted down back we went therefore for the sack told the schoolmistress our intention  you can but try she said frostily                                       so there we are with the sack over my shoulder and the kitchenino in the qbs hand bursting out of that thricedamned and annoying station and running through the black wet gulf of a naples night in a slow rain cabmen look at us but my sack saved me i am weary of that boaconstrictor a naples cabman after dark by day there is moreorless a tariff  it is about a mile from the station to the quay where the ship lies we make our way through the deep gulflike streets over the slippery black cobbles the black houses rise massive to a great height on either side but the streets are not in this part very narrow we plunge forwards in the unearthly halfdarkness of this great uncontrolled city there are no lights at all from the buildingsonly the small electric lamps of the streets  so we emerge on the harbour front and hurry past the great storehouses in the rainy night to where the actual entrances begin the tram bangs past us we scuffle along that pavementridge which lies like an isthmus down the vast black quicksands of that harbour road one feels peril all round but at length we come to a gate by the harbour railway no not that on to the next iron gate of the railway crossing and so we run out past the great sheds and the buildings of the port station till we see a ship rearing in front and the sea all black but now where is that little hole where one gets the tickets we are at the back of everywhere in this desert jungle of the harbour darkness                                       a man directs us round the cornerand actually does not demand money it is the sack again sothere i see the knot of men soldiers chiefly fighting in a bare room round a tiny wicket i recognise the place where i have fought before  so while the qb stands guard over sack and bag i plunge into the fray it literally is a fight some thirty men all at once want to get at a tiny wicket in a blank wall there are no queuerails there is no order just a hole in a blank wall and thirty fellows mostly military pressing at it in a mass but i have done this before the way is to insert the thin end of oneself and without any violence by deadly pressure and pertinacity come at the goal one hand must be kept fast over the money pocket and one must be free to clutch the wicketside when one gets there and thus one is ground small in those mills of god demos struggling for tickets it isnt very niceso close so incomparably crushed and never for a second must one be off ones guard for ones watch and money and even hanky when i first came to italy after the war i was robbed twice in three weeks floating round in the sweet old innocent confidence in mankind since then i have never ceased to be on my guard somehow or other waking and sleeping ones spirit must be on its guard nowadays which is really what i prefer now i have learnt it confidence in the goodness of mankind is a very thin protection indeed integer vitae scelerisque purus will do nothing for you when it comes to humanity however efficacious it may be with lions and wolves therefore tight on my guard like a screw biting into a bit of wood i bite my way through that knot of fellows to the wicket and shout for two firstclass the clerk inside ignores me for some time serving soldiers but if you stand like doomsday you get your way two firsts says the clerk husband and wife say i in case there is a twoberth cabin jokes behind but i get my tickets impossible to put my hand to my pocket the tickets cost about a hundred and five francs each clutching paper change and the green slips with a last gasp i get out of the knot soweve done it as i sort my money and stow away i hear another ask for one firstclass nothing left says the clerk so you see how one must fight  i must say for these dense and struggling crowds they are only intense not violent and not in the least brutal i always feel a certain sympathy with the men in them                                       bolt through the pouring rain to the ship and in two minutes we are aboard and behold each of us has a deck cabin i one to myself the qb to herself next door palatialnot a cabin at all but a proper little bedroom with a curtained bed under the porthole windows a comfortable sofa chairs table carpets big washbowls with silver tapsa whole de luxe i dropped the sack on the sofa with a gasp drew back the yellow curtains of the bed looked out of the porthole at the lights of naples and sighed with relief one could wash thoroughly refreshingly and change ones linen wonderful                                       the stateroom is like a hotel lounge many little tables with flowers and periodicals armchairs warm carpet bright but soft lights and people sitting about chatting a loud group of english people in one corner very assured two quiet english ladies various italians seeming quite modest here one could sit in peace and rest pretending to look at an illustrated magazine so we rested after about an hour there entered a young englishman and his wife whom we had seen on our train so at last the coach had been shunted down to the port where should we have been had we waited                                       the waiters began to flap the white tablecloths and spread the tables nearest the walls dinner would begin at halfpast seven immediately the boat started we sat in silence till eight or nine tables were spread then we let the other people take their choice after which we chose a table by ourselves neither of us wanting company so we sat before the plates and the winebottles and sighed in the hopes of a decent meal food by the way is not included in the hundredandfive francs  alas we were not to be alone two young neapolitans pleasant quiet blond or semiblond they were wellbred and evidently of northern extraction afterwards we found out they were jewellers but i liked their quiet gentle manners the dinner began and we were through the soup when up pranced another young fellow rather strapping and loud a commercial traveller for sure he had those cocky assured manners of one who is not sure of his manners he had a rather high forehead and black hair brushed up in a showy wing and a large ring on his finger not that a ring signifies anything here most of the men wear several all massively jewelled if one believed in all the jewels why italy would be more fabulous than fabled india but our friend the bounder was smart and smelled of cash not money but cash  i had an inkling of what to expect when he handed the salt and said in english salt thenk you but i ignored the advance however he did not wait long through the windows across the room the qb saw the lights of the harbour slowly moving oh she cried are we going and also in italian partiamo all watched the lights the bounder screwing round he had one of the fine bounderish backs  yes he said wegoing  oh cried she do you speak english  yees some englishi speak  as a matter of fact he spoke about forty disconnected words but his accent was so good for these forty he did not speak english he imitated an english voice making sounds and the effect was startling he had served on the italian front with the scots guardsso he told us in italian he was milanese oh he had had a time with the scots guards wheeskyeh wheesky  come along bhoys he shouted  and it was such a scotch voice shouting so loudmouthed and actual i nearly went under the table it struck us both like a blow  afterwards he rattled away without misgiving he was a traveller for a certain type of machine and was doing sicily shortly he was going to englandand he asked largely about firstclass hotels then he asked was the qb frenchwas she italianno she was german ahgerman and immediately out he came with the german word deutsch deutsch eh from deutschland oh yes deutschland über alles ah i know no morewhat deutschland unter alles now deutschland unter alles and he bounced on his seat with gratification of the words of german as of english he knew half a dozen phrases  no said the qb not deutschland unter alles not for long anyhow  how not for long you think so i think so too said the bounder then in italian la germania wont stand under all for long no no at present it is england über alles england über alles but germany will rise up again  of course said the qb how shouldnt she  ah said the bounder while england keeps the money in her pocket we shall none of us rise up italy won the war and germany lost it and italy and germany they both are down and england is up they both are down and england is up england and france strange isnt it ah the allies what are the allies for to keep england up and france half way and germany and italy down  ah they wont stay down for ever said the qb  you think not ah we will see we will see how england goes on now  england is not going on so marvellously after all say i  how not you mean ireland  no not only ireland industry altogether england is as near to ruin as other countries  ma with all the money and we others with no money how will she be ruined  and what good would it be to you if she were  oh wellwho knows if england were ruined a slow smile of anticipation spread over his face how he would love ithow they would all love it if england were ruined that is the business part of them perhaps would not love it but the human part would the human part fairly licks its lips at the thought of englands ruin the commercial part however quite violently disclaims the anticipations of the human part and there it is the newspapers chiefly speak with the commercial voice but individually when you are got at in a railway carriage or as now on a ship up speaks the human voice and you know how they love you this is no doubt inevitable when the exchange stands at a hundred and six men go humanly blind i suppose however much they may keep the commercial eye open and having gone humanly blind they bump into ones human self nastily a nasty jar you know then how they hate you underneath they hate us and as human beings we are objects of envy and malice they hate us with envy and despise us with jealousy which perhaps doesnt hurt commercially humanly it is to me unpleasant  the dinner was over and the bounder was lavishing cigarettesmurattis if you please we had all drunk two bottles of wine two other commercial travellers had joined the bounder at our tabletwo smart young fellows one a bounder and one gentle and nice our two jewellers remained quiet talking their share but quietly and so sensitively one could not help liking them so we were seven people six men  wheesky will you drink wheesky mister said our original bounder yes one small scotch one scotch wheesky all this in a perfect scotty voice of a man standing at a bar calling for a drink it was comical one could not but laugh and very impertinent he called for the waiter took him by the buttonhole and with a breasttobreast intimacy asked if there was whisky the waiter with the same tone of youandiaremenwhohavethesamefeelings said he didnt think there was whisky but he would look our bounder went round the table inviting us all to whiskies and pressing on us his expensive english cigarettes with great aplomb  the whisky cameand five persons partook it was fiery oily stuff from heaven knows where the bounder rattled away spouting his bits of english and his four words of german he was in high feather wriggling his large haunches on his chair and waving his hands he had a peculiar manner of wriggling from the bottom of his back with fussy selfassertiveness it was my turn to offer whisky  i was able in a moments lull to peer through the windows and see the dim lights of caprithe glimmer of anacapri up on the black shadowthe lighthouse we had passed the island in the midst of the babel i sent out a few thoughts to a few people on the island then i had to come back  the bounder had once more resumed his theme of linghilterra litalia la germania he swanked england as hard as he could of course england was the top dog and if he could speak some english if he were talking to english people and if as he said he was going to england in april why he was so much the more topdoggy than his companions who could not rise to all these heights at the same time my nerves had too much to bear  where were we going and where had we been and where did we live and ah yes english people lived in italy thousands thousands of english people lived in italy yes it was very nice for them there used to be many germans but now the germans were down but the englishwhat could be better for them than italy now they had sun they had warmth they had abundance of everything they had a charming people to deal with and they had the cambio ecco the other commercial travellers agreed they appealed to the qb if it was not so and altogether i had enough of it  oh yes said i its very nice to be in italy especially if you are not living in an hotel and you have to attend to things for yourself it is very nice to be overcharged every time and then insulted if you say a word its very nice to have the cambio thrown in your teeth if you say two words to any italian even a perfect stranger its very nice to have waiters and shoppeople and railway porters sneering in a bad temper and being insulting in small mean ways all the time its very nice to feel what they all feel against you and if you understand enough italian its very nice to hear what they say when youve gone by oh very nice very nice indeed  i suppose the whisky had kindled this outburst in me they sat dead silent and then our bounder began in his sugary deprecating voice  why no why no it is not true signore no it is not true why england is the foremost nation in the world  and you want to pay her out for it  but no signore but no what makes you say so why we italians are so goodnatured noi italiani siamo così buoni siamo così buoni  it was the identical words of the schoolmistress  buoni said i yesperhaps buoni when its not a question of the exchange and of money but since it is always a question of cambio and soldi now one is always in a small way insulted  i suppose it must have been the whisky anyhow italians can never bear hard bitterness the jewellers looked distressed the bounders looked down their noses half exulting even now and half sheepish being caught the third of the commis voyageurs the gentle one made large eyes and was terrified that he was going to be sick he represented a certain italian liqueur and he modestly asked us to take a glass of it he went with the waiter to secure the proper brand so we drankand it was good but he the giver sat with large and haunted eyes then he said he would go to bed our bounder gave him various advice regarding seasickness there was a mild swell on the sea so he of the liqueur departed                                       our bounder thrummed on the table and hummed something and asked the qb if she knew the rosencavalier he always appealed to her she said she did and ah he was passionately fond of music said he then he warbled in a head voice a bit more he only knew classical music said he and he mewed a bit of moussorgsky the qb said moussorgsky was her favourite musician for opera ah cried the bounder if there were but a pianothere is a piano said his mateyes he replied but it is locked upthen let us get the key said his mate with aplomb the waiters being men with the same feelings as our two would give them anything so the key was forthcoming we paid our billsmine about sixty francs then we went along the faintly rolling ship up the curved staircase to the drawing room our bounder unlocked the door of this drawing room and switched on the lights  it was quite a pleasant room with deep divans upholstered in pale colours and palmtrees standing behind little tables and a black upright piano our bounder sat on the pianostool and gave us an exhibition he splashed out noise on the piano in splashes like water splashing out of a pail he lifted his head and shook his black mop of hair and yelled out some fragments of opera and he wriggled his large bounders back upon the piano stool wriggling upon his wellfilled haunches evidently he had a great deal of feeling for music but very little prowess he yelped it out and wriggled and splashed the piano his friend the other bounder a quiet one in a pale suit with stout limbs older than the wriggler stood by the piano whilst the young one exhibited across the space of carpet sat the two brother jewellers deep in a divan their lean semiblond faces quite inscrutable the qb sat next to me asking for this and that music none of which the wriggler could supply he knew four scraps and a few splashesnot more the elder bounder stood near him quietly comforting encouraging and admiring him as a lover encouraging and admiring his ingénue betrothed and the qb sat brighteyed and excited admiring that a man could perform so unselfconsciously selfconscious and give himself away with such generous wriggles for my part as you may guess i did not admire  i had had enough rising i bowed and marched off the qb came after me goodnight said i at the head of the corridor she turned in and i went round the ship to look at the dark night of the sea                                       morning came sunny with pieces of cloud and the sicilian coast towering pale blue in the distance how wonderful it must have been to ulysses to venture into this mediterranean and open his eyes on all the loveliness of the tall coasts how marvellous to steal with his ship into these magic harbours there is something eternally morningglamourous about these lands as they rise from the sea and it is always the odyssey which comes back to one as one looks at them all the lovely morningwonder of this world in homers day  our bounder was dashing about on deck in one of those raincoats gathered in at the waist and ballooning out into skirts below the waist he greeted me with a cry of its a long long way to tipperary very long said i goodbye piccadilly he continued ciao said i as he dashed jauntily down the steps soon we saw the others as well but it was morning and i simply did not want to speak to themexcept just goodday for my life i couldnt say two more words to any of them this morning except to ask the mild one if he had been sick he had not  so we waited for the great città di trieste to float her way into palermo harbour it looked so nearthe town there the great circle of the port the mass of the hills crowding round panormus the allharbour i wished the bulky steamer would hurry up for i hated her now i hated her swankiness she seemed made for commercial travellers with cash i hated the big picture that filled one end of the stateroom an elegant and ideal peasantgirl a sort of italia strolling on a lovely and ideal cliffs edge among myriad blooms and carrying over her arm in a most sophisticated fashion a bough of almond blossom and a sheaf of anemones i hated the waiters and the cheap elegance the common de luxe i disliked the people who all turned their worst cashgreasy sides outwards on this ship vulgar vulgar postwar commercialism and dogfish moneystink i longed to get off and the bloated boat edged her way so slowly into the port and then more slowly still edged round her fat stern and even then we were kept for fifteen minutes waiting for someone to put up the gangway for the first class the second class of course were streaming off and melting like thawed snow into the crowds of onlookers on the quay long before we were allowed to come off                                       glad glad i was to get off that ship i dont know why for she was clean and comfortable and the attendants were perfectly civil glad glad i was not to share the deck with any more commercial travellers glad i was to be on my own feet independent no i would not take a carriage i carried my sack on my back to the hotel looking with a jaundiced eye on the lethargic traffic of the harbour front it was about nine oclock                                       later on when i had slept i thought as i have thought before the italians are not to blame for their spite against us we england have taken upon ourselves for so long the rôle of leading nation and if now in the war or after the war we have led them all into a real old swinerywhich we have notwithstanding all entente cantthen they have a legitimate grudge against us if you take upon yourself to lead you must expect the mud to be thrown at you if you lead into a nasty morass especially if once in the bog you think of nothing else but scrambling out over other poor devils backs pretty behaviour of great nations  and still for all that i must insist that i am a single human being an individual not a mere national unit a mere chip of linghilterra or la germania i am not a chip of any nasty old block i am myself                                       in the evening the qb insisted on going to the marionettes for which she has a sentimental passion so the three of uswe were with the american friend once morechased through dark and tortuous sidestreets and markets of palermo in the night until at last a friendly man led us to the place the back streets of palermo felt friendly not huge and rather horrible like naples near the port  the theatre was a little hole opening simply off the street there was no one in the little ticket box so we walked past the doorscreen a shabby old man with a long fennelstalk hurried up and made us places on the back benches and hushed us when we spoke of tickets the play was in progress a serpentdragon was just having a tussle with a knight in brilliant brass armour and my heart came into my mouth the audience consisted mostly of boys gazing with frantic interest on the bright stage there was a sprinkling of soldiers and elderly men the place was packedabout fifty souls crowded on narrow little ribbons of benches so close one behind the other that the end of the man in front of me continually encroached and sat on my knee i saw on a notice that the price of entry was forty centimes  we had come in towards the end of the performance and so sat rather bewildered unable to follow the story was the inevitable paladins of franceone heard the names rinaldo orlando again and again but the story was told in dialect hard to follow  i was charmed by the figures the scene was very simple showing the interior of a castle but the figures which were about twothirds of human size were wonderful in their brilliant glittering gold armour and their martial prancing motions all were knightseven the daughter of the king of babylon she was distinguished only by her long hair all were in the beautiful glittering armour with helmets and visors that could be let down at will i am told this armour has been handed down for many generations it certainly is lovely one actor alone was not in armour the wizard magicce or malvigge the merlin of the paladins he was in a long scarlet robe edged with fur and wore a threecornered scarlet hat  so we watched the dragon leap and twist and get the knight by the leg and then perish we watched the knights burst into the castle we watched the wonderful armourclashing embraces of the delivered knights orlando and his bosom friend and the little dwarf clashing their armoured breasts to the breasts of their brothers and deliverers we watched the wouldbe tears flowand then the statue of the witch suddenly go up in flames at which a roar of exultation from the boys then it was over the theatre was empty in a moment but the proprietors and the two men who sat near us would not let us go we must wait for the next performance  my neighbour a fat jolly man told me all about it his neighbour a handsome tipsy man kept contradicting and saying it wasnt so but my fat neighbour winked at me not to take offence  this story of the paladins of france lasted three nights we had come on the middle nightof course but no mattereach night was a complete story i am sorry i have forgotten the names of the knights but the story was that orlando and his friend and the little dwarf owing to the tricks of that same dwarf who belonged to the paladins had been captured and immured in the enchanted castle of the ghastly old witch who lived on the blood of christians it was now the business of rinaldo and the rest of the paladins by the help of magicce the good wizard to release their captured brethren from the ghoulish old witch  so much i made out of the fat mans story while the theatre was filling he knew every detail of the whole paladin cycle and it is evident the paladin cycle has lots of versions for the handsome tipsy neighbour kept saying he was wrong he was wrong and giving different stories and shouting for a jury to come and say who was right he or my fat friend a jury gathered and a storm began to rise but the stout proprietor with a fennelwand came and quenched the noise telling the handsome tipsy man he knew too much and wasnt asked whereupon the tipsy one sulked  ah said my friend couldnt i come on friday friday was a great night on friday they were giving i beati paoli the blessed pauls he pointed to the walls where were the placards announcing the blessed pauls these pauls were evidently some awful secret society with masking hoods and daggers and awful eyes looking through the holes i said were they assassins like the black hand by no means by no means the blessed pauls were a society for the protection of the poor their business was to track down and murder the oppressive rich ah they were a wonderful a splendid society were they said i a sort of camorra ah on the contraryhere he lapsed into a tense voicethey hated the camorra these the blest pauls were the powerful and terrible enemy of the grand camorra for the grand camorra oppresses the poor and therefore the pauls track down in secret the leaders of the grand camorra and assassinate them or bring them to the fearful hooded tribunal which utters the dread verdict of the beati paoli and when once the beati paoli have decreed a mans deathall over ah bellissimo bellissimo why dont i come on friday  it seems to me a queer moral for the urchins thickpacked and gazing at the drop scene they are all males urchins or men i ask my fat friend why there are no womenno girls ah he says the theatre is so small but i say if there is room for all the boys and men there is the same room for girls and women oh nonot in this small theatre besides this is nothing for women not that there is anything improper he hastens to add not at all but what should women and girls be doing at the marionette show it was an affair for males  i agreed with him really and was thankful we hadnt a lot of smirking twitching girls and lasses in the audience this male audience was so tense and pure in its attention  but hist the play is going to begin a lad is grinding a broken streetpiano under the stage the padrone yells silenzio with a roar and reaching over pokes obstreperous boys with his long fennelstalk like a beadle in church when the curtain rises the piano stops and there is dead silence on swings a knight glittering marching with that curious hippety lilt and gazing round with fixed and martial eyes he begins the prologue telling us where we are and dramatically he waves his sword and stamps his foot and wonderfully sounds his male martial rather husky voice then the paladins his companions who are to accompany him swing one by one onto the stage till they are five in all handsome knights including the babylonian princess and the knight of britain they stand in a handsome glittering line and then comes merlin in his red robe merlin has a bright fair rather chubby face and blue eyes and seems to typify the northern intelligence he now tells them in many words how to proceed and what is to be done  so then the glittering knights are ready are they ready rinaldo flourishes his sword with the wonderful cry andiamo let us goand the others respond andiamo splendid word  the first enemy were the knights of spain in red kirtles and half turbans with these a terrible fight first of all rushes in the knight of britain he is the boaster who always in words does everything but in fact poor knight of britain he falls lamed the four paladins have stood shoulder to shoulder glittering watching the fray forth now steps another knight and the fight recommences terrible is the smacking of swords terrible the gasps from behind the dropped visors till at last the knight of spain fallsand the paladin stands with his foot on the dead then loud acclamations from the paladins and yells of joy from the audience  silenzio yells the padrone flourishing the fennelstalk  dead silence and the story goes on the knight of britain of course claims to have slain the foe and the audience faintly jeeringly hisses hes always the boaster and he never does anything the knight of britain whispers my fat friend he has forgotten my nationality i wonder if the knight of britain is pure tradition or if a political touch of today has crept in  however this fray is overmerlin comes to advise for the next move and are we ready we are ready andiamo again the word is yelled out and they set off at first one is all engaged watching the figures their brilliance their blank martial stare their sudden angular gestures there is something extremely suggestive in them how much better they fit the old legendtales than living people would do nay if we are going to have human beings on the stage they should be masked and disguised for in fact drama is enacted by symbolic creatures formed out of human consciousness puppets if you like but not human individuals our stage is all wrong so boring in its personality  gradually however i found that my eyes were of minor importance gradually it was the voice that gained hold of the blood it is a strong rather husky male voice that acts direct on the blood not on the mind again the old male adam began to stir at the roots of my soul again the old firsthand indifference the rich untamed male blood rocked down my veins what does one care what does one care for precept and mental dictation is there not the massive brilliant outflinging recklessness in the male soul summed up in the sudden word andiamo andiamo let us go on andiamolet us go hell knows where but let us go on the splendid recklessness and passion that knows no precept and no schoolteacher whose very molten spontaneity is its own guide  i loved the voices of the paladinsrinaldos voice and orlandos voice the voice of men once more men who are not to be tutored to be sure there was merlin making his long speeches in rather a chuntering prosy tone but who was he was he a paladin and a splendour not he a longgowned chunterer it is the reckless blood which achieves all the piffpiffpiffing of the mental and moral intelligence is but a subsidiary help a mere instrument  the dragon was splendid i have seen dragons in wagner at covent garden and at the prinzregenten theater in munich and they were ridiculous but this dragon simply frightened me with his leaping and twisting and when he seized the knight by the leg my blood ran cold  with smoke and sulphur leaps in beelzebub but he is merely the servant of the great old witch he is black and grinning and he flourishes his posterior and his tail but he is curiously inefficacious a sort of lackey of wicked powers  the old witch with her grey hair and staring eyes succeeds in being ghastly with just a touch she would be a tall benevolent old lady but listen to her hear her horrible female voice with its scraping yells of evil lustfulness yes she fills me with horror and i am staggered to find how i believe in her as the evil principle beelzebub poor devil is only one of her instruments  it is her old horrible grinning female soul which locks up the heroes and which sends forth the awful and almost omnipotent malevolence this old ghastly womanspirit is the very core of mischief and i felt my heart getting as hot against her as the hearts of the lads in the audience were red deep hate i felt of that symbolic old ghoulfemale poor male beelzebub is her loutish slave and it takes all merlins brightfaced intelligence and all the surging hot urgency of the paladins to conquer her  she will never be finally destroyedshe will never finally die till her statue which is immured in the vaults of the castle is burnedoh it was a very psychoanalytic performance altogether and one could give a very good freudian analysis of itbut behold this image of the witch this white submerged idea of woman which rules from the deeps of the unconscious behold the reckless untamable male knights will do for it as the statue goes up in flameit is only paper over wiresthe audience yells and yells again and would god the symbolic act were really achieved it is only little boys who yell men merely smile at the trick they know well enough the white image endures  so it is over the knights look at us once more orlando hero of heroes has a slight inward cast of the eyes this gives him that look of almost fierce goodnature which these people adore the look of a man who does not think but whose heart is all the time red hot with burning generous bloodpassion this is what they adore  so my knights go they all have wonderful faces and are so splendidly glittering and male i am sorry they will be laid in a box now  there is a great gasp of relief the piano starts its lame rattle somebody looking round laughs and we all look round and seated on the top of the ticket office is a fat solemn urchin of two or three years hands folded over his stomach his forehead big and blank like some queer little buddha the audience laughs with that southern sympathy physical sympathy that is what they love to feel and to arouse  but there is a little afterscene in front of the dropcurtain jerks out a little fat flat caricature of a neapolitan and from the opposite side jerks the tall caricature of a sicilian they jerk towards one another and bump into one another with a smack and smack goes the neapolitan down on his posterior and the boys howl with joy it is the eternal collision between the two peoples neapolitan and sicilian now goes on a lot of fooling between the two clowns in the two dialects alas i can hardly understand anything at all but it sounds comic and looks very funny the neapolitan of course gets most of the knocks and there seems to be no indecency at allunless oncethe boys howl and rock with joy and no one says silenzio  but it is over all is over the theatre empties in a moment and i shake hands with my fat neighbour affectionately and in the right spirit truly i loved them all in the theatre the generous hot southern blood so subtle and spontaneous that asks for blood contact not for mental communion or spirit sympathy i was sorry to leave them
