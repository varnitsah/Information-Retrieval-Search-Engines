from the dairy of george iv       epistles to the literati      memoirs of mr charles j yellowplush     miss shums husband    chapter i   i was born in the year one of the present or christian hera and am in consquints sevenandthirty years old my mamma called me charles james harrington fitzroy yellowplush in compliment to several noble families and to a sellybrated coachmin whom she knew who wore a yellow livry and drove the lord mayor of london  why she gev me this genlmns name is a diffiklty or rayther the name of a part of his dress however its stuck to me through life in which i was as it were a footman by buth  praps he was my fatherthough on this subjict i cant speak suttinly for my ma wrapped up my buth in a mistry i may be illygitmit i may have been changed at nuss but ive always had genlmnly tastes through life and have no doubt that i come of a genlmnly origum  the less i say about my parint the better for the dear old creatur was very good to me and i fear had very little other goodness in her why i cant say but i always passed as her nevyou we led a strange life sometimes ma was dressed in sattn and rooge and sometimes in rags and dutt sometimes i got kisses and sometimes kix sometimes gin and sometimes shampang law bless us how she used to swear at me and cuddle me there we were quarrelling and making up sober and tipsy starving and guttling by turns just as ma got money or spent it but let me draw a vail over the seen and speak of her no moreits sfishant for the public to know that her name was miss montmorency and we lived in the new cut  my poor mother died one morning hevn bless her and i was left alone in this wide wicked wuld without so much money as would buy me a penny roal for my brexfast but there was some amongst our naybors and let me tell you theres more kindness among them poor disrepettable creaturs than in half a dozen lords or barrynets who took pity upon poor sals orfin for they bust out laffin when i called her miss montmorency and gev me bred and shelter im afraid in spite of their kindness that my morrils wouldnt have improved if id stayed long among em but a bennyviolent genlmn saw me and put me to school the academy which i went to was called the free school of saint bartholomews the lessthe young genlmn wore green baize coats yellow leather whatsisnames a tin plate on the left arm and a cap about the size of a muffing i stayed there sicks years from sicks that is to say till my twelth year during three years of witch i distinguished myself not a little in the musicle way for i bloo the bellus of the church horgin and very fine tunes we played too  well its not worth recounting my jewvenile follies what trix we used to play the applewoman and how we put snuff in the old clarks prayerbookmy eye but one day a genlmn entered the schoolroomit was on the very day when i went to subtraxionand asked the master for a young lad for a servant they pitched upon me glad enough and nex day found me sleeping in the sculry close under the sink at mr bagos countryhouse at pentonwille  bago kep a shop in smithfield market and drov a taring good trade in the hoil and italian way ive heard him say that he cleared no less than fifty pounds every year by letting his front room at hanging time his winders looked right opsit newgit and many and many dozen chaps has he seen hanging there laws was laws in the year ten and they screwed chaps nex for nex to nothink but my bisniss was at his countryhouse where i made my first ontray into fashnabl life i was knife errint and stableboy then and ant ashamed to own it for my merrits have raised me to what i amtwo livries forty pound a year maltlicker washin silkstocking and wax candlesnot countin wails which is somethink pretty considerable at our house i can tell you  i didnt stay long here for a suckmstance happened which got me a very different situation a handsome young genlmn who kep a tilbry and a ridin horse at livry wanted a tiger i bid at once for the place and being a neat tidylooking lad he took me bago gave me a character and he my first livry proud enough i was of it as you may fancy  my new master had some business in the city for he went in every morning at ten got out of his tilbry at the citty road and had it waiting for him at six when if it was summer he spanked round into the park and drove one of the neatest turnouts there wery proud i was in a goldlaced hat a drab coat and a red weskit to sit by his side when he drove i already began to ogle the gals in the carridges and to feel that longing for fashionabl life which ive had ever since when he was at the oppera or the play down i went to skittles or to white condick gardens and mr frederic altamonts young man was somebody i warrant to be sure there is very few manservants at pentonwille the poppylation being mostly gals of all work and so though only fourteen i was as much a man down there as if i had been as old as jerusalem  but the most singular thing was that my master who was such a gay chap should live in such a hole he had only a groundfloor in john streeta parlor and a bedroom i slep over the way and only came in with his boots and brexfast of a morning  the house he lodged in belonged to mr and mrs shum they were a poor but proliffic couple who had rented the place for many years and they and their family were squeezed in it pretty tight i can tell you  shum said he had been a hofficer and so he had he had been a subdeputy assistant vicecommissary or some such think and as i heerd afterwards had been obliged to leave on account of his nervousness he was such a coward the fact is that he was considered dangerous to the harmy and sent home  he had married a widow buckmaster who had been a miss slamcoe she was a bristol gal and her father being a bankrup in the tallowchandlering way left in course a pretty little sum of money a thousand pound was settled on her and she was as high and mighty as if it had been a millium  buckmaster died leaving nothink nothink except four ugly daughters by miss slamcoe and her forty pound a year was rayther a narrow income for one of her appytite and pretensions in an unlucky hour for shum she met him he was a widower with a little daughter of three years old a little house at pentonwille and a little income about as big as her own i believe she bullyd the poor creature into marridge and it was agreed that he should let his groundfloor at john street and so add somethink to their means  they married and the widow buckmaster was the gray mare i can tell you she was always talking and blustering about her famly the celebrity of the buckmasters and the antickety of the slamcoes they had a sixroomed house not counting kitching and sculry and now twelve daughters in all whizz4 miss buckmasters miss betsy miss dosy miss biddy and miss winny 1 miss shum mary by name shums daughter and seven others who shall be nameless mrs shum was a fat redhaired woman at least a foot taller than s who was but a yard and a half high palefaced rednosed knockkneed baldheaded his nose and shutfrill all brown with snuff  before the house was a little garden where the washin of the famly was all ways hanging there was so many of em that it was obliged to be done by relays there was six rails and a stocking on each and four small goosbry bushes always covered with some bit of linning or other the hall was a regular puddle wet dabs of dishclouts flapped in your face soapy smoking bits of flanning went nigh to choke you and while you were looking up to prevent hanging yourself with the ropes which were strung across and about slap came the hedge of a pail against your shins till one was like to be drove mad with hagony the great slattnly doddling girls was always on the stairs poking about with nasty flowerpots acooking something or sprawling in the windowseats with greasy curlpapers reading greasy novels an infernal pianna was jingling from morning till nighttwo eldest miss buckmasters battle of pragsix youngest miss shums in my cottage till i knew every note in the battle of prag and cussed the day when in my cottage was rote the younger girls too were always bouncing and thumping about the house with torn pinnyfores and dogseard grammars and large pieces of bread and treacle i never see such a house  as for mrs shum she was such a fine lady that she did nothink but lay on the drawingroom sophy read novels drink scold scream and go into hystarrix little shum kep reading an old newspaper from weeks end to weeks end when he was not engaged in teaching the children or goin for the beer or cleanin the shoes for they kep no servant this house in john street was in short a regular pandymony  what could have brought mr frederic altamont to dwell in such a place the reason is hobvius he adoared the fust miss shum  and suttnly he did not show a bad taste for though the other daughters were as ugly as their hideous ma mary shum was a pretty little pink modest creatur with glossy black hair and tender blue eyes and a neck as white as plaster of parish she wore a dismal old black gownd which had grown too short for her and too tight but it only served to show her pretty angles and feet and bewchus figger master though he had looked rather low for the gal of his art had certainly looked in the right place never was one more pretty or more hamiable i gav her always the buttered toast left from our brexfust and a cup of tea or chocklate as altamont might fancy and the poor thing was glad enough of it i can vouch for they had precious short commons up stairs and she the least of all  for it seemed as if which of the shum famly should try to snub the poor thing most there was the four buckmaster girls always at her it was mary git the coalskittle mary run down to the publichouse for the beer mary i intend to wear your clean stockens out walking or your new bonnet to church only her poor father was kind to her and he poor old muff his kindness was of no use mary bore all the scolding like a hangel as she was no not if she had a pair of wings and a goold trumpet could she have been a greater hangel  i never shall forgit one seen that took place it was when master was in the city and so having nothink earthly to do i happened to be listening on the stairs the old scolding was agoing on and the old tune of that hojus battle of prag old shum made some remark and miss buckmaster cried out law pa what a fool you are all the gals began laffin and so did mrs shum all that is excep mary who turned as red as flams and going up to miss betsy buckmaster give her two such wax on her great red ears as made them tingle again  old mrs shum screamed and ran at her like a bengal tiger her great arms vent veeling about like a vinmill as she cuffed and thumped poor mary for taking her pas part mary shum who was always acrying before didnt shed a tear now i will do it again she said if betsy insults my father new thumps new shreex and the old horridan went on beatin the poor girl till she was quite exosted and fell down on the sophy puffin like a poppus  for shame mary began old shum for shame you naughty gal you for hurting the feelings of your dear mamma and beating your kind sister  why it was because she called you a  if she did you pert miss said shum looking mighty dignitified i could correct her and not you  you correct me indeed said miss betsy turning up her nose if possible higher than before i should like to see you erect me imperence and they all began laffin again  by this time mrs s had recovered from the effex of her exsize and she began to pour in her wolly fust she called mary names then shum  oh why screeched she why did i ever leave a genteel famly where i ad every ellygance and lucksry to marry a creatur like this he is unfit to be called a man he is unworthy to marry a gentlewoman and as for that hussy i disown her thank heaven she ant a slamcoe she is only fit to be a shum  thats true mamma said all the gals for their mother had taught them this pretty piece of manners and they despised their father heartily indeed i have always remarked that in famlies where the wife is internally talking about the merits of her branch the husband is invariably a spooney  well when she was exosted again down she fell on the sofy at her old trixmore screechingmore convulshuns and she wouldnt stop this time till shum had got her half a pint of her old remedy from the blue lion over the way she grew more easy as she finished the gin but mary was sent out of the room and told not to come back agin all day  miss mary says ifor my heart yurned to the poor gal as she came sobbing and miserable down stairs miss mary says i if i might make so bold heres masters room empty and i know where the cold bif and pickles is oh charles said she nodding her head sadly im too retched to have any happytite and she flung herself on a chair and began to cry fit to bust  at this moment who should come in but my master i had taken hold of miss marys hand somehow and do believe i should have kist it when as i said haltamont made his appearance whats this cries he lookin at me as black as thunder or as mr phillips as hickit in the new tragedy of macbuff  its only miss mary sir answered i  get out sir says he as fierce as posbil and i felt somethink i think it was the tip of his to touching me behind and found myself nex minit sprawling among the wet flannings and buckets and things  the people from up stairs came to see what was the matter as i was cussin and crying out its only charles ma screamed out miss betsy  wheres mary says mrs shum from the sofy  shes in masters room miss said i  shes in the lodgers room ma cries miss shum heckoing me  very good tell her to stay there till he comes back and then miss shum went bouncing up the stairs again little knowing of haltamonts return                                  id long before observed that my master had an anchoring after mary shum indeed as i have said it was purely for her sake that he took and kep his lodgings at pentonwille excep for the sake of love which is above being mersnary fourteen shillings a wick was a little too strong for two such ratholes as he lived in i do blieve the famly had nothing else but their lodger to live on they brekfisted off his tealeaves they cut away pounds and pounds of meat from his jints he always dined at home and his bakers bill was at least enough for six but that wasnt my business i saw him grin sometimes when i laid down the cold bif of a morning to see how little was left of yesterdays sirline but he never said a syllabub for true love dont mind a pound of meat or so hextra  at first he was very kind and attentive to all the gals miss betsy in partickler grew mighty fond of him they sat for whole evenings playing cribbitch he taking his pipe and glas she her tea and muffing but as it was improper for her to come alone she brought one of her sisters and this was genrally maryfor he made a pint of asking her tooand one day when one of the others came instead he told her very quitely that he hadnt invited her and miss buckmaster was too fond of muffings to try this game on again besides she was jealous of her three grown sisters and considered mary as only a child law bless us how she used to ogle him and quot bits of pottry and play meet me by moonlike on an old gitter she reglar flung herself at his head but he wouldnt have it bein better ockypied elsewhere  one night as genteel as possible he brought home tickets for ashleys and proposed to take the two young ladiesmiss betsy and miss mary in course i recklect he called me aside that afternoon assuming a solamon and misterus hare charles said he are you up to snuff  why sir said i im genrally considered tolerably downy  well says he ill give you half a suffering if you can manage this bisness for me ive chose a rainy night on purpus when the theatre is over you must be waitin with two umbrellows give me one and hold the other over miss buckmaster and hark ye sir turn to the right when you leave the theater and say the coach is ordered to stand a little way up the street in order to get rid of the crowd  we went in a fly hired by mr a and never shall i forgit cartliches hacting on that memrable night talk of kimble talk of magreedy ashleys for my money with cartlitch in the principal part but this is nothink to the porpus when the play was over i was at the door with the umbrellos it was raining cats and dogs sure enough  mr altamont came out presently miss mary under his arm and miss betsy following behind rayther sulky this way sir cries i pushin forward and i threw a great cloak over miss betsy fit to smother her mr a and miss mary skipped on and was out of sight when miss betsys cloak was settled you may be sure  theyre only gone to the fly miss its a little way up the street away from the crowd of carridges and off we turned to the right and no mistake  after marchin a little through the plash and mud has anybody seen coxys fly cries i with the most innocent haxent in the world  coxs fly hollows out one chap is it the vaggin you want says another i see the blackin wan pass giggles out another gentlmn and there was such a hinterchange of compliments as you never heerd i pass them over though because some of em were not wery genteel  law miss said i what shall i do my master will never forgive me and i havent a single sixpence to pay a coach miss betsy was just going to call one when i said that but the coachman wouldnt have it at that price he said and i knew very well that she hadnt four or five shillings to pay for a wehicle so in the midst of that tarin rain at midnight we had to walk four miles from westminster bridge to pentonwille and what was wuss i didnt happen to know the way a very nice walk it was and no mistake  at about halfpast two we got safe to john street my master was at the garden gate miss mary flew into miss betsys arms while master begun cussin and swearing at me for disobeying his orders and turning to the right instead of to the left law bless me his hacting of hanger was very near as natral and as terrybl as mr cartlichs in the play  they had waited half an hour he said in the fly in the little street at the left of the theater they had drove up and down in the greatest fright possible and at last came home thinking it was in vain to wait any more they gave her ot rumandwater and roast oysters for supper and this consoled her a little  i hope nobody will cast an imputation on miss mary for her share in this adventer for she was as honest a gal as ever lived and i do believe is hignorant to this day of our little strattygim besides alls fair in love and as my master could never get to see her alone on account of her infernal eleven sisters and ma he took this opportunity of expressin his attachment to her  if he was in love with her before you may be sure she paid it him back again now ever after the night at ashleys they were as tender as two tuttledoveswhich fully accounts for the axdent what happened to me in being kicked out of the room and in course i bore no mallis  i dont know whether miss betsy still fancied that my master was in love with her but she loved muffings and tea and kem down to his parlor as much as ever  now comes the singlar part of my history    chapter ii   but who was this genlmn with a fine namemr frederic altamont or what was he the most mysterus genlmn that ever i knew once i said to him on a wery rainy day sir shall i bring the gig down to your office and he gave me one of his black looks and one of his loudest hoaths and told me to mind my own bizziness and attend to my orders another dayit was on the day when miss mary slapped miss betsys facemiss m who adoared him as i have said already kep on asking him what was his buth parentidg and ediccation dear frederic says she why this mistry about yourself and your hactions why hide from your little marythey were as tender as this i can tell youyour buth and your professin  i spose mr frederic looked black for i was only listening and he said in a voice hagitated by emotion mary said he if you love me ask me this no more let it be sfishnt for you to know that i am a honest man and that a secret what it would be misery for you to larn must hang over all my actionsthat is from ten oclock till six  they went on chaffin and talking in this melumcolly and mysterus way and i didnt lose a word of what they said for them houses in pentonwille have only walls made of pasteboard and you hear rayther better outside the room than in but though he kep up his secret he swore to her his affektion this day pint blank nothing should prevent him he said from leading her to the halter from makin her his adoarable wife after this was a slight silence dearest frederic mummered out miss speakin as if she was chokin i am yoursyours for ever and then silence agen and one or two smax as if there was kissin going on here i thought it best to give a rattle at the doorlock for as i live there was old mrs shum awalkin down the stairs  it appears that one of the younger gals alooking out of the bedrum window had seen my master come in and coming down to tea half an hour afterwards said so in a cussary way old mrs shum who was a dragon of vertyou cam bustling down the stairs panting and frowning as fat and as fierce as a old sow at feedin time  wheres the lodger fellow says she to me  i spoke loud enough to be heard down the streetif you mean maam my master mr frederic altamont esquire hes just stept in and is puttin on clean shoes in his bedroom  she said nothink in answer but flumps past me and opening the parlordoor sees master looking very queer and miss mary adrooping down her head like a pale lily  did you come into my famly says she to corrupt my daughters and to destroy the hinnocence of that infamous gal did you come here sir as a seducer or only as a lodger speak sir speakand she folded her arms quite fierce and looked like mrs siddums in the tragic mews  i came here mrs shum said he because i loved your daughter or i never would have condescended to live in such a beggarly hole i have treated her in every respect like a genlmn and she is as innocent now mam as she was when she was born if shell marry me i am ready if shell leave you she shall have a home where she shall be neither bullyd nor starved no hangry frumps of sisters no cross motherinlaw only an affeckshnat husband and all the pure pleasures of hyming  mary flung herself into his armsdear dear frederic says she ill never leave you  miss says mrs shum you aint a slamcoe nor yet a buckmaster thank god you may marry this person if your pa thinks proper and he may insult mebrave metrample on my feelinx in my own houseand theres noooobody by to defend me  i knew what she was going to be at on came her histarrix agen and she began screechin and roaring like mad down comes of course the eleven gals and old shum there was a pretty row look here sir says she at the conduck of your precious trull of a daughteralone with this man kissin and dandlin and lawd knows what besides  what he cries miss betsyhe in love with mary oh the wretch the monster the deceiverand she falls down too screeching away as loud as her mamma for the silly creature fancied still that altamont had a fondness for her  silence these women shouts out altamont thundering loud i love your daughter mr shum i will take her without a penny and can afford to keep her if you dont give her to me shell come of her own will is that enoughmay i have her  well talk of this matter sir says mr shum looking as high and mighty as an alderman gals go up stairs with your dear mammaand they all trooped up again and so the skrimmage ended  you may be sure that old shum was not very sorry to get a husband for his daughter mary for the old creatur loved her better than all the pack which had been brought him or born to him by mrs buckmaster but strange to say when he came to talk of settlements and so forth not a word would my master answer he said he made four hundred a year reglarhe wouldnt tell howbut mary if she married him must share all that he had and ask no questions only this he would say as hed said before that he was a honest man  they were married in a few days and took a very genteel house at islington but still my master went away to business and nobody knew where who could he be    chapter iii   if ever a young kipple in the middlin classes began life with a chance of happiness it was mr and mrs frederic altamont there house at cannon row islington was as comfortable as house could be carpited from top to to pores rates small furnitur elygant and three deomestix of which i in course was one my life wasnt so easy as in mr as bachelor days but what then the three ws is my maxum plenty of work plenty of wittles and plenty of wages altamont kep his gig no longer but went to the city in an omlibuster  one would have thought i say that mrs a with such an effeckshnut husband might have been as happy as her blessid majisty nothing of the sort for the fust six months it was all very well but then she grew gloomier and gloomier though a did everythink in life to please her  old shum used to come reglarly four times a wick to cannon row where he lunched and dined and teed and supd the pore little man was a thought too fond of wine and spirits and many and manys the night that ive had to support him home and you may be sure that miss betsy did not now desert her sister she was at our place mornink noon and night not much to my maysters liking though he was too goodnatured to wex his wife in trifles  but betsy never had forgotten the recollection of old days and hated altamont like the foul feind she put all kind of bad things into the head of poor innocent missis who from being all gayety and cheerfulness grew to be quite melumcolly and pale and retchid just as if she had been the most misrable woman in the world  in three months more a baby comes in course and with it old mrs shum who stuck to mrs side as close as a wampire and made her retchider and retchider she used to bust into tears when altamont came home she used to sigh and wheep over the pore child and say my child my child your father is false to me or your father deceives me or what will you do when your pore mother is no more or such like sentimental stuff  it all came from mother shum and her old trix as i soon found out the fact is when there is a mistry of this kind in the house its a servants duty to listen and listen i did one day when mrs was cryin as usual and fat mrs shum a sittin consolin her as she called it though heaven knows she only grew wuss and wuss for the consolation  well i listened mrs shum was arockin the baby and missis cryin as yousual  pore dear innocint says mrs s heavin a great sigh youre the child of a unknown father and a misrable mother  dont speak ill of frederic mamma says missis he is all kindness to me  all kindness indeed yes he gives you a fine house and a fine gownd and a ride in a fly whenever you please but where does all his money come from who is hewhat is he who knows that he maynt be a murderer or a housebreaker or a utterer of forged notes how can he make his money honestly when he wont say where he gets it why does he leave you eight hours every blessid day and wont say where he goes to oh mary mary you are the most injured of women  and with this mrs shum began sobbin and miss betsy began yowling like a cat in a gitter and pore missis cried tootears is so remarkable infeckshus  perhaps mamma wimpered out she frederic is a shopboy and dont like me to know that he is not a gentleman  a shopboy says betsy he a shopboy o no no no more likely a wretched willain of a murderer stabbin and robing all day and feedin you with the fruits of his illgotten games  more crying and screechin here took place in which the baby joined and made a very pretty consort i can tell you  he cant be a robber cries missis hes too good too kind for that besides murdering is done at night and frederic is always home at eight  but he can be a forger says betsy a wicked wicked forger why does he go away every day to forge notes to be sure why does he go to the city to be near banks and places and so do it more at his convenience  but he brings home a sum of money every dayabout thirty shillingssometimes fifty and then he smiles and says its a good days work this is not like a forger said pore mrs a  i have iti have it screams out mrs s the villainthe sneaking doublefaced jonas hes married to somebody else he is and thats why he leaves you the base biggymist  at this mrs altamont struck all of a heap fainted clean away a dreadful business it washystarrix then hystarrix in course from mrs shum bells ringin child squalin suvvants tearin up and down stairs with hot water if ever there is a noosance in the world its a house where faintain is always goin on i wouldnt live in oneno not to be groom of the chambers and git two hundred a year  it was eight oclock in the evenin when this row took place and such a row it was that nobody but me heard masters knock he came in and heard the hooping and screeching and roaring he seemed very much frightened at first and said what is it  mrs shums here says i and mrs in astarrix  altamont looked as black as thunder and growled out a word which i dont like to namelet it suffice that it begins with a d and ends with a nation and he tore up stairs like mad  he bust open the bedroom door missis lay quite pale and stony on the sofy the babby was screechin from the craddle miss betsy was sprawlin over missis and mrs shum half on the bed and half on the ground all howlin and squeelin like so many dogs at the moond  when a came in the mother and daughter stopped all of a sudding there had been one or two tiffs before between them and they feared him as if he had been a hogre  whats this infernal screeching and crying about says he oh mr altamont cries the old woman you know too well its about you that this darling child is misrabble  and why about me pray madam  why sir dare you ask why because you deceive her sir because you are a false cowardly traitor sir because you have a wife elsewhere sir and the old lady and miss betsy began to roar again as loud as ever  altamont pawsed for a minnit and then flung the door wide open nex he seized miss betsy as if his hand were a vice and he world her out of the room then up he goes to mrs s get up says he thundering loud you lazy trolloping mischsefmaking lying old fool get up and get out of this house you have been the cuss and bain of my happyniss since you entered it with your dd lies and novvle rending and histerrix you have perwerted mary and made her almost as mad as yourself  my child my child shriex out mrs shum and clings round missis but altamont ran between them and griping the old lady by her arm dragged her to the door follow your daughter mam says he and down she went chawls see those ladies to the door he hollows out and never let them pass it again we walked down together and off they went and master locked and doublelocked the bedroom door after him intendin of course to have a tatortator as they say with his wife you may be sure that i followed up stairs again pretty quick to hear the result of their confidence  as they say at st stevenses it was rayther a stormy debate mary says master youre no longer the merry greatful gal i knew and loved at pentonwill theres some secret a pressin on youtheres no smilin welcom for me now as there used formly to be your mother and sisterinlaw have perwerted you mary and thats why ive drove them from this house which they shall not reenter in my life  o frederic its you is the cause and not i why do you have any mistry from me where do you spend your days why did you leave me even on the day of your marridge for eight hours and continue to do so every day  because says he i makes my livelihood by it i leave you and dont tell you how i make it for it would make you none the happier to know  it was in this way the convysation ren onmore tears and questions on my missises part more sturmness and silence on my masters it ended for the first time since their marridge in a reglar quarrel wery difrent i can tell you from all the hammerous billing and kewing which had proceeded their nupshuls  master went out slamming the door in a fury as well he might says he if i cant have a comforable life i can have a jolly one and so he went off to the hed tavern and came home that evening beesly intawsicated when high words begin in a family drink generally follows on the genlmans side and then fearwell to all conjubial happyniss these two pipple so fond and loving were now sirly silent and full of il wil master went out earlier and came home later missis cried more and looked even paler than before  well things went on in this uncomfortable way master still in the mopes missis tempted by the deamons of jellosy and curosity until a singlar axident brought to light all the goings on of mr altamont  it was the tenth of january i recklect the day for old shum gev me half a crownd the fust and last of his money i ever see by the way he was dining along with master and they were making merry together  master said as he was mixing his fifth tumler of punch and little shum his twelfth or somaster said i see you twice in the city today mr shum  well thats curous says shum i was in the city todays the day when the divvydins god bless em is paid and me and mrs s went for our halfyears inkem but we only got out of the coach crossed the street to the bank took our money and got in agen how could you see me twice  altamont stuttered and stammered and hemd and hawd o says he i was passingpassing as you went in and out and he instantly turned the conversation and began talking about pollytix or the weather or some such stuff  yes my dear said my missis but how could you see papa twice master didnt answer but talked pollytix more than ever still she would continy on where was you my dear when you saw pa what were you doing my love to see pa twice and so forth master looked angrier and angrier and his wife only pressed him wuss and wuss  this was as i said little shums twelfth tumler and i knew pritty well that he could git very little further for as reglar as the thirteenth came shum was drunk the thirteenth did come and its consquinzes i was obliged to leed him home to john street where i left him in the hangry arms of mrs shum  how the d sayd he all the way how the dddthe deddydeddydevilcould he have seen me twice    chapter iv   it was a sad slip on altamonts part for no sooner did he go out the next morning than missis went out too she tor down the street and never stopped till she came to her pas house at pentonwill she was clositid for an hour with her ma and when she left her she drove straight to the city she walked before the bank and behind the bank and round the bank she came home disperryted having learned nothink  and it was now an extraordinary thing that from shums house for the next ten days there was nothing but expyditions into the city mrs s tho her dropsicle legs had never carred her half so fur before was eternally on the key veve as the french say if she didnt go miss betsy did or misses did they seemed to have an attrackshun to the bank and went there as natral as an omlibus  at last one day old mrs shum comes to our houseshe wasnt admitted when master was there but came still in his absintsand she wore a hair of tryumph as she entered mary says she where is the money your husbind brought to you yesterday my master used always to give it to missis when he returned  the money ma says mary why here and pulling out her puss she showed a sovrin a good heap of silver and an oddlooking little coin  thats it thats it cried mrs s a queene annes sixpence isnt it deardated seventeen hundred and three  it was so sure enough a queen ans sixpence of that very date  now my love says she i have found him come with me tomorrow and you shall know all  and now comes the end of my story                                  the ladies nex morning set out for the city and i walked behind doing the genteel thing with a nosegy and a goold stick we walked down the new roadwe walked down the city roadwe walked to the bank we were crossing from that heddyfiz to the other side of cornhill when all of a sudden missis shreeked and fainted spontaceously away  i rushed forrard and raised her to my arms spiling thereby a new weskit and a pair of crimson smalcloes i rushed forrard i say very nearly knocking down the old sweeper who was hobbling away as fast as posibil we took her to birchs we provided her with a hackneycoach and every lucksury and carried her home to islington                                  that night master never came home nor the nex night nor the nex on the fourth day an octioneer arrived he took an infantry of the furnitur and placed a bill in the window  at the end of the wick altamont made his appearance he was haggard and pale not so haggard however not so pale as his miserable wife  he looked at her very tendrilly i may say its from him that i coppied my look to miss  he looked at her very tendrilly and held out his arms she gev a suffycating shreek and rusht into his umbraces  mary says he you know all now i have sold my place i have got three thousand pounds for it and saved two more ive sold my house and furnitur and that brings me another well go abroad and love each other has formly  and now you ask me who he was i shudder to relatemr haltamont swep the crossing from the bank to cornhill  of cors i left his servis i met him few years after at baddenbadden where he and mrs a were much respectid and pass for pipple of propaty     the amours of mr deuceace   dimond cut dimond   the name of my nex master was if posbil still more ellygant and youfonious than that of my fust i now found myself boddy servant to the honrabble halgernon percy deuceace youngest and fifth son of the earl of crabs  halgernon was a barrystirthat is he lived in pump cort temple a wulgar naybrood witch praps my readers dont no suffiz to say its on the confines of the citty and the choasen aboad of the lawyers of this metrappolish  when i say that mr deuceace was a barrystir i dont mean that he went sesshums or surcoats as they call em but simply that he kep chambers lived in pump cort and looked out for a commitionarship or a revisinship or any other place that the wig guvvyment could give him his father was a wig pier as the landriss told me and had been a toary pier the fack is his lordship was so poar that he would be anythink or nothink to get provisions for his sons and an inkum for himself  i phansy that he aloud halgernon two hundred a year and it would have been a very comforable maintenants only he knever paid him  owever the young genlmn was a genlmn and no mistake he got his allowents of nothing a year and spent it in the most honrabble and fashnabble manner he kep a kabhe went to holmaxand crockfudshe moved in the most xquizzit suckles and trubbld the law boox very little i can tell you those fashnabble gents have ways of getten money witch comman pipple doant understand  though he only had a therd floar in pump cort he lived as if he had the welth of cresas the tenpun notes floo abowt as common as haypinceclarrit and shampang was at his house as vulgar as gin and verry glad i was to be sure to be a valley to a zion of the nobillaty  deuceace had in his sittinroom a large pictur on a sheet of paper the names of his family was wrote on it it was wrote in the shape of a tree agroin out of a maninarmers stomick and the names were on little plates among the bows the pictur said that the deuceaces kem into england in the year 1066 along with william conqueruns my master called it his podygree i do bleev it was because he had this pictur and because he was the honrabble deuceace that he mannitched to live as he did if he had been a common man youd have said he was no better than a swinler its only rank and buth that can warrant such singularities as my master showd for its no use disgysing itthe honrabble halgernon was a gambler for a man of wulgar family its the wust trade that can befor a man of common feelinx of honesty this profession is quite imposbil but for a real thoroughbread genlmn its the esiest and most prophetable line he can take  it may praps appear curious that such a fashnabble man should live in the temple but it must be recklected that its not only lawyers who live in whats called the ins of cort many batchylers who have nothink to do with lor have here their loginx and many sham barrysters who never put on a wig and gownd twise in their lives kip apartments in the temple instead of bon street pickledilly or other fashnabble places  frinstance on our stairkis so these houses are called there was 8 sets of chamberses and only 3 lawyers these was bottom floar screwson hewson and jewson attorneys fust floar mr sergeant flabberopsite mr counslor bruffy and secknd pair mr haggerstony an irish counslor praktising at the old baly and lickwise what they call reporter to the morning post nyouspapper opsite him was wrote             mr richard blewitt   and on the thud floar with my master lived one mr dawkins  this young fellow was a new comer into the temple and unlucky it was for him toohed better have never been born for its my firm apinion that the temple ruined himthat is with the help of my master and mr dick blewitt as you shall hear  mr dawkins as i was gave to understand by his young man had just left the universary of oxford and had a pretty little fortn of his ownsix thousand pound or soin the stox he was jest of age an orfin who had lost his father and mother and having distinkwished hisself at collitch where he gained seffral prices was come to town to push his fortn and study the barrysters bisness  not bein of a very high fammly hisselfindeed ive heard say his father was a chismonger or somethink of that lo sortdawkins was glad to find his old oxford frend mr blewitt yonger son to rich squire blewitt of listershire and to take rooms so near him  now tho there was a considdrable intimacy between me and mr blewitts gentleman there was scarcely any betwixt our mastersmine being too much of the aristoxy to associate with one of mr blewitts sort blewitt was what they call a bettin man he went reglar to tattlesalls kep a pony wore a white hat a blue berdseye handkercher and a cutaway coat in his manners he was the very contrary of my master who was a slim ellygant man as ever i seehe had very white hands rayther a sallow face with sharp dark ise and small wiskus neatly trimmed and as black as warrens jethe spoke very low and softhe seemed to be watchin the person with whom he was in convysation and always flatterd everybody as for blewitt he was quite of another sort he was always swearin singing and slappin people on the back as hearty as posbill he seemed a merry careless honest cretur whom one would trust with life and soul so thought dawkins at least who though a quiet young man fond of his boox novvles byrons poems footplaying and such like scientafic amusemints grew hand in glove with honest dick blewitt and soon after with my master the honrabble halgernon poor daw he thought he was makin good connexions and real frendshe had fallen in with a couple of the most etrocious swinlers that ever lived  before mr dawkinss arrivial in our house mr deuceace had barely condysended to speak to mr blewitt it was only about a month after that suckumstance that my master all of a sudding grew very friendly with him the reason was pretty cleardeuceace wanted him dawkins had not been an hour in masters company before he knew that he had a pidgin to pluck  blewitt knew this too and bein very fond of pidgin intended to keep this one entirely to himself it was amusin to see the honrabble halgernon manuvring to get this poor bird out of blewitts clause who thought he had it safe in fact hed brought dawkins to these chambers for that very porpos thinking to have him under his eye and strip him at leisure  my master very soon found out what was mr blewitts game gamblers know gamblers if not by instink at least by reputation and though mr blewitt moved in a much lower speare than mr deuceace they knew each others dealins and caracters puffickly well  charles you scoundrel says deuceace to me one day he always spoak in that kind way who is this person that has taken the opsit chambers and plays the flute so industrusly  its mr dawkins a rich young gentleman from oxford and a great friend of mr blewittses sir says i they seem to live in each others rooms  master said nothink but he grindmy eye how he did grin not the fowl find himself could snear more satannickly  i knew what he meant  imprimish a man who plays the floot is a simpleton  secknly mr blewitt is a raskle  thirdmo when a raskle and a simpleton is always together and when the simpleton is rich one knows pretty well what will come of it  i was but a lad in them days but i knew what was what as well as my master its not gentlemen only thats up to snough law bless us there was four of us on this stairkes four as nice young men as you ever see mr bruffys young man mr dawkinses mr blewitts and meand we knew what our masters was about as well as thay did theirselfs frinstance i can say this for myself there wasnt a paper in deuceaces desk or drawer not a bill a note or mimerandum which i hadnt read as well as he with blewitts it was the sameme and his young man used to read em all there wasnt a bottle of wine that we didnt get a glass out of nor a pound of sugar that we didnt have some lumps of it we had keys to all the cubbardswe pipped into all the letters that kem and wentwe pored over all the billfileswed the best pickens out of the dinners the livvers of the fowls the forcemit balls out of the soup the egs from the sallit as for the coals and candles we left them to the landrisses you may call this robrynonsinceits only our rightsa suvvants purquizzits is as sacred as the laws of hengland  well the long and short of it is this richard blewitt esquire was sityouated as follows hed an incum of three hundred a year from his father out of this he had to pay one hundred and ninety for money borrowed by him at collidge seventy for chambers seventy more for his hoss aty for his suvvant on bord wagis and about three hundred and fifty for a sepparat establishment in the regency park besides this his pockitmoney say a hunderd his eatin drinkin and winemarchants bill about two hunderd moar so that you see he laid by a pretty handsome sum at the end of the year  my master was diffrent and being a more fashnable man than mr b in course he owed a deal more mony there was fust        account contray at crockfords        l 3711  0  0      bills of xchange and i o us but he         didnt pay these in most cases       4963  0  0      21 tailors bills in all                1306 11  9      3 hossdealers do                         402  0  0

owes is somethink instructif and agreeable  but to my tail the very day after my master had made the inquiries concerning mr dawkins witch i mentioned already he met mr blewitt on the stairs and byoutiffle it was to see how this gnlmn who had before been almost cut by my master was now received by him one of the sweetest smiles i ever saw was now vizzable on mr deuceaces countenance he held out his hand covered with a white kid glove and said in the most frenly tone of vice posbill what mr blewitt it is an age since we met what a shame that such near naybors should see each other so seldom  mr blewitt who was standing at his door in a pegreen dressinggown smoakin a segar and singing a hunting coarus looked surprised flattered and then suspicious  why yes says he it is mr deuceace a long time  not i think since we dined at sir george hookeys bytheby what an evening that washay mr blewitt what wine what capital songs i recollect your mayday in the morningcuss me the best comick song i ever heard i was speaking to the duke of doncaster about it only yesterday you know the duke i think  mr blewitt said quite surly no i dont  not know him cries master why hang it blewitt he knows you as every sporting man in england does i should think why man your good things are in everybodys mouth at newmarket  and so master went on chaffin mr blewitt that genlmn at fust answered him quite short and angry but after a little more flummery he grew as pleased as posbill took in all deuceaces flatry and bleeved all his lies at last the door shut and they both went into mr blewitts chambers together  of course i cant say what past there but in an hour master kem up to his own room as yaller as mustard and smellin sadly of backo smoke i never see any genmln more sick than he was hed been smoakin seagars along with blewitt i said nothink in course tho id often heard him xpress his horrow of backo and knew very well he would as soon swallow pizon as smoke but he wasnt a chap to do a thing without a reason if hed been smoakin i warrant he had smoked to some porpus  i didnt hear the convysation betwean em but mr blewitts man did it waswell mr blewitt what capital seagars have you one for a friend to smoak the old fox it wasnt only the seagars he was asmoakin walk in says mr blewitt and they began a chaffin together master very ankshous about the young gintleman who had come to live in our chambers mr dawkins and always coming back to that subjectsaying that people on the same stairkis ot to be frenly how glad hed be for his part to know mr dick blewitt and any friend of his and so on mr dick howsever seamed quite aware of the trap laid for him i really dont know this dawkins says he hes a chismongers son i hear and tho ive exchanged visits with him i doant intend to continyou the acquaintancenot wishin to assoshate with that kind of pipple so they went on master fishin and mr blewitt not wishin to take the hook at no price  confound the vulgar thief muttard my master as he was laying on his sophy after being so very ill ive poisoned myself with his infernal tobacco and he has foiled me the cursed swindling boor he thinks hell ruin this poor cheesemonger does he ill step in and warn him  i thought i should bust alaffin when he talked in this style i knew very well what his warning meantlockin the stabledoor but stealin the hoss fust  next day his strattygam for becoming acquainted with mr dawkins we exicuted and very pritty it was  besides potry and the flute mr dawkins i must tell you had some other parshallitieswiz he was very fond of good eatin and drinkin after doddling over his music and boox all day this young genlmn used to sally out of evenings dine sumptiously at a tavern drinkin all sorts of wine along with his friend mr blewitt he was a quiet young fellow enough at fust but it was mr b who for his own porpuses no doubt had got him into this kind of life well i neednt say that he who eats a fine dinner and drinks too much overnight wants a bottle of sodawater and a gril praps in the morning such was mr dawkinses case and reglar almost as twelve oclock came the waiter from dix coffyhouse was to be seen on our stairkis bringing up mr ds hot breakfast  no man would have thought there was anythink in such a trifling cirkumstance master did though and pounced upon it like a cock on a barlycorn  he sent me out to mr morells in pickledilly for wots called a strasbugpiein french a patty defau graw he takes a card and nails it on the outside case patty defaw graws come generally in a round wooden box like a drumb and what do you think he writes on it why as follosfor the honorable algernon percy deuceace c c c with prince talleyrands compliments  prince tallyrams complimints indeed i laff when i think of it still the old surpint he was a surpint that deuceace and no mistake  well by a most extrornary piece of illluck the nex day punctially as mr dawkinses brexfas was coming up the stairs mr halgernon percy deuceace was going down he was as gay as a lark humming an oppra tune and twizzting round his head his hevy goldheaded cane down he went very fast and by a most unlucky axdent struck his cane against the waiters tray and away went mr dawkinses gril kayann kitchup sodawater and all i cant think how my master should have choas such an exact time to be sure his windo looked upon the court and he could see every one who came into our door  as soon as the axdent had took place master was in such a rage as to be sure no man ever was in befor he swoar at the waiter in the most dreddfle way he threatened him with his stick and it was only when he see that the waiter was rayther a bigger man than hisself that he was in the least pazzyfied he returned to his own chambres and john the waiter went off for more gril to dixes coffyhouse  this is a most unlucky axdent to be sure charles says master to me after a few minits paws during witch he had been and wrote a note put it into an anvelope and sealed it with his big seal of arms but staya thought strikes metake this note to mr dawkins and that pye you brought yesterday and hearkye you scoundrel if you say where you got it i will break every bone in your skin  these kind of promises were among the few which i knew him to keep and as i loved boath my skinn and my boans i carried the noat and of cors said nothink waiting in mr dawkinses chambus for a few minnits i returned to my master with an anser i may as well give both of these documence of which i happen to have taken coppies                             i        the hon a p deuceace to t s dawkins esq                                              temple tuesday    mr deuceace presents his compliments to mr dawkins and begs at   the same time to offer his most sincere apologies and regrets for   the accident which has just taken place    may mr deuceace be allowed to take a neighbors privilege and to   remedy the evil he has occasioned to the best of his power if mr   dawkins will do him the favor to partake of the contents of the   accompanying case from strasbourg direct and the gift of a   friend on whose taste as a gourmand mr dawkins may rely perhaps   he will find that it is not a bad substitute for the plat which mr   deuceaces awkwardness destroyed    it will also mr deuceace is sure be no small gratification to   the original donor of the pate when he learns that it has fallen   into the hands of so celebrated a bon vivant as mr dawkins    t s dawkins esq c c c                              ii    from t s dawkins esq to the hon a p deuceace    mr thomas smith dawkins presents his grateful compliments to the   hon mr deuceace and accepts with the greatest pleasure mr   deuceaces generous proffer    it would be one of the happiest moments of mr smith dawkinss   life if the hon mr deuceace would extend his generosity still   further and condescend to partake of the repast which his   munificent politeness has furnished    temple tuesday   many and many a time i say have i grind over these letters which i had wrote from the original by mr bruffys copyin clark deuceaces flam about prince tallyram was puffickly successful i saw young dawkins blush with delite as he red the note he toar up for or five sheets before he composed the answer to it which was as you red abuff and roat in a hand quite trembling with pleasyer if you could but have seen the look of triumph in deuceaces wicked black eyes when he read the noat i never see a deamin yet but i can phansy 1 a holding a writhing soal on his pitchfrock and smilin like deuceace he dressed himself in his very best clothes and in he went after sending me over to say that he would except with pleasyour mr dawkinss invite  the pie was cut up and a most frenly conversation begun betwixt the two genlmin deuceace was quite captivating he spoke to mr dawkins in the most respeckful and flatrin manneragread in every think he saidprazed his taste his furniter his coat his classick nolledge and his playin on the floot youd have thought to hear him that such a polygon of exlens as dawkins did not breaththat such a modist sinsear honrabble genlmn as deuceace was to be seen nowhere xcept in pump cort poor daw was complitly taken in my master said hed introduce him to the duke of doncaster and heaven knows how many nobs more till dawkins was quite intawsicated with pleasyour i know as a fac and it pretty well shows the young genlmns carryter that he went that very day and ordered 2 new coats on porpos to be introjuiced to the lords in  but the best joak of all was at last singin swagrin and swarinkup stares came mr dick blewitt he flung opn mr dawkinss door shouting out daw my old buck how are you when all of a sudden he sees mr deuceace his jor dropt he turned chocky white and then burnin red and looked as if a stror would knock him down my dear mr blewitt says my master smilin and offring his hand how glad i am to see you mr dawkins and i were just talking about your pony pray sit down  blewitt did and now was the question who should sit the other out but law bless you mr blewitt was no match for my master all the time he was fidgetty silent and sulky on the contry master was charmin i never herd such a flo of conversatin or so many wittacisms as he uttered at last completely beat mr blewitt took his leaf that instant master followed him and passin his arm through that of mr dick led him into our chambers and began talkin to him in the most affabl and affeckshnat manner  but dick was too angry to listen at last when master was telling him some long story about the duke of doncaster blewitt burst out  a plague on the duke of doncaster come come mr deuceace dont you be running your rigs upon me i aint the man to be bamboozld by longwinded stories about dukes and duchesses you think i dont know you every man knows you and your line of country yes youre after young dawkins there and think to pluck him but you

passed between the two genlmnone walkin quickly up and down the roomtother angry and stupid sittin down and stampin with his foot  now listen to this mr blewitt continues master at last if youre quiet

myself i should like to know by what law of honor i am bound to give him up to you  it was charmin to hear this pair of raskles talkin about honor i declare i could have found it in my heart to warn young dawkins of the precious way in which these chaps were going to serve him but if they didnt know what honor was i did and never never did i tell tails about my masters when in their sarviceout in

you may come too if you please     foring parts   it was a singular proof of my masters modesty that though he had won this andsome sum of mr dawkins and was inclined to be as extravygant and osntatious as any man i ever seed yet when he determined on going to paris he didnt let a single frend know of all them winnings of his didnt acquaint my lord crabs his father that he was about to leave his natiff shoarsneighdidnt even so much as call together his tradesmin and pay off their little bills befor his departure  on the contry chawles said he to me stick a piece of paper on my door which is the way that lawyers do and write back at seven upon it back at seven i wrote and stuck it on our outer oak and so mistearus was deuceace about his continental tour to all except me that when the landriss brought him her account for the last month amountain at the very least to 2l 10s master told her to leave it till monday morning when it should be properly settled its extrodny how ickonomical a man becomes when hes got five thousand lbs in his pockit  back at 7 indeed at 7 we were aroalin on the dover road in the reglator coachmaster inside me out a strange company of people there was too in that wehicle3 sailors an italyin with his musicbox and munky a missionary going to convert the heathens in france 2 oppra girls they call em figureaunts and the figureaunts mothers inside 4 frenchmin with gingybred caps and mustashes singing chattering and jesticklating in the most vonderful vay such compliments as passed between them and the figureaunts such a munshin of biskits and sippin of brandy such o mong jews and o sacrrres and kill fay frwaws i didnt understand their languidge at that time so of course cant igsplain much of their conwersation but it pleased me nevertheless for now i felt that i was reely going into foring parts which ever sins i had had any edication at all was always my fondest wish heavin bless us thought i if these are specimeens of all frenchmen what a set they must be the pore italyins monky sittin mopin and meluncolly on his box was not half so ugly and seamed quite as reasonabble  well we arrived at dovership hotel weal cutlets half a ginny glas of ale a shilling glas of neagush half a crownd a hapnyworth of waxlites four shillings and so on but master paid without grumbling as long as it was for himself he never minded the expens and nex day we embarked in the packit for balong sirmarewhich means in french the town of balong sityouated on the sea i who had heard of foring wonders expected this to be the fust and greatest phansy then my disapintment when we got there to find this balong not situated on the sea but on the shoar  but oh the gettin there was the bisniss how i did wish for pump court agin as we were tawsing abowt in the channel gentle reader av you ever been on the otionthe sea the sea the open sea as barry cromwell says as soon as we entered our little wessel and id looked to masters luggitch and mine mine was rapt up in a very small hankercher as soon i say as we entered our little wessel as soon as i saw the waives black and frothy like fresh drawn porter adashin against the ribs of our galliant bark the keal like a wedge splittin the billoes in two the sales aflaffin in the hair the standard of hengland floating at the maskhead the steward agetting ready the basins and things the capting proudly tredding the deck and giving orders to the salers the white rox of albany and the bathinmasheens disappearing in the distansthen then i felt for the first time the mite the madgisty of existence yellowplush my boy said i in a dialogue with myself your life is now about to commensyour carear as a man dates from your entrans on board this packit be wise be manly be cautious forgit the follies of your youth you are no longer a boy now but a footman throw down your tops your marbles your boyish gamesthrow off your childish habbits with your inky clerks jackitthrow up your                                  here i recklect i was obleeged to stopp a fealin in the fust place singlar in the next place painful and at last compleatly overpowering had come upon me while i was making the abuff speach and now i found myself in a sityouation which dellixy for bids me to describe suffis to say that now i dixcovered what basins was made forthat for many many hours i lay in a hagony of exostion dead to all intense and porpuses the rain pattering in my face the salers tramplink over my bodythe panes of purgatory going on inside when wed been about four hours in this sityouation it seamd to me four ears the steward comes to that part of the deck where we servants were all huddled up together and calls out charles  well says i gurgling out a faint yes whats the matter  youre wanted  where  your masters wery ill says he with a grin  master be hanged says i turning round more misrable than ever i woodnt have moved that day for twenty thousand mastersno not for the empror of russia or the pop of room  well to cut this sad subjik short many and many a voyitch have i sins had upon what shakspur calls the wasty dip but never such a retched one as that from dover to balong in the year anna domino 1818 steemers were scarce in those days and our journey was made in a smack at last when i was in a stage of despare and exostion as reely to phansy myself at deaths doar we got to the end of our journey late in the evening we hailed the gaelic shoars and hankered in the arbor of balong sirmare  it was the entrans of parrowdice to me and master and as we entered the calm water and saw the comfrabble lights gleaming in the houses and felt the roal of the vessel degreasing never was two mortials gladder i warrant than we were at length our capting drew up at the key and our journey was down but such a bustle and clatter such jabbering such shrieking and swaring such wollies of oafs and axicrations as saluted us on landing i never knew we were boarded in the fust place by customhouse officers in cockhats who seased our luggitch and called for our passpots then a crowd of innwaiters came tumbling and screaming on deckdis way sare cries one hotel meurice says another hotel de bang screeches another chapthe tower of babyle was nothink to it the fust thing that struck me on landing was a big fellow with earrings who very nigh knock me down in wrenching masters carpetbag out of my hand as i was carrying it to the hotell but we got to it safe at last and for the fust time in my life i slep in a foring country  i shant describe this town of balong which as it has been visited by not less on an avaridg than two milliums of english since i fust saw it twenty years ago is tolrabbly well known already its a dingy melumcolly place to my mind the only thing moving in the streets is the gutter which runs down em as for wooden shoes i saw few of em and for frogs upon my honor i never see a single frenchman swallow one which i had been led to beleave was their reglar though beastly custom one thing which amazed me was the singlar name which they give to this town of balong its divided as every boddy knows into an upper town sitouate on a mounting and surrounded by a wall or bullyvar and a lower town which is on the level of the sea well will it be believed that they call the upper town the hot veal and the other the base veal which is on the contry genrally good in france though the beaf it must be confest is excrabble  it was in the base veal that deuceace took his lodgian at the hotel de bang in a very crooked street called the rue del ascew and if hed been the archbishop of devonshire or the duke of canterbury he could not have given himself greater hairs i can tell you nothink was too fine for us now we had a sweet of rooms on the first floor which belonged to the prime minister of france at least the landlord said they were the premiers and the hon algernon percy deuceace who had not paid his landriss and came to dover in a coach seamed now to think that goold was too vulgar for him and a carridge and six would break down with a man of his weight shampang flew about like gingerpop besides bordo clarit burgundy burgong and other wines and all the delixes of the balong kitchins we stopped a fortnit at this dull place and did nothing from morning till night excep walk on the bench and watch the ships going in and out of arber with one of them long sliding opraglasses which they call i dont know why tallowscoops our amusements for the fortnit we stopped here were boath numerous and daliteful nothink in fact could be more pickong as they say in the morning before breakfast we boath walked on the peer master in a blue mareen jackit and me in a slapup new livry both provided with long sliding opraglasses called as i said i dont know y but i suppose its a scientafick term tallowscoops with these we igsamined very attentively the otion the seaweed the pebbles the dead cats the fishwimmin and the waives like little children playing at leapfrog which came tumblin over 1 another on to the shoar it seemed to me as if they were scrambling to get there as well they might being sick of the sea and anxious for the blessid peaceable terry firmy  after brexfast down we went again that is master on his beat and me on minefor my place in this foring town was a complete shinycure and putting our tallyscoops again in our eyes we egsamined a little more the otion pebbils dead cats and so on and this lasted till dinner and dinner till bedtime and bedtime lasted till nex day when came brexfast and dinner and tallyscooping as before this is the way with all people of this town of which as ive heard say there is ten thousand happy english who lead this plesnt life from years end to years end  besides this theres billiards and gambling for the gentlemen a little dancing for the gals and scandle for the dowygers in none of these amusements did we partake we were a little too good to play crown pints at cards and never get paid when we won or to go dangling after the portionless gals or amuse ourselves with slops and pennywist along with the old ladies no no my master was a man of fortn now and behayved himself as sich if ever he condysended to go into the public room of the hotel de bangthe french doubtless for reasons best known to themselves call this a sallymanjyhe swoar more and lowder than any one there he abyoused the waiters the wittles the wines with his glas in his i he staired at every body he took always the place before the fire he talked about my carridge my currier my servant and he did wright ive always found through life that if you wish to be respected by english people you must be insalent to them especially if you are a sprig of nobiliaty we like being insulted by noblemenit shows theyre familiar with us law bless us ive known many and many a genlmn about town whod rather be kicked by a lord than not be noticed by him theyve even had an aw of me because i was a lords footman while my master was hectoring in the parlor at balong pretious airs i gave myself in the kitching i can tell you and the consequints was that we were better served and moar liked than many pipple with twice our merit  deuceace had some particklar plans no doubt which kep him so long at balong and it clearly was his wish to act the man of fortune there for a little time before he tried the character of paris he purchased a carridge he hired a currier he rigged me in a fine new livry blazin with lace and he past through the balong bank a thousand pounds of the money he had won from dawkins to his credit at a paris house showing the balong bankers at the same time that hed plenty moar in his potfolie this was killin two birds with one stone the bankers clerks spread the nuse over the town and in a day after master had paid the money every old dowyger in balong had looked out the crabs family podigree in the peeridge and was quite intimate with the deuceace name and estates if sattn himself were a lord i do beleave theres many vurtuous english mothers would be glad to have him for a soninlaw  now though my master had thought fitt to leave town without excommunicating with his father on the subject of his intended continental tripe as soon as he was settled at balong he roat my lord crabbs a letter of which i happen to have a copy it ran thus   boulogne january 25  my dear fatheri have long in the course of my legal studies found the necessity of a knowledge of french in which language all the early history of our profession is written and have determined to take a little relaxation from chamber reading which has seriously injured my health if my modest finances can bear a two months journey and a residence at paris i propose to remain there that period  will you have the kindness to send me a letter of introduction to lord bobtail our ambassador my name and your old friendship with him i know would secure me a reception at his house but a pressing letter from yourself would at once be more courteous and more effectual  may i also ask you for my last quarters salary i am not an expensive man my dear father as you know but we are no chameleons and fifty pounds with my little earnings in my profession would vastly add to the agremens of my continental excursion  present my love to all my brothers and sisters ah how i wish the hard portion of a younger son had not been mine and that i could live without the dire necessity for labor happy among the rural scenes of my childhood and in the society of my dear sisters and you heaven bless you dearest father and all those beloved ones now dwelling under the dear old roof at sizes  ever your affectionate son  algernon  the right hon the earl of crabs c  sizes court bucks   to this affeckshnat letter his lordship replied by return of poast as follos   my dear algernonyour letter came safe to hand and i enclose you the letter for lord bobtail as you desire he is a kind man and has one of the best cooks in europe  we were all charmed with your warm remembrances of us not having seen you for seven years we cannot but be pleased at the family affection which in spite of time and absence still clings so fondly to home it is a sad selfish world and very few who have entered it can afford to keep those fresh feelings which you have my dear son  may you long retain them is a fond fathers earnest prayer be sure dear algernon that they will be through life your greatest comfort as well as your best worldly ally consoling you in misfortune cheering you in depression aiding and inspiring you to exertion and success  i am sorry truly sorry that my account at couttss is so low just now as to render a payment of your allowance for the present impossible i see by my book that i owe you now nine quarters or 450l depend on it my dear boy that they shall be faithfully paid over to you on the first opportunity  by the way i have enclosed some extracts from the newspapers which may interest you and have received a very strange letter from a mr blewitt about a play transaction which i suppose is the case alluded to in these prints he says you won 4700l from one dawkins that the lad paid it that he blewitt was to go what he calls snacks in the winning but that you refused to share the booty how can you my dear boy quarrel with these vulgar people or lay yourself in any way open to their attacks i have played myself a good deal and there is no man living who can accuse me of a doubtful act you should either have shot this blewitt or paid him now as the matter stands it is too late to do the former and perhaps it would be quixotic to perform the latter my dearest boy recollect through life that you never can afford to be dishonest with a roque four thousand seven hundred pounds was a great coup to be sure  as you are now in such high feather can you dearest algernon lend me five hundred pounds upon my soul and honor i will repay you your brothers and sisters send you their love i need not add that you have always the blessings of your affectionate father  crabs  psmake it 500 and i will give you my noteofhand for a thousand                                  i neednt say that this did not quite enter into deuceaces eyedears lend his father 500 pound indeed hed as soon have lent him a box on the year in the fust place he hadn seen old crabs for seven years as that nobleman remarked in his epistol in the secknd he hated him and they hated each other and nex if master had loved his father ever so much he loved somebody else betterhis fathers son namely and sooner than deprive that exlent young man of a penny hed have sean all the fathers in the world hangin at newgat and all the beloved ones as he called his sisters the lady deuceacisses so many convix at bottomy bay  the newspaper parrografs showed that however secret we wished to keep the play transaction the public knew it now full well blewitt as i found after was the author of the libels which appeared right and left   gambling in high lifethe honorable mr dcce againthis celebrated whistplayer has turned his accomplishments to some profit on friday the 16th january he won five thousand pounds from a very young gentleman thms smth dwkns esq and lost two thousand five hundred to r blwtt esq of the tmple mr d very honorably paid the sum lost by him to the honorable whistplayer but we have not heard that before his sudden trip to paris mr ducce paid his losings to mr blwtt   nex came a notice to corryspondents   fair play asks us if we know of the gambling doings of the notorious deuceace we answer we do and in our very next number propose to make some of them public                                  they didnt appear however but on the contry the very same newspeper which had been before so abusiff of deuceace was now loud in his praise it said   a paragraph was inadvertently admitted into our paper of last week most unjustly assailing the character of a gentleman of high birth and talents the son of the exemplary erl of crbs we repel with scorn and indignation the dastardly falsehoods of the malignant slanderer who vilified mr decece and beg to offer that gentleman the only reparation in our power for having thus tampered with his unsullied name we disbelieve the ruffian and his story and most sincerely regret that such a tale or such a writer should ever have been brought forward to the readers of this paper   this was satisfactory and no mistake and much pleased we were at the denial of this conshentious editor so much pleased that master sent him a tenpound noat and his complymints hed sent another to the same address before this parrowgraff was printed why i cant think for i woodnt suppose any thing musnary in a littery man  well after this bisniss was concluded the currier hired the carridge smartened a little and me set up in my new livries we bade ojew to bulong in the grandest state posbill what a figure we cut and my i what a figger the postillion cut a cockhat a jackit made out of a cows skin it was in cold weather a pigtale about 3 fit in length and a pair of boots oh sich a pare a bishop might almost have preached out of one or a modratsized famly slep in it me and mr schwigshhnaps the currier sate behind in the rumbill master aloan in the inside as grand as a turk and rapt up in his fine fircloak off we sett bowing gracefly to the crowd the harnissbells jinglin the great white hosses snortin kickin and squeelin and the postilium cracking his wip as loud as if hed been drivin her majesty the quean                                  well i shant describe our voyitch we passed sefral sitties willitches and metrappolishes sleeping the fust night at amiens witch as everyboddy knows is famous ever since the year 1802 for whats called the pease of amiens we had some very good done with sugar and brown sos in the amiens way but after all the boasting about them i think i like our marrowphats better  speaking of wedgytables another singler axdent happened here concarning them master who was brexfasting before going away told me to go and get him his fur travlingshoes i went and toald the waiter of the inn who stared grinned as these chaps always do said bong which means very well and presently came back  im blest if he didnt bring master a plate of cabbitch would you bleave it that now in the nineteenth sentry when they say theres schoolmasters abroad these stewpid french jackasses are so extonishingly ignorant as to call a cabbidge a shoo never never let it be said after this that these benighted souperstitious misrabble savidges are equill in any respex to the great brittish people the moor i travvle the moor i see of the world and other natiums i am proud of my own and despise and deplore the retchid ignorance of the rest of yourup                                  my remarks on parris you shall have by an early opportunity me and deuceace played some curious pranx there i can tell you     mr deuceace at paris    chapter i   the two bundles of hay   lieutenantgeneral sir george griffin kcb was about seventyfive years old when he left this life and the east ingine army of which he was a distinguished ornyment sir georges first appearance in injar was in the character of a cabbingboy to a vessel from which he rose to be clerk to the owners at calcutta from which he became all of a sudden a capting in the companys service and so rose and rose until he rose to be a leftenantgeneral when he stopped rising altogetherhopping the twig of this life as drummers generals dustmen and emperors must do  sir george did not leave any mal hair to perpetuate the name of griffin a widow of about twentyseven and a daughter avaritching twentythree was left behind to deploar his loss and share his proppaty on old sir georges deth his interesting widdo and orfan who had both been with him in injer returned hometried london for a few months did not like it and resolved on a trip to paris where very small london people become very great ones if theyve money as these griffinses had the intelligent reader need not be told that miss griffin was not the daughter of lady griffin for though marritches are made tolrabbly early in injer people are not quite so precoashoos as all that the fact is lady g was sir georges second wife i need scarcely add that miss matilda griffin wos the offspring of his fust marritch  miss leonora kicksey a ansum lively islington gal taken out to calcutta and amongst his other goods very comfortably disposed of by her uncle capting kicksey was oneandtwenty when she married sir george at seventyone and the 13 miss kickseys nine of whom kep a school at islington the other 4 being married variously in the city were not a little envius of my ladys luck and not a little proud of their relationship to her one of em miss jemima kicksey the oldest and by no means the least ugly of the sett was staying with her ladyship and gev me all the partecklars of the rest of the famly being of a lo sort i in course no nothink my acquaintance thank my stars dont lie among them or the likes of them  well this miss jemima lived with her younger and more fortnat sister in the qualaty of companion or toddy poar thing id a soon be a gally slave as lead the life she did every body in the house despised her her ladyship insulted her the very kitching gals scorned and flouted her she roat the notes she kep the bills she made the tea she whipped the chocklate she cleaned the canary birds and gev out the linning for the wash she was my ladys walking pocket or rettycule and fetched and carried her handkercher or her smellbottle like a wellbred spaniel all night at her ladyships swarries she thumped kidrills nobody ever thought of asking her to dance when miss griffing sung she played the piano and was scolded because the singer was out of tune abommanating dogs she never drove out without her ladyships puddle in her lap and reglarly unwell in a carriage she never got anything but the back seat poar jemima i can see her now in my ladys seckndbest old clothes the ladiesmaids always got the prime leavings a liloc sattn gown crumpled blotched and greasy a pair of white sattn shoes of the color of inger rubber a faded yellow velvet hat with a wreath of hartifishl flowers run to sead and a bird of parrowdice perched on the top of it melumcolly and moulting with only a couple of feathers left in his unfortunate tail  besides this ornyment to their saloon lady and miss griffin kept a number of other servants in the kitching 2 ladiesmaids 2 footmin six feet high each crimson coats goold knots and white cassymear pantyloons a coachmin to match a page and a shassure a kind of servant only known among forriners and who looks more like a majorgeneral than any other mortial wearing a cockhat a unicorn covered with silver lace mustashos eplets and a sword by his side all these to wait upon two ladies not counting a host of the fair sex such as cooks scullion housekeepers and so forth  my lady griffins lodging was at forty pound a week in a grand sweet of rooms in the plas vandome at paris and having thus described their house and their servants hall i may give a few words of description concerning the ladies themselves  in the fust place and in coarse they hated each other my lady was twentysevena widdo of two yearsfat fair and rosy a slow quiet coldlooking woman as those fairhaired gals generally are it seemed difficult to rouse her either into likes or dislikes to the former at least she never loved any body but one and that was herself she hated in her calm quiet way almost every one else who came near herevery one from her neighbor the duke who had slighted her at dinner down to john the footman who had torn a hole in her train i think this womans heart was like one of them lithograffic stones you cant rub out any thing when once its drawn or wrote on it nor could you out of her ladyships stoneheart i meanin the shape of an affront a slight or real or phansied injury she boar an exlent irreprotchable character against which the tongue of scandal never wagged she was allowed to be the best wife posbilland so she was but she killed her old husband in two years as dead as ever mr thurtell killed mr william weare she never got into a passion not sheshe never said a rude word but shed a geniusa genius which many women haveof making a hell of a house and tortring the poor creatures of her family until they were wellnigh drove mad  miss matilda griffin was a good deal uglier and about as amiable as her motherinlaw she was crooked and squinted my lady to do her justice was straight and looked the same way with her is she was dark and my lady was fairsentimental as her ladyship was cold my lady was never in a passionmiss matilda always and awfille were the scenes which used to pass between these 2 women and the wickid wickid quarls which took place why did they live together there was the mistry not related and hating each other like pison it would surely have been easier to remain seprat and so have detested each other at a distans  as for the fortune which old sir george had left that it was clear was very considrabble300 thousand lb at the least as i have heard say but nobody knew how it was disposed of some said that her ladyship was sole mistriss of it others that it was divided others that she had only a life inkum and that the money was all to go as was natral to miss matilda these are subjix which are not praps very interesting to the british public but were mighty important to my master the honrable algernon percy deuceace esquire barristeratlaw etsettler etsettler  for ive forgot to inform you that my master was very intimat in this house and that we were now comfortably settled at the hotel mirabew pronounced marobo in french in the rew delly pay at paris we had our cab and two riding horses our bankers book and a thousand pound for a balantz at lafitts our club at the corner of the rew gramong our share in a box at the oppras our apartments spacious and elygant our swarries at court our dinners at his excellency lord bobtails and elsewhere thanks to poar dawkinss five thousand pound we were as complete gentlemen as any in paris  now my master like a wise man as he was seaing himself at the head of a smart sum of money and in a country where his debts could not bother him determined to give up for the present every think like gamblingat least high play as for losing or winning a ralow of napoleums at whist or ecarty it did not matter it looks like money to do such things and gives a kind of respectabilaty but as for play he wouldntoh no not for worldsdo such a thing he had played like other young men of fashn and won and lost old fox he didnt say he had paid but he had given up the amusement and was now determined he said to live on his inkum the fact is my master was doing his very best to act the respectable man and a very good game it is too but it requires a precious great roag to play it  he made his appearans reglar at churchme carrying a handsome large black marocky prayerbook and bible with the psalms and lessons marked out with red ribbings and youd have thought as i graivly laid the volloms down before him and as he berried his head in his nicely brushed hat before service began that such a pious proper morl young nobleman was not to be found in the whole of the peeridge it was a comfort to look at him efry old tabby and dowyger at my lord bobtails turned up the wights of their is when they spoke of him and vowed they had never seen such a dear daliteful exlent young man what a good son he must be they said and oh what a good soninlaw he had the pick of all the english gals at paris before we had been there 3 months but unfortunately most of them were poar and love and a cottidge was not quite in masters way of thinking  well about this time my lady griffin and miss g made their appearants at parris and master who was up to snough very soon changed his noat he sate near them at chapple and sung hims with my lady he danced with em at the embassy balls he road with them in the boy de balong and the shandeleasies which is the french high park he roat potry in miss griffins halbim and sang jewets along with her and lady griffin he brought sweetmeats for the puddledog he gave money to the footmin kissis and gloves to the sniggering ladiesmaids he was sivvle even to poar miss kicksey there wasnt a single soal at the griffinses that didnt adoar this good young man  the ladies if they hated befoar you may be sure detested each other now wuss than ever there had been always a jallowsy between them miss jellows of her motherinlaws bewty madam of misss espree miss taunting my lady about the school at islington and my lady sneering at miss for her squint and her crookid back and now came a stronger caws they both fell in love with mr deuceacemy lady that is to say as much as she could with her cold selfish temper she liked deuceace who amused her and made her laff she liked his manners his riding and his good loox and being a pervinew herself had a dubble respect for real aristocratick flesh and blood misss love on the contry was all flams and fury shed always been at this work from the time she had been at school where she very nigh run away with a frentch master next with a footman which i may say in confidence is by no means unnatral or unusyouall as i could show if i liked and so had been going on sins fifteen she reglarly flung herself at deuceaces headsuch sighing crying and ogling i never see often was i ready to bust out laffin as i brought master skoars of rosecolored billydoos folded up like cockhats and smellin like barbers shops which this very tender young lady used to address to him now though master was a scoundrill and no mistake he was a gentlemin and a man of good breading and miss came a little too strong pardon the wulgarity of the xpression with her hardor and attachmint for one of his taste besides she had a crookid spine and a squint so that supposing their fortns tolrabbly equal deuceace reely preferred the motherinlaw  now then it was his bisniss to find out which had the most money with an english famly this would have been easy a look at a will at doctor commonses would settle the matter at once but this india naybobs will was at calcutty or some outlandish place and there was no getting sight of a coppy of it i will do mr algernon deuceace the justass to say that he was so little musnary in his love for lady griffin that he would have married her gladly even if she had ten thousand pounds less than miss matilda in the meantime his plan was to keep em both in play until he could strike the best fish of the twonot a difficult matter for a man of his genus besides miss was hooked for certain    chapter ii  honor thy father   i said that my master was adoard by every person in my lady griffins establishmint i should have said by every person excep onea young french gnlmn that is who before our appearants had been mighty partiklar with my lady ockupying by her side exackly the same pasition which the honrable mr deuceace now held it was bewtiffle and headifying to see how coolly that young nobleman kicked the poar shevalliay de lorge out of his shoes and how gracefully he himself stept into em munseer de lorge was a smart young french jentleman of about my masters age and good looks but not possest of half my masters impidince not that that quallaty is uncommon in france but few very few had it to such a degree as my exlent employer mr deuceace besides de lorge was reglarly and reely in love with lady griffin and master only pretending he had of coars an advantitch which the poor frentchman never could git he was all smiles and gaty while delorge was ockward and melumcolly my master had said twenty pretty things to lady griffin befor the shevalier had finished smoothing his hat staring at her and sighing fit to bust his weskit o luv luv this isnt the way to win a woman or my names not fitzroy yellowplush myself when i begun my carear among the fair six i was always sighing and moping like this poar frenchman what was the consquints the foar fust women i adoared lafft at me and left me for something more lively with the rest i have edopted a diffrent game and with tolerable suxess i can tell you but this is eggatism which i aboar  well the long and the short of it is that munseer ferdinand hyppolite xavier stanislas shevalier de lorge was reglar cut out by munseer algernon percy deuceace exquire poar ferdinand did not leave the househe hadnt the heart to do thatnor had my lady the desire to dismiss him he was usefle in a thousand different ways gitting oppraboxes and invitations to french swarries bying gloves and o de colong writing french noats and such like always let me recommend an english famly going to paris to have at least one young man of the sort about them never mind how old your ladyship is he will make love to you never mind what errints you send him upon hell trot off and do them besides hes always quite and welldresst and never drinx moar than a pint of wine at dinner which as i say is a pint to consider such a conveniants of a man was munseer de lorgethe greatest use and comfort to my lady posbill if it was but to laff at his bad pronunciatium of english it was somethink amusink the fun was to pit him against poar miss kicksey she speakin french and he our naytif british tong  my master to do him justace was perfickly sivvle to this poar young frenchman and having kicked him out of the place which he occupied sertingly treated his fallen anymy with every respect and consideration poar modist downhearted little ferdinand adoured my lady as a goddice and so he was very polite likewise to my masternever venturing once to be jellows of him or to question my lady griffins right to change her lover if she choase to do so  thus then matters stood master had two strinx to his bo and might take either the widdo or the orfn as he preferred com bong lwee somblay as the frentch say his only pint was to discover how the money was disposed off which evidently belonged to one or other or boath at any rate he was sure of one as sure as any mortal man can be in this sublimary spear where nothink is suttin except unsertnty                                  a very unixpected insident here took place which in a good deal changed my masters calkylations  one night after conducting the two ladies to the oppra after suppink of white soop sammydeperdrow and shampang glassy which means eyced at their house in the plas vandom me and master droav hoam in the cab as happy as possbill  chawls you dd scoundrel says he to me for he was in an exlent humer when im married ill dubbil your wagis  this he might do to be sure without injuring himself seeing that he had us yet never paid me any but what then law bless us things would be at a pretty pass if we suvvants only lived on our wagis our puckwisits is the thing and no mistake  i ixprest my gratitude as best i could swoar that it wasnt for wagis i served himthat i would as leaf weight upon him for nothink and that never never so long as i livd would i of my own accord part from such an exlent master by the time these two spitches had been mademy spitch and hiswe arrived at the hotel mirabeu which us every body knows aint very distant from the plas vandome up we marched to our apartmince me carrying the light and the cloax master hummink a hair out of the oppra as merry as a lark  i opened the door of our salong there was lights already in the room an empty shampang bottle roalin on the floar another on the table near which the sofy was drawn and on it lay a stout old genlmn smoaking seagars as if hed bean in an inn taproom  deuceace who abommunates seagars as ive already shown bust into a furious raige against the genlmn whom he could hardly see for the smoak and with a number of oaves quite unnecessary to repeat asked him what bisniss hed there  the smoaking chap rose and laying down his seagar began a ror of laffin and said what algy my boy dont you know me  the reader may praps recklect a very affecting letter which was published in the last chapter of these memoars in which the writer requested a loan of five hundred pound from mr algernon deuceace and which boar the respected signatur of the earl of crabs mr deuceaces own father it was that distinguished arastycrat who was now smokin and laffin in our room  my lord crabs was as i preshumed about 60 years old a stowt burly redfaced baldheaded nobleman whose nose seemed blushing at what his mouth was continually swallowing whose hand praps trembled a little and whose thy and legg was not quite so full or as steddy as they had been in former days but he was a respecktabble finelooking old nobleman and though it must be confest 12 drunk when we fust made our appearance in the salong yet by no means moor so than a reel noblemin ought to be  what algy my boy shouts out his lordship advancing and seasing master by the hand doant you know your own father  master seemed anythink but overhappy my lord says he looking very pail and speakin rayther slow i didnti confessthe unexpected pleasureof seeing you in paris the fact is sir said he recovering himself a little the fact is there was such a confounded smoke of tobacco in the room that i really could not see who the stranger was who had paid me such an unexpected visit  a bad habit algernon a bad habit said my lord lighting another seagar a disgusting and filthy practice which you my dear child will do well to avoid it is at best dear algernon but a nasty idle pastime unfitting a man as well for mental exertion as for respectable society sacrificing at once the vigor of the intellect and the graces of the person bytheby what infernal bad tobacco they have too in this hotel could not you send your servant to get me a few seagars at the cafe de paris give him a fivefranc piece and let him go at once thats a good fellow  here his lordship hiccupt and drank off a fresh tumbler of shampang very sulkily master drew out the coin and sent me on the errint  knowing the cafe de paris to be shut at that hour i didnt say a word but quietly establisht myself in the anteroom where as it happened by a singler coinstdints i could hear every word of the conversation between this exlent pair of relatifs  help yourself and get another bottle says my lord after a sollum paws my poar master the king of all other compnies in which he moved seamed here but to play secknd fiddill and went to the cubbard from which his father had already igstracted two bottils of his prime sillary  he put it down before his father coft spit opened the windows stirred the fire yawned clapt his hand to his forehead and suttnly seamed as uneezy as a genlmn could be but it was of no use the old one would not budg help yourself says he again and pass me the bottil  you are very good father says master but really i neither drink nor smoke  right my boy quite right talk about a good conscience in this lifea good stomack is everythink no bad nights no headachseh quite cool and collected for your law studies in the morningeh and the old nobleman here grinned in a manner which would have done creddit to mr grimoldi  master sate pale and wincing as ive seen a pore soldier under the cat he didnt anser a word his exlent pa went on warming as he continued to speak and drinking a fresh glas at evry full stop  how you must improve with such talents and such principles why algernon all london talks of your industry and perseverance youre not merely a philosopher man hang it youve got the philosophers stone fine rooms fine horses champagne and all for 200 a year  i presume sir says my master that you mean the two hundred a year which you pay me  the very sum my boy the very sum cries my lord laffin as if he would die why thats the wonder i never pay the two hundred a year and you keep all this state up upon nothing give me your secret o you young trismegistus tell your old father how such wonders can be worked and i willyes then upon my word i willpay you your two hundred a year  enfin my lord says mr deuceace starting up and losing all patience will you have the goodness to tell me what this visit means you leave me to starve for all you care and you grow mighty facetious because i earn my bread you find me in prosperity and  precisely my boy precisely keep your temper and pass that bottle i find you in prosperity and a young gentleman of your genius and acquirements asks me why i seek your society oh algernon algernon this is not worthy of such a profound philosopher why do i seek you why because you are in prosperity o my son else why the devil should i bother my self about you did i your poor mother or your family ever get from you a single affectionate feeling did we or any other of your friends or intimates ever know you to be guilty of a single honest or generous action did we ever pretend any love for you or you for us algernon deuceace you dont want a father to tell you that you are a swindler and a spendthrift i have paid thousands for the debts of yourself and your brothers and if you pay nobody else i am determined you shall repay me you would not do it by fair means when i wrote to you and asked you for a loan of money i knew you would not had i written again to warn you of my coming you would have given me the slip and so i came uninvited to force you to repay me thats why i am here mr algernon and so help yourself and pass the bottle  after this speach the old genlmn sunk down on the sofa and puffed as much smoke out of his mouth as if hed been the chimley of a steaminjian i was pleased i confess with the sean and liked to see this venrabble and virtuous old man anocking his son about the hed just as deuceace had done with mr richard blewitt as ive before shown masters face was fust redhot next chawkwhite and then skyblew he looked for all the world like mr tippy cooke in the tragady of frankinstang at last he mannidged to speek  my lord says he i expected when i saw you that some such scheme was on foot swindler and spendthrift as i am at least it is but a family failing and i am indebted for my virtues to my fathers precious example your lordship has i perceive added drunkenness to the list of your accomplishments and i suppose under the influence of that gentlemanly excitement has come to make these preposterous propositions to me when you are sober you will perhaps be wise enough to know that fool as i may be i am not such a fool as you think me and that if i have got money i intend to keep itevery farthing of it though you were to be ten times as drunk and ten times as threatening as you are now  well well my boy said lord crabs who seemed to have been half asleep during his sons oratium and received all his sneers and surcasms with the most complete goodhumor well well if you will resist tant pis pour toi ive no desire to ruin you recollect and am not in the slightest degree angry but i must and will have a thousand pounds you had better give me the money at once it will cost you more if you dont  sir says mr deuceace i will be equally candid i would not give you a farthing to save you from  here i thought proper to open the doar and touching my hat said i have been to the cafe de paris my lord but the house is shut  bon theres a good lad you may keep the five francs and now get me a candle and show me down stairs  but my master seized the wax taper pardon me my lord says he what a servant do it when your son is in the room ah par exemple my dear father said he laughing you think there is no politeness left among us and he led the way out  good night my dear boy said lord crabs  god bless you sir says he are you wrapped warm mind the step  and so this affeckshnate pair parted    chapter iii  minewvring   master rose the nex morning with a dismal countinantshe seamed to think that his pas visit boded him no good i heard him muttering at his brexfast and fumbling among his hundred pound notes once he had laid a parsle of them aside i knew what he meant to send em to his father but no says he at last clutching them all up together again and throwing them into his escritaw what harm can he do me if he is a knave i know another whos full as sharp lets see if we cannot beat him at his own weapons with that mr deuceace drest himself in his best clothes and marched off to the plas vandom to pay his cort to the fair widdo and the intresting orfn  it was abowt ten oclock and he propoased to the ladies on seeing them a number of planns for the days rackryation riding in the body balong going to the twillaries to see king looy disweet who was then the raining sufferin of the french crownd go to chapple and finely a dinner at 5 oclock at the caffy de parry whents they were all to adjourn to see a new peace at the theatre of the pot st martin called sussannar and the elders  the gals agread to everythink exsep the two last prepositiums we have an engagement my dear mr algernon said my lady looka very kind letter from lady bobtail and she handed over a pafewmd noat from that exolted lady it ran thus   fbg st honore thursday feb 15 1817  my dear lady griffinit is an age since we met harassing public duties occupy so much myself and lord bobtail that we have scarce time to see our private friends among whom i hope my dear lady griffin will allow me to rank her will you excuse so unceremonious an invitation and dine with us at the embassy today we shall be en petite comite and shall have the pleasure of hearing i hope some of your charming daughters singing in the evening i ought perhaps to have addressed a separate note to dear miss griffin but i hope she will pardon a poor diplomate who has so many letters to write you know  farewell till seven when i positively must see you both ever dearest lady griffin your affectionate  eliza bobtail   such a letter from the ambassdriss brot by the ambasdors shassure and sealed with his seal of arms would affect anybody in the middling ranx of life it droav lady griffin mad with delight and long before my masters arrivle shed sent mortimer and fitzclarence her two footmin along with a polite reply in the affummatiff  master read the noat with no such fealinx of joy he felt that there was somethink agoing on behind the seans and though he could not tell how was sure that some danger was near him that old fox of a father of his had begun his minations pretty early  deuceace handed back the letter sneared and poohd and hinted that such an invitation was an insult at best what he called a pees ally and the ladies might depend upon it was only sent because lady bobtail wanted to fill up two spare places at her table but lady griffin and miss would not have his insinwations they knew too fu lords ever to refuse an invitatium from any one of them go they would and poor deuceace must dine alone after they had been on their ride and had had their other amusemince master came back with them chatted and laft he was mighty sarkastix with my lady tender and sentrymentle with miss and left them both in high sperrits to perform their twollet before dinner  as i came to the door for i was as famillyer as a servnt of the house as i came into the drawingroom to announts his cab i saw master very quietly taking his pocketbook or pot fool as the french call it and thrusting it under one of the cushinx of the sofa what game is this thinx i  why this was the game in abowt two hours when he knew the ladies were gon he pretends to be vastly anxious abowt the loss of his potfolio and back he goes to lady griffinses to seek for it there  pray says he on going in ask miss kicksey if i may see her for a single moment and down comes miss kicksey quite smiling and happy to see him  law mr deuceace says she trying to blush as hard as ever she could you quite surprise me i dont know whether i ought really being alone to admit a gentleman  nay dont say so dear miss kicksey for do you know i came here for a double purposeto ask about a pocketbook which i have lost and may perhaps have left here and then to ask you if you will have the great goodness to pity a solitary bachelor and give him a cup of your nice tea  nice tea i thot i should have split for im blest if master had eaten a morsle of dinner  never mind down to tea they sat do you take cream and sugar dear sir says poar kicksey with a voice as tender as a tuttleduff  both dearest miss kicksey answers master who stowed in a power of sashong and muffinx which would have done honor to a washawoman  i shant describe the conversation that took place betwigst master and this young lady the reader praps knows y deuceace took the trouble to talk to her for an hour and to swallow all her tea he wanted to find out from her all she knew about the famly money matters and settle at once which of the two griffinses he should marry  the poar thing of cors was no match for such a man as my master in a quarter of an hour he had if i may use the igspression turned her inside out he knew everything that she knew and that poar creature was very little there was nine thousand a year she had heard say in money in houses in banks in injar and what not boath the ladies signed papers for selling or buying and the money seemed equilly divided betwigst them  nine thousand a year deuceace went away his cheex tingling his heart beating he without a penny could nex morning if he liked be master of five thousand per hannum  yes but how which had the money the mother or the daughter all the teadrinking had not taught him this piece of nollidge and deuceace thought it a pity that he could not marry both                                  the ladies came back at night mightaly pleased with their reception at the ambasdors and stepping out of their carridge bid coachmin drive on with a gentlemin who had handed them outa stout old gentlemin who shook hands most tenderly at parting and promised to call often upon my lady griffin he was so polite that he wanted to mount the stairs with her ladyship but no she would not suffer it edward says she to the coachmin quite loud and pleased that all the people in the hotel should hear her you will take the carriage and drive his lordship home now can you guess who his lordship was the right hon the earl of crabs to be sure the very old genlmn whom i had seen on such charming terms with his son the day before master knew this the nex day and began to think he had been a fool to deny his pa the thousand pound  now though the suckmstansies of the dinner at the ambasdors only came to my years some time after i may as well relate em here word for word as they was told me by the very genlmn who waited behind lord crabseses chair  there was only a petty comity at dinner as lady bobtail said and my lord crabs was placed betwigst the two griffinses being mighty ellygant and palite to both allow me says he to lady g between the soop and the fish my dear madam to thank youfervently thank you for your goodness to my poor boy your ladyship is too young to experience but i am sure far too tender not to understand the gratitude which must fill a fond parents heart for kindness shown to his child believe me says my lord looking her full and tenderly in the face that the favors you have done to another have been done equally to myself and awaken in my bosom the same grateful and affectionate feelings with which you have already inspired my son algernon  lady griffin blusht and droopt her head till her ringlets fell into her fishplate and she swallowed lord crabss flumry just as she would so many musharuins my lord whose powers of slackjaw was notoarious nex addrast another spitch to miss griffin he said hed heard how deuceace was situated miss blushtwhat a happy dog he wasmiss blusht crimson and then he sighed deeply and began eating his turbat and lobster sos master was a good un at flumry but law bless you he was no moar equill to the old man than a molehill is to a mounting before the night was over he had made as much progress as another man would in a ear one almost forgot his red nose and his big stomick and his wicked leering is in his gentle insiniwating woice his fund of annygoats and above all the bewtific morl religious and honrabble toan of his genral conservation praps you will say that these ladies were for such rich pipple mightaly esaly captivated but recklect my dear sir that they were fresh from injarthat theyd not sean many lordsthat they adoared the peeridge as every honest woman does in england who has proper feelinx and has read the fashnabble novvlesand that here at paris was their fust step into fashnabble sosiaty  well after dinner while miss matilda was singing die tantie or dip your chair or some of them sellabrated italyian hairs when she began this squall hang me if shed ever stop my lord gets hold of lady griffin again and gradgaly begins to talk to her in a very different strane  what a blessing it is for us all says he that algernon has found a friend so respectable as your ladyship  indeed my lord and why i suppose i am not the only respectable friend that mr deuceace has  no surely not the only one he has had his birth and permit me to say his relationship to myself have procured him many but here my lord heaved a very affecting and large sigh  but what says my lady laffing at the igspression of his dismal face you dont mean that mr deuceace has lost them or is unworthy of them  i trust not my dear madam i trust not but he is wild thoughtless extravagant and embarrassed and you know a man under these circumstances is not very particular as to his associates  embarrassed good heavens he says he has two thousand a year left him by a godmother and he does not seem even to spend his incomea very handsome independence too for a bachelor  my lord nodded his head sadly and saidwill your ladyship give me your word of honor to be secret my son has but a thousand a year which i allow him and is heavily in debt he has played madam i fear and for this reason i am so glad to hear that he is in a respectable domestic circle where he may learn in the presence of far greater and purer attractions to forget the dicebox and the low company which has been his bane  my lady griffin looked very grave indeed was it true was deuceace sincere in his professions of love or was he only a sharper wooing her for her money could she doubt her informer his own father and whats more a real flesh and blood pear of parlyment she determined she would try him praps she did not know she had liked deuceace so much until she kem to feel how much she should hate him if she found hed been playing her false  the evening was over and back they came as weeve seenmy lord driving home in my ladys carridge her ladyship and miss walking up stairs to their own apartmince  here for a wonder was poar miss kicksey quite happy and smiling and evidently full of a secretsomething mighty pleasant to judge from her loox she did not long keep it as she was making tea for the ladies for in that house they took a cup regular before bedtime well my lady says she who do you think has been to drink tea with me poar thing a frendly face was a event in her lifea teaparty quite a hera  why perhaps lenoir my maid says my lady looking grave i wish miss kicksey you would not demean yourself by mixing with my domestics recollect madam that you are sister to lady griffin  no my lady it was not lenoir it was a gentleman and a handsome gentleman too  oh it was monsieur de lorge then says miss he promised to bring me some guitarstrings  no nor yet m de lorge he came but was not so polite as to ask for me what do you think of your own beau the honorable mr algernon deuceace and so saying poar kicksey clapped her hands together and looked as joyfle as if shed come in to a fortin  mr deuceace here and why pray says my lady who recklected all that his exlent pa had been saying to her  why in the first place he had left his pocketbook and in the second he wanted he said a dish of my nice tea which he took and stayed with me an hour or moar  and pray miss kicksey said miss matilda quite contempshusly what may have been the subject of your conversation with mr algernon did you talk politics or music or fine arts or metaphysics miss m being what was called a blue as most humpbacked women in sosiaty are always made a pint to speak on these grand subjects  no indeed he talked of no such awful matters if he had you know matilda i should never have understood him first we talked about the weather next about muffins and crumpets crumpets he said he liked best and then we talked here miss kickseys voice fell about poor dear sir george in heaven what a good husband he was and  what a good fortune he left eh miss kicksey says my lady with a hard snearing voice and a diabollicle grin  yes dear leonora he spoke so respectfully of your blessed husband and seemed so anxious about you and matilda it was quite charming to hear him dear man  and pray miss kicksey what did you tell him  oh i told him that you and leonora had nine thousand a year and  what then  why nothing that is all i know i am sure i wish i had ninety says poor kicksey her eyes turning to heaven  ninety fiddlesticks did not mr deuceace ask how the money was left and to which of us  yes but i could not tell him  i knew it says my lady slapping down her teacupi knew it  well says miss matilda and why not lady griffin there is no reason you should break your teacup because algernon asks a harmless question he is not mercenary he is all candor innocence generosity he is himself blessed with a sufficient portion of the worlds goods to be content and often and often has he told me he hoped the woman of his choice might come to him without a penny that he might show the purity of his affection  ive no doubt says my lady perhaps the lady of his choice is miss matilda griffin and she flung out of the room slamming the door and leaving miss matilda to bust into tears as was her reglar custom and pour her loves and woas into the buzzom of miss kicksey    chapter iv  hitting the nale on the hedd   the nex morning down came me and master to lady griffinsesi amusing myself with the gals in the antyroom he paying his devours to the ladies in the salong miss was thrumming on her gitter my lady was before a great box of papers busy with accounts bankers books lawyers letters and what not law bless us its a kind of bisniss i should like well enuff especially when my hannual account was seven or eight thousand on the right side like my ladys my lady in this house kep all these matters to herself miss was a vast deal too sentrimentle to mind business  miss matildas eyes sparkled as master came in she pinted gracefully to a place on the sofy beside her which deuceace took my lady only looked up for a moment smiled very kindly and down went her head among the papers agen as busy as a b  lady griffin has had letters from london says miss from nasty lawyers and people come here and sit by me you naughty man you  and down sat master willingly says he my dear miss griffin why i declare it is quits a teteatete  well says miss after the prillimnary flumries in coarse we met a friend of yours at the embassy mr deuceace  my father doubtless he is a great friend of the ambassador and surprised me myself by a visit the night before last  what a dear delightful old man how he loves you mr deuceace  oh amazingly says master throwing his is to heaven  he spoke of nothing but you and such praises of you  master breathed more freely he is very good my dear father but blind as all fathers are he is so partial and attached to me  he spoke of you being his favorite child and regretted that you were not his eldest son i can but leave him the small portion of a younger brother he said but never mind he has talents a noble name and an independence of his own  an independence yes oh yes i am quite independent of my father  two thousand pounds a year left you by your godmother the very same you told us you know  neither more nor less says master bobbing his head a sufficiency my dear miss griffinto a man of my moderate habits an ample provision  bytheby cries out lady griffin interrupting the conversation you who are talking about money matters there i wish you would come to the aid of poor me come naughty boy and help me out with this long long sum  didnt he gothats all my i how his is shone as he skipt across the room and seated himself by my lady  look

hundred and ninety pounds good i daresay you are right im sure i cant go through the fatigue to see and now comes another question whose money is this mine or matildas you see it is the interest of a

george left his money you must let me see his will first  oh willingly  masters chair seemed suddenly to have got springs in the cushns he was obliged to hold himself down  look here i have only a copy taken by my hand from sir georges own manuscript soldiers you know do not employ lawyers much and this was written on the night before going into action and she read i george griffin c cyou know how these things beginbeing now of sane mindum um umleave to my friends thomas abraham hicks a colonel in the h e i companys service and to john monro mackirkincroft of the house of huffle mackirkincroft and dobbs at calcutta the whole of my property to be realized as speedily as they may consistently with the interests of the property in trust for my wife leonora emilia griffin born l

more all the rest is stuff but now you know the whole business tell us what is to be done with the money  why the money unquestionably should be divided between you  tant mieux say i i really thought it had been all matildas                                  there was a paws for a minit or two after the will had been read master left the desk at which he had been seated with her ladyship paced up and down the room for a while and then came round to the place where miss matilda was seated at last he said in a low trembling voice  i am almost sorry my dear lady griffin that you have read that will to me for an attachment such as mine must seem i fear mercenary when the object of it is so greatly favored by worldly fortune miss griffinmatilda i know i may say the word your dear eyes grant me the permission i need not tell you or you dear motherinlaw how long how fondly i have adored you my tender my beautiful matilda i will not affect to say i have not read your heart ere this and that i have not known the preference with which you have honored me speak it dear girl from your own sweet lips in the presence of an affectionate parent utter the sentence which is to seal my happiness for life matilda dearest matilda say oh say that you love me  miss m shivered turned pail rowled her eyes about and fell on masters neck whispering hodibly i do  my lady looked at the pair for a moment with her teeth grinding her is glaring her busm throbbing and her face chock white for all the world like madam pasty in the oppra of mydear when shes goin to mudder her childring you recklect and out she flounced from the room without a word knocking down poar me who happened to be very near the dor and leaving my master along with his crookback mistress  ive repotted the speech he made to her pretty well the fact is i got it in a ruff copy only on the copy its wrote lady griffin leonora instead of miss griffin matilda as in the abuff and so on  master had hit the right nail on the head this time he thought but his adventors ant over yet    chapter v  the griffins claws   well master had hit the right nail on the head this time thanx to luckthe crooked one to be sure but then it had the goold nobb which was the part deuceace most valued as well he should being a connyshure as to the relletiff valyou of pretious metals and much preferring virging goold like this to poor old battered iron like my lady griffin  and so in spite of his father at which old noblemin mr deuceace now snapt his fingers in spite of his detts which to do him justas had never stood much in his way and in spite of his povatty idleness extravagans swindling and debotcheries of all kinds which ant generally very favorable to a young man who has to make his way in the world in spite of all there he was i say at the topp of the trea the fewcher master of a perfect fortun the defianced husband of a fool of a wife what can mortial man want more vishns of ambishn now occupied his soal shooting boxes oppra boxes money boxes always full hunters at melton a seat in the house of commins heaven knows what and not a poar footman who only describes what hes seen and cant in cors pennytrate into the idears and the busms of men  you may be shore that the threecornered noats came pretty thick now from the griffinses miss was always awriting them befoar and now nite noon and mornink breakfast dinner and sopper in they came till my pantry for master never read em and i carried em out was puffickly intolrabble from the odor of musk ambygrease bargymot and other sense with which they were

lord when shall the time come when the tedious night shall not separate us nor the blessed day twelve one two i have heard the bells chime and the quarters and never cease to think of my husband my adored percy pardon the girlish confessioni have kissed the letter at this place will thy lips press it too and remain for a moment on the spot which has been equally saluted by your  matilda   this was the fust letter and was brot to our house by one of the poar footmin fitzclarence at sicks oclock in the morning i thot it was for life and death and woak master at that extraornary hour and gave it to him i shall never forgit him when he red it he cramped it up and he cust and swoar applying to the lady who roat the genlmn that brought it and me who introjuiced it to his notice such a collection of epitafs as i seldum hered excep at billinxgit the fact is thiss for a fust letter misss noat was rather too strong and sentymentle but that was her way she was always reading melancholy stoary booksthaduse of wawsaw the sorrows of macwhirter and such like  after about 6 of them master never yoused to read them but handid them over to me to see if there was anythink in them which must be answered in order to kip up appearuntses the next letter is   no ii  beloved to what strange madnesses will passion lead one lady griffin since your avowal yesterday has not spoken a word to your poor matilda has declared that she will admit no one heigho not even you my algernon and has locked herself in her own dressingroom i do believe that she is jealous and fancies that you were in love with her ha ha i could have told her another talenestce pas adieu adieu adieu a thousand thousand million kisses  m g  monday afternoon 2 oclock   there was another letter kem before bedtime for though me and master called at the griffinses we wairnt aloud to enter at no price mortimer and fitzclarence grind at me as much as to say we were going to be relations but i dont spose master was very sorry when he was obleached to come back without seeing the fare objict of his affeckshns  well on chewsdy there was the same game ditto on wensday only when we called there who should we see but our father lord crabs who was waiving his hand to miss kicksey and saying he should be back to dinner at 7 just as me and master came up the stares there was no admittns for us though bah bah never mind says my lord taking his son affeckshnately by the hand what two strings to your bow ay algernon the dowager a little jealous miss a little lovesick but my ladys fit of anger will vanish and i promise you my boy that you shall see your fair one tomorrow  and so saying my lord walked master down stares looking at him as tender and affeckshnat and speaking to him as sweet as posbill master did not know what to think of it he never new what game his old father was at only he somehow felt that he had got his head in a net in spite of his suxess on sunday i knew iti knew it quite well as soon as i saw the old genlmn igsammin him by a kind of smile which came over his old face and was somethink betwigst the angellic and the direbollicle  but masters dowts were cleared up nex day and every thing was bright again at brexfast in comes a note with inclosier boath of witch i here copy   no ix  thursday morning  victoria victoria mamma has yielded at last not her consent to our union but her consent to receive you as before and has promised to forget the past silly woman how could she ever think of you as anything but the lover of your matilda i am in a whirl of delicious joy and passionate excitement i have been awake all this long night thinking of thee my algernon and longing for the blissful hour of meeting  come m g   this is the inclosier from my lady   i will not tell you that your behavior on sunday did not deeply shock me i had been foolish enough to think of other plans and to fancy your heart if you had any was fixed elsewhere than on one at whose foibles you have often laughed with me and whose person at least cannot have charmed you  my stepdaughter will not i presume marry without at least going through the ceremony of asking my consent i cannot as yet give it have i not reason to doubt whether she will be happy in trusting herself to you  but she is of age and has the right to receive in her own house all those who may be agreeable to hercertainly you who are likely to be one day so nearly connected with her if i have honest reason to believe that your love for miss griffin is sincere if i find in a few months that you yourself are still desirous to marry her i can of course place no further obstacles in your way  you are welcome then to return to our hotel i cannot promise to receive you as i did of old you would despise me if i did i can promise however to think no more of all that has passed between us and yield up my own happiness for that of the daughter of my dear husband  l e g   well now ant this a manly straitforard letter enough and natral from a woman whom we had to confess the truth treated most scuvvily master thought so and went and made a tender respeckful speach to lady griffin a little flumry costs nothink grave and sorroflle he kist her hand and speakin in a very low adgitayted voice calld hevn to witness how he deplord that his conduct should ever have given rise to such an unfornt ideer but if he might offer her esteem respect the warmest and tenderest admiration he trusted she would accept the same and a deal moar flumry of the kind with dark sollum glansis of the eyes and plenty of white pockithankercher  he thought hed make all safe poar fool he was in a netsich a net as i never yet see set to ketch a roag in    chapter vi  the jewel   the shevalier de lorge the young frenchmin whom i wrote of in my last who had been rather shy of his visits while master was coming it so very strong now came back to his old place by the side of lady griffin there was no love now though betwigst him and master although the shevallier had got his lady back agin deuceace being compleatly devoted to his crookid veanus  the shevalier was a little pale moddist insinifishnt creature and i shoodnt have thought from his appearants would have the heart to do harm to a fli much less to stand befor such a tremendious tiger and fireeater as my master but i see putty well after a week from his manner of going onof speakin at master and lookin at him and olding his lips tight when deuceace came into the room and glaring at him with his is that he hated the honrabble algernon percy  shall i tell you why because my lady griffin hated him hated him wuss than pison or the devvle or even wuss than her daughterinlaw praps you phansy that the letter you have juss red was honest praps you amadgin that the sean of the reading of the will came on by mere chans and in the reglar cors of suckmstansies it was all a game i tell youa reglar trap and that extrodnar clever young man my master as neatly put his foot into it as ever a pocher did in fesnt preserve  the shevalier had his q from lady griffin when deuceace went off the feald back came de lorge to her feet not a witt less tender than befor por fellow por fellow he really loved this woman he might as well have foln in love with a boreconstructor he was so blinded and beat by the power wich she had got over him that if she told him black was white hed beleave it or if she ordered him to commit murder hed do it she wanted something very like it i can tell you  ive already said how in the fust part of their acquaintance master used to laff at de lorges bad inglish and funny ways the little creature had a thowsnd of these and being small and a frenchman master in cors looked on him with that goodhumored kind of contemp which a good brittn ot always to show he rayther treated him like an intelligent munky than a man and ordered him about as if hed bean my ladys footman  all this munseer took in very good part until after the quarl betwigst master and lady griffin when that lady took care to turn the tables whenever master and miss were not present as ive heard the servants say she used to laff at shevalliay for his obeajance and sivillatty to master for her part she wondered how a man of his birth could act a servnt how any man could submit to such contemsheous behavior from another and then she told him how deuceace was always snearing at him behind his back how in fact he ought to hate him corjaly and how it was suttaly time to show his sperrit  well the poar little man beleaved all this from his hart and was angry or pleased gentle or quarlsum igsactly as my lady liked there got to be frequint rows betwigst him and master sharp words flung at each other across the dinnertable dispewts about handing ladies their smelingbotls or seeing them to their carridge or going in and out of a roam fust or any such nonsince  for hevns sake i heerd my lady in the midl of one of these tiffs say pail and the tears trembling in her is do do be calm mr deuceace monsieur de lorge i beseech you to forgive him you are both of you so esteemed lovd by members of this family that for its peace as well as your own you should forbear to quarrel  it was on the way to the sally mangy that this brangling had begun and it ended jest as they were seating themselves i shall never forgit poar little de lorges eyes when my lady said both of you he staird at my lady for a momint turned pail red lookd wild and then going round to master shook his hand as if he would have wrung it off mr deuceace only bowd and grind and turned away quite stately miss heaved a loud o from her busm and looked up in his face with an igspreshn jest as if she could have eat him up with love and the little shevalliay sate down to his soopplate and wus so happy that im blest if he wasnt crying he thought the widdow had made her declyration and would have him and so thought deuceace who lookd at her for some time mighty bitter and contempshus and then fell atalking with miss  now though master didnt choose to marry lady griffin as he might have done he yet thought fit to be very angry at the notion of her marrying anybody else and so consquintly was in a fewry at this confision which she had made regarding her parshaleaty for the french shevaleer  and this ive perseaved in the cors of my expearants through life that when you vex him a roags no longer a roag you find him out at onst when hes in a passion for he shows as it ware his cloven foot the very instnt you tread on it at least this is what young roags do it requires very cool blood and long practis to get over this pint and not to show your pashn when you feel it and snarl when you are angry old crabs wouldnt do it being like another noblemin of whom i heard the duke of wellington say while waiting behind his gracis chair that if you were kicking him from behind no one standing before him would know it from the bewtifle smiling igspreshn of his face young master hadnt got so far in the thiefs grammer and when he was angry showd it and its also to be remarked a very profownd observatin for a footmin but we have is though we do wear plush britchis its to be remarked i say that one of these chaps is much sooner maid angry than another because honest men yield to other people roags never do honest men love other people roags only themselves and the slightest thing which comes in the way of thir beloved objects sets them fewrious master hadnt led a life of gambling swindling and every kind of debotch to be goodtempered at the end of it i prommis you  he was in a pashun and when he was in a pashn a more insalent insuffrable overbearing broot didnt live  this was the very pint to which my lady wished to bring him for i must tell you that though she had been trying all her might to set master and the shevalliay by the years she had suxeaded only so far as to make them hate each profowndly but somehow or other the 2 cox wouldnt fight  i doant think deuceace ever suspected any game on the part of her ladyship for she carried it on so admirally that the quarls which daily took place betwigst him and the frenchman never seemed to come from her on the contry she acted as the reglar peasemaker between them as ive just shown in the tiff which took place at the door of the sally mangy besides the 2 young men though reddy enough to snarl were natrally unwilling to come to bloes ill tell you why being friends and idle they spent their mornins as young fashnabbles genrally do at billiads fensing riding pistleshooting or some such improoving study in billiads master beat the frenchman hollow and had won a pretious sight of money from him but thats neither here nor there or as the french say ontry noo at pistleshooting master could knock down eight immidges out of ten and de lorge seven and in fensing the frenchman could pink the honorable algernon down evry one of his weskit buttns theyd each of them been out more than onst for every frenchman will fight and master had been obleagd to do so in the cors of his bisniss and knowing each others curridg as well as the fact that either could put a hundrid bolls running into a hat at 30 yards they wairnt very willing to try such exparrymence upon their own hats with their own heads in them so you see they kep quiet and only grould at each other  but today deuceace was in one of his thundering black humers and when in this way he wouldnt stop for man or devvle i said that he walked away from the shevalliay who had given him his hand in his sudden bust of joyfle goodhumor and who i do bleave would have hugd a shebear so very happy was he master walked away from him pale and hotty and taking his seat at table no moor mindid the brandishments of miss griffin but only replied to them with a pshaw or a dam at one of us servnts or abuse of the soop or the wine cussing and swearing like a trooper and not like a wellbred son of a noble british peer  will your ladyship says he slivering off the wing of a pully ally bashymall allow me to help you  i thank you no but i will trouble monsieur de lorge and towards that gnlmn she turned with a most tender and fasnating smile  your ladyship has taken a very sudden admiration for mr de lorges carving you used to like mine once  you are very skilful but today if you will allow me i will partake of something a little simpler  the frenchman helped and being so happy in cors spilt the gravy a great blob of brown sos spurted on to masters chick and myandrewed down his shertcollar and virgingwhite weskit  confound you says he m de lorge you have done this on purpose and down went his knife and fork over went his tumbler of wine a deal of it into poar miss griffinses lap who looked fritened and ready to cry  my lady bust into a fit of laffin peel upon peel as if it was the best joak in the world de lorge giggled and grind too pardong says he meal pardong mong share munseer  and he looked as if he would have done it again for a penny        in the long dialogues we have generally ventured to      change the peculiar spelling of our friend mr yellowplush  the little frenchman was quite in extasis he found himself all of a suddn at the very top of the trea and the laff for onst turned against his rivle he actialy had the ordassaty to propose to my lady in english to take a glass of wine  veal you says he in his jargin take a glas of madere viz me mi ladi and he looked round as if hed igsackly hit the english manner and pronunciation  with the greatest pleasure says lady g most graciously nodding at him and gazing at him as she drank up the wine shed refused master before and this didnt increase his goodhumer  well they went on master snarling snapping and swearing making himself i must confess as much of a blaggard as any i ever see and my lady employing her time betwigst him and the shevalliay doing every think to irritate master and flatter the frenchmn desert came and by this time miss was stockstill with fright the chevaleer half tipsy with pleasure and gratafied vannaty my lady puffickly raygent with smiles and master bloo with rage  mr deuceace says my lady in a most winning voice after a little chaffing in which she only worked him up moar and moar may i trouble you for a few of those grapes they look delicious  for answer master seasd hold of the grayp dish and sent it sliding down the table to de lorge upsetting in his way fruitplates glasses dickanters and heaven knows what  monsieur de lorge says he shouting out at the top of his voice have the goodness to help lady griffin she wanted my grapes long ago and has found out they are sour                                  there was a dead paws of a moment or so                                  ah says my lady vous osez minsulter devant mes gens dans ma propre maisoncest par trop fort monsieur and up she got and flung out of the room miss followed her screeching out mammafor gods sakelady griffin and here the door slammed on the pair  her ladyship did very well to speak french de lorge would not have understood her else as it was he heard quite enough and as the door clikt too in the presents of me and messeers mortimer and fitzclarence the family footmen he walks round to my master and hits him a slap on the face and says prends ca menteur et lache which means take that you liar and cowardrayther strong igspreshns for one genlmn to use to another  master staggered back and looked bewildered and then he gave a kind of a scream and then he made a run at the frenchman and then me and mortimer flung ourselves upon him whilst fitzclarence embraced the shevalliay  a demain says he clinching his little fist and walking away not very sorry to git off  when he was fairly down stares we let go of master who swallowed a goblit of water and then pawsing a little and pullout his pus he presented to messeers mortimer and fitzclarence a luydor each i will give you five more tomorrow says he if you will promise to keep this secrit  and then he walked in to the ladies if you knew says he going up to lady griffin and speaking very slow in cors we were all at the keyhole the pain i have endured in the last minute in consequence of the rudeness and insolence of which i have been guilty to your ladyship you would think my own remorse was punishment sufficient and would grant me pardon  my lady bowed and said she didnt wish for explanations mr deuceace was her daughters guest and not hers but she certainly would never demean herself by sitting again at table with him and so saying out she boltid again  oh algernon algernon says miss in teers what is this dreadful mysterythese fearful shocking quarrels tell me has anything happened where where is the chevalier  master smiled and said be under no alarm my sweetest matilda de lorge did not understand a word of the dispute he was too much in love for that he is but gone away for half an hour i believe and will return to coffee  i knew what masters game was for if miss had got a hinkling of the quarrel betwigst him and the frenchman we should have had her screeming at the hotel mirabeu and the juice and all to pay he only stopt for a few minnits and cumfitted her and then drove off to his friend captain bullseye of the rifles with whom i spose he talked over this unplesnt bisniss we fownd at our hotel a note from de lorge saying where his secknd was to be seen  two mornings after there was a parrowgraf in gallynannys messinger which i hear beg leaf to transcribe   fearful duelyesterday morning at six oclock a meeting took place in the bois de boulogne between the hon a p dcece a younger son of the earl of crbs and the chevalier de lo the chevalier was attended by major de m of the royal guard and the hon mr d by captain bllsye of the british rifle corps as far as we have been able to learn the particulars of this deplorable affair the dispute originated in the house of a lovely lady one of the most brilliant ornaments of our embassy and the duel took place on the morning ensuing  the chevalier the challenged party and the most accomplished amateur swordsman in paris waived his right of choosing the weapons and the combat took place with pistols  the combatants were placed at forty paces with directions to advance to a barrier which separated them only eight paces each was furnished with two pistols monsieur de lo fired almost immediately and the ball took effect in the left wrist of his antagonist who dropped the pistol which he held in that hand he fired however directly with his right and the chevalier fell to the ground we fear mortally wounded a ball has entered above his hipjoint and there is very little hope that he can recover  we have heard that the cause of this desperate duel was a blow which the chevalier ventured to give to the hon mr d if so there is some reason for the unusual and determined manner in which the duel was fought  mr deuae returned to his hotel whither his excellent father the right hon earl of crbs immediately hastened on hearing of the sad news and is now bestowing on his son the most affectionate parental attention the news only reached his lordship yesterday at noon while at breakfast with his excellency lord bobtail our ambassador the noble earl fainted on receiving the intelligence but in spite of the shock to his own nerves and health persisted in passing last night by the couch of his son   and so he did this is a sad business charles says my lord to me after seeing his son and settling himself down in our salong have you any segars in the house and hark ye send me up a bottle of wine and some luncheon i can certainly not leave the neighborhood of my dear boy    chapter vii  the consquinsies   the shevalliay did not die for the ball came out of its own accord in the midst of a violent fever and inflamayshn which was brot on by the wound he was kept in bed for 6 weeks though and did not recover for a long time after  as for master his lot im sorry to say was wuss than that of his advisary inflammation came on too and to make an ugly story short they were obliged to take off his hand at the rist  he bore it in cors like a trojin and in a month he too was well and his wound heeld but i never see a man look so like a devvle as he used sometimes when he looked down at the stump  to be sure in miss griffinses eyes this only indeerd him the mor she sent twenty noats a day to ask for him calling him her beloved her unfortunat her hero her wictim and i dono what ive kep some of the noats as i tell you and curiously sentimentle they are beating the sorrows of macwhirter all to nothing  old crabs used to come offen and consumed a power of wine and seagars at our house i bleave he was at paris because there was an exycution in his own house in england and his son was a sure find as they say during his illness and couldnt deny himself to the old genlmn his eveninx my lord spent reglar at lady griffins where as master was ill i didnt go any more now and where the shevalier wasnt there to disturb him  you see how that woman hates you deuceace says my lord one day in a fit of cander after they had been talking about lady griffin she has not done with you yet i tell you fairly  curse her says master in a fury lifting up his maimd armcurse her but i will be even with her one day i am sure of matilda i took care to put that beyond the reach of a failure the girl must marry me for her own sake  for her own sake o ho good good my lord lifted his is and said gravely i understand my dear boy it is an excellent plan  well says master grinning fearcely and knowingly at his exlent old father as the girl is safe what harm can i fear from the fiend of a stepmother  my lord only gev a long whizzle and soon after taking up his hat walked off i saw him sawnter down the plas vandome and go in quite calmly to the old door of lady griffinses hotel bless his old face such a puffickly goodnatured kindhearted merry selfish old scoundrel i never shall see again  his lordship was quite right in saying to master that lady griffin hadnt done with him no moar she had but she never would have thought of the nex game she was going to play if somebody hadnt put her up to it who did if you red the above passidge and saw how a venrabble old genlmn took his hat and sauntered down the plas vandome looking hard and kind at all the nussarymaidsbuns they call them in francein the way i leave you to guess who was the author of the nex scheam a woman suttnly never would have pitcht on it  in the fuss payper which i wrote concerning mr deuceaces adventers and his kind behayvior to messrs dawkins and blewitt i had the honor of laying before the public a skidewl of my masters detts in witch was the following itim        bills of xchange and ious 4963l 0s 0d   the iouse were trifling say a thowsnd pound the bills amountid to four thowsnd moar  now the lor is in france that if a genlmn gives these in england and a french genlmn gits them in any way he can pursew the englishman who has drawn them even though he should be in france master did not know this factlaboring under a very common mistak that when onst out of england he might wissle at all the debts he left behind him  my lady griffin sent over to her slissators in london who made arrangemints with the persons who possest the fine collection of ortografs on stampt paper which master had left behind him and they were glad enuff to take any oppertunity of getting back their money  one fine morning as i was looking about in the courtyard of our hotel talking to the servantgals as was my reglar custom in order to improve myself in the french languidge one of them comes up to me and says tenez monsieur charles down below in the office there is a bailiff with a couple of gendarmes who is asking for your masteratil des dettes par hasard  i was struck all of a heapthe truth flasht on my minds hi toinette says i for that was the gals nametoinette says i giving her a kiss keep them for two minits as you valyou my affeckshn and then i gave her another kiss and ran up stares to our chambers master had now pretty well recovered of his wound and was aloud to drive abowt it was lucky for him that he had the strength to move sir sir says i the bailiffs are after you and you must run for your life  bailiff says he nonsense i dont thank heaven owe a shilling to any man  stuff sir says i forgetting my respeck dont you owe money in england i tell you the bailiffs are here and will be on you

an old waiter when toinette sees master she smiles and says dis donc charles ou est donc ton maitre chez lui nestce pas cest le jeune a monsieur says she curtsying to the bailiff  the old waiter was just agoing to blurt out mais ce nest pas when toinette stops him and says laissez donc passer ces messieurs vieux bete and in they walk the 2 jon darms taking their post in the hall  master throws open the salong doar very gravely and touching my hat says have you any orders about the cab sir  why no chawls says i i shant drive out today  the old bailiff grinned for he understood english having had plenty of english customers and says in french as master goes out i think sir you had better let your servant get a coach for i am under the painful necessity of arresting you au nom de la loi for the sum of ninetyeight thousand seven hundred francs owed by you to the sieur jacques francois lebrun of paris and he pulls out a number of bills with masters acceptances on them sure enough  take a chair sir says i and down he sits and i began to chaff him as well as i could about the weather my illness my sad axdent having lost one of my hands which was stuck into my busum and so on  at last after a minnit or two i could contane no longer and bust out in a horse laff  the old fellow turned quite pail and began to suspect somethink hola says he gendarmes a moi a moi je suis floue vole which means in english that he was reglar sold  the jondarmes jumped into the room and so did toinette and the waiter grasefly rising from my armchare i took my hand from my dressinggownd and flinging it open stuck up on the chair one of the neatest legs ever seen  i then pinted majesticklyto what do you thinkto my plush tites those sellabrated inigspressables which have rendered me famous in yourope  taking the hint the jondarmes and the servnts rord out laffing and so did charles yellowplush esquire i can tell you old grippard the bailiff looked as if he would faint in his chare  i heard a kab galloping like mad out of the hotelgate and knew then that my master was safe    chapter viii  the end of mr deuceaces history limbo   my tail is droring rabidly to a close my suvvice with mr deuceace didnt continyou very long after the last chapter in which i described my admiral strattyjam and my singlar selfdevocean theres very few servnts i can tell you whod have thought of such a contrivance and very few moar would have eggsycuted it when thought of  but after all beyond the trifling advantich to myself in selling masters roab de sham which you gentle reader may remember i woar and in dixcovering a fipun note in one of the pocketsbeyond this i say there was to poar master very little advantich in what had been done its true he had escaped very good but frans is not like great brittin a man in a livry coat with 1 arm is pretty easily known and caught too as i can tell you  such was the case with master he coodn leave paris moarover if he would what was to become in that case of his bridehis unchbacked hairis he knew that young ladys temprimong as the parishers say too well to let her long out of his site she had nine thousand a yer shed been in love a duzn times befor and mite be agin the honrabble algernon deuceace was a little too wide awake to trust much to the constnsy of so very inflammable a young creacher heavn bless us it was a marycle she wasnt earlier married i do bleave from suttn seans that past betwigst us that shed have married me if she hadnt been sejuiced by the supearor rank and indianuity of the genlmn in whose survace i was  well to use a commin igspreshn the beaks were after him how was he to manitch he coodn get away from his debts and he wooden quit the fare objict of his affeckshns he was ableejd then as the french say to lie perdewgoing out at night like a howl out of a hivybush and returning in the daytime to his roast for its a maxum in france and i wood it were followed in ingland that after dark no man is lible for his detts and in any of the royal gardensthe twillaries the pally roil or the lucksimbug for examplea man may wander from sunrise to evening and hear nothing of the ojus dunns they ant admitted into these places of public enjyment and rondyvoo any more than dogs the centuries at the gardengates having orders to shuit all such  master then was in this uncomfrable situationneither liking to go nor to stay peeping out at nights to have an interview with his miss ableagd to shuffle off her repeated questions as to the reason of all this disgeise and to talk of his two thowsnd a year jest as if he had it and didnt owe a shilling in the world  of course now he began to grow mighty eager for the marritch  he roat as many noats as she had done befor swoar against delay and cerymony talked of the pleasures of hyming the ardship that the ardor of two arts should be allowed to igspire the folly of waiting for the consent of lady griffin she was but a stepmother and an unkind one miss was he said a major might marry whom she liked and suttnly had paid lady g quite as much attention as she ought by paying her the compliment to ask her at all  and so they went on the curious thing was that when master was pressed about his cause for not coming out till nighttime he was misterus and miss griffin when asked why she wooden marry igsprest or rather didnt igspress a simlar secrasy wasnt it hard the cup seemed to be at the lip of both of em and yet somehow they could not manitch to take a drink  but one morning in reply to a most desprat epistol wrote by my master over night deuceace delighted gits an answer from his soals beluffd which ran thus   miss griffin to the hon a p deuceace  dearestyou say you would share a cottage with me there is no need luckily for that you plead the sad sinking of your spirits at our delayed union beloved do you think my heart rejoices at our separation you bid me disregard the refusal of lady griffin and tell me that i owe her no further duty  adored algernon i can refuse you no more i was willing not to lose a single chance of reconciliation with this unnatural stepmother respect for the memory of my sainted father bid me do all in my power to gain her consent to my union with you nay shall i own it prudence dictated the measure for to whom should she leave the share of money accorded to her by my fathers will but to my fathers child  but there are bounds beyond which no forbearance can go and thank heaven we have no need of looking to lady griffin for sordid wealth we have a competency without her is it not so dearest algernon  be it as you wish then dearest bravest and best your poor matilda has yielded to you her heart long ago she has no longer need to keep back her name name the hour and i will delay no more but seek for refuge in your arms from the contumely and insult which meet me ever here  matilda  ps oh algernon if you did but know what a noble part your dear father has acted throughout in doing his best endeavors to further our plans and to soften lady griffin it is not his fault that she is inexorable as she is i send you a note sent by her to lord crabs we will laugh at it soon nestce pas   ii  my lordin reply to your demand for miss griffins hand in favor of your son mr algernon deuceace i can only repeat what i before have been under the necessity of stating to youthat i do not believe a union with a person of mr deuceaces character would conduce to my stepdaughters happiness and therefore refuse my consent i will beg you to communicate the contents of this note to mr deuceace and implore you no more to touch upon a subject which you must be aware is deeply painful to me  i remain your lordships most humble servant  l e griffin  the right hon the earl of crabs   hang her ladyship says my master what care i for it as for the old lord whod been so afishous in his kindness and advice master recknsiled that pretty well with thinking that his lordship knew he was going to marry ten thousand a year and igspected to get some share of it for he roat back the following letter to his father as well as a flaming one to miss   thank you my dear father for your kindness in that awkward business you know how painfully i am situated just now and can pretty well guess both the causes of my disquiet a marriage with my beloved matilda will make me the happiest of men the dear girl consents and laughs at the foolish pretensions of her motherinlaw to tell you the truth i wonder she yielded to them so long carry your kindness a step further and find for us a parson a license and make us two into one we are both major you know so that the ceremony of a guardians consent is unnecessary  your affectionate  algernon deuceace  how i regret that difference between us some time back matters are changed now and shall be more still after the marriage   i knew what my master meantthat he would give the old lord the money after he was married and as it was probble that miss would see the letter he roat he made it such as not to let her see two clearly into his present uncomfrable situation  i took this letter along with the tender one for miss reading both of em in course by the way miss on getting hers gave an inegspressable look with the white of her is kist the letter and prest it to her busm lord crabs read his quite calm and then they fell atalking together and told me to wait awhile and i should git an anser  after a deal of counseltation my lord brought out a card and there was simply written on it        tomorrow at the ambassadors at twelve   carry that back to your master chawls says he and bid him not to fail  you may be sure i stept back to him pretty quick and gave him the card and the messinge master looked sattasfied with both but suttnly not over happy no man is the day before his marridge much more his marridge with a humpback harriss though she be  well as he was agoing to depart this bachelor life he did what every man in such suckmstances ought to do he made his willthat is he made a dispasition of his property and wrote letters to his creditors telling them of his lucky chance and that after his marridge he would sutnly pay them every stiver before they must know his povvaty well enough to be sure that paymint was out of the question  to do him justas he seamd to be inclined to do the thing that was right now that it didnt put him to any inkinvenients to do so  chawls says he handing me over a tenpunnote heres your wagis and thank you for getting me out of the scrape with the bailiffs when you are married you shall be my valet out of livry and ill treble your salary  his vallit praps his butler yes thought i heres a chancea vallit to ten thousand a year nothing to do but to shave him and read his notes and let my whiskers grow to dress in spick and span black and a clean shut per day muffings every night in the housekeepers room the pick of the gals in the servants hall a chap to clean my boots for me and my masters opera bone reglar once a week i knew what a vallit was as well as any genlmn in service and this i can tell you hes genrally a hapier idler handsomer mor genlmnly man than his master he has more money to spend for genlmn will leave their silver in their waistcoat pockets more suxess among the gals as good dinners and as good winethat is if hes friends with the butler and friends in corse they will be if they know which way their interest lies  but these are only cassels in the air what the french call shutter despang it wasnt roat in the book of fate that i was to be mr deuceaces vallit  days will pass at lasteven days befor a wedding the longist and unpleasantist day in the whole of a mans life i can tell you excep may be the day before his hanging and at length aroarer dawned on the suspicious morning which was to unite in the bonds of hyming the honrable algernon percy deuceace exquire and miss matilda griffin my masters wardrobe wasnt so rich as it had been for hed left the whole of his nicknax and trumpry of dressingcases and rob dy shams his bewtifle museum of varnished boots his curous colleckshn of stulz and staub coats when he had been ableaged to quit so suddnly our pore dear lodginx at the hotel mirabew and being incog at a friends house ad contentid himself with ordring a coople of shoots of cloves from a common tailor with a suffishnt quantaty of linning  well he put on the best of his coatsa blue and i thought it my duty to ask him whether hed want his frock again he was good natured and said take it and be hanged to you halfpast eleven oclock came and i was sent to look out at the door if there were any suspicious charicters a precious good nose i have to find a bailiff out i can tell you and an i which will almost see one round a corner and presenly a very modest green glass coach droave up and in master stept i didnt in corse appear on the box because being known my appearints might have compromised master but i took a short cut and walked as quick as posbil down to the rue de foburg st honore where his exlnsy the english ambasdor lives and where marridges are always performed betwigst english folk at paris                                  there is almost nex door to the ambasdors hotel another hotel of that lo kind which the french call cabbyrays or winehouses and jest as masters green glasscoach pulled up another coach drove off out of which came two ladies whom i knew pretty wellsuffiz that one had a humpback and the ingenious reader will know why she came there the other was poor miss kicksey who came to see her turned off  well masters glasscoach droav up jest as i got within a few yards of the door our carridge i say droav up and stopt down gits coachmin to open the door and comes i to give mr deuceace an arm when out of the cabaray shoot four fellows and draw up betwigst the coach and embassydoar two other chaps go to the other doar of the carridge and opening it one saysrendezvous m deuceace je vous arrete au nom de la loi which means get out of that mr d you are nabbed and no mistake master turned gashly pail and sprung to the other side of the coach as if a serpint had stung him he flung open the door and was for making off that way but he saw the four chaps standing betwigst libbarty and him he slams down the front window and screams out fouettez cocher which means go it coachmm in a despert loud voice but coachmin wooden go it and besides was off his box  the long and short of the matter was that jest as i came up to the door two of the bums jumped into the carridge i saw all i knew my duty and so very mornfly i got up behind  tiens says one of the chaps in the street cest ce drole qui nous a floure lautre jour i knew em but was too melumcolly to smile  ou ironsnous donc says coachmin to the genlmn who had got inside  a deep woice from the intearor shouted out in reply to the coachmin a sainte pelagie                                  and now praps i ot to dixcribe to you the humors of the prizn of sainte pelagie which is the french for fleat or queens bentch but on this subject im rather shy of writing partly because the admiral boz has in the history of mr pickwick made such a dixcripshun of a prizn that mine wooden read very amyousingly afterwids and also because to tell you the truth i didnt stay long in it being not in a humer to waist my igsistance by passing away the ears of my youth in such a dull place  my fust errint now was as you may phansy to carry a noat from master to his destined bride the poar thing was sadly taken aback as i can tell you when she found after remaining two hours at the embassy that her husband didnt make his appearance and so after staying on and on and yet seeing no husband she was forsed at last to trudge dishconslit home where i was already waiting for her with a letter from my master  there was no use now denying the fact of his arrest and so he confest it at onst but he made a cockandbull story of treachery of a friend infimous fodgery and heaven knows what however it didnt matter much if he had told her that he had been betrayed by the man in the moon she would have bleavd him  lady griffin never used to appear now at any of my visits she kep one drawingroom and miss dined and lived alone in another they quarld so much that praps it was best they should live apart only my lord crabs used to see both comforting each with that winning and innsnt way he had he came in as miss in tears was lisning to my account of masters seazure and hoping that the prisn wasnt a horrid place with a nasty horrid dunjeon and a dreadfle jailer and nasty horrid bread and water law bless us she had borrod her ideers from the novvles she had been reading  o my lord my lord says she have you heard this fatal story  dearest matilda what for heavens sake you alarm me whatyesnois itno it cant be speak says my lord seizing me by the choler of my coat what has happened to my boy  please you my lord says i hes at this moment in prisn no wusshaving been incarserated about two hours ago  in prison algernon in prison tis impossible imprisoned for what sum mention it and i will pay to the utmost farthing in my power  im sure your lordship is very kind says i recklecting the sean betwixgst him and master whom he wanted to diddil out of a thowsand lb and youll be happy to hear hes only in for a trifle five thousand pound is i think pretty near the mark  five thousand poundsconfusion says my lord clasping his hands and looking up to heaven and i have not five hundred dearest matilda how shall we help him  alas my lord i have but three guineas and you know how lady griffin has the  yes my sweet child i know what you would say but be of good cheeralgernon you know has ample funds of his own  thinking my lord meant dawkinss five thousand of which to be sure a good lump was left i held my tung but i cooden help wondering at lord crabss igstream compashn for his son and miss with her 10000l a year having only 3 guineas is her pockit  i took home bless us what a home a long and very inflamble letter from miss in which she dixscribed her own sorror at the disappointment swoar she lovd him only the moar for his misfortns made light of them as a pusson for a paltry sum of five thousand pound ought never to be cast down specially as he had a certain independence in view and vowed that nothing nothing should ever injuice her to part from him etsettler etsettler  i told master of the conversation which had past betwigst me and my lord and of his handsome offers and his horrow at hearing of his sons being taken and likewise mentioned how strange it was that miss should only have 3 guineas and with such a fortn bless us i should have thot that she would always have carried a hundred thowsnd lb in her pockit  at this master only said pshaw but the rest of the story about his father seemed to dixquiet him a good deal and he made me repeat it over agin  he walked up and down the room agytated and it seamd as if a new lite was breaking in upon him  chawls says he did you observedid missdid my father seem particularly intimate with miss griffin  how do you mean sir says i  did lord crabs appear very fond of miss griffin  he was suttnly very kind to her  come sir speak at once did miss griffin seem very fond of his lordship  why to tell the truth sir i must say she seemed very fond of him  what did he call her  he called her his dearest gal  did he take her hand  yes and he  and he what  he kist her and told her not to be so wery downhearted about the misfortn which had hapnd to you  i have it now says he clinching his fist and growing gashly paili have it nowthe infernal old hoary scoundrel the wicked unnatural wretch he would take her from me and he poured out a volley of oaves which are impossbill to be repeatid here  i thot as much long ago and when my lord kem with his vizits so pretious affeckshnt at my lady griffinses i expected some such game was in the wind indeed id heard a somethink of it from the griffinses servnts that my lord was mighty tender with the ladies  one thing however was evident to a man of his intleckshal capassaties he must either marry the gal at onst or he stood very small chance of having her he must get out of limbo immediantly or his respectid father might be stepping into his vaykint shoes oh he saw it all nowthe fust attempt at arest the marridge fixt at 12 oclock and the bayliffs fixt to come and intarup the marridgethe jewel praps betwigst him and de lorge but no it was the woman who did thata man dont deal such fowl blows igspecially a father to his son a woman may poar thingshes no other means of reventch and is used to fight with underhand wepns all her life through  well whatever the pint might be this deuceace saw pretty clear that hed been beat by his father at his own gamea trapp set for him onst which had been defitted by my presnts of mindanother trap set afterwids in which my lord had been suxesfle now my lord roag as he was was much too goodnatured to do an unkind ackshn mearly for the sake of doing it hed got to that pich that he didnt mind injariesthey were all fair play to himhe gave em and reseavd them without a thought of mallis if he wanted to injer his son it was to benefick himself and how was this to be done by getting the hairiss to himself to be sure the honrabble mr d didnt say so but i knew his feelinx well enoughhe regretted that he had not given the old genlmn the money he askt for  poar fello he thought he had hit it but he was wide of the mark after all  well but what was to be done it was clear that he must marry the gal at any ratecootky coot as the french say that is marry her and hang the igspence  to do so he must first git out of prisnto get out of prisn he must pay his debtsand to pay his debts he must give every shilling he was worth never mind four thousand pound is a small stake to a reglar gambler igspecially when he must play it or rot for life in prisn and when if he plays it well it will give him ten thousand a year  so seeing there was no help for it he maid up his mind and accordingly wrote the follying letter to miss griffin   my adored matildayour letter has indeed been a comfort to a poor fellow who had hoped that this night would have been the most blessed in his life and now finds himself condemned to spend it within a prison wall you know the accursed conspiracy which has brought these liabilities upon me and the foolish friendship which has cost me so much but what matters we have as you say enough even though i must pay this shameful demand upon me and five thousand pounds are as nothing compared to the happiness which i lose in being separated a night from thee courage however if i make a sacrifice it is for you and i were heartless indeed if i allowed my own losses to balance for a moment against your happiness  is it not so beloved one is not your happiness bound up with mine in a union with me i am proud to think soproud too to offer such a humble proof as this of the depth and purity of my affection  tell me that you will still be mine tell me that you will be mine tomorrow and tomorrow these vile chains shall be removed and i will be free once moreor if bound only bound to you my adorable matilda my betrothed bride write to me ere the evening closes for i shall never be able to shut my eyes in slumber upon my prison couch until they have been first blessed by the sight of a few words from thee write to me love write to me i languish for the reply which is to make or mar me for ever your affectionate  a p d   having polisht off this epistol master intrustid it to me to carry and bade me at the same time to try and give it into miss griffins hand alone i ran with it to lady griffinses i found miss as i desired in a sollatary condition and i presented her with masters pafewmed billy  she read it and the number of size to which she gave vint and the tears which she shed beggar digscription she wep and sighed until i thought she would bust she even claspt my hand in hers and said o charles is he very very miserable  he is maam says i very miserable indeednobody upon my honor could be miserablerer  on hearing this pethetic remark her mind was made up at onst and sitting down to her eskrewtaw she immediantly ableaged master with an answer here it is in black and white   my prisoned bird shall pine no more but fly home to its nest in these arms adored algernon i will meet thee tomorrow at the same place at the same hour then then it will be impossible for aught but death to divide us  m g   this kind of flumry style comes you see of reading novvles and cultivating littery purshuits in a small way how much better is it to be puffickly ignorant of the hart of writing and to trust to the writing of the heart this is my style artyfiz i despise and trust compleatly to natur but revnong a no mootong as our continential friends remark to that nice white sheep algernon percy deuceace exquire that wenrabble old ram my lord crabs his father and that tender and dellygit young lamb miss matilda griffin  she had just foalded up into its proper triangular shape the noat transcribed abuff and i was just on the point of saying according to my masters orders miss if you please the honrabble mr deuceace would be very much ableaged to you to keep the seminary which is to take place tomorrow a profound se when my masters father entered and i fell back to the door miss without a word rusht into his arms burst into teers agin as was her reglar way it must be confest she was of a very mist constitution and showing to him his sons note cried look my dear lord how nobly your algernon our algernon writes to me who can doubt after this of the purity of his matchless affection  my lord took the letter read it seamed a good deal amyoused and returning it to its owner said very much to my surprise my dear miss griffin he certainly does seem in earnest and if you choose to make this match without the consent of your motherinlaw you know the consequence and are of course your own mistress  consequencesfor shame my lord a little money more or less what matters it to two hearts like ours  hearts are very pretty things my sweet young lady but threepercents are better  nay have we not an ample income of our own without the aid of lady griffin  my lord shrugged his shoulders be it so my love says he im sure i can have no other reason to prevent a union which is founded upon such disinterested affection  and here the conversation dropt miss retired clasping her hands and making play with the whites of her is my lord began trotting up and down the room with his fat hands stuck in his britchis pockits his countnince lighted up with igstream joy and singing to my inordnit igstonishment        see the conquering hero comes       tiddy diddy dolltiddy doll doll doll   he began singing this song and tearing up and down the room like mad i stood amazda new light broke in upon me he wasnt going then to make love to miss griffin master might marry her had she not got the for  i say i was just standing stock still my eyes fixt my hands puppindicklar my mouf wide open and these igstrordinary thoughts passing in my mind when my lord having got to the last doll of his song just as i came to the sillible for of my ventriloquism or inward speechwe had eatch jest reached the pint digscribed when the meditations of both were sudnly stopt by my lord in the midst of his singin and trottin match coming bolt up aginst poar me sending me up aginst one end of the room himself flying back to the other and it was only after considrabble agitation that we were at length restored to anything like a liquilibrium  what you here you infernal rascal says my lord  your lordships very kind to notus me says i i am here and i gave him a look  he saw i knew the whole game  and after whisling a bit as was his habit when puzzled i bleave hed have only whisled if he had been told he was to be hanged in five minits after whisling a bit he stops sudnly and coming up to me says  hearkye charles this marriage must take place tomorrow  must it sir says i now for my part i dont think  stop my good fellow if it does not take place what do you gain  this staggerd me if it didnt take place i only lost a situation for master had but just enough money to pay his detts and it wooden soot my book to serve him in prisn or starving  well says my lord you see the force of my argument now look here and he lugs out a crisp fluttering snowy hundredpun note if my son and miss griffin are married tomorrow you shall have this and i will moreover take you into my service and give you double your present wages  flesh and blood cooden bear it my lord says i laying my hand upon my busm only give me security and im yours for ever  the old noblemin grind and pattid me on the shoulder right my lad says he rightyoure a nice promising youth here is the best security and he pulls out his pockitbook returns the hundredpun bill and takes out one for fifty here is half today tomorrow you shall have the remainder  my fingers trembled a little as i took the pretty fluttering bit of paper about five times as big as any sum of money i had ever had in my life i cast my i upon the amount it was a fifty sure enougha bank possbill made payable to leonora emilia griffin and indorsed by her the cat was out of the bag now gentle reader i spose you begin to see the game  recollect from this day you are in my service  my lord you overpoar me with your faviors  go to the devil sir says he do your duty and hold your tongue  and thus i went from the service of the honorabble algernon deuceace to that of his exlnsy the right honorabble earl of crabs                                  on going back to prisn i found deuceace locked up in that oajus place to which his igstravygansies had deservedly led him and felt for him i must say a great deal of contemp a raskle such as hea swindler who had robbed poar dawkins of the means of igsistance who had cheated his fellowroag mr richard blewitt and who was making a musnary marridge with a disgusting creacher like miss griffin didn merit any compashn on my purt and i determined quite to keep secret the suckmstansies of my privit intervew with his exlnsy my presnt master  i gev him miss griffinses trianglar which he read with a satasfied air then turning to me says he you gave this to miss griffin alone  yes sir  you gave her my message  yes sir  and you are quite sure lord crabs was not there when you gave either the message or the note  not there upon my honor says i  hang your honor sir brush my hat and coat and go call a coachdo you hear                                  i did as i was ordered and on coming back found master in whats called i think the greffe of the prisn the officer in waiting had out a great register and was talking to master in the french tongue in coarse a number of poar prisners were looking eagerly on  let us see my lor says he the debt is 98700 francs there are capture expenses interest so much and the whole sum amounts to a hundred thousand francs moins 13  deuceace in a very myjestic way takes out of his pocketbook four thowsnd pun notes this is not french money but i presume that you know it m greffier says he  the greffier turned round to old solomon a moneychanger who had one or two clients in the prisn and hapnd luckily to be there les billets sont bons says he je les prendrai pour cent mille douze cent francs et jespere my lor de vous revoir  good says the greffier i know them to be good and i will give my lor the difference and make out his release  which was done the poar debtors gave a feeble cheer as the great dubble iron gates swung open and clang to again and deuceace stept out and me after him to breathe the fresh hair  he had been in the place but six hours and was now free againfree and to be married to ten thousand a year nex day but for all that he lookt very faint and pale he had put down his great stake and when he came out of sainte pelagie he had but fifty pounds left in the world  never mindwhen onst the moneys down make your mind easy and so deuceace did he drove back to the hotel mirabew where he ordered apartmince infinately more splendid than befor and i pretty soon told toinette and the rest of the suvvants how nobly he behayved and how he valyoud four thousnd pound no more than ditch water and such was the consquincies of my praises and the poplarity i got for us boath that the delighted landlady immediantly charged him dubble what she would have done if it hadn been for my stoaries  he ordered splendid apartmince then for the nex week a carridgeandfour for fontainebleau tomorrow at 12 precisely and having settled all these things went quietly to the roshy de cancale where he dined as well he might for it was now eight oclock i didnt spare the shompang neither that night i can tell you for when i carried the note he gave me for miss griffin in the evening informing her of his freedom that young lady remarked my hagitated manner of walking and speaking and said honest charles he is flusht with the events of the day here charles is a napoleon take it and drink to your mistress  i pockitid it but i must say i didnt like the moneyit went

has he this is better and better are you thinking of going into the church deuceace  my lord may i ask you to be a little more serious  serious a quoi bon i am seriousserious in my surprise that when you might have had either of these women you should have preferred that hideous wife of yours  may i ask you in turn how you came to be so little squeamish about a wife as to choose a woman who had just been making love to your own son says deuceace growing fierce  how can you ask such a question i owe forty thousand poundsthere is an execution at sizes hallevery acre i have is in the hands of my creditors and thats why i married her do you think there was any love lady crabs is a devlish fine woman but shes not a foolshe married me for my coronet and i married her for her money  well my

my lordyou donti mean you cant d says he starting up and losing all patience you dont dare to say that miss griffin had not a fortune of ten thousand a year  my lord was rolling up and wetting betwigst his lips another segar he lookt up after he had lighted it and said quietly  certainly miss griffin had a fortune of ten thousand a year  well sir and has she not got it now has she spent it in a week  she has not got a sixpence now she married without her mothers consent  deuceace sunk down in a chair and i never see such a dreadful picture of despair as there was in the face of that retchid manhe writhed and nasht his teeth he tore open his coat and wriggled madly the stump of his left hand until fairly beat he threw it over his livid pale face and sinking backwards fairly wept alowd  bah its a dreddfle thing to hear a man crying his pashn torn up from the very roots of his heart as it must be before it can git such a vent my lord meanwhile rolled his segar lighted it and went on  my dear boy the girl has not a shilling i wished to have left you alone in peace with your four thousand pounds you might have lived decently upon it in germany where money is at 5 per cent where your duns would not find you and a couple of hundred a year would have kept you and your wife in comfort but you see lady crabs would not listen to it you had injured her and after she had tried to kill you and failed she determined to ruin you and succeeded i must own to you that i directed the arresting business and put her up to buying your protested bills she got them for a trifle and as you have paid them has made a good two thousand pounds by her bargain it was a painful thing to be sure for a father to get his son arrested but que voulezvous i did not appear in the transaction she would have you ruined and it was absolutely necessary that you should marry before i could so i pleaded your cause with miss griffin and made you the happy man you are you rogue you rogue you thought to match your old father did you but never mind lunch will be ready soon in the meantime have a segar and drink a glass of sauterne  deuceace who had been listening to this speech sprung up wildly  ill not believe it he said its a lie an infernal lie forged by you you hoary villain and by the murderess and strumpet you have married ill not believe it show me the will matilda matilda shouted he screaming hoarsely and flinging open the door by which she had gone out  keep your temper my boy you are vexed and i feel for you but dont use such bad language it is quite needless believe me  matilda shouted out deuceace again and the poor crooked thing came trembling in followed by miss kicksey  is this true woman says he clutching hold of her hand  what dear algernon says she  what screams out deuceacewhat why that you are a beggar for marrying without your mothers consentthat you basely lied to me in order to bring about this matchthat you are a swindler in conspiracy with that old fiend yonder and the shedevil his wife  it is true sobbed the poor woman that i have nothing but  nothing but what why dont you speak you drivelling fool  i have nothingbut you dearest have two thousand a year is that not enough for us you love me for myself dont you algernon you have told me so a thousand timessay so again dear husband and do not do not be so unkind and here she sank on her knees and clung to him and tried to catch his hand and kiss it  how much did you say says my lord  two thousand a year sir he has told us so a thousand times  two thousand two thouho ho hohaw haw haw roars my lord that is i vow the best thing i ever heard in my life my dear creature he has not a shillingnot a single maravedi by all the gods and goddesses and this exlnt noblemin began laffin louder than ever a very kind and feeling genlmn he was as all must confess  there was a paws and mrs deuceace didn begin cussing and swearing at her husband as he had done at her she only said o algernon is this true and got up and went to a chair and wep in quiet  my lord opened the great box if you or your lawyers would like to examine sir georges will it is quite at your service you will see here the proviso which i mentioned that gives the entire fortune to lady griffinlady crabs that is and here my dear boy you see the danger of hasty conclusions her ladyship only showed you the first page of the will of course she wanted to try you you thought you made a great stroke in at once proposing to miss griffindo not mind it my love he really loves you now very sincerelywhen in fact you would have done much better to have read the rest of the will you were completely bitten my boyhumbugged bamboozleday and by your old father you dog i told you i would you know when you refused to lend me a

occurred to interrupt the friendship between her dear mother and herself  and for me sir says deuceace speaking faint and very slow i hopei trusti think my lord you will not forget me  forget you sir certainly not  and that you will make some provision  algernon deuceace says my lord getting up from the sophy and looking at him with sich a jolly malignity as i never see i declare before heaven that i will not give you a penny  hereupon my lord held out his hand to mrs deuceace and said my dear will you join your mother and me we shall always as i said have a home for you  my lord said the poar thing dropping a curtsy my home is with him                                  about three months after when the season was beginning at paris and the autumn leafs was on the ground my lord my lady me and mortimer were taking a stroal in the boddy balong the carridge driving on slowly ahead and us as happy as possbill admiring the pleasant woods and the goldn sunset  my lord was expayshating to my lady upon the exquizit beauty of the sean and pouring forth a host of butifle and virtuous sentaments sootable to the hour it was dalitefle to hear him ah said he black must be the heart my love which does not feel the influence of a scene like this gathering as it were from those sunlit skies a portion of their celestial gold and gaining somewhat of heaven with each pure draught of this delicious air  lady crabs did not speak but prest his arm and looked upwards mortimer and i too felt some of the infliwents of the sean and lent on our goold sticks in silence the carriage drew up close to us and my lord and my lady sauntered slowly tords it  jest at the place was a bench and on the bench sate a poorly drest woman and by her leaning against a tree was a man whom i thought id sean befor he was drest in a shabby blew coat with white seems and copper buttons a torn hat was on his head and great quantaties of matted hair and whiskers disfiggared his countnints he was not shaved and as pale as stone  my lord and lady didn tak the slightest notice of him but past on to the carridge me and mortimer lickwise took our places as we past the man had got a grip of the womans shoulder who was holding down her head sobbing bitterly  no sooner were my lord and lady seated than they both with igstream dellixy and good natur burst into a ror of lafter peal upon peal whooping and screaching enough to frighten the evening silents  deuceace turned round i see his face nowthe face of a devvle of hell fust he lookt towards the carridge and pinted to it with his maimed arm then he raised the other and struck the woman by his side she fell screaming  poor thing poor thing     mr yellowplushs ajew   the end of mr deuceaces history is going to be the end of my corrispondince i wish the public was as sory to part with me as i am with the public becaws i fansy reely that weve become frends and feal for my part a becoming greaf at saying ajew  its imposbill for me to continyow

cyclopaedy and how be doctor larner told her that on his honner it was under ten thowsnd  you may guess that the doctor when he made this speach was pretty far gone the fact is that whether it was the coronation or the goodness of the wine cappitle it is in our house i can tell you or the natral propensaties of the gests assembled which made them so igspecially jolly i dont know but they had kep up

whigs must of course stand by our own friends and i will agree without a moments hesitation that the literary whatdyecallem is the prince of periodicals  the pwince of pewiodicals says bullwig my dear sir john its the empewow of the pwess  soitlet it be the emperor of the press as you poetically call it but between ourselves confess itdo not the tory writers beat your whigs hollow you talk about magazines look at  look at hwat shouts out larder theres none sir jan compared to ourrs  pardon me i think that  it is bentleys mislany you mane says ignatius as sharp as a niddle  why no but  o thin its coburn sure and that divvle thayodora pretty paper sir but lightthrashy milkandwatherynot sthrong like the litherary chrangood luck to it  why doctor lander i was going to tell at once the name of the periodical its frasers magazine  freser says the doctor o thunder and turf  fwaser says bullwig oahhumhawyesnowhythat is weallyno weally upon my weputation i never before heard the name of the pewiodical by the by sir john what wemarkable good clawet this is is it lawose or laff  laff indeed he cooden git beyond laff and im blest if i could kip it neitherfor hearing him pretend ignurnts and being behind the skreend settlin somethink for the genlmn i bust into such a raw of laffing as never was igseeded  hullo says bullwig turning red have i said anything impwobable aw widiculous for weally i never befaw wecollect to have heard in society such a twemendous peal of cachinnationthat which the twagic bard who fought at mawathon has called an anewithmon gelasma  why be the holy piper says larder i think you are dthrawing a little on your imagination not read fraser dont believe him my lord duke he reads every word of it the rogue the boys about that magazine baste him as if he was a sack of oatmale my reason for crying out sir jan was because you mintioned fraser at all bullwig has every syllable of it be heartfrom the pailitix down to the yellowplush correspondence  ha ha says bullwig affecting to laff you may be sure my ears prickt up when i heard the name of the yellowplush correspondence ha ha why to tell truth i have wead the cowespondence to which you allude its a gweat favowite at court i was talking with spwing wice and john wussell about it the other day  well and what do you think of it says sir john looking mity waggishfor he knew it was me who roat it  why weally and twuly theres considewable cleverness about the cweature but its low disgustingly low it violates pwabability and the orthogwaphy is so carefully inaccuwate that it requires a positive study to compwehend it  yes faith says larner the arthagraphy is detestible its as bad for a man to write bad spillin as it is for em to speak wid a brrogue iducation furst and ganius afterwards your health my lord and good luck to you  yaw wemark says bullwig is vewy appwopwiate you will wecollect sir john in hewodotus as for you doctor you know more about iwish than about gweekyou will wecollect without doubt a stowy nawwated by that cwedulous though fascinating chwonicler of a certain kind of sheep which is known only in a certain distwict of awabia and of which the tail is so enormous that it either dwaggles on the gwound or is bound up by the shepherds of the country into a small wheelbawwow or cart which makes the chwonicler sneewingly wemark that thus the sheep of awabia have their own chawiots i have often thought sir this clawet is weally nectaweousi have often i say thought that the wace of man may be compawed to these awabian sheepgenius is our tail education our wheelbawwow without art and education to pwop it this genius dwops on the gwound and is polluted by the mud or injured by the wocks upon the way with the wheelbawwow it is stwengthened incweased and supporteda pwide to the owner a blessing to mankind  a very appropriate simile says sir john and i am afraid that the genius of our friend yellowplush has need of some such support  apropos said bullwig who is yellowplush i was given to understand that the name was only a fictitious one and that the papers were written by the author of the diary of a physician if so the man has wonderfully improved in style and there is some hope of him  bah says the duke of doublejowl everybody knows its barnard the celebrated author of sam slick  pardon my dear duke says lord bagwig its the authoress of high life almacks and other fashionable novels  fiddlesticks end says doctor larner dont be blushing and pretinding to ask questions dont we know you bullwig its you yourself you thief of the world we smoked you from the very beginning  bullwig was about indignantly to reply when sir john interrupted them and saidi must correct you all gentlemen mr yellowplush is no other than mr yellowplush he gave you my dear bullwig your last glass of champagne at dinner and is now an inmate of my house and an ornament of my kitchen  gad says doublejowl lets have him up  hear hear says bagwig  ah now says larner your grace is not going to call up and talk to a footman sure is it gintale  to say the least of it says bullwig the pwactice is iwwegular and indecowous and i weally dont see how the interview can be in any way pwofitable  but the vices of the company went against the two littery men and everybody excep them was for having up poor me the bell was wrung butler came send up charles says master and charles who was standing behind the skreand was persnly abliged to come in  charles says master i have been telling these gentlemen who is the author of the yellowplush correspondence in frasers magazine  its the best magazine in europe says the duke  and no mistake says my lord  hwhat says larner and wheres the litherary chran  i said myself nothink but made a bough and blusht like picklecabbitch  mr yellowplush says his grace will you in the first place drink a glass of wine  i boughed agin  and what wine do you prefer sir humble port or imperial burgundy  why your grace says i i know my place and aint above kitchin wines i will take a glass of port and drink it to the health of this honrabble compny  when id swigged off the bumper which his grace himself did me the honor to pour out for me there was a silints for a minnit when my master said  charles yellowplush i have perused your memoirs in frasers magazine with so much curiosity and have so high an opinion of your talents as a writer that i really cannot keep you as a footman any longer or allow you to discharge duties for which you are now quite unfit with all my admiration for your talents mr yellowplush i still am confident that many of your friends in the servantshall will clean my boots a great deal better than a gentleman of your genius can ever be expected to doit is for this purpose i employ footmen and not that they may be writing articles in magazines butyou need not look so red my good fellow and had better take another glass of porti dont wish to throw you upon the wide world without

all languages are familiar to me all thoughts are known to me all men understood by me i have gathered wisdom from the honeyed lips of plato as we wandered in the gardens of acadameswisdom too from the mouth of job johnson as we smoked our backy in seven dials such must be the studies and such is the mission in this world of the poetphilosopher but the knowledge is only emptiness the initiation

gweat cause of fweedom that i have celebwated are known to all but this i confess has nothing to do with the question no the question is thison the thwone of litewature i stand unwivalled pweeminent and the bwitish government honowing genius in me compliments the bwitish nation by lifting into the bosom of the heweditawy nobility the most gifted member of the democwacy the honrabble genlm here sunk down amidst repeated cheers  sir john says i and my lord duke the words of my rivrint frend ignatius and the remarks of the honrabble genlmn who has just sate down have made me change the detummination which i had the honor of igspressing just now  i igsept the eighty pound a year knowing that i shall ave plenty of time for pursuing my littery career and hoping some day to set on that same bentch of barranites which is deckarated by the presnts of my honrabble friend  why shooden i its trew i aint done anythink as yet to deserve such an honor and its very probable that i never shall but what thenquaw dong as our friends say id much rayther have a coatofarms than a coat of livry id much rayther have my bludred hand spralink in the middle of a shield than underneath a teatray a barranit i will be and in consiquints must cease to be a footmin  as to my politticle princepills these i confess aint settled they are i know necessary but they aint necessary until askt for besides i reglar read the sattarist newspaper and so ignirince on this pint would be inigscusable  but if one man can git to be a doctor and another a barranit and another a capting in the navy and another a countess and another the wife of a governor of the cape of good hope i begin to perseave that the littery trade aint such a very bad un igspecially if youre up to snough and know whats oclock ill learn to make myself usefle in the fust place then ill larn to spell and i trust by reading the novvles of the honrabble member and the scientafick treatiseses of the reverend doctor i may find the secrit of suxess and git a litell for my own share ive sevral frends in the press having paid for many of those chaps drink and given them other treets and so i think ive got all the emilents of suxess therefore i am detummined as i said to igsept your kind offer and beg to withdraw the wuds which i made yous of when i refyoused your hoxpatable offer i must however  i wish youd withdraw yourself said sir john bursting into a most igstrorinary rage and not interrupt the company with your infernal talk go down and get us coffee and hark ye hold your impertinent tongue or ill break every bone in your body you shall have the place as i said and while youre in my service you shall be my servant but you dont stay in my service after tomorrow go down stairs sir and dont stand staring here                                  in this abrupt way my evening ended its with a melancholy regret that i think what came of it i dont wear plush any more i am an altered a wiser and i trust a better man  im about a novvle having made great progriss in spelling in the style of my friend bullwig and preparing for publigation in the doctors cyclopedear the lives of eminent british and foring wosherwomen    skimmings from the dairy of george iv   charles yellowplush esq to oliver yorke esq  dear whytakin advantage of the crismiss holydays sir john and me who is a member of parlyment had gone down to our place in yorkshire for six wicks to shoot grows and woodcox and enjoy old english hospitalaty this ugly canady bisniss unluckaly put an end to our sports in the country and brot us up to buckly square as fast as four posterses could gallip when there i found your parcel containing the two vollumes of a new book which as i have been away from the literary world and emplied solely in athlatic exorcises have been laying neglected in my pantry among my knifecloaths and dekanters and blackingbottles and bedroom candles and things    these memoirs were originally published in frasers magazine and it may be stated for the benefit of the unlearned in such matters that oliver yorke is the assumed name of the editor of that periodical   this will im sure account for my delay in notussing the work i see sefral of the papers and magazeens have been befoarhand with me and have given their apinions concerning it specially the quotly revew which has most mussilessly cut to peases the author of this dairy of the times of george iv    diary illustrative of the times of george the fourth interspersed with original letters from the late queen caroline and from various other distinguished persons           tot ou tard tout se scaitmaintenon  in 2 vols london 1838 henry colburn   that its a woman who wrote it is evydent from the style of the writing as well as from certain proofs in the book itself most suttnly a femail wrote this dairy but who this dairymaid may be i in coarse cant conjecter and indeed common galliantry forbids me to ask i can only judge of the book itself which it appears to me is clearly trenching upon my ground and favrite subjicks viz fashnabble life as igsibited in the houses of the nobility gentry and rile fammly  but i bare no mallisinfamation is infamation and it doesnt matter where the infamy comes from and whether the dairy be from that distinguished pen to which it is ornarily attributedwhether i say it comes from a lady of honor to the late quean or a scullion to that diffunct majisty no matter all we ask is nollidge never mind how we have it nollidge as our cook says is like trikelpossitits always good though you was to drink it out of an old shoo  well then although this dairy is likely searusly to injur my pussonal intrests by fourstalling a deal of what i had to say in my private memoarsthough many many guineas is taken from my pockit by cuttin short the tail of my narratifthough much that i had to say in souperior languidge greased with all the ellygance of my orytory the benefick of my classcle reading the chawms of my agreble wit is thus abruply brot befor the world by an inferior genus neither knowing nor writing english yet i say that nevertheless i must say what i am puffickly prepaired to say to gainsay which no man can say a wordyet i say that i say i consider this publication welkom far from viewing it with enfy i greet it with applaws because it increases that most exlent specious of nollidge i mean fashnabble nollidge compayred to witch all other nollidge is nonsincea bag of goold to a pare of snuffers  could lord broom on the canady question say moar or say what he had tu say better we are marters both of us to prinsple and every body who knows eather knows that we would sacrafice anythink rather than that fashion is the goddiss i adoar this delightful work is an offring on her srine and as sich all her wushippers are bound to hail it here is not a question of trumpry lords and honrabbles generals and barronites but the crown itself and the king and queens actions witch may be considered as the crown jewels heres princes and granddukes and airsparent and heaven knows what all with bloodroyal in their veins and their names mentioned in the very fust page of the peeridge in this book you become so intmate with the prince of wales that you may follow him if you please to his marridgebed or if you prefer the princiss charlotte you may have with her an hours tatortator    our estimable correspondent means we presume teteateteo y   now though most of the remarkable extrax from this book have been given already the cream of the dairy as i wittily say i shall trouble you nevertheless with a few partly because they cant be repeated too often and because the toan of obsyvation with which they have been genrally received by the press is not igsackly such as i think they merit how indeed can these common magaseen and newspaper pipple know anythink of fashnabble life let alone ryal  conseaving then that the publication of the dairy has done reel good on this scoar and may probly do a deal moor i shall look through it for the porpus of selecting the most ellygant passidges and which i think may be peculiarly adapted to the readers benefick  for you see my dear mr yorke that in the fust place that this is no common catchpny book like that of most authors and authoresses who write for the base looker of gain heaven bless you the dairymaid is above anything musnary she is a woman of rank and no mistake and is as much above doin a common or vulgar action as i am superaor to taking beer after dinner with my cheese she proves that most satisfackarily as we see in the following passidge   her royal highness came to me and having spoken a few phrases on different subjects produced all the papers she wishes to have published her whole correspondence with the prince relative to lady js dismissal his subsequent neglect of the princess and finally the acquittal of her supposed guilt signed by the duke of portland c at the time of the secret inquiry when if proof could have been brought against her it certainly would have been done and which acquittal to the disgrace of all parties concerned as well as to the justice of the nation in general was not made public at the time a common criminal is publicly condemned or acquitted her royal highness commanded me to have these letters published forthwith saying you may sell them for a great sum at first for she had spoken to me before concerning this business i thought of availing myself of the opportunity but upon second thoughts i turned from this idea with detestation for if i do wrong by obeying her wishes and endeavoring to serve her i will do so at least from good and disinterested motives not from any sordid views the princess commands me and i will obey her whatever may be the issue but not for fare or fee i own i tremble not so much for myself as for the idea that she is not taking the best and most dignified way of having these papers published why make a secret of it at all if wrong it should not be done if right it should be done openly and in the face of her enemies in her royal highnesss case as in that of wronged princes in general why do they shrink from straightforward dealings and rather have recourse to crooked policy i wish in this particular instance i could make her royal highness feel thus but she is naturally indignant at being falsely accused and will not condescend to an avowed explanation   can anythink be more just and honrabble than this the dairylady is quite fair and abovebored a clear stage says she and no favior i wont do behind my back what i am ashamed of before my face not i no more she does for you see that though she was offered this manyscrip by the princess for nothink though she knew that she could actially get for it a large sum of money she was above it like an honest noble grateful fashnabble woman as she was she aboars secrecy and never will have recors to disguise or crookid polacy this ought to be an ansure to them radicle sneerers who pretend that they are the equals of fashnabble pepple wheras its a wellknown fact that the vulgar roagues have no notion of honor  and after this positif declaration which reflex honor on her ladyship long life to her ive often waited behind her chairafter this positif declaration that even for the porpus of defending her missis she was so himinded as to refuse anythink like a peculiarly consideration it is actially asserted in the public prints by a booxeller that he has given her a thousand pound for the dairy a thousand pound nonsinceits a phigment a base lible this woman take a thousand pound in a matter where her dear mistriss friend and benyfactriss was concerned never a thousand baggonits would be more prefrabble to a woman of her xqizzit feelins and fashion  but to proseed its been objected to me when i wrote some of my expearunces in fashnabble life that my languidge was occasionally vulgar and not such as is genrally used in those exqizzit famlies which i frequent now ill lay a wager that there is in this book wrote as all the world knows by a rele lady and speakin of kings and queens as if they were as common as sandboysthere is in this book more wulgarity than ever i displayed more nastiness than ever i would dare to think on and more bad grammar than ever i wrote since i was a boy at school as for authografy evry genlmn has his own never mind spellin i say so long as the sence is right  let me here quot a letter from a corryspondent of this charming lady of honor and a very nice corryspondent he is too without any mistake   lady o poor lady o knows the rules of prudence i fear me as imperfectly as she doth those of the greek and latin grammars or she hath let her brother who is a sad swine become master of her secrets and then contrived to quarrel with him you would see the outline of the melange in the newspapers but not the report that mr s is about to publish a pamphlet as an addition to the harleian tracts setting forth the amatory adventures of his sister we shall break our necks in haste to buy it of course crying shameful all the while and it is said that lady o is to be cut which i cannot entirely believe let her tell two or three old women about town that they are young and handsome and give some welltimed parties and she may still keep the society which she hath been used to the times are not so hard as they once were when a woman could not construe magna charta with anything like impunity people were full as gallant many years ago but the days are gone by wherein my lordprotector of the commonwealth of england was wont to go a lovemaking to mrs fleetwood with the bible under his arm  and so miss jacky gordon is really clothed with a husband at last and miss laura manners left without a mate she and lord stair should marry and have children in mere revenge as to miss gordon shes a venus well suited for such a vulcanwhom nothing but money and a title could have rendered tolerable even to a kitchen wench it is said that the matrimonial correspondence between this couple is to be published full of sad scandalous relations of which you may be sure scarcely a word is true in former times the duchess of st as made use of these elegant epistles in order to intimidate lady johnstone but that ruse would not avail so in spite they are to be printed what a cargo of amiable creatures yet will some people scarcely believe in the existence of pandemonium  tuesday morningyou are perfectly right respecting the hot rooms here which we all cry out against and all find very comfortablemuch more so than the cold sands and bleak neighborhood of the sea which looks vastly well in one of vander veldes pictures hung upon crimson damask but hideous and shocking in reality h and his elle talking of parties were last night at cholmondeley house but seem not to ripen in their love he is certainly goodhumored and i believe goodhearted so deserves a good wife but his cara seems a genuine london miss made up of many affectations will she form a comfortable helpmate for me i like not her origin and deem many strange things to run in blood besides madness and the hanoverian evil  thursdayi verily do believe that i shall never get to the end of this small sheet of paper so many unheard of interruptions have i had and now i have been to vauxhall and caught the toothache i was of lady e bm and hs party very dullthe lady giving us all a supper after our promenade        much ado was there god wot       she would love but he would not   he ate a great deal of ice although he did not seem to require it and she faisoit les yeux doux enough not only to have melted all the ice which he swallowed but his own hard heart into the bargain the thing will not do in the meantime miss long hath become quite cruel to wellesley pole and divides her favor equally between lords killeen and kilworth two as simple irishmen as ever gave birth to a bull i wish to hymen that she were fairly married for all this pother gives one a disgusting picture of human nature   a disgusting pictur of human nature indeedand isnt he who moralizes about it and she to whom he writes a couple of pretty heads in the same piece which mr yorke is the wust the scandle or the scandlemongers see what it is to be a moral man of fashn fust he scrapes togither all the bad stoaries about all the people of his acquentancehe goes to a ball and laffs or snears at everybody therehe is asked to a dinner and brings away along with meat and wine to his hearts content a sour stomick filled with nasty stories of all the people present there he has such a squeamish appytite that all the world seems to disagree with him and what has he got to say to his delicate female frend why that  fust mr s is going to publish indescent stoaries about lady o his sister which everybodys goin to by  nex that miss gordon is going to be cloathed with an usband and that all their matrimonial corryspondins is to be published too  3 that lord h is going to be married but theres some thing rong in his wifes blood  4 miss long has cut mr wellesley and is gone after two irish lords  wooden you phancy now that the author of such a letter instead of writin about pipple of tiptop qualaty was describin vinegar yard would you beleave that the lady he was aritin to was a chased modist lady of honor and mother of a famly o trumpery o morris as homer says this is a higeous pictur of manners such as i weap to think of as evry morl man must weap  the above is one pritty pictur of mearly fashnabble life what follows is about families even higher situated than the most fashnabble here we have the princessregient her daughter the princess sharlot her grandmamma the old quean and her madjistys daughters the two princesses if this is not high life i dont know where it is to be found and its pleasing to see what affeckshn and harmny rains in such an exolted spear   sunday 24thyesterday the princess went to meet the princess charlotte at kensington lady  told me that when the latter arrived she rushed up to her mother and said for gods sake be civil to her meaning the duchess of leeds who followed her lady  said she felt sorry for the latter but when the princess of wales talked to her she soon became so free and easy that one could not have any feeling about her feelings princess charlotte i was told was looking handsome very pale but her head more becomingly dressedthat is to say less dressed than usual her figure is of that full round shape which is now in its prime but she disfigures herself by wearing her bodice so short that she literally has no waist her feet are very pretty and so are her hands and arms and her ears and the shape of her head her countenance is expressive when she allows her passions to play upon it and i never saw any face with so little shade express so many powerful and varied emotions lady  told me that the princess charlotte talked to her about her situation and said in a very quiet but determined way she would not bear it and that as soon as parliament met she intended to come to warwick house and remain there that she was also determined not to consider the duchess of leeds as her governess but only as her first lady she made many observations on other persons and subjects and appears to be very quick very penetrating but imperious and wilful there is a tone of romance too in her character which will only serve to mislead her  she told her mother that there had been a great battle at windsor between the queen and the prince the former refusing to give up miss knight from her own person to attend on princess charlotte as subgoverness but the princeregent had gone to windsor himself and insisted on her doing so and the old beguin was forced to submit but has been ill ever since and sir henry halford declared it was a complete breaking up of her constitutionto the great delight of the two princesses who were talking about this affair miss knight was the very person they wished to have they think they can do as they like with her it has been ordered that the princess charlotte should not see her mother alone for a single moment but the latter went into her room stuffed a pair of large shoes full of papers and having given them to her daughter she went home lady  told me everything was written down and sent to mr brougham next day   see what discord will creap even into the best regulated famlies here are six of emviz the quean and her two daughters her son and his wife and daughter and the manner in which they hate one another is a compleat puzzle                          his mother  the prince hates    his wife                         his daughter   princess charlotte hates her father   princess of wales hates her husband  the old quean by their squobbles is on the pint of death and her two jewtiful daughters are delighted at the news what a happy fashnabble christian famly o mr yorke mr yorke if this is the way in the drawinrooms im quite content to live below in pease and charaty with all men writin as i am now in my pantry or els havin a quiet game at cards in the servantsall with us theres no bitter wicked quarling of this sort we dont hate our children or bully our mothers or wish em ded when theyre sick as this dairywoman says kings and queens do when were writing to our friends or sweethearts we dont fill our letters with nasty stoaries takin away the carricter of our fellowservants as this maid of honors amusin moral frend does but in coarse its not for us to judge of our bettersthese great people are a supeerur race and we cant comprehend their ways  do you recklectits twenty years ago nowhow a bewtiffle princess died in givin buth to a poar baby and how the whole nation of hengland wep as though it was one man over that sweet woman and child in which were sentered the hopes of every one of us and of which each was as proud as of his own wife or infnt do you recklect how pore fellows spent their last shillin to buy a black crape for their hats and clergymen cried in the pulpit and the whole country through was no better than a great dismal funeral do you recklet mr yorke who was the person that we all took on so about we called her the princis sharlot of wales and we valyoud a single drop of her blood more than the whole heartless body of her father well we looked up to her as a kind of saint or angle and blest god such foolish loyal english pipple as we ware in those days who had sent this sweet lady to rule over us but heaven bless you it was only souperstition she was no better than she should be as it turns outor at least the dairymaid says so no betterif my daughters or yours was 12 so bad wed as leaf be dead ourselves and they hanged but listen to this pritty charritable story and a truce to reflexshuns   sunday january 9 1814yesterday according to appointment i went to princess charlotte found at warwick house the harpplayer dizzi was asked to remain and listen to his performance but was talked to during the whole time which completely prevented all possibility of listening to the music the duchess of leeds and her daughter were in the room but left it soon next arrived miss knight who remained all the time i was there princess charlotte was very graciousshowed me all her bonny dyes as bwould have called thempictures and cases and jewels c she talked in a very desultory way and it would be difficult to say of what she observed her mother was in very low spirits i asked her how she supposed she could be otherwise this questioning answer saves a great deal of trouble and serves two purposesie avoids committing oneself or giving offence by silence there was hung in the apartment one portrait amongst others that very much resembled the duke of d i asked miss knight whom it represented she said that was not known it had been supposed a likeness of the pretender when young this answer suited my thoughts so comically i could have laughed if one ever did at courts anything but the contrary of what one was inclined to do  princess charlotte has a very great variety of expression in her countenancea play of features and a force of muscle rarely seen in connection with such soft and shadeless coloring her hands and arms are beautiful but i think her figure is already gone and will soon be precisely like her mothers in short it is the very picture of her and not in miniature i could not help analyzing my own sensations during the time i was with her and thought more of them than i did of her why was i at all flattered at all more amused at all more supple to this young princess than to her who is only the same sort of person set in the shade of circumstances and of years it is that youth and the approach of power and the latent views of selfinterest sway the heart and dazzle the understanding if this is so with a heart not i trust corrupt and a head not particularly formed for interested calculations what effect must not the same causes produce on the generality of mankind  in the course of the conversation the princess charlotte contrived to edge in a good deal of tumdedy and would if i had entered into the thing have gone on with it while looking at a little picture of herself which had about thirty or forty different dresses to put over it done on isinglass and which allowed the general coloring of the picture to be seen through its transparency it was i thought a pretty enough conceit though rather like dressing up a doll ah said miss knight i am not content though madamefor i yet should have liked one more dressthat of the favorite sultana  no no said the princess i never was a favorite and never can be onelooking at a picture which she said was her fathers but which i do not believe was done for the regent any more than for me but represented a young man in a hussars dressprobably a former favorite  the princess charlotte seemed much hurt at the little notice that was taken of her birthday after keeping me for two hours and a half she dismissed me and i am sure i could not say what she said except that it was an olio of decousus and heterogeneous things partaking of the characteristics of her mother grafted on a younger scion i dined teteatete with my dear old aunt hers is always a sweet and soothing society to me   theres a pleasing ladylike moral extract for you an innocent young thing of fifteen has picturs of two lovers in her room and expex a good number more this dellygate young creature edges in a good deal of tumdedy i cant find it in johnsons dixonary and would have gone on with the thing ellygence of languidge if the dairylady would have let her  now to tell you the truth mr yorke i doant beleave a single syllible of this story this lady of honner says in the fust place that the princess would have talked a good deal of tumdedy which means i suppose indeasnsy if she the lady of honner would have let her this is a good one why she lets every body else talk tumdedy to their hearts content she lets her friends write tumdedy and after keeping it for a quarter of a sentry she prints it why then be so squeamish about hearing a little and then theres the stoary of the two portricks this woman has the honner to be received in the frendlyest manner by a british princess and what does the grateful loyal creature do 2 picturs of the princesss relations are hanging in her room and the dairywoman swears away the poor young princesss carrickter by swearing they are picturs of her lovers for shame oh for shame you slanderin backbitin dairywoman you if you told all them things to your dear old aunt on going to dine with her you must have had very sweet and soothing society indeed  i had marked out many more extrax which i intended to write about but i think i have said enough about this dairy in fack the butler and the gals in the servantshall are not well pleased that i should go on reading this naughty book so well have no more of it only one passidge about pollytics witch is sertnly quite new   no one was so likely to be able to defeat bonaparte as the crown prince from the intimate knowledge he possessed of his character bernadotte was also instigated against bonaparte by one who not only owed him a personal hatred but who possessed a mind equal to his and who gave the crown prince both information and advice how to act this was no less a person than madame de stael it was not as some have asserted that she was in love with bernadotte for at the time of their intimacy madame de stael was in love with rocca but she used her influence which was not small with the crown prince to make him fight against bonaparte and to her wisdom may be attributed much of the success which accompanied his attack upon him bernadotte has raised the flame of liberty which seems fortunately to blaze all around may it liberate europe and from the ashes of the laurel may olive branches spring up and overshadow the earth   theres a discuvery that the overthrow of boneypart is owing to madame de stael what nonsince for colonel southey or doctor napier to write histories of the war with that capsican hupstart and murderer when here we have the whole affair explaned by the lady of honor   sunday april 10 1814the incidents which take place every hour are miraculous bonaparte is deposed but alive subdued but allowed to choose his place of residence the island of elba is the spot he has selected for his ignominious retreat france is holding forth repentant arms to her banished sovereign the poissardes who dragged louis xvi to the scaffold are presenting flowers to the emperor of russia the restorer of their legitimate king what a stupendous field for philosophy to expatiate in what an endless material for thought what humiliation to the pride of mere human greatness how are the mighty fallen of all that was great in napoleon what remains despoiled of his usurped power he sinks to insignificance there was no moral greatness in the man the meteor dazzled scorched is put oututterly and for ever but the power which rests in those who have delivered the nations from bondage is a power that is delegated to them from heaven and the manner in which they have used it is a guarantee for its continuance the duke of wellington has gained laurels unstained by any useless flow of blood he has done more than conquer othershe has conquered himself and in the midst of the blaze and flush of victory surrounded by the homage of nations he has not been betrayed into the commission of any act of cruelty or wanton offence he was as cool and selfpossessed under the blaze and dazzle of fame as a common man would be under the shade of his gardentree or

mans ambition was permitted to devastate every home tie and every heartfelt joy   and now after this sublime passidge as full of awfle reflections and pious sentyments as those of mrs cole in the play i shall only quot one little extrak more   all goes gloomily with the poor princess lady charlotte campbell told me she regrets not seeing all these curious personages but she says the more the princess is forsaken the more happy she is at having offered to attend her at this time this is very amiable in her and cannot fail to be gratifying to the princess   so it iswery amiable wery kind

lady sharlot had any hand in this book heaven forbid she is all gratitude pure gratitude depend upon it she would not go for to blacken her old frend and patrons carrickter after having been so outrageously faithful to her she wouldnt do it at no price depend upon it how sorry she must be that others ant quite so squemish and show up in this indesent way the follies of her kind genrus

was the laff of the whole town your intelackshal natur respected barnet is not fizzickly adapted so to speak for encounters of this sort you must not indulge in combats with us course bullies of the press you have not the staminy for a reglar setto what then is your plan in the midst of the mob to pass as quiet as you can you wont be undistubbed who is some stray kix and buffits will fall to youmortial man is subjick to such but if you begin to wins and cry out and set up for a marter wo betide you  these remarks pusnal as i confess them to be are yet i assure you written in perfick goodnatur and have been inspired by your play of the sea capting and prefiz to it which latter is on matters intirely pusnal and will therefore i trust igscuse this kind of ad hominam as they say diskcushion i propose honrabble barnit to cumsider calmly this play and prephiz and to speak of both with that honisty which in the pantry or studdy ive been always phamous for let us in the first place listen to the opening of the preface of the fourth edition   no one can be more sensible than i am of the many faults and deficiencies to be found in this play but perhaps when it is considered how very rarely it has happened in the history of our dramatic literature that good acting plays have been produced except by those who have either been actors themselves or formed their habits of literature almost of life behind the scenes i might have looked for a criticism more generous and less exacting and rigorous than that by which the attempts of an author accustomed to another class of composition have been received by a large proportion of the periodical press  it is scarcely possible indeed that this play should not contain faults of two kinds first the faults of one who has necessarily much to learn in the mechanism of his art and secondly of one who having written largely in the narrative style of fiction may not unfrequently mistake the effects of a novel for the effects of a drama i may add to these perhaps the deficiencies that arise from uncertain health and broken spirits which render the author more susceptible than he might have been some years since to that spirit of depreciation and hostility which it has been his misfortune to excite amongst the general contributors to the periodical press for the consciousness that every endeavor will be made to cavil to distort to misrepresent and in fine if possible to run down will occasionally haunt even the hours of composition to check the inspiration and damp the ardor  having confessed thus much frankly and fairly and with a hope that i may ultimately do better should i continue to write for the stage which nothing but an assurance that with all my defects i may yet bring some little aid to the drama at a time when any aid however humble ought to be welcome to the lovers of the art could induce me to do may i be permitted to say a few words as to some of the objections which have been made against this play   now my dear sir look what a pretty number of please you put forrards here why your play shouldnt be good  first good plays are almost always written by actors  secknd you are a novice to the style of composition  third you may be mistaken in your effects being a novelist by trade and not a playwriter  fourthly your in such bad helth and sperrits  fifthly your so afraid of the critix that they damp your arder  for shame for shame man what confeshns is thesewhat painful pewling and piping your not a babby i take you to be some seven or eight and thutty years oldin the morning of youth as the flosofer says dont let any such nonsince take your reazn prisoner what you an old hand amongst usan old soljer of our sovring quean the pressyou who have had the best pay have held the topmost rank ay and deserved them tooi gif you lef to quot me in sasiaty and say i am a man of genius yllwplsh says soyou to lose heart and cry pickavy and begin to howl because little boys fling stones at you fie man take courage and bearing the terrows of your bloodred hand as the poet says punish us if weve ofended you punish us like a man or bear your own punishment like a man dont try to come off with such misrabble lodgic as that above  what do you you give four satisfackary reazns that the play is bad the secknd is naughtfor your no such chicking at playwriting this being the forth you show that the play must be bad and then begin to deal with the critix for finding folt  was there ever wuss generalship the play is badyour righta wuss i never see or read but why kneed you say so if it was so very bad why publish it because you wish to serve the drama o fie dont lay that flattering function to your sole as milton observes do you believe that this sea capting can serve the drama did you never intend that it should serve anything or anybody else of cors you did you wrote it for moneymoney from the maniger money from the booksellerfor the same reason that i write this sir shakspeare wrote for the very same reasons and i never heard that he bragged about serving the drama away with this canting about great motifs let us not be too prowd my dear barnet and fansy ourselves marters of the truth marters or apostels we are but tradesmen working for bread and not for righteousness sake lets try and work honestly but dont let us be prayting pompisly about our sacred calling the taylor who makes your coats and very well they are made too with the best of velvit collarsi say stulze or nugee might cry out that their motifs were but to assert the eturnle truth of tayloring with just as much reazn and who would believe them  well after this acknollitchmint that the play is bad come sefral pages of attack on the critix and the folt those gentry have found with it with these i shant middle for the presnt you defend all the characters 1 by 1 and conclude your remarks as follows   i must be pardoned for this disquisition on my own designs when every means is employed to misrepresent it becomes perhaps allowable to explain and if i do not think that my faults as a dramatic author are to be found in the study and delineation of character it is precisely because that is the point on which all my previous pursuits in literature and actual life would be most likely to preserve me from the errors i own elsewhere whether of misjudgment or inexperience  i have now only to add my thanks to the actors for the zeal and talent with which they have embodied the characters entrusted to them the sweetness and grace with which miss faucit embellished the part of violet which though only a sketch is most necessary to the coloring and harmony of the play were perhaps the more pleasing to the audience from the generosity rare with actors which induced her to take a part so far inferior to her powers the applause which attends the performance of mrs warner and mr strickland attests their success in characters of unusual difficulty while the singular beauty and nobleness whether of conception or execution with which the greatest of living actors has elevated the part of norman so totally different from his ordinary range of character is a new proof of his versatility and accomplishment in all that belongs to his art it would be scarcely gracious to conclude these remarks without expressing my acknowledgment of that generous and indulgent sense of justice which forgetting all political differences in a literary arena has enabled me to appeal to approving audiencesfrom hostile critics and it is this which alone encourages me to hope that sooner or later i may add to the dramatic literature of my country something that may find perhaps almost as many friends in the next age as it has been the fate of the author to find enemies in this   see now what a good comfrabble vanaty is pepple have quarld with the dramatic characters of your play no says you if i am remarkabble for anythink its for my study and delineation of character that is presizely the pint to which my littery purshuits have led me have you read jil blaw my dear sir have you pirouzed that exlent tragady the critic theres something so like this in sir fretful plaguy and the archbishop of granadiers that im blest if i cant laff till my sides ake think of the critix fixing on the very pint for which you are famusthe roags and spose they had said the plot was absudd or the langwitch absudder still dont you think you would have had a word in defens of them tooyou who hope to find frends for your dramatic wux in the nex age poo i tell thee barnet that the nex age will be wiser and better than this and do you think that it will imply itself a reading of your trajadies this is misantrofy barnetreglar byronism and you ot to have a better apinian of human natur  your apinion about the actors i shant here meddle with they all acted exlently as far as my humbile judgement goes and your write in giving them all possible prays but lets consider the last sentence of the prefiz my dear barnet and see what a pretty set of apiniuns you lay down  1 the critix are your inymies in this age  2 in the nex however you hope to find newmrous frends  3 and its a satisfackshn to think that in spite of politticle diffrances you have found frendly aujences here  now my dear barnet for a man who begins so humbly with what my friend father prout calls an argamantum ad misericorjam who ignowledges that his play is bad that his pore dear helth is bad and those cussid critix have played the juice with himi say for a man who beginns in such a humbill toan its rather rich to see how you end  my dear barnet do you suppose that politticle diffrances prejudice pepple against you what are your politix wig i presumeso are mine ontry noo and what if they are wig or raddiccle or cumsuvvative does any mortial man in england care a phig for your politix do you think yourself such a mity man in parlymint that critix are to be angry with you and aujences to be cumsidered magnanamous because they treat you fairly there now was sherridn he who roat the rifles and school for scandle i saw the rifles after your play and o barnet if you knew what a relief it wasthere i say was sherridnhe was a politticle character if you pleasehe could make a spitch or twodo you spose that pitt purseyvall castlerag old george the third himself wooden go to see the rivlesay and clap hands too and laff and ror for all sherrys wiggery do you spose the critix wouldnt applaud too for shame barnet what ninnis what hartless raskles you must beleave them to bein the fust plase to fancy that you are a politticle genus in the secknd to let your politix interfear with their notiums about littery merits  put that nonsince out of your head as fox said to bonypart wasnt it that great genus dennis that wrote in swiff and poops time who fansid that the french king wooden make pease unless dennis was delivered up to him upon my wud i doant think he carrid his diddlusion much further than a serting honrabble barnet of my aquentance  and then for the nex age respected sir this is another diddlusion a gross misteak on your part or my name is not ysh these

has not written near so much as me being an infearor genus betwigst ourselves but he says he never had such mortial difficklty with anything as with the dixcripshn of the plott of your pease here his letter   to chrls ftzry plntgnt yllwplsh esq c c  30th nov 1839  my dear and honored siri have the pleasure of laying before you the following description of the plot and a few remarks upon the style of the piece called the sea captain  fiveandtwenty years back a certain lord arundel had a daughter heiress of his estates and property a poor cousin sir maurice beevor being next in succession and a page arthur le mesnil by name  the daughter took a fancy for the page and the young persons were married unknown to his lordship  three days before her confinement thinking no doubt that period favorable for travelling the young couple had agreed to run away together and had reached a chapel near on the seacoast from which they were to embark when lord arundel abruptly put a stop to their proceedings by causing one gaussen a pirate to murder the page  his daughter was carried back to arundel house and in three days gave birth to a son whether his lordship knew of this birth i cannot say the infant however was never acknowledged but carried by sir maurice beevor to a priest onslow by name who educated the lad and kept him for twelve years in profound ignorance of his birth the boy went by the name of norman  lady arundel meanwhile married again again became a widow but had a second son who was the acknowledged heir and called lord ashdale old lord arundel died and her ladyship became countess in her own right  when norman was about twelve years of age his mother who wished to waft young arthur to a distant land had him sent on board ship who should the captain of the ship be but gaussen who received a smart bribe from sir maurice beevor to kill the lad accordingly gaussen tied him to a plank and pitched him overboard                                  about thirteen years after these circumstances violet an orphan niece of lady arundels second husband came to pass a few weeks with her ladyship she had just come from a seavoyage and had been saved from a wicked algerine by an english sea captain this sea captain was no other than norman who had been picked up off his plank and fell in love with and was loved by miss violet  a short time after violets arrival at her aunts the captain came to pay her a visit his ship anchoring off the coast near lady arundels residence by a singular coincidence that rogue gaussens ship anchored in the harbor too gaussen at once knew his man for he had tracked him after drowning him and he informed sir maurice beevor that young norman was alive  sir maurice beevor informed her ladyship how should she get rid of him in this wise he was in love with violet let him marry her and be off for lord ashdale was in love with his cousin too and of course could not marry a young woman in her station of life you have a chaplain on board says her ladyship to captain norman let him attend tonight in the ruined chapel marry violet and away with you to sea by this means she hoped to be quit of him forever  but unfortunately the conversation had been overheard by beevor and reported to ashdale ashdale determined to be at the chapel and carry off violet as for beevor he sent gaussen to the chapel to kill both ashdale and norman thus there would only be lady arundel between him and the title  norman in the meanwhile who had been walking near the chapel had just seen his worthy old friend the priest most barbarously murdered there sir maurice beevor had set gaussen upon him his reverence was coming with the papers concerning normans birth which beevor wanted in order to extort money from the countess gaussen was however obliged to run before he got the papers and the clergyman had time before he died to tell norman the story and give him the documents with which norman sped off to the castle to have an interview with his mother  he lays his white cloak and hat on the table and begs to be left alone with her ladyship lord ashdale who is in the room surlily quits it but going out cunningly puts on normans cloak it will be dark says he down at the chapel violet wont know me and egad ill run off with her  norman has his interview her ladyship acknowledges him for she cannot help it but will not embrace him love him or have anything to do with him  away he goes to the chapel his chaplain was there waiting to marry him to violet his boat was there to carry him on board his ship and violet was there too  norman says she in the dark dear norman i knew you by your white cloak here i am and she and the man in a cloak go off to the inner chapel to be married  there waits master gaussen he has seized the chaplain and the boats crew and is just about to murder the man in the cloak when  norman rushes in and cuts him down much to the surprise of miss for she never suspected it was sly ashdale who had come as we have seen disguised and very nearly paid for his masquerading  ashdale is very grateful but when norman persists in marrying violet he saysno he shant he shall fight he is a coward if he doesnt fight norman flings down his sword and says he wont fight and  lady arundel who has been at prayers all this time rushing in says hold this is your brother percyyour elder brother here is some restiveness on ashdales part but he finishes by embracing his brother  norman burns all the papers vows he will never peach reconciles himself with his mother says he will go loser but having ordered his ship to veer round to the chapel orders it to veer back again for he will pass the honeymoon at arundel castle  as you have been pleased to ask my opinion it strikes me that there are one or two very good notions in this plot but the author does not fail as he would modestly have us believe from ignorance of stagebusiness he seems to know too much rather than too little about the stage to be too anxious to cram in effects incidents perplexities there is the perplexity concerning ashdales murder and normans murder and the priests murder and the pages murder and gaussens murder there is the perplexity about the papers and that about the hat and cloak a silly foolish obstacle which only tantalize the spectator and retard the march of the dramas action it is as if the author had said i must have a new incident in every act i must keep tickling the spectator perpetually and never let him off until the fall of the curtain  the same disagreeable bustle and petty complication of intrigue you may remark in the authors drama of richelieu the lady of lyons was a much simpler and better wrought plot the incidents following each other either not too swiftly or startlingly in richelieu it always seemed to me as if one heard doors perpetually clapping and banging one was puzzled to follow the train of conversation in the midst of the perpetual small noises that distracted one right and left  nor is the list of characters of the sea captain to be despised the outlines of all of them are good a mother for whom one feels a proper tragic mixture of hatred and pity a gallant singlehearted son whom she disdains and who conquers her at last by his noble conduct a dashing haughty tybalt of a brother a wicked poor cousin a pretty maid and a fierce buccaneer these people might pass three hours very well on the stage and interest the audience hugely but the author fails in filling up the outlines his language is absurdly stilted frequently careless the reader or spectator hears a number of loud speeches but scarce a dozen lines that seem to belong of nature to the speakers  nothing can be more fulsome or loathsome to my mind than the continual shamreligious claptraps which the author has put into the mouth of his hero nothing more unsailorlike than his nambypamby starlit descriptions which my ingenious colleague has i see alluded to thy faith my anchor and thine eyes my haven cries the gallant captain to his lady see how loosely the sentence is constructed like a thousand others in the book the captain is to cast anchor with the girls faith in her own eyes either image might pass by itself but together like the quadrupeds of kilkenny they devour each other the captain tells his lieutenant to bid his bark veer round to a point in the harbor was ever such language my lady gives sir maurice a thousand pounds to waft him her son to some distant shore nonsense sheer nonsense and what is worse affected nonsense  look at the comedy of the poor cousin there is a great deal of game on the estatepartridges hares wildgeese snipes and plovers smacking his lipsbesides a magnificent preserve of sparrows which i can sell to the little blackguards in the streets at a penny a hundred but i am very poora very poor old knight  is this wit or nature it is a kind of sham wit it reads as if it were wit but it is not what poor poor stuff about the little blackguard boys what flimsy ecstasies and silly smacking of lips about the plovers is this the man who writes for the next age o fie here is another joke          sir maurice  mice zounds how can i    keep mice  i cant afford it  they were starved    to death an age ago  the last was found    come christmas three years stretched beside a bone    in that same larder so consumed and worn    by pious fast twas awful to behold it    i canonized its corpse in spirits of wine    and set it in the porcha solemn warning    to thieves and beggars   is not this rare wit zounds how can i keep mice is well enough for a miser not too new or brilliant either but this miserable dilution of a thin joke this wretched hunting down of the poor mouse it is humiliating to think of a man of esprit harping so long on such a mean pitiful string a man who aspires to immortality too i doubt whether it is to be gained thus whether our authors words are not too loosely built to make starry pointing pyramids of horace clipped and squared his blocks more carefully before he laid the monument which imber edax or aquila impotens or fuga temporum might assail in vain even old ovid when he raised his stately shining heathen temple had placed some columns in it and hewn out a statue or two which deserved the immortality that he prophesied somewhat arrogantly for himself but let not all be looking forward to a future and fancying that incerti spatium dum finiat aevi our books are to be immortal alas the way to immortality is not so easy nor will our sea captain be permitted such an unconscionable cruise if all the immortalities were really to have their wish what a work would our descendants have to study them all  not yet in my humble opinion has the honorable baronet achieved this deathless consummation there will come a day may it be long distant when the very best of his novels will be forgotten and it is reasonable to suppose that his dramas will pass out of existence some time or other in the lapse of the secula seculorum in the meantime my dear plush if you ask me what the great obstacle is towards the dramatic fame and merit of our friend i would say that it does not lie so much in hostile critics or feeble health as in a careless habit of writing and a peevish vanity which causes him to shut his eyes to his faults the question of original capacity i will not moot one may think very highly of the honorable baronets talent without rating it quite so high as he seems disposed to do  and to conclude as he has chosen to combat the critics in person the critics are surely justified in being allowed to address him directly        with best compliments to mrs yellowplush          i have the honor to be dear sir               your most faithful and obliged                    humble servant                              john thomas smith   and now smith having finisht his letter i think i cant do better than clothes mine lickwise
