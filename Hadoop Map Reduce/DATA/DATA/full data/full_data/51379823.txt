51379823	my aunt margarets mirror  by sir walter scott   from short stories published in the keepsake annual of 1828     introduction  the species of publication which has come to be generally known by the title of annual being a miscellany of prose and verse equipped with numerous engravings and put forth every year about christmas had flourished for a long while in germany before it was imitated in this country by an enterprising bookseller a german by birth mr ackermann the rapid success of his work as is the custom of the time gave birth to a host of rivals and among others to an annual styled the keepsake the first volume of which appeared in 1828 and attracted much notice chiefly in consequence of the very uncommon splendour of its illustrative accompaniments the expenditure which the spirited proprietors lavished on this magnificent volume is understood to have been not less than from ten to twelve thousand pounds sterling  various gentlemen of such literary reputation that any one might think it an honour to be associated with them had been announced as contributors to this annual before application was made to me to assist in it and i accordingly placed with much pleasure at the editors disposal a few fragments originally designed to have been worked into the chronicles of the canongate besides a manuscript drama the longneglected performance of my youthful daysthe house of aspen  the keepsake for 1828 included however only three of these little prose tales of which the first in order was that entitled my aunt margarets mirror by way of introduction to this when now included in a general collection of my lucubrations i have only to say that it is a mere transcript or at least with very little embellishment of a story that i remembered being struck with in my childhood when told at the fireside by a lady of eminent virtues and no inconsiderable share of talent one of the ancient and honourable house of swinton she was a kind of relation of my own and met her death in a manner so shockingbeing killed in a fit of insanity by a female attendant who had been attached to her person for half a lifetimethat i cannot now recall her memory child as i was when the catastrophe occurred without a painful reawakening of perhaps the first images of horror that the scenes of real life stamped on my mind  this good spinster had in her composition a strong vein of the superstitious and was pleased among other fancies to read alone in her chamber by a taper fixed in a candlestick which she had had formed out of a human skull one night this strange piece of furniture acquired suddenly the power of locomotion and after performing some odd circles on her chimneypiece fairly leaped on the floor and continued to roll about the apartment mrs swinton calmly proceeded to the adjoining room for another light and had the satisfaction to penetrate the mystery on the spot rats abounded in the ancient building she inhabited and one of these had managed to ensconce itself within her favourite memento mori though thus endowed with a more than feminine share of nerve she entertained largely that belief in supernaturals which in those times was not considered as sitting ungracefully on the grave and aged of her condition and the story of the magic mirror was one for which she vouched with particular confidence alleging indeed that one of her own family had been an eyewitness of the incidents recorded in it    i tell the tale as it was told to me  stories enow of much the same cast will present themselves to the recollection of such of my readers as have ever dabbled in a species of lore to which i certainly gave more hours at one period of my life than i should gain any credit by confessing  august 1831     aunt margarets mirror        there are times   when fancy plays her gambols in despite   even of our watchful senseswhen in sooth   substance seems shadow shadow substance seems   when the broad palpable and markd partition   twixt that which is and is not seems dissolved   as if the mental eye gaind power to gaze   beyond the limits of the existing world   such hours of shadowy dreams i better love   than all the gross realities of life      anonymous  my aunt margaret was one of that respected sisterhood upon whom devolve all the trouble and solicitude incidental to the possession of children excepting only that which attends their entrance into the world we were a large family of very different dispositions and constitutions some were dull and peevishthey were sent to aunt margaret to be amused some were rude romping and boisterousthey were sent to aunt margaret to be kept quiet or rather that their noise might be removed out of hearing those who were indisposed were sent with the prospect of being nursed those who were stubborn with the hope of their being subdued by the kindness of aunt margarets disciplinein short she had all the various duties of a mother without the credit and dignity of the maternal character the busy scene of her various cares is now over of the invalids and the robust the kind and the rough the peevish and pleased children who thronged her little parlour from morning to night not one now remains alive but myself who afflicted by early infirmity was one of the most delicate of her nurslings yet nevertheless have outlived them all  it is still my custom and shall be so while i have the use of my limbs to visit my respected relation at least three times a week her abode is about half a mile from the suburbs of the town in which i reside and is accessible not only by the highroad from which it stands at some distance but by means of a greensward footpath leading through some pretty meadows i have so little left to torment me in life that it is one of my greatest vexations to know that several of these sequestered fields have been devoted as sites for building in that which is nearest the town wheelbarrows have been at work for several weeks in such numbers that i verily believe its whole surface to the depth of at least eighteen inches was mounted in these monotrochs at the same moment and in the act of being transported from one place to another huge triangular piles of planks are also reared in different parts of the devoted messuage and a little group of trees that still grace the eastern end which rises in a gentle ascent have just received warning to quit expressed by a daub of white paint and are to give place to a curious grove of chimneys  it would perhaps hurt others in my situation to reflect that this little range of pasturage once belonged to my father whose family was of some consideration in the world and was sold by patches to remedy distresses in which he involved himself in an attempt by commercial adventure to redeem his diminished fortune while the building scheme was in full operation this circumstance was often pointed out to me by the class of friends who are anxious that no part of your misfortunes should escape your observation such pasturegroundlying at the very towns endin turnips and potatoes the parks would bring l20 per acre and if leased for buildingoh it was a gold mine and all sold for an old song out of the ancient possessors hands my comforters cannot bring me to repine much on this subject if i could be allowed to look back on the past without interruption i could willingly give up the enjoyment of present income and the hope of future profit to those who have purchased what my father sold i regret the alteration of the ground only because it destroys associations and i would more willingly i think see the earls closes in the hands of strangers retaining their silvan appearance than know them for my own if torn up by agriculture or covered with buildings mine are the sensations of poor logan    the horrid plough has rased the green     where yet a child i strayed   the axe has felld the hawthorn screen     the schoolboys summer shade  i hope however the threatened devastation will not be consummated in my day although the adventurous spirit of times short while since passed gave rise to the undertaking i have been encouraged to think that the subsequent changes have so far damped the spirit of speculation that the rest of the woodland footpath leading to aunt margarets retreat will be left undisturbed for her time and mine i am interested in this for every step of the way after i have passed through the green already mentioned has for me something of early remembrancethere is the stile at which i can recollect a cross childsmaid upbraiding me with my infirmity as she lifted me coarsely and carelessly over the flinty steps which my brothers traversed with shout and bound i remember the suppressed bitterness of the moment and conscious of my own inferiority the feeling of envy with which i regarded the easy movements and elastic steps of my more happily formed brethren alas these goodly barks have all perished on lifes wide ocean and only that which seemed so little seaworthy as the naval phrase goes has reached the port when the tempest is over then there is the pool where manoeuvring our little navy constructed out of the broad waterflags my elder brother fell in and was scarce saved from the watery element to die under nelsons banner there is the hazel copse also in which my brother henry used to gather nuts thinking little that he was to die in an indian jungle in quest of rupees  there is so much more of remembrance about the little walk thatas i stop rest on my crutchheaded cane and look round with that species of comparison between the thing i was and that which i now amit almost induces me to doubt my own identity until i find myself in face of the honeysuckle porch of aunt margarets dwelling with its irregularity of front and its odd projecting latticed windows where the workmen seem to have made it a study that no one of them should resemble another in form size or in the oldfashioned stone entablature and labels which adorn them this tenement once the manor house of the earls closes we still retain a slight hold upon for in some family arrangements it had been settled upon aunt margaret during the term of her life upon this frail tenure depends in a great measure the last shadow of the family of bothwell of earls closes and their last slight connection with their paternal inheritance the only representative will then be an infirm old man moving not unwillingly to the grave which has devoured all that were dear to his affections  when i have indulged such thoughts for a minute or two i enter the mansion which is said to have been the gatehouse only of the original building and find one being on whom time seems to have made little impression for the aunt margaret of today bears the same proportional age to the aunt margaret of my early youth that the boy of ten years old does to the man of byr lady some fiftysix years the old ladys invariable costume has doubtless some share in confirming one in the opinion that time has stood still with aunt margaret  the brown or chocolatecoloured silk gown with ruffles of the same stuff at the elbow within which are others of mechlin lace the black silk gloves or mitts the white hair combed back upon a roll and the cap of spotless cambric which closes around the venerable countenanceas they were not the costume of 1780 so neither were they that of 1826 they are altogether a style peculiar to the individual aunt margaret there she still sits as she sat thirty years since with her wheel or the stocking which she works by the fire in winter and by the window in summer or perhaps venturing as far as the porch in an unusually fine summer evening her frame like some wellconstructed piece of mechanics still performs the operations for which it had seemed destinedgoing its round with an activity which is gradually diminished yet indicating no probability that it will soon come to a period  the solicitude and affection which had made aunt margaret the willing slave to the inflictions of a whole nursery have now for their object the health and comfort of one old and infirm manthe last remaining relative of her family and the only one who can still find interest in the traditional stores which she hoards as some miser hides the gold which he desires that no one should enjoy after his death  my conversation with aunt margaret generally relates little either to the present or to the future for the passing day we possess as much as we require and we neither of us wish for more and for that which is to follow we have on this side of the grave neither hopes nor fears nor anxiety we therefore naturally look back to the past and forget the present fallen fortunes and declined importance of our family in recalling the hours when it was wealthy and prosperous  with this slight introduction the reader will know as much of aunt margaret and her nephew as is necessary to comprehend the following conversation and narrative  last week when late in a summer evening i went to call on the old lady to whom my reader is now introduced i was received by her with all her usual affection and benignity while at the same time she seemed abstracted and disposed to silence i asked her the reason they have been clearing out the old chapel she said john clayhudgeons having it seems discovered that the stuff withinbeing i suppose the remains of our ancestorswas excellent for topdressing the meadows  here i started up with more alacrity than i have displayed for some years but sat down while my aunt added laying her hand upon my sleeve the chapel has been long considered as common ground my dear and used for a pinfold and what objection can we have to the man for employing what is his own to his own profit besides i did speak to him and he very readily and civilly promised that if he found bones or monuments they should be carefully respected and reinstated and what more could i ask so the first stone they found bore the name of margaret bothwell 1585 and i have caused it to be laid carefully aside as i think it betokens death and having served my namesake two hundred years it has just been cast up in time to do me the same good turn my house has been long put in order as far as the small earthly concerns require it but who shall say that their account with heaven is sufficiently revised  after what you have said aunt i replied perhaps i ought to take my hat and go away and so i should but that there is on this occasion a little alloy mingled with your devotion to think of death at all times is a dutyto suppose it nearer from the finding an old gravestone is superstition and you with your strong useful common sense which was so long the prop of a fallen family are the last person whom i should have suspected of such weakness  neither would i deserve your suspicions kinsman answered aunt margaret if we were speaking of any incident occurring in the actual business of human life but for all this i have a sense of superstition about me which i do not wish to part with it is a feeling which separates me from this age and links me with that to which i am hastening and even when it seems as now to lead me to the brink of the grave and bid me gaze on it i do not love that it should be dispelled it soothes my imagination without influencing my reason or conduct  i profess my good lady replied i that had any one but you made such a declaration i should have thought it as capricious as that of the clergyman who without vindicating his false reading preferred from habits sake his old mumpsimus to the modern sumpsimus  well answered my aunt i must explain my inconsistency in this particular by comparing it to another i am as you know a piece of that oldfashioned thing called a jacobite but i am so in sentiment and feeling only for a more loyal subject never joined in prayers for the health and wealth of george the fourth whom god long preserve but i dare say that kindhearted sovereign would not deem that an old woman did him much injury if she leaned back in her armchair just in such a twilight as this and thought of the highmettled men whose sense of duty called them to arms against his grandfather and how in a cause which they deemed that of their rightful prince and country    they fought till their hand to the broadsword was glued   they fought against fortune with hearts unsubdued  do not come at such a moment when my head is full of plaids pibrochs and claymores and ask my reason to admit what i am afraid it cannot denyi mean that the public advantage peremptorily demanded that these things should cease to exist i cannot indeed refuse to allow the justice of your reasoning but yet being convinced against my will you will gain little by your motion you might as well read to an infatuated lover the catalogue of his mistresss imperfections for when he has been compelled to listen to the summary you will only get for answer that he loes her a the better  i was not sorry to have changed the gloomy train of aunt margarets thoughts and replied in the same tone well i cant help being persuaded that our good king is the more sure of mrs bothwells loyal affection that he has the stewart right of birth as well as the act of succession in his favour  perhaps my attachment were its source of consequence might be found warmer for the union of the rights you mention said aunt margaret but upon my word it would be as sincere if the kings right were founded only on the will of the nation as declared at the revolution i am none of your jure divino folks  and a jacobite notwithstanding  and a jacobite notwithstandingor rather i will give you leave to call me one of the party which in queen annes time were called whimsicals because they were sometimes operated upon by feelings sometimes by principle after all it is very hard that you will not allow an old woman to be as inconsistent in her political sentiments as mankind in general show themselves in all the various courses of life since you cannot point out one of them in which the passions and prejudices of those who pursue it are not perpetually carrying us away from the path which our reason points out  true aunt but you are a wilful wanderer who should be forced back into the right path  spare me i entreat you replied aunt margaret you remember the gaelic song though i dare say i mispronounce the words     hatil mohatil na dowski mi   i am asleep do not waken me  i tell you kinsman that the sort of waking dreams which my imagination spins out in what your favourite wordsworth calls moods of my own mind are worth all the rest of my more active days then instead of looking forwards as i did in youth and forming for myself fairy palaces upon the verge of the grave i turn my eyes backward upon the days and manners of my better time and the sad yet soothing recollections come so close and interesting that i almost think it sacrilege to be wiser or more rational or less prejudiced than those to whom i looked up in my younger years  i think i now understand what you mean i answered and can comprehend why you should occasionally prefer the twilight of illusion to the steady light of reason  where there is no task she rejoined to be performed we may sit in the dark if we like it if we go to work we must ring for candles  and amidst such shadowy and doubtful light continued i imagination frames her enchanted and enchanting visions and sometimes passes them upon the senses for reality  yes said aunt margaret who is a wellread woman to those who resemble the translator of tasso     prevailing poet whose undoubting mind    believed the magic wonders which he sung  it is not required for this purpose that you should be sensible of the painful horrors which an actual belief in such prodigies inflicts such a belief nowadays belongs only to fools and children it is not necessary that your ears should tingle and your complexion change like that of theodore at the approach of the spectral huntsman all that is indispensable for the enjoyment of the milder feeling of supernatural awe is that you should be susceptible of the slight shuddering which creeps over you when you hear a tale of terrorthat wellvouched tale which the narrator having first expressed his general disbelief of all such legendary lore selects and produces as having something in it which he has been always obliged to give up as inexplicable another symptom is a momentary hesitation to look round you when the interest of the narrative is at the highest and the third a desire to avoid looking into a mirror when you are alone in your chamber for the evening i mean such are signs which indicate the crisis when a female imagination is in due temperature to enjoy a ghost story i do not pretend to describe those which express the same disposition in a gentleman  that last symptom dear aunt of shunning the mirror seems likely to be a rare occurrence amongst the fair sex  you are a novice in toilet fashions my dear cousin all women consult the lookingglass with anxiety before they go into company but when they return home the mirror has not the same charm the die has been castthe party has been successful or unsuccessful in the impression which she desired to make but without going deeper into the mysteries of the dressingtable i will tell you that i myself like many other honest folks do not like to see the blank black front of a large mirror in a room dimly lighted and where the reflection of the candle seems rather to lose itself in the deep obscurity of the glass than to be reflected back again into the apartment that space of inky darkness seems to be a field for fancy to play her revels in she may call up other features to meet us instead of the reflection of our own or as in the spells of halloween which we learned in childhood some unknown form may be seen peeping over our shoulder in short when i am in a ghostseeing humour i make my handmaiden draw the green curtains over the mirror before i go into the room so that she may have the first shock of the apparition if there be any to be seen but to tell you the truth this dislike to look into a mirror in particular times and places has i believe its original foundation in a story which came to me by tradition from my grandmother who was a party concerned in the scene of which i will now tell you     the mirror    chapter i  you are fond said my aunt of sketches of the society which has passed away i wish i could describe to you sir philip forester the chartered libertine of scottish good company about the end of the last century i never saw him indeed but my mothers traditions were full of his wit gallantry and dissipation this gay knight flourished about the end of the seventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth century he was the sir charles easy and the lovelace of his day and countryrenowned for the number of duels he had fought and the successful intrigues which he had carried on the supremacy which he had attained in the fashionable world was absolute and when we combine it with one or two anecdotes for which if laws were made for every degree he ought certainly to have been hanged the popularity of such a person really serves to show either that the present times are much more decent if not more virtuous than they formerly were or that highbreeding then was of more difficult attainment than that which is now so called and consequently entitled the successful professor to a proportional degree of plenary indulgences and privileges no beau of this day could have borne out so ugly a story as that of pretty peggy grindstone the millers daughter at sillermillsit had wellnigh made work for the lord advocate but it hurt sir philip forester no more than the hail hurts the hearthstone he was as well received in society as ever and dined with the duke of a the day the poor girl was buried she died of heartbreak but that has nothing to do with my story  now you must listen to a single word upon kith kin and ally i promise you i will not be prolix but it is necessary to the authenticity of my legend that you should know that sir philip forester with his handsome person elegant accomplishments and fashionable manners married the younger miss falconer of kings copland the elder sister of this lady had previously become the wife of my grandfather sir geoffrey bothwell and brought into our family a good fortune miss jemima or miss jemmie falconer as she was usually called had also about ten thousand pounds sterlingthen thought a very handsome portion indeed  the two sisters were extremely different though each had their admirers while they remained single lady bothwell had some touch of the old kings copland blood about her she was bold though not to the degree of audacity ambitious and desirous to raise her house and family and was as has been said a considerable spur to my grandfather who was otherwise an indolent man but whom unless he has been slandered his ladys influence involved in some political matters which had been more wisely let alone she was a woman of high principle however and masculine good sense as some of her letters testify which are still in my wainscot cabinet  jemmie falconer was the reverse of her sister in every respect her understanding did not reach above the ordinary pitch if indeed she could be said to have attained it her beauty while it lasted consisted in a great measure of delicacy of complexion and regularity of features without any peculiar force of expression even these charms faded under the sufferings attendant on an illassorted match she was passionately attached to her husband by whom she was treated with a callous yet polite indifference which to one whose heart was as tender as her judgment was weak was more painful perhaps than absolute illusage sir philip was a voluptuarythat is a completely selfish egotistwhose disposition and character resembled the rapier he wore polished keen and brilliant but inflexible and unpitying as he observed carefully all the usual forms towards his lady he had the art to deprive her even of the compassion of the world and useless and unavailing as that may be while actually possessed by the sufferer it is to a mind like lady foresters most painful to know she has it not  the tattle of society did its best to place the peccant husband above the suffering wife some called her a poor spiritless thing and declared that with a little of her sisters spirit she might have brought to reason any sir philip whatsoever were it the termagant falconbridge himself but the greater part of their acquaintance affected candour and saw faults on both sidesthough in fact there only existed the oppressor and the oppressed the tone of such critics was to be sure no one will justify sir philip forester but then we all know sir philip and jemmie falconer might have known what she had to expect from the beginning what made her set her cap at sir philip he would never have looked at her if she had not thrown herself at his head with her poor ten thousand pounds i am sure if it is money he wanted she spoiled his market i know where sir philip could have done much better and then if she would have the man could not she try to make him more comfortable at home and have his friends oftener and not plague him with the squalling children and take care all was handsome and in good style about the house i declare i think sir philip would have made a very domestic man with a woman who knew how to manage him  now these fair critics in raising their profound edifice of domestic felicity did not recollect that the cornerstone was wanting and that to receive good company with good cheer the means of the banquet ought to have been furnished by sir philip whose income dilapidated as it was was not equal to the display of the hospitality required and at the same time to the supply of the good knights menus plaisirs so in spite of all that was so sagely suggested by female friends sir philip carried his goodhumour everywhere abroad and left at home a solitary mansion and a pining spouse  at length inconvenienced in his money affairs and tired even of the short time which he spent in his own dull house sir philip forester determined to take a trip to the continent in the capacity of a volunteer it was then common for men of fashion to do so and our knight perhaps was of opinion that a touch of the military character just enough to exalt but not render pedantic his qualities as a beau garcon was necessary to maintain possession of the elevated situation which he held in the ranks of fashion  sir philips resolution threw his wife into agonies of terror by which the worthy baronet was so much annoyed that contrary to his wont he took some trouble to soothe her apprehensions and once more brought her to shed tears in which sorrow was not altogether unmingled with pleasure lady bothwell asked as a favour sir philips permission to receive her sister and her family into her own house during his absence on the continent sir philip readily assented to a proposition which saved expense silenced the foolish people who might have talked of a deserted wife and family and gratified lady bothwell for whom he felt some respect as for one who often spoke to him always with freedom and sometimes with severity without being deterred either by his raillery or the prestige of his reputation  a day or two before sir philips departure lady bothwell took the liberty of asking him in her sisters presence the direct question which his timid wife had often desired but never ventured to put to him  pray sir philip what route do you take when you reach the continent  i go from leith to helvoet by a packet with advices  that i comprehend perfectly said lady bothwell dryly but you do not mean to remain long at helvoet i presume and i should like to know what is your next object  you ask me my dear lady answered sir philip a question which i have not dared to ask myself the answer depends on the fate of war i shall of course go to headquarters wherever they may happen to be for the time deliver my letters of introduction learn as much of the noble art of war as may suffice a poor interloping amateur and then take a glance at the sort of thing of which we read so much in the gazette  and i trust sir philip said lady bothwell that you will remember that you are a husband and a father and that though you think fit to indulge this military fancy you will not let it hurry you into dangers which it is certainly unnecessary for any save professional persons to encounter  lady bothwell does me too much honour replied the adventurous knight in regarding such a circumstance with the slightest interest but to soothe your flattering anxiety i trust your ladyship will recollect that i cannot expose to hazard the venerable and paternal character which you so obligingly recommend to my protection without putting in some peril an honest fellow called philip forester with whom i have kept company for thirty years and with whom though some folks consider him a coxcomb i have not the least desire to part  well sir philip you are the best judge of your own affairs i have little right to interfereyou are not my husband  god forbid said sir philip hastily instantly adding however god forbid that i should deprive my friend sir geoffrey of so inestimable a treasure  but you are my sisters husband replied the lady and i suppose you are aware of her present distress of mind  if hearing of nothing else from morning to night can make me aware of it said sir philip i should know something of the matter  i do not pretend to reply to your wit sir philip answered lady bothwell but you must be sensible that all this distress is on account of apprehensions for your personal safety  in that case i am surprised that lady bothwell at least should give herself so much trouble upon so insignificant a subject  my sisters interest may account for my being anxious to learn something of sir philip foresters motions about which otherwise i know he would not wish me to concern myself i have a brothers safety too to be anxious for  you mean major falconer your brother by the mothers side what can he possibly have to do with our present agreeable conversation  you have had words together sir philip said lady bothwell  naturally we are connections replied sir philip and as such have always had the usual intercourse  that is an evasion of the subject answered the lady by words i mean angry words on the subject of your usage of your wife  if replied sir philip forester you suppose major falconer simple enough to intrude his advice upon me lady bothwell in my domestic matters you are indeed warranted in believing that i might possibly be so far displeased with the interference as to request him to reserve his advice till it was asked  and being on these terms you are going to join the very army in which my brother falconer is now serving  no man knows the path of honour better than major falconer said sir philip an aspirant after fame like me cannot choose a better guide than his footsteps  lady bothwell rose and went to the window the tears gushing from her eyes  and this heartless raillery she said is all the consideration that is to be given to our apprehensions of a quarrel which may bring on the most terrible consequences good god of what can mens hearts be made who can thus dally with the agony of others  sir philip forester was moved he laid aside the mocking tone in which he had hitherto spoken  dear lady bothwell he said taking her reluctant hand we are both wrong you are too deeply serious i perhaps too little so the dispute i had with major falconer was of no earthly consequence had anything occurred betwixt us that ought to have been settled par voie du fait as we say in france neither of us are persons that are likely to postpone such a meeting permit me to say that were it generally known that you or my lady forester are apprehensive of such a catastrophe it might be the very means of bringing about what would not otherwise be likely to happen i know your good sense lady bothwell and that you will understand me when i say that really my affairs require my absence for some months this jemima cannot understand it is a perpetual recurrence of questions why can you not do this or that or the third thing and when you have proved to her that her expedients are totally ineffectual you have just to begin the whole round again now do you tell her dear lady bothwell that you are satisfied she is you must confess one of those persons with whom authority goes farther than reasoning do but repose a little confidence in me and you shall see how amply i will repay it  lady bothwell shook her head as one but half satisfied how difficult it is to extend confidence when the basis on which it ought to rest has been so much shaken but i will do my best to make jemima easy and further i can only say that for keeping your present purpose i hold you responsible both to god and man  do not fear that i will deceive you said sir philip the safest conveyance to me will be through the general postoffice helvoetsluys where i will take care to leave orders for forwarding my letters as for falconer our only encounter will be over a bottle of burgundy so make yourself perfectly easy on his score  lady bothwell could not make herself easy yet she was sensible that her sister hurt her own cause by taking on as the maidservants call it too vehemently and by showing before every stranger by manner and sometimes by words also a dissatisfaction with her husbands journey that was sure to come to his ears and equally certain to displease him but there was no help for this domestic dissension which ended only with the day of separation  i am sorry i cannot tell with precision the year in which sir philip forester went over to flanders but it was one of those in which the campaign opened with extraordinary fury and many bloody though indecisive skirmishes were fought between the french on the one side and the allies on the other in all our modern improvements there are none perhaps greater than in the accuracy and speed with which intelligence is transmitted from any scene of action to those in this country whom it may concern during marlboroughs campaigns the sufferings of the many who had relations in or along with the army were greatly augmented by the suspense in which they were detained for weeks after they had heard of bloody battles in which in all probability those for whom their bosoms throbbed with anxiety had been personally engaged amongst those who were most agonized by this state of uncertainty was thei had almost said desertedwife of the gay sir philip forester a single letter had informed her of his arrival on the continent no others were received one notice occurred in the newspapers in which volunteer sir philip forester was mentioned as having been entrusted with a dangerous reconnaissance which he had executed with the greatest courage dexterity and intelligence and received the thanks of the commanding officer the sense of his having acquired distinction brought a momentary glow into the ladys pale cheek but it was instantly lost in ashen whiteness at the recollection of his danger after this they had no news whatever neither from sir philip nor even from their brother falconer the case of lady forester was not indeed different from that of hundreds in the same situation but a feeble mind is necessarily an irritable one and the suspense which some bear with constitutional indifference or philosophical resignation and some with a disposition to believe and hope the best was intolerable to lady forester at once solitary and sensitive lowspirited and devoid of strength of mind whether natural or acquired    chapter ii  as she received no further news of sir philip whether directly or indirectly his unfortunate lady began now to feel a sort of consolation even in those careless habits which had so often given her pain he is so thoughtless she repeated a hundred times a day to her sister he never writes when things are going on smoothly it is his way had anything happened he would have informed us  lady bothwell listened to her sister without attempting to console her probably she might be of opinion that even the worst intelligence which could be received from flanders might not be without some touch of consolation and that the dowager lady forester if so she was doomed to be called might have a source of happiness unknown to the wife of the gayest and finest gentleman in scotland this conviction became stronger as they learned from inquiries made at headquarters that sir philip was no longer with the armythough whether he had been taken or slain in some of those skirmishes which were perpetually occurring and in which he loved to distinguish himself or whether he had for some unknown reason or capricious change of mind voluntarily left the service none of his countrymen in the camp of the allies could form even a conjecture meantime his creditors at home became clamorous entered into possession of his property and threatened his person should he be rash enough to return to scotland these additional disadvantages aggravated lady bothwells displeasure against the fugitive husband while her sister saw nothing in any of them save what tended to increase her grief for the absence of him whom her imagination now representedas it had before marriagegallant gay and affectionate  about this period there appeared in edinburgh a man of singular appearance and pretensions he was commonly called the paduan doctor from having received his education at that famous university he was supposed to possess some rare receipts in medicine with which it was affirmed he had wrought remarkable cures but though on the one hand the physicians of edinburgh termed him an empiric there were many persons and among them some of the clergy who while they admitted the truth of the cures and the force of his remedies alleged that doctor baptista damiotti made use of charms and unlawful arts in order to obtain success in his practice the resorting to him was even solemnly preached against as a seeking of health from idols and a trusting to the help which was to come from egypt but the protection which the paduan doctor received from some friends of interest and consequence enabled him to set these imputations at defiance and to assume even in the city of edinburgh famed as it was for abhorrence of witches and necromancers the dangerous character of an expounder of futurity it was at length rumoured that for a certain gratification which of course was not an inconsiderable one doctor baptista damiotti could tell the fate of the absent and even show his visitors the personal form of their absent friends and the action in which they were engaged at the moment this rumour came to the ears of lady forester who had reached that pitch of mental agony in which the sufferer will do anything or endure anything that suspense may be converted into certainty  gentle and timid in most cases her state of mind made her equally obstinate and reckless and it was with no small surprise and alarm that her sister lady bothwell heard her express a resolution to visit this man of art and learn from him the fate of her husband lady bothwell remonstrated on the improbability that such pretensions as those of this foreigner could be founded in anything but imposture  i care not said the deserted wife what degree of ridicule i may incur if there be any one chance out of a hundred that i may obtain some certainty of my husbands fate i would not miss that chance for whatever else the world can offer me  lady bothwell next urged the unlawfulness of resorting to such sources of forbidden knowledge  sister replied the sufferer he who is dying of thirst cannot refrain from drinking even poisoned water she who suffers under suspense must seek information even were the powers which offer it unhallowed and infernal i go to learn my fate alone and this very evening will i know it the sun that rises tomorrow shall find me if not more happy at least more resigned  sister said lady bothwell if you are determined upon this wild step you shall not go alone if this man be an impostor you may be too much agitated by your feelings to detect his villainy if which i cannot believe there be any truth in what he pretends you shall not be exposed alone to a communication of so extraordinary a nature i will go with you if indeed you determine to go but yet reconsider your project and renounce inquiries which cannot be prosecuted without guilt and perhaps without danger  lady forester threw herself into her sisters arms and clasping her to her bosom thanked her a hundred times for the offer of her company while she declined with a melancholy gesture the friendly advice with which it was accompanied  when the hour of twilight arrivedwhich was the period when the paduan doctor was understood to receive the visits of those who came to consult with himthe two ladies left their apartments in the canongate of edinburgh having their dress arranged like that of women of an inferior description and their plaids disposed around their faces as they were worn by the same class for in those days of aristocracy the quality of the wearer was generally indicated by the manner in which her plaid was disposed as well as by the fineness of its texture it was lady bothwell who had suggested this species of disguise partly to avoid observation as they should go to the conjurers house and partly in order to make trial of his penetration by appearing before him in a feigned character lady foresters servant of tried fidelity had been employed by her to propitiate the doctor by a suitable fee and a story intimating that a soldiers wife desired to know the fate of her husbanda subject upon which in all probability the sage was very frequently consulted  to the last moment when the palace clock struck eight lady bothwell earnestly watched her sister in hopes that she might retreat from her rash undertaking but as mildness and even timidity is capable at times of vehement and fixed purposes she found lady forester resolutely unmoved and determined when the moment of departure arrived ill satisfied with the expedition but determined not to leave her sister at such a crisis lady bothwell accompanied lady forester through more than one obscure street and lane the servant walking before and acting as their guide at length he suddenly turned into a narrow court and knocked at an arched door which seemed to belong to a building of some antiquity it opened though no one appeared to act as porter and the servant stepping aside from the entrance motioned the ladies to enter they had no sooner done so than it shut and excluded their guide the two ladies found themselves in a small vestibule illuminated by a dim lamp and having when the door was closed no communication with the external light or air the door of an inner apartment partly open was at the farther side of the vestibule  we must not hesitate now jemima said lady bothwell and walked forwards into the inner room where surrounded by books maps philosophical utensils and other implements of peculiar shape and appearance they found the man of art  there was nothing very peculiar in the italians appearance he had the dark complexion and marked features of his country seemed about fifty years old and was handsomely but plainly dressed in a full suit of black clothes which was then the universal costume of the medical profession large waxlights in silver sconces illuminated the apartment which was reasonably furnished he rose as the ladies entered and notwithstanding the inferiority of their dress received them with the marked respect due to their quality and which foreigners are usually punctilious in rendering to those to whom such honours are due  lady bothwell endeavoured to maintain her proposed incognito and as the doctor ushered them to the upper end of the room made a motion declining his courtesy as unfitted for their condition we are poor people sir she said only my sisters distress has brought us to consult your worship whether  he smiled as he interrupted heri am aware madam of your sisters distress and its cause i am aware also that i am honoured with a visit from two ladies of the highest considerationlady bothwell and lady forester if i could not distinguish them from the class of society which their present dress would indicate there would be small possibility of my being able to gratify them by giving the information which they come to seek  i can easily understand said lady bothwell  pardon my boldness to interrupt you milady cried the italian your ladyship was about to say that you could easily understand that i had got possession of your names by means of your domestic but in thinking so you do injustice to the fidelity of your servant and i may add to the skill of one who is also not less your humble servantbaptista damiotti  i have no intention to do either sir said lady bothwell maintaining a tone of composure though somewhat surprised but the situation is something new to me if you know who we are you also know sir what brought us here  curiosity to know the fate of a scottish gentleman of rank now or lately upon the continent answered the seer his name is il cavaliero philippo forester a gentleman who has the honour to be husband to this lady and with your ladyships permission for using plain language the misfortune not to value as it deserves that inestimable advantage  lady forester sighed deeply and lady bothwell replied  since you know our object without our telling it the only question that remains is whether you have the power to relieve my sisters anxiety  i have madam answered the paduan scholar but there is still a previous inquiry have you the courage to behold with your own eyes what the cavaliero philippo forester is now doing or will you take it on my report  that question my sister must answer for herself said lady bothwell  with my own eyes will i endure to see whatever you have power to show me said lady forester with the same determined spirit which had stimulated her since her resolution was taken upon this subject  there may be danger in it  if gold can compensate the risk said lady forester taking out her purse  i do not such things for the purpose of gain answered the foreigner i dare not turn my art to such a purpose if i take the gold of the wealthy it is but to bestow it on the poor nor do i ever accept more than the sum i have already received from your servant put up your purse madam an adept needs not your gold  lady bothwell considering this rejection of her sisters offer as a mere trick of an empiric to induce her to press a larger sum upon him and willing that the scene should be commenced and ended offered some gold in turn observing that it was only to enlarge the sphere of his charity  let lady bothwell enlarge the sphere of her own charity said the paduan not merely in giving of alms in which i know she is not deficient but in judging the character of others and let her oblige baptista damiotti by believing him honest till she shall discover him to be a knave do not be surprised madam if i speak in answer to your thoughts rather than your expressions and tell me once more whether you have courage to look on what i am prepared to show  i own sir said lady bothwell that your words strike me with some sense of fear but whatever my sister desires to witness i will not shrink from witnessing along with her  nay the danger only consists in the risk of your resolution failing you the sight can only last for the space of seven minutes and should you interrupt the vision by speaking a single word not only would the charm be broken but some danger might result to the spectators but if you can remain steadily silent for the seven minutes your curiosity will be gratified without the slightest risk and for this i will engage my honour  internally lady bothwell thought the security was but an indifferent one but she suppressed the suspicion as if she had believed that the adept whose dark features wore a halfformed smile could in reality read even her most secret reflections a solemn pause then ensued until lady forester gathered courage enough to reply to the physician as he termed himself that she would abide with firmness and silence the sight which he had promised to exhibit to them upon this he made them a low obeisance and saying he went to prepare matters to meet their wish left the apartment the two sisters hand in hand as if seeking by that close union to divert any danger which might threaten them sat down on two seats in immediate contact with each otherjemima seeking support in the manly and habitual courage of lady bothwell and she on the other hand more agitated than she had expected endeavouring to fortify herself by the desperate resolution which circumstances had forced her sister to assume the one perhaps said to herself that her sister never feared anything and the other might reflect that what so feebleminded a woman as jemima did not fear could not properly be a subject of apprehension to a person of firmness and resolution like her own  in a few moments the thoughts of both were diverted from their own situation by a strain of music so singularly sweet and solemn that while it seemed calculated to avert or dispel any feeling unconnected with its harmony increased at the same time the solemn excitation which the preceding interview was calculated to produce the music was that of some instrument with which they were unacquainted but circumstances afterwards led my ancestress to believe that it was that of the harmonica which she heard at a much later period in life  when these heavenborn sounds had ceased a door opened in the upper end of the apartment and they saw damiotti standing at the head of two or three steps sign to them to advance his dress was so different from that which he had worn a few minutes before that they could hardly recognize him and the deadly paleness of his countenance and a certain stern rigidity of muscles like that of one whose mind is made up to some strange and daring action had totally changed the somewhat sarcastic expression with which he had previously regarded them both and particularly lady bothwell he was barefooted excepting a species of sandals in the antique fashion his legs were naked beneath the knees above them he wore hose and a doublet of dark crimson silk close to his body and over that a flowing loose robe something resembling a surplice of snowwhite linen his throat and neck were uncovered and his long straight black hair was carefully combed down at full length  as the ladies approached at his bidding he showed no gesture of that ceremonious courtesy of which he had been formerly lavish on the contrary he made the signal of advance with an air of command and when arm in arm and with insecure steps the sisters approached the spot where he stood it was with a warning frown that he pressed his finger to his lips as if reiterating his condition of absolute silence while stalking before them he led the way into the next apartment  this was a large room hung with black as if for a funeral at the upper end was a table or rather a species of altar covered with the same lugubrious colour on which lay divers objects resembling the usual implements of sorcery these objects were not indeed visible as they advanced into the apartment for the light which displayed them being only that of two expiring lamps was extremely faint the masterto use the italian phrase for persons of this descriptionapproached the upper end of the room with a genuflection like that of a catholic to the crucifix and at the same time crossed himself the ladies followed in silence and arm in arm two or three low broad steps led to a platform in front of the altar or what resembled such here the sage took his stand and placed the ladies beside him once more earnestly repeating by signs his injunctions of silence the italian then extending his bare arm from under his linen vestment pointed with his forefinger to five large flambeaux or torches placed on each side of the altar they took fire successively at the approach of his hand or rather of his finger and spread a strong light through the room by this the visitors could discern that on the seeming altar were disposed two naked swords laid crosswise a large open book which they conceived to be a copy of the holy scriptures but in a language to them unknown and beside this mysterious volume was placed a human skull but what struck the sisters most was a very tall and broad mirror which occupied all the space behind the altar and illumined by the lighted torches reflected the mysterious articles which were laid upon it  the master then placed himself between the two ladies and pointing to the mirror took each by the hand but without speaking a syllable they gazed intently on the polished and sable space to which he had directed their attention suddenly the surface assumed a new and singular appearance it no longer simply reflected the objects placed before it but as if it had selfcontained scenery of its own objects began to appear within it at first in a disorderly indistinct and miscellaneous manner like form arranging itself out of chaos at length in distinct and defined shape and symmetry it was thus that after some shifting of light and darkness over the face of the wonderful glass a long perspective of arches and columns began to arrange itself on its sides and a vaulted roof on the upper part of it till after many oscillations the whole vision gained a fixed and stationary appearance representing the interior of a foreign church the pillars were stately and hung with scutcheons the arches were lofty and magnificent the floor was lettered with funeral inscriptions but there were no separate shrines no images no display of chalice or crucifix on the altar it was therefore a protestant church upon the continent a clergyman dressed in the geneva gown and band stood by the communion table and with the bible opened before him and his clerk awaiting in the background seemed prepared to perform some service of the church to which he belonged  at length there entered the middle aisle of the building a numerous party which appeared to be a bridal one as a lady and gentleman walked first hand in hand followed by a large concourse of persons of both sexes gaily nay richly attired the bride whose features they could distinctly see seemed not more than sixteen years old and extremely beautiful the bridegroom for some seconds moved rather with his shoulder towards them and his face averted but his elegance of form and step struck the sisters at once with the same apprehension as he turned his face suddenly it was frightfully realized and they saw in the gay bridegroom before them sir philip forester his wife uttered an imperfect exclamation at the sound of which the whole scene stirred and seemed to separate  i could compare it to nothing said lady bothwell while recounting the wonderful tale but to the dispersion of the reflection offered by a deep and calm pool when a stone is suddenly cast into it and the shadows become dissipated and broken the master pressed both the ladies hands severely as if to remind them of their promise and of the danger which they incurred the exclamation died away on lady foresters tongue without attaining perfect utterance and the scene in the glass after the fluctuation of a minute again resumed to the eye its former appearance of a real scene existing within the mirror as if represented in a picture save that the figures were movable instead of being stationary  the representation of sir philip forester now distinctly visible in form and feature was seen to lead on towards the clergyman that beautiful girl who advanced at once with diffidence and with a species of affectionate pride in the meantime and just as the clergyman had arranged the bridal company before him and seemed about to commence the service another group of persons of whom two or three were officers entered the church they moved at first forward as though they came to witness the bridal ceremony but suddenly one of the officers whose back was towards the spectators detached himself from his companions and rushed hastily towards the marriage party when the whole of them turned towards him as if attracted by some exclamation which had accompanied his advance suddenly the intruder drew his sword the bridegroom unsheathed his own and made towards him swords were also drawn by other individuals both of the marriage party and of those who had last entered they fell into a sort of confusion the clergyman and some elder and graver persons labouring apparently to keep the peace while the hotter spirits on both sides brandished their weapons but now the period of the brief space during which the soothsayer as he pretended was permitted to exhibit his art was arrived the fumes again mixed together and dissolved gradually from observation the vaults and columns of the church rolled asunder and disappeared and the front of the mirror reflected nothing save the blazing torches and the melancholy apparatus placed on the altar or table before it  the doctor led the ladies who greatly required his support into the apartment from whence they came where wine essences and other means of restoring suspended animation had been provided during his absence he motioned them to chairs which they occupied in silencelady forester in particular wringing her hands and casting her eyes up to heaven but without speaking a word as if the spell had been still before her eyes  and what we have seen is even now acting said lady bothwell collecting herself with difficulty  that answered baptista damiotti i cannot justly or with certainty say but it is either now acting or has been acted during a short space before this it is the last remarkable transaction in which the cavalier forester has been engaged  lady bothwell then expressed anxiety concerning her sister whose altered countenance and apparent unconsciousness of what passed around her excited her apprehensions how it might be possible to convey her home  i have prepared for that answered the adept i have directed the servant to bring your equipage as near to this place as the narrowness of the street will permit fear not for your sister but give her when you return home this composing draught and she will be better tomorrow morning few he added in a melancholy tone leave this house as well in health as they entered it such being the consequence of seeking knowledge by mysterious means i leave you to judge the condition of those who have the power of gratifying such irregular curiosity farewell and forget not the potion  i will give her nothing that comes from you said lady bothwell i have seen enough of your art already perhaps you would poison us both to conceal your own necromancy but we are persons who want neither the means of making our wrongs known nor the assistance of friends to right them  you have had no wrongs from me madam said the adept you sought one who is little grateful for such honour he seeks no one and only gives responses to those who invite and call upon him after all you have but learned a little sooner the evil which you must still be doomed to endure i hear your servants step at the door and will detain your ladyship and lady forester no longer the next packet from the continent will explain what you have already partly witnessed let it not if i may advise pass too suddenly into your sisters hands  so saying he bid lady bothwell goodnight she went lighted by the adept to the vestibule where he hastily threw a black cloak over his singular dress and opening the door entrusted his visitors to the care of the servant it was with difficulty that lady bothwell sustained her sister to the carriage though it was only twenty steps distant when they arrived at home lady forester required medical assistance the physician of the family attended and shook his head on feeling her pulse  here has been he said a violent and sudden shock on the nerves i must know how it has happened  lady bothwell admitted they had visited the conjurer and that lady forester had received some bad news respecting her husband sir philip  that rascally quack would make my fortune were he to stay in edinburgh said the graduate this is the seventh nervous case i have heard of his making for me and all by effect of terror he next examined the composing draught which lady bothwell had unconsciously brought in her hand tasted it and pronounced it very germain to the matter and what would save an application to the apothecary he then paused and looking at lady bothwell very significantly at length added i suppose i must not ask your ladyship anything about this italian warlocks proceedings  indeed doctor answered lady bothwell i consider what passed as confidential and though the man may be a rogue yet as we were fools enough to consult him we should i think be honest enough to keep his counsel  may be a knave come said the doctor i am glad to hear your ladyship allows such a possibility in anything that comes from italy  what comes from italy may be as good as what comes from hanover doctor but you and i will remain good friends and that it may be so we will say nothing of whig and tory  not i said the doctor receiving his fee and taking his hat a carolus serves my purpose as well as a willielmus but i should like to know why old lady saint ringan and all that set go about wasting their decayed lungs in puffing this foreign fellow  ayyou had best set him down a jesuit as scrub says on these terms they parted  the poor patientwhose nerves from an extraordinary state of tension had at length become relaxed in as extraordinary a degreecontinued to struggle with a sort of imbecility the growth of superstitious terror when the shocking tidings were brought from holland which fulfilled even her worst expectations  they were sent by the celebrated earl of stair and contained the melancholy event of a duel betwixt sir philip forester and his wifes halfbrother captain falconer of the scotchdutch as they were then called in which the latter had been killed the cause of quarrel rendered the incident still more shocking it seemed that sir philip had left the army suddenly in consequence of being unable to pay a very considerable sum which he had lost to another volunteer at play he had changed his name and taken up his residence at rotterdam where he had insinuated himself into the good graces of an ancient and rich burgomaster and by his handsome person and graceful manners captivated the affections of his only child a very young person of great beauty and the heiress of much wealth delighted with the specious attractions of his proposed soninlaw the wealthy merchantwhose idea of the british character was too high to admit of his taking any precaution to acquire evidence of his condition and circumstancesgave his consent to the marriage it was about to be celebrated in the principal church of the city when it was interrupted by a singular occurrence  captain falconer having been detached to rotterdam to bring up a part of the brigade of scottish auxiliaries who were in quarters there a person of consideration in the town to whom he had been formerly known proposed to him for amusement to go to the high church to see a countryman of his own married to the daughter of a wealthy burgomaster captain falconer went accordingly accompanied by his dutch acquaintance with a party of his friends and two or three officers of the scotch brigade his astonishment may be conceived when he saw his own brotherinlaw a married man on the point of leading to the altar the innocent and beautiful creature upon whom he was about to practise a base and unmanly deceit he proclaimed his villainy on the spot and the marriage was interrupted of course but against the opinion of more thinking men who considered sir philip forester as having thrown himself out of the rank of men of honour captain falconer admitted him to the privilege of such accepted a challenge from him and in the rencounter received a mortal wound such are the ways of heaven mysterious in our eyes lady forester never recovered the shock of this dismal intelligence   and did this tragedy said i take place exactly at the time when the scene in the mirror was exhibited  it is hard to be obliged to maim ones story answered my aunt but to speak the truth it happened some days sooner than the apparition was exhibited  and so there remained a possibility said i that by some secret and speedy communication the artist might have received early intelligence of that incident  the incredulous pretended so replied my aunt  what became of the adept demanded i  why a warrant came down shortly afterwards to arrest him for high treason as an agent of the chevalier st george and lady bothwell recollecting the hints which had escaped the doctor an ardent friend of the protestant succession did then call to remembrance that this man was chiefly prone among the ancient matrons of her own political persuasion it certainly seemed probable that intelligence from the continent which could easily have been transmitted by an active and powerful agent might have enabled him to prepare such a scene of phantasmagoria as she had herself witnessed yet there were so many difficulties in assigning a natural explanation that to the day of her death she remained in great doubt on the subject and much disposed to cut the gordian knot by admitting the existence of supernatural agency  but my dear aunt said i what became of the man of skill  oh he was too good a fortuneteller not to be able to foresee that his own destiny would be tragical if he waited the arrival of the man with the silver greyhound upon his sleeve he made as we say a moonlight flitting and was nowhere to be seen or heard of some noise there was about papers or letters found in the house but it died away and doctor baptista damiotti was soon as little talked of as galen or hippocrates  and sir philip forester said i did he too vanish for ever from the public scene  no replied my kind informer he was heard of once more and it was upon a remarkable occasion it is said that we scots when there was such a nation in existence have among our full peck of virtues one or two little barleycorns of vice in particular it is alleged that we rarely forgive and never forget any injuries receivedthat we make an idol of our resentment as poor lady constance did of her grief and are addicted as burns says to nursing our wrath to keep it warm lady bothwell was not without this feeling and i believe nothing whatever scarce the restoration of the stewart line could have happened so delicious to her feelings as an opportunity of being revenged on sir philip forester for the deep and double injury which had deprived her of a sister and of a brother but nothing of him was heard or known till many a year had passed away  at lengthit was on a fasterns een shrovetide assembly at which the whole fashion of edinburgh attended full and frequent and when lady bothwell had a seat amongst the lady patronesses that one of the attendants on the company whispered into her ear that a gentleman wished to speak with her in private  in private and in an assembly roomhe must be mad tell him to call upon me tomorrow morning  i said so my lady answered the man but he desired me to give you this paper  she undid the billet which was curiously folded and sealed it only bore the words on business of life and death written in a hand which she had never seen before suddenly it occurred to her that it might concern the safety of some of her political friends she therefore followed the messenger to a small apartment where the refreshments were prepared and from which the general company was excluded she found an old man who at her approach rose up and bowed profoundly his appearance indicated a broken constitution and his dress though sedulously rendered conforming to the etiquette of a ballroom was worn and tarnished and hung in folds about his emaciated person lady bothwell was about to feel for her purse expecting to get rid of the supplicant at the expense of a little money but some fear of a mistake arrested her purpose she therefore gave the man leisure to explain himself  i have the honour to speak with the lady bothwell  i am lady bothwell allow me to say that this is no time or place for long explanations what are your commands with me  your ladyship said the old man had once a sister  true whom i loved as my own soul  and a brother  the bravest the kindest the most affectionate said lady bothwell  both these beloved relatives you lost by the fault of an unfortunate man continued the stranger  by the crime of an unnatural bloodyminded murderer said the lady  i am answered replied the old man bowing as if to withdraw  stop sir i command you said lady bothwell who are you that at such a place and time come to recall these horrible recollections i insist upon knowing  i am one who intends lady bothwell no injury but on the contrary to offer her the means of doing a deed of christian charity which the world would wonder at and which heaven would reward but i find her in no temper for such a sacrifice as i was prepared to ask  speak out sir what is your meaning said lady bothwell  the wretch that has wronged you so deeply rejoined the stranger is now on his deathbed his days have been days of misery his nights have been sleepless hours of anguishyet he cannot die without your forgiveness his life has been an unremitting penanceyet he dares not part from his burden while your curses load his soul  tell him said lady bothwell sternly to ask pardon of that being whom he has so greatly offended not of an erring mortal like himself what could my forgiveness avail him  much answered the old man it will be an earnest of that which he may then venture to ask from his creator lady and from yours remember lady bothwell you too have a deathbed to look forward to your soul mayall human souls mustfeel the awe of facing the judgmentseat with the wounds of an untented conscience raw and ranklingwhat thought would it be then that should whisper i have given no mercy how then shall i ask it  man whosoever thou mayest be replied lady bothwell urge me not so cruelly it would be but blasphemous hypocrisy to utter with my lips the words which every throb of my heart protests against they would open the earth and give to light the wasted form of my sister the bloody form of my murdered brother forgive himnever never  great god cried the old man holding up his hands is it thus the worms which thou hast called out of dust obey the commands of their maker farewell proud and unforgiving woman exult that thou hast added to a death in want and pain the agonies of religious despair but never again mock heaven by petitioning for the pardon which thou hast refused to grant  he was turning from her  stop she exclaimed i will tryyes i will try to pardon him  gracious lady said the old man you will relieve the overburdened soul which dare not sever itself from its sinful companion of earth without being at peace with you what do i knowyour forgiveness may perhaps preserve for penitence the dregs of a wretched life  ha said the lady as a sudden light broke on her it is the villain himself and grasping sir philip foresterfor it was he and no otherby the collar she raised a cry of murder murder seize the murderer  at an exclamation so singular in such a place the company thronged into the apartment but sir philip forester was no longer there he had forcibly extricated himself from lady bothwells hold and had run out of the apartment which opened on the landingplace of the stair there seemed no escape in that direction for there were several persons coming up the steps and others descending but the unfortunate man was desperate he threw himself over the balustrade and alighted safely in the lobby though a leap of fifteen feet at least then dashed into the street and was lost in darkness some of the bothwell family made pursuit and had they come up with the fugitive they might perhaps have slain him for in those days mens blood ran warm in their veins but the police did not interfere the matter most criminal having happened long since and in a foreign land indeed it was always thought that this extraordinary scene originated in a hypocritical experiment by which sir philip desired to ascertain whether he might return to his native country in safety from the resentment of a family which he had injured so deeply as the result fell out so contrary to his wishes he is believed to have returned to the continent and there died in exile  so closed the tale of the mysterious mirror
