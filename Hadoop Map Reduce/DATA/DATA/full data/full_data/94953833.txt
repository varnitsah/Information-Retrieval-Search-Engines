94953833	saints progress   by john galsworthy    part i     i  such a day made glad the heart all the flags of july were waving the sun and the poppies flaming white butterflies spiring up and twining and the bees busy on the snapdragons the limetrees were coming into flower tall white lilies in the garden beds already rivaled the delphiniums the york and lancaster roses were fullblown round their golden hearts there was a gentle breeze and a swish and stir and hum rose and fell above the head of edward pierson coming back from his lonely ramble over tintern abbey he had arrived at kestrel his brother roberts home on the bank of the wye only that morning having stayed at bath on the way down and now he had got his face burnt in that particoloured way peculiar to the faces of those who have been too long in london as he came along the narrow rather overgrown avenue the sound of a waltz thrummed out on a piano fell on his ears and he smiled for music was the greatest passion he had his dark grizzled hair was pushed back off his hot brow which he fanned with his straw hat though not broad that brow was the broadest part of a narrow oval face whose length was increased by a short dark pointed bearda visage such as vandyk might have painted grave and gentle but for its bright grey eyes cinderlashed and crowsfooted and its strange look of not seeing what was before it he walked quickly though he was tired and hot tall upright and thin in a grey parsonical suit on whose black kerseymere vest a little gold cross dangled  above his brothers house whose sloping garden ran down to the railway line and river a large room had been built out apart pierson stood where the avenue forked enjoying the sound of the waltz and the cool whipping of the breeze in the sycamores and birches a man of fifty with a sense of beauty born and bred in the country suffers fearfully from nostalgia during a long unbroken spell of london so that his afternoon in the old abbey had been almost holy he had let his senses sink into the sunlit greenery of the towering woods opposite he had watched the spiders and the little shining beetles the flycatchers and sparrows in the ivy touched the mosses and the lichens looked the speedwells in the eye dreamed of he knew not what a hawk had been wheeling up there above the woods and he had been up there with it in the blue he had taken a real spiritual bath and washed the dusty fret of london off his soul  for a year he had been working his parish singlehandedno jokefor his curate had gone for a chaplain and this was his first real holiday since the war began two years ago his first visit too to his brothers home he looked down at the garden and up at the trees of the avenue bob had found a perfect retreat after his quarter of a century in ceylon dear old bob and he smiled at the thought of his elder brother whose burnt face and fierce grey whiskers somewhat recalled a bengal tiger the kindest fellow that ever breathed yes he had found a perfect home for thirza and himself and edward pierson sighed he too had once had a perfect home a perfect wife the wound of whose death fifteen years ago still bled a little in his heart their two daughters gratian and noel had not taken after her gratian was like his own mother and noels fair hair and big grey eyes always reminded him of his cousin leila whopoor thinghad made that sad mess of her life and now he had heard was singing for a living in south africa ah what a pretty girl she had been  drawn by that eternal waltz tune he reached the doorway of the musicroom a chintz curtain hung there and to the sound of feet slipping on polished boards he saw his daughter noel waltzing slowly in the arms of a young officer in khaki round and round they went circling backing moving sideways with curious steps which seemed to have come in recently for he did not recognise them at the piano sat his niece eve with a teasing smile on her rosy face but it was at his young daughter that edward pierson looked her eyes were halfclosed her cheeks rather pale and her fair hair cut quite short curled into her slim round neck quite cool she seemed though the young man in whose arms she was gliding along looked fiery hot a handsome boy with blue eyes and a little golden down on the upper lip of his sunny redcheeked face edward pierson thought nice couple and had a moments vision of himself and leila dancing at that longago cambridge may weekon her seventeenth birthday he remembered so that she must have been a year younger than nollie was now this would be the young man she had talked of in her letters during the last three weeks were they never going to stop  he passed into view of those within and said  arent you very hot nollie  she blew him a kiss the young man looked startled and selfconscious and eve called out  its a bet uncle theyve got to dance me down  pierson said mildly  a bet my dears  noel murmured over her shoulder  its all right daddy and the young man gasped  shes bet us one of her puppies against one of mine sir  pierson sat down a little hypnotized by the sleepy strumming the slow giddy movement of the dancers and those halfclosed swimming eyes of his young daughter looking at him over her shoulder as she went by he sat with a smile on his lips nollie was growing up now that gratian was married she had become a great responsibility if only his dear wife had lived the smile faded from his lips he looked suddenly very tired the struggle physical and spiritual he had been through these fifteen years sometimes weighed him almost to the ground most men would have married again but he had always felt it would be sacrilege real unions were for ever even though the church permitted remarriage  he watched his young daughter with a mixture of aesthetic pleasure and perplexity could this be good for her to go on dancing indefinitely with one young man could that possibly be good for her but they looked very happy and there was so much in young creatures that he did not understand noel so affectionate and dreamy seemed sometimes possessed of a little devil edward pierson was naif attributed those outbursts of demonic possession to the loss of her mother when she was such a mite gratian but two years older had never taken a mothers place that had been left to himself and he was more or less conscious of failure  he sat there looking up at her with a sort of whimsical distress and suddenly in that dainty voice of hers which seemed to spurn each word a little she said  im going to stop and sitting down beside him took up his hat to fan herself  eve struck a triumphant chord hurrah ive won  the young man muttered  i say noel we werent half done  i know but daddy was getting bored werent you dear this is cyril morland  pierson shook the young mans hand  daddy your nose is burnt  my dear i know  i can give you some white stuff for it you have to sleep with it on all night uncle and auntie both use it  nollie  well eve says so if youre going to bathe cyril look out for that current  the young man gazing at her with undisguised adoration muttered  rather and went out  noels eyes lingered after him eve broke a silence  if youre going to have a bath before tea nollie youd better hurry up  all right was it jolly in the abbey daddy  lovely like a great piece of music  daddy always puts everything into music you ought to see it by moonlight its gorgeous then all right eve im coming but she did not get up and when eve was gone cuddled her arm through her fathers and murmured  what dyou think of cyril  my dear how can i tell he seems a nicelooking young man  all right daddy dont strain yourself its jolly down here isnt it she got up stretched herself a little and moved away looking like a very tall child with her short hair curling in round her head  pierson watching her vanish past the curtain thought what a lovely thing she is and he got up too but instead of following went to the piano and began to play mendelssohns prelude and fugue in e minor he had a fine touch and played with a sort of dreamy passion it was his way out of perplexities regrets and longings a way which never quite failed him  at cambridge he had intended to take up music as a profession but family tradition had destined him for holy orders and an emotional church revival of that day had caught him in its stream he had always had private means and those early years before he married had passed happily in an eastend parish to have not only opportunity but power to help in the lives of the poor had been fascinating simple himself the simple folk of his parish had taken hold of his heart when however he married agnes heriot he was given a parish of his own on the borders of east and west where he had been ever since even after her death had nearly killed him it was better to go on where work and all reminded him of one whom he had resolved never to forget in other ties but he knew that his work had not the zest it used to have in her day or even before her day it may well be doubted whether he who had been in holy orders twentysix years quite knew now what he believed everything had become circumscribed and fixed by thousands of his own utterances to have taken fresh stock of his faith to have gone deep into its roots would have been like taking up the foundations of a stillstanding house some men naturally root themselves in the inexpressiblefor which one formula is much the same as another though edward pierson gently dogmatic undoubtedly preferred his highchurch statement of the inexpressible to that of say the zoroastrians the subtleties of change the modifications by science left little sense of inconsistency or treason on his soul sensitive charitable and only combative deep down he instinctively avoided discussion on matters where he might hurt others or they hurt him and since explanation was the last thing which o could be expected of one who did not base himself on reason he had found but scant occasion ever to examine anything just as in the old abbey he had soared off into the infinite with the hawk the beetles and the grasses so now at the piano by these sounds of his own making he was caught away again into emotionalism without realising that he was in one of his most religious moods  arent you coming to tea edward  the woman standing behind him in a lilaccoloured gown had one of those faces which remain innocent to the end of the chapter in spite of the complete knowledge of life which appertains to mothers in days of suffering and anxiety like these of the great war thirza pierson was a valuable person without ever expressing an opinion on cosmic matters she reconfirmed certain cosmic truths such as that though the whole world was at war there was such a thing as peace that though all the sons of mothers were being killed there remained such a thing as motherhood that while everybody was living for the future the present still existed her tranquil tender matteroffact busyness and the dew in her eyes had been proof against twentythree years of life on a teaplantation in the hot part of ceylon against bob pierson against the anxiety of having two sons at the front and the confidences of nearly every one she came across nothing disturbed her she was like a painting of goodness by an old master restored by kate greenaway she never went to meet life but when it came made the best of it this was her secret and pierson always felt rested in her presence  he rose and moved by her side over the lawn towards the big tree at the bottom of the garden  how dyou think noel is looking edward  very pretty that young man thirza  yes im afraid hes over head and ears in love with her  at the dismayed sound he uttered she slipped her soft round arm within his hes going to the front soon poor boy  have they talked to you  he has nollie hasnt yet  nollie is a queer child thirza  nollie is a darling but rather a desperate character edward  pierson sighed  in a swing under the tree where the teathings were set out the rather desperate character was swaying what a picture she is he said and sighed again  the voice of his brother came to themhigh and steamy as though corrupted by the climate of ceylon  you incorrigible dreamy chap ted weve eaten all the raspberries eve give him some jam he must be dead phew the heat come on my dear and pour out his tea hallo cyril had a good bathe by george wish my head was wet squattezvous down over there by nollie shell swing and keep the flies off you  give me a cigarette uncle bob  what your father doesnt  just for the flies you dont mind daddy  not if its necessary my dear  noel smiled showing her upper teeth and her eyes seemed to swim under their long lashes  it isnt necessary but its nice  ah ha said bob pierson here you are nollie  but noel shook her head at that moment she struck her father as startlingly grownupso composed swaying above that young man at her feet whose sunny face was all adoration no longer a child he thought dear nollie     ii   1  awakened by that daily cruelty the advent of hot water edward pierson lay in his chintzcurtained room fancying himself back in london a wild bee hunting honey from the bowl of flowers on the windowsill and the scent of sweetbrier shattered that illusion he drew the curtain and kneeling on the windowseat thrust his head out into the morning the air was intoxicatingly sweet haze clung over the river and the woods beyond the lawn sparkled with dew and two wagtails strutted in the dewy sunshine thank god for loveliness he thought those poor boys at the front and kneeling with his elbows on the sill he began to say his prayers the same feeling which made him beautify his church use vestments good music and incense filled him now god was in the loveliness of his world as well as in his churches one could worship him in a grove of beech trees in a beautiful garden on a high hill by the banks of a bright river god was in the rustle of the leaves and the hum of a bee in the dew on the grass and the scent of flowers god was in everything and he added to his usual prayer this whisper i give thee thanks for my senses o lord in all of us keep them bright and grateful for beauty then he remained motionless prey to a sort of happy yearning very near to melancholy great beauty ever had that effect on him one could capture so little of itcould never enjoy it enough who was it had said not long ago love of beauty is really only the sex instinct which nothing but complete union satisfies ah yes georgegratians husband george laird and a little frown came between his brows as though at some thorn in the flesh poor george but then all doctors were materialists at heartsplendid fellows though a fine fellow george working himself to death out there in france one must not take them too seriously he plucked a bit of sweetbrier and put it to his nose which still retained the shine of that bleaching ointment noel had insisted on his using the sweet smell of those little rough leaves stirred up an acute aching he dropped them and drew back no longings no melancholy one ought to be out this beautiful morning  it was sunday but he had not to take three services and preach at least one sermon this day of rest was really to be his own for once it was almost disconcerting he had so long felt like the cab horse who could not be taken out of the shafts lest he should fall down he dressed with extraordinary deliberation and had not quite finished when there came a knock on his door and noels voice said can i come in daddy  in her flaxblue frock with a gloire de dijon rose pinned where it met on her faintly browned neck she seemed to her father a perfect vision of freshness  heres a letter from gratian george has been sent home ill and hes gone to our house shes got leave from her hospital to come home and nurse him  pierson read the letter poor george  when are you going to let me be a nurse daddy  we must wait till youre eighteen nollie  i could easily say i was its only a month and i look much more  pierson smiled  dont i  you might be anything from fifteen to twentyfive my dear according as you behave  i want to go out as near the front as possible  her head was poised so that the sunlight framed her face which was rather broadthe brow rather too broadunder the waving lightbrown hair the nose short and indeterminate cheeks still round from youth almost waxenpale and faintly hollowed under the eyes it was her lips dainty yet loving and above all her grey eyes big and dreamily alive which made her a swan he could not imagine her in nurses garb  this is new isnt it nollie  cyril morlands sisters are both out and hell be going soon everybody goes  gratian hasnt got out yet it takes a long time to get trained  i know all the more reason to begin  she got up looked at him looked at her hands seemed about to speak but did not a little colour had come into her cheeks then obviously making conversation she asked  are you going to church its worth anything to hear uncle bob read the lessons especially when he loses his place no youre not to put on your long coat till just before church time i wont have it  obediently pierson resigned his long coat  now you see you can have my rose your nose is better she kissed his nose and transferred her rose to the buttonhole of his short coat thats all come along and with her arm through his they went down but he knew she had come to say something which she had not said    2  bob pierson in virtue of greater wealth than the rest of the congregation always read the lessons in his high steamy voice his breathing never adjusted to the length of any period the congregation accustomed heard nothing peculiar he was the necessary gentry with the necessary finger in the pie it was his own family whom he perturbed in the second row noel staring solemnly at the profile of her father in the front row was thinking poor daddy his eyes look as if they were coming out oh daddy smile or itll hurt you young morland beside her rigid in his tunic was thinking she isnt thinking of me and just then her little finger crooked into his edward pierson was thinking oh my dear old bob oh and beside him thirza thought poor dear ted i how nice for him to be having a complete rest i must make him eat hes so thin and eve was thinking oh father mercy but bob pierson was thinking cheer oh only another three verses noels little finger unhooked itself but her eyes stole round to young morlands eyes and there was a light in them which lingered through the singing and the prayers at last in the reverential rustle of the settling congregation a surpliced figure mounted the pulpit  i come not to bring peace but a sword  pierson looked up he felt deep restfulness there was a pleasant light in this church the hum of a country bluebottle made all the difference to the quality of silence no critical thought stirred within him nor any excitement he was thinking now i shall hear something for my good a fine text when did i preach from it last turned a little away from the others he saw nothing but the preachers homely face up there above the carved oak it was so long since he had been preached to so long since he had had a rest the words came forth dropped on his forehead penetrated met something which absorbed them and disappeared a good plain sermon he thought i suppose im stale i dont seem let us not dear brethren droned the preachers earnest voice think that our dear lord in saying that he brought a sword referred to a physical sword it was the sword of the spirit to which he was undoubtedly referring that bright sword of the spirit which in all ages has cleaved its way through the fetters imposed on men themselves by their own desires imposed by men on other men in gratification of their ambitions as we have had so striking an example in the invasion by our cruel enemies of a little neighbouring country which had done them no harm dear brethren we may all bring swords piersons chin jerked he raised his hand quickly and passed it over his face all bring swords he thought swordsi wasnt asleepsurely but let us be sure that our swords are bright bright with hope and bright with faith that we may see them flashing among the carnal desires of this mortal life carving a path for us towards that heavenly kingdom where alone is peace perfect peace let us pray  pierson did not shut his eyes he opened them as he fell on his knees in the seat behind noel and young morland had also fallen on their knees their faces covered each with a single hand but her left hand and his right hung at their sides they prayed a little longer than any others and on rising sang the hymn a little louder    3  no paper came on sundaysnot even the local paper which had so long and so nobly done its bit with headlines to win the war no news whatever came of men blown up to enliven the hush of the hot july afternoon or the sense of druggingwhich followed aunt thirzas sunday lunch some slept some thought they were awake but noel and young morland walked upward through the woods towards a high common of heath and furze crowned by what was known as kestrel rocks between these two young people no actual word of love had yet been spoken their lovering had advanced by glance and touch alone  young morland was a school and college friend of the two pierson boys now at the front he had no home of his own for his parents were dead and this was not his first visit to kestrel arriving three weeks ago for his final leave before he should go out he had found a girl sitting in a little wagonette outside the station and had known his fate at once but who knows when noel fell in love she wasone supposesjust ready for that sensation for the last two years she had been at one of those highclass finishing establishments where in spite of the healthy curriculum perhaps because of it there is ever an undercurrent of interest in the opposing sex and not even the gravest efforts to eliminate instinct are quite successful the disappearance of every young male thing into the maw of the military machine put a premium on instinct the thoughts of noel and her school companions were turned perforce to that which in prewar freedom of opportunity they could afford to regard as of secondary interest love and marriage and motherhood fixed as the lot of women by the countless ages were threatened for these young creatures they not unnaturally pursued what they felt to be receding  when young morland showed by following her about with his eyes what was happening to him noel was pleased from being pleased she became a little excited from being excited she became dreamy then about a week before her fathers arrival she secretly began to follow the young man about with her eyes became capricious too and a little cruel if there had been another young man to favourbut there was not and she favoured uncle bobs red setter cyril morland grew desperate during those three days the demon her father dreaded certainly possessed her and then one evening while they walked back together from the hayfields she gave him a sidelong glance and he gasped out oh noel what have i done she caught his hand and gave it a quick squeeze what a change what blissful alteration ever since  through the wood young morland mounted silently screwing himself up to put things to the touch noel too mounted silently thinking i will kiss him if he kisses me eagerness and a sort of languor were running in her veins she did not look at him from under her shady hat sun light poured down through every chink in the foliage made the greenness of the steep wood marvellously vivid and alive flashed on beech leaves ash leaves birch leaves fell on the ground in little runlets painted bright patches on trunks and grass the beech mast the ferns butterflies chased each other in that sunlight and myriads of ants and gnats and flies seemed possessed by a frenzy of life the whole wood seemed possessed as if the sunshine were a happy being which had come to dwell therein at a halfway spot where the trees opened and they could see far below them the gleam of the river she sat down on the bole of a beechtree and young morland stood looking at her why should one face and not an other this voice and not that make a heart beat why should a touch from one hand awaken rapture and a touch from another awaken nothing he knelt down and pressed his lips to her foot her eyes grew very bright but she got up and ran onshe had not expected him to kiss her foot she heard him hurrying after her and stopped leaning against a birch trunk he rushed to her and without a word spoken his lips were on her lips the moment in life which no words can render had come for them they had found their enchanted spot and they moved no further but sat with their arms round each other while the happy being of the wood watched a marvellous speederup of love is war what might have taken six months was thus accomplished in three weeks  a short hour passed then noel said  i must tell daddy cyril i meant to tell him something this morning only i thought id better wait in case you didnt  morland answered oh noel it was the staple of his conversation while they sat there  again a short hour passed and morland said  i shall go off my chump if were not married before i go out  how long does it take  no time if we hurry up ive got six days before i rejoin and perhaps the chief will give me another week if i tell him  poor daddy kiss me again a long one  when the long one was over she said  then i can come and be near you till you go out oh cyril  oh noel  perhaps you wont go so soon dont go if you can help it  not if i can help it darling but i shant be able  no of course not i know  young morland clutched his hair everyones in the same boat but it cant last for ever and now were engaged we can be together all the time till ive got the licence or whatever it is and then  daddy wont like our not being married in a church but i dont care  looking down at her closed eyes and their lashes resting on her cheeks young morland thought  my god im in heaven  another short hour passed before she freed herself  we must go cyril kiss me once more  it was nearly dinnertime and they ran down 4  edward pierson returning from the evening service where he had read the lessons saw them in the distance and compressed his lips their long absence had vexed him what ought he to do in the presence of loves young dream he felt strange and helpless that night when he opened the door of his room he saw noel on the windowseat in her dressinggown with the moonlight streaming in on her  dont light up daddy ive got something to say  she took hold of the little gold cross on his vest and turned it over  im engaged to cyril we want to be married this week  it was exactly as if someone had punched him in the ribs and at the sound he made she hurried on  you see we must be he may be going out any day  in the midst of his aching consternation he admitted a kind of reason in her words but he said  my dear youre only a child marriage is the most serious thing in life youve only known him three weeks  i know all that daddy her voice sounded so ridiculously calm but we cant afford to wait he might never come back you see and then i should have missed him  but noel suppose he never did come back it would only be much worse for you  she dropped the little cross and took hold of his hand pressing it against her heart but still her voice was calm  no much better daddy you think i dont know my own feelings but i do  the man in pierson softened the priest hardened  nollie true marriage is the union of souls and for that time is wanted time to know that you feel and think the same and love the same things  yes i know but we do  you cant tell that my dear no one could in three weeks  but these arent ordinary times are they people have to do things in a hurry oh daddy be an angel mother would have understood and let me i know  pierson drew away his hand the words hurt from reminder of his loss from reminder of the poor substitute he was  look nollie he said after all these years since she left us im as lonely as ever because we were really one if you marry this young man without knowing more of your own hearts than you can in such a little time you may regret it dreadfully you may find it turn out after all nothing but a little empty passion or again if anything happens to him before youve had any real married life together youll have a much greater grief and sense of loss to put up with than if you simply stay engaged till after the war besides my child youre much too young  she sat so still that he looked at her in alarm but i must  he bit his lips and said sharply you cant nollie  she got up and before he could stop her was gone with the closing of the door his anger evaporated and distress took its place poor child what to do with this wayward chicken just out of the egg and wanting to be fullfledged at once the thought that she would be lying miserable crying perhaps beset him so that he went out into the passage and tapped on her door getting no answer he went in it was dark but for a streak of moonlight and in that he saw her lying on her bed face down and stealing up laid his hand on her head she did not move and stroking her hair he said gently  nollie dear i didnt mean to be harsh if i were your mother i should know how to make you see but im only an old bumbledaddy  she rolled over scrambling into a crosslegged posture on the bed he could see her eyes shining but she did not speak she seemed to know that in silence was her strength  he said with a sort of despair  you must let me talk it over with your aunt she has a lot of good sense  yes  he bent over and kissed her hot forehead  good night my dear dont cry promise me  she nodded and lifted her face he felt her hot soft lips on his forehead and went away a little comforted  but noel sat on her bed hugging her knees listening to the night to the emptiness and silence each minute so much lost of the little little time left that she might have been with him     iii  pierson woke after a troubled and dreamful night in which he had thought himself wandering in heaven like a lost soul  after regaining his room last night nothing had struck him more forcibly than the needlessness of his words dont cry nollie for he had realised with uneasiness that she had not been near crying no there was in her some emotion very different from the tearful he kept seeing her crosslegged figure on the bed in that dim light tense enigmatic almost chinese kept feeling the feverish touch of her lips a good girlish burst of tears would have done her good and been a guarantee he had the uncomfortable conviction that his refusal had passed her by as if unspoken and since he could not go and make music at that time of night he had ended on his knees in a long search for guidance which was not vouchsafed him  the culprits were demure at breakfast no one could have told that for the last hour they had been sitting with their arms round each other watching the river flow by talking but little through lips too busy pierson pursued his sisterinlaw to the room where she did her flowers every morning he watched her for a minute dividing ramblers from pansies cornflowers from sweet peas before he said  im very troubled thirza nollie came to me last night imagine they want to get marriedthose two  accepting life as it came thirza showed no dismay but her cheeks grew a little pinker and her eyes a little rounder she took up a sprig of mignonette and said placidly  oh my dear  think of it thirzathat child why its only a year or two since she used to sit on my knee and tickle my face with her hair  thirza went on arranging her flowers  noel is older than you think edward she is more than her age and real married life wouldnt begin for them till afterif it ever began  pierson experienced a sort of shock his sisterinlaws words seemed criminally lighthearted  butbut he stammered the union thirza who can tell what will happen before they come together again  she looked at his quivering face and said gently  i know edward but if you refuse i should be afraid in these days of what noel might do i told you theres a streak of desperation in her  noel will obey me  i wonder there are so many of these war marriages now  pierson turned away  i think theyre dreadful what do they meanjust a momentary gratification of passion they might just as well not be  they mean pensions as a rule said thirza calmly  thirza that is cynical besides it doesnt affect this case i cant bear to think of my little nollie giving herself for a moment which may come to nothing or may turn out the beginning of an unhappy marriage who is this boywhat is he i know nothing of him how can i give her to himits impossible if they had been engaged some time and i knew something of himyes perhaps even at her age but this hasty passionatenessit isnt right it isnt decent i dont understand i really donthow a child like that can want it the fact is she doesnt know what shes asking poor little nollie she cant know the nature of marriage and she cant realise its sacredness if only her mother were here talk to her thirza you can say things that i cant  thirza looked after the retreating figure in spite of his cloth perhaps a little because of it he seemed to her like a child who had come to show her his sore finger and having finished the arrangement of her flowers she went out to find her niece she had not far to go for noel was standing in the hall quite evidently lying in wait they went out together to the avenue  the girl began at once  it isnt any use talking to me auntie cyril is going to get a license  oh so youve made up your minds  quite  do you think thats fair by me nollie should i have asked him here if id thought this was going to happen  noel only smiled  have you the least idea what marriage means  noel nodded  really  of course gratian is married besides at school  your father is dead against it this is a sad thing for him hes a perfect saint and you oughtnt to hurt him cant you wait at least till cyrils next leave  he might never have one you see  the heart of her whose boys were out there too and might also never have another leave could not but be responsive to those words she looked at her niece and a dim appreciation of this revolt of life menaced by death of youth threatened with extinction stirred in her noels teeth were clenched her lips drawn back and she was staring in front of her  daddy oughtnt to mind old people havent to fight and get killed they oughtnt to mind us taking what we can theyve had their good time  it was such a just little speech that thirza answered  yes perhaps he hasnt quite realised that  i want to make sure of cyril auntie i want everything i can have with him while theres the chance i dont think its much to ask when perhaps ill never have any more of him again  thirza slipped her hand through the girls arm  i understand she said only nollie suppose when all this is over and we breathe and live naturally once more you found youd made a mistake  noel shook her head i havent  we all think that my dear but thousands of mistakes are made by people who no more dream theyre making them than you do now and then its a very horrible business it would be especially horrible for you your father believes heart and soul in marriage being for ever  daddys a darling but i dont always believe what he believes you know besides im not making a mistake auntie i love cyril ever so  thirza gave her waist a squeeze  you mustnt make a mistake we love you too much nollie i wish we had gratian here  gratian would back me up said noel she knows what the war is and you ought to auntie if rex or harry wanted to be married im sure youd never oppose them and theyre no older than cyril you must understand what it means to me auntie dear to feel that we belong to each other properly beforebefore it all begins for him andand there may be no more daddy doesnt realise i know hes awfully good buthes forgotten  my dear i think he remembers only too well he was desperately attached to your mother  noel clenched her hands  was he well so am i to cyril and he to me we wouldnt be unreasonable if it wasntwasnt necessary talk to cyril auntie then youll understand there he is only dont keep him long because i want him oh auntie i want him so badly  she turned and slipped back into the house and thirza conscious of having been decoyed to this young man who stood there with his arms folded like napoleon before a battle smiled and said  well cyril so youve betrayed me  even in speaking she was conscious of the really momentous change in this sunburnt blueeyed lazily impudent youth since the day he arrived three weeks ago in their little wagonette he took her arm just as noel had and made her sit down beside him on the rustic bench where he had evidently been told to wait  you see mrs pierson he said its not as if noel were an ordinary girl in an ordinary time is it noel is the sort of girl one would knock ones brains out for and to send me out there knowing that i could have been married to her and wasnt will take all the heart out of me of course i mean to come back but chaps do get knocked over and i think its cruel that we cant take what we can while we can besides ive got money and that would be hers anyway so do be a darling wont you he put his arm round her waist just as if he had been her son and her heart which wanted her own boys so badly felt warmed within her  you see i dont know mr pierson but he seems awfully gentle and jolly and if he could see into me he wouldnt mind i know we dont mind risking our lives and all that but we do think we ought to have the run of them while were alive ill give him my dying oath or anything that i could never change towards noel and shell do the same oh mrs pierson do be a jolly brick and put in a word for me quick weve got so few days  but my dear boy said thirza feebly do you think its fair to such a child as noel  yes i do you dont understand shes simply had to grow up she is grownupall in this week shes quite as old as i am reallyand im twentytwo and you know its going to beits got to bea young world from now on people will begin doing things much earlier whats the use of pretending its like what it was and being cautious and all that if im going to be killed i think weve got a right to be married first and if im not then what does it matter  youve known each other twentyone days cyril  no twentyone years every days a year whenoh mrs pierson this isnt like you is it you never go to meet trouble do you  at that shrewd remark thirza put her hand on the hand which still clasped her waist and pressed it closer  well my dear she said softly we must see what can be done  cyril morland kissed her cheek i will bless you for ever he said i havent got any people you know except my two sisters  and something like tears started up on thirzas eyelashes they seemed to her like the babes in the woodthose two     iv  1  in the diningroom of her fathers house in that old london square between east and west gratian laird in the outdoor garb of a nurse was writing a telegram reverend edward pierson kestrel tintern monmouthshire george terribly ill please come if you can gratian giving it to a maid she took off her long coat and sat down for a moment she had been travelling all night after a full days work and had only just arrived to find her husband between life and death she was very different from noel not quite so tall but of a stronger build with dark chestnutcoloured hair clear hazel eyes and a broad brow the expression of her face was earnest with a sort of constant spiritual enquiry and a singularly truthful look she was just twenty and of the year that she had been married had only spent six weeks with her husband they had not even a house of their own as yet after resting five minutes she passed her hand vigorously over her face threw back her head and walked up stairs to the room where he lay he was not conscious and there was nothing to be done but sit and watch him  if he dies she thought i shall hate god for his cruelty i have had six weeks with george some people have sixty years she fixed her eyes on his face short and broad with bumps of observation on the brows he had been sunburnt the dark lashes of his closed eyes lay on deathly yellow cheeks his thick hair grew rather low on his broad forehead the lips were just open and showed strong white teeth he had a little clipped moustache and hair had grown on his cleancut jaw his pyjama jacket had fallen open gratian drew it close it was curiously still for a london day though the window was wide open anything to break this heavy stupor which was not only georges but her own and the very worlds the cruelty of itwhen she might be going to lose him for ever in a few hours or days she thought of their last parting it had not been very loving had come too soon after one of those arguments they were inclined to have in which they could not as yet disagree with suavity george had said there was no future life for the individual she had maintained there was they had grown hot and impatient even in the cab on the way to his train they had pursued the wretched discussion and the last kiss had been from lips on lips yet warm from disagreement  ever since as if in compunction she had been wavering towards his point of view and now when he was perhaps to solve the problemfind out for certainshe had come to feel that if he died she would never see him after it was cruel that such a blight should have come on her belief at this of all moments  she laid her hand on his it was warm felt strong although so motionless and helpless george was so vigorous so alive and strongwilled it seemed impossible that life might be going to play him false she recalled the unflinching look of his steelbright eyes his deep queerly vibrating voice which had no trace of selfconsciousness or pretence she slipped her hand on to his heart and began very slowly gently rubbing it he as doctor and she as nurse had both seen so much of death these last two years yet it seemed suddenly as if she had never seen death and that the young faces she had seen empty and white in the hospital wards had just been a show death would appear to her for the first time if this face which she loved were to be drained for ever of light and colour and movement and meaning  a humblebee from the square garden boomed in and buzzed idly round the room she caught her breath in a little sob   2  pierson received that telegram at midday returning from a lonely walk after his talk with thirza coming from gratian so selfreliantit meant the worst he prepared at once to catch the next train noel was out no one knew where so with a sick feeling he wrote   dearest child  i am going up to gratian poor george is desperately ill if it goes badly you should be with your sister i will wire tomorrow morning early i leave you in your aunts hands my dear be reasonable and patient god bless you  your devoted  daddy   he was alone in his thirdclass compartment and leaning forward watched the ruined abbey across the river till it was out of sight those old monks had lived in an age surely not so sad as this they must have had peaceful lives remote down here in days when the church was great and lovely and men laid down their lives for their belief in her and built everlasting fanes to the glory of god what a change to this age of rush and hurry of science trade material profit and this terrible war he tried to read his paper but it was full of horrors and hate when will it end he thought and the train with its rhythmic jolting seemed grinding out the answer nevernever  at chepstow a soldier got in followed by a woman with a very flushed face and curious swimmy eyes her hair was in disorder and her lip bleeding as if she had bitten it through the soldier too looked strained and desperate they sat down far apart on the seat opposite pierson feeling that he was in their way tried to hide himself behind his paper when he looked again the soldier had taken off his tunic and cap and was leaning out of the window the woman on the seats edge sniffing and wiping her face met his glance with resentful eyes then getting up she pulled the mans sleeve  sit dahn dont ang out o there  the soldier flung himself back on the seat and looked at pierson  the wife an mes ad a bit of a row he said companionably gits on me nerves im not used to it she was in a raid and er nerves are all gone funny aint they old girl makes me feel me ead ive been wounded there you know cant stand much now i might do somethin if she was to go on like this for long  pierson looked at the woman but her eyes still met his resentfully the soldier held out a packet of cigarettes take one he said pierson took one and feeling that the soldier wanted him to speak murmured we all have these troubles with those were fond of the fonder we are of people the more we feel them dont we i had one with my daughter last night  ah said the soldier thats right the wife and mell make it up ere come orf it old girl  from behind his paper he soon became conscious of the sounds of reconciliationreproaches because someone had been offered a drink kisses mixed with mild slappings and abuse when they got out at bristol the soldier shook his hand warmly but the woman still gave him her resentful stare and he thought dreamily the war how it affects everyone his carriage was invaded by a swarm of soldiers and the rest of the journey was passed in making himself small when at last he reached home gratian met him in the hall  just the same the doctor says we shall know in a few hours now how sweet of you to come you must be tired in this heat it was dreadful to spoil your holiday  my dear as ifmay i go up and see him  george laird was still lying in that stupor and pierson stood gazing down at him compassionately like most parsons he had a wide acquaintance with the sick and dying and one remorseless fellowship with death death the commonest thing in the world nowcommoner than life this young doctor must have seen many die in these last two years saved many from death and there he lay not able to lift a finger to save himself pierson looked at his daughter what a strong promising young couple they were and putting his arm round her he led her away to the sofa whence they could see the sick man  if he dies dad she whispered  he will have died for the country my love as much as ever our soldiers do  i know but thats no comfort ive been watching here all day ive been thinking men will be just as brutal afterwardsmore brutal the world will go on the same  we must hope not shall we pray gracie  gratian shook her head  if i could believe that the worldif i could believe anything ive lost the power dad i dont even believe in a future life if george dies we shall never meet again  pierson stared at her without a word  gratian went on the last time we talked i was angry with george because he laughed at my belief now that i really want belief i feel that he was right  pierson said tremulously  no no my dear its only that youre overwrought god in his mercy will give you back belief  there is no god dad  my darling child what are you saying  no god who can help us i feel it if there were any god who could take part in our lives alter anything without our will knew or cared what we didhe wouldnt let the world go on as it does  but my dear his purposes are inscrutable we dare not say he should not do this or that or try to fathom to what ends he is working  then hes no good to us its the same as if he didnt exist why should i pray for georges life to one whose ends are just his own i know george oughtnt to die if theres a god who can help it will be a wicked shame if george dies if theres a god who can help its a wicked shame when babies die and all these millions of poor boys i would rather think theres no god than a helpless or a wicked god  her father had suddenly thrown up his hands to his ears she moved closer and put her arm round him  dad dear im sorry i didnt mean to hurt you  pierson pressed her face down to his shoulder and said in a dull voice  what do you think would have happened to me gracie if i had lost belief when your mother died i have never lost belief pray god i never shall  gratian murmured  george would not wish me to pretend i believehe would want me to be honest if im not honest i shant deserve that he should live i dont believe and i cant pray  my darling youre overtired  no dad she raised her head from his shoulder and clasping her hands round her knees looked straight before her we can only help ourselves and i can only bear it if i rebel  pierson sat with trembling lips feeling that nothing he could say would touch her just then the sick mans face was hardly visible now in the twilight and gratian went over to his bed she stood looking down at him a long time  go and rest dad the doctors coming again at eleven ill call you if i want anything i shall lie down a little beside him  pierson kissed her and went out to lie there beside him would be the greatest comfort she could get he went to the bare narrow little room he had occupied ever since his wife died and taking off his boots walked up and down with a feeling of almost crushing loneliness both his daughters in such trouble and he of no use to them it was as if life were pushing him utterly aside he felt confused helpless bewildered surely if gratian loved george she had not left gods side whatever she might say then conscious of the profound heresy of this thought he stood still at the open window  earthly loveheavenly love was there any analogy between them  from the square gardens the indifferent whisper of the leaves answered and a newsvendor at the far end bawling his nightly tale of murder 3  george laird passed the crisis of his illness that night and in the morning was pronounced out of danger he had a splendid constitution andscotsman on his fathers sidea fighting character he came back to life very weak but avid of recovery and his first words were ive been hanging over the edge gracie  a very high cliff and his body half over balancing one inch the merest fraction of an inch more and over he would have gone deuced rum sensation but not so horrible as it would have been in real life with the slip of that last inch he felt he would have passed at once into oblivion without the long horror of a fall so this was what it was for all the poor fellows he had seen slip in the past two years mercifully at the end one was not alive enough to be conscious of what one was leaving not alive enough even to care if he had been able to take in the presence of his young wife able to realise that he was looking at her face touching her for the last timeit would have been hell if he had been up to realising sunlight moonlight the sound of the worlds life outside the softness of the bed he lay onit would have meant the most poignant anguish of defraudment life was a rare good thing and to be squashed out of it with your powers at full a wretched mistake in natures arrangements a wretched villainy on the part of manfor his own death like all those other millions of premature deaths would have been due to the idiocy and brutality of men he could smile now with gratian looking down at him but the experience had heaped fuel on a fire which had always smouldered in his doctors soul against that half emancipated breed of apes the human race well now he would get a few days off from his deathcarnival and he lay feasting his returning senses on his wife she made a pretty nurse and his practised eye judged her a good onefirm and quiet  george laird was thirty at the opening of the war he was in an eastend practice and had volunteered at once for service with the army for the first nine months he had been right up in the thick of it a poisoned arm rather than the authorities had sent him home during that leave he married gratian he had known the piersons some time and made conscious of the instability of life had resolved to marry her at the first chance he got for his fatherinlaw he had respect and liking ever mixed with what was not quite contempt and not quite pity the blend of authority with humility cleric with dreamer monk with artist mystic with man of action in pierson excited in him an interested but often irritated wonder he saw things so differently himself and had little of the humorous curiosity which enjoys what is strange simply because it is strange they could never talk together without soon reaching a point when he wanted to say if were not to trust our reason and our senses for what theyre worth sirwill you kindly tell me what we are to trust how can we exert them to the utmost in some matters and in others suddenly turn our backs on them once in one of their discussions which often bordered on acrimony he had expounded himself at length  i grant he had said that theres a great ultimate mystery that we shall never know anything for certain about the origin of life and the principle of the universe but why should we suddenly shut up our enquiring apparatus and deny all the evidence of our reasonsay about the story of christ or the question of a future life or our moral code if you want me to enter a temple of little mysteries leaving my reason and senses behindas a mohammedan leaves his shoesit wont do to say to me simply there it is enter you must show me the door and you cant and ill tell you why sir because in your brain theres a little twist which is not in mine or the lack of a little twist which is in mine nothing more than that divides us into the two main species of mankind one of whom worships and one of whom doesnt oh yes i know you wont admit that because it makes your religions natural instead of what you call supernatural but i assure you theres nothing more to it your eyes look up or they look downthey never look straight before them well mine do just the opposite  that day pierson had been feeling very tired and though to meet this attack was vital he had been unable to meet it his brain had stammered he had turned a little away leaning his cheek on his hand as if to cover that momentary break in his defences some days later he had said  i am able now to answer your questions george i think i can make you understand  laird had answered all right sir go ahead  you begin by assuming that the human reason is the final test of all things what right have you to assume that suppose you were an ant you would take your ants reason as the final test wouldnt you would that be the truth and a smile had fixed itself on his lips above his little grave beard  george laird also had smiled  that seems a good point sir he said until you recognise that i dont take the human reason as final test in any absolute sense i only say its the highest test we can apply and that behind that test all is quite dark and unknowable  revelation then means nothing to you  nothing sir  i dont think we can usefully go on george  i dont think we can sir in talking with you i always feel like fighting a man with one hand tied behind his back  and i perhaps feel that i am arguing with one who was blind from birth  for all that they had often argued since but never without those peculiar smiles coming on their faces still they respected each other and pierson had not opposed his daughters marriage to this heretic whom he knew to be an honest and trustworthy man it had taken place before lairds arm was well and the two had snatched a months honeymoon before he went back to france and she to her hospital in manchester since then just one february fortnight by the sea had been all their time together  in the afternoon he had asked for beef tea and having drunk a cup said  ive got something to tell your father  but warned by the pallor of his smiling lips gratian answered  tell me first george  our last talk gracie welltheres nothingon the other side i looked over its as black as your hat  gratian shivered  i know while you were lying here last night i told father  he squeezed her hand and said i also want to tell him  dad will say the motive for life is gone  i say it leaps out all the more gracie what a mess we make of itwe angelapes when shall we be men i wonder you and i gracie will fight for a decent life for everybody no handsupping about that bend down its good to touch you again everythings good im going to have a sleep  after the relief of the doctors report in the early morning pierson had gone through a hard struggle what should he wire to noel he longed to get her back home away from temptation to the burning indiscretion of this marriage but ought he to suppress reference to georges progress would that be honest at last he sent this telegram george out of danger but very weak come up by the afternoon post however he received a letter from thirza  i have had two long talks with noel and cyril it is impossible to budge them and i really think dear edward that it will be a mistake to oppose it rigidly he may not go out as soon as we think how would it be to consent to their having banns publishedthat would mean another three weeks anyway and in absence from each other they might be influenced to put it off im afraid this is the only chance for if you simply forbid it i feel they will run off and get married somewhere at a registrars  pierson took this letter out with him into the square garden for painful cogitation no man can hold a position of spiritual authority for long years without developing the habit of judgment he judged noels conduct to be headlong and undisciplined and the vein of stubbornness in his character fortified the father and the priest within him thirza disappointed him she did not seem to see the irretrievable gravity of this hasty marriage she seemed to look on it as something much lighter than it was to consider that it might be left to chance and that if chance turned out unfavourable there would still be a way out to him there would be no way out he looked up at the sky as if for inspiration it was such a beautiful day and so bitter to hurt his child even for her good what would her mother have advised surely agnes had felt at least as deeply as himself the utter solemnity of marriage and sitting there in the sunlight he painfully hardened his heart he must do what he thought right no matter what the consequences so he went in and wrote that he could not agree and wished noel to come back home at once     v  1  but on the same afternoon just about that hour noel was sitting on the riverbank with her arms folded tight across her chest and by her side cyril morland with despair in his face was twisting a telegram rejoin tonight regiment leaves tomorrow  what consolation that a million such telegrams had been read and sorrowed over these last two years what comfort that the sun was daily blotted dim for hundreds of bright eyes the joy of life poured out and sopped up by the sands of desolation  how long have we got cyril  ive engaged a car from the inn so i neednt leave till midnight ive packed already to have more time  lets have it to ourselves then lets go off somewhere ive got some chocolate  morland answered miserably  i can send the car up here for my things and have it pick me up at the inn if youll say goodbye to them for me afterwards well walk down the line then we shant meet anyone  and in the bright sunlight they walked hand in hand on each side of a shining rail about six they reached the abbey  lets get a boat said noel we can come back here when its moonlight i know a way of getting in after the gates shut  they hired a boat rowed over to the far bank and sat on the stern seat side by side under the trees where the water was stained deep green by the high woods if they talked it was but a word of love now and then or to draw each others attention to a fish a bird a dragonfly what use making plansfor lovers the chief theme longing paralysed their brains they could do nothing but press close to each other their hands enlaced their lips meeting now and then on noels face was a strange fixed stillness as if she were waitingexpecting they ate their chocolates the sun set dew began to fall the river changed and grew whiter the sky paled to the colour of an amethyst shadows lengthened dissolved slowly it was past nine already a waterrat came out a white owl flew over the river towards the abbey the moon had come up but shed no light as yet they saw no beauty in all thistoo young too passionate too unhappy  noel said when shes over those trees cyril lets go itll be half dark  they waited watching the moon which crept with infinite slowness up and up brightening ever so little every minute  now said noel and morland rowed across  they left the boat and she led the way past an empty cottage to a shed with a roof sloping up to the abbeys low outer wall  we can get over here she whispered  they clambered up and over to a piece of grassy courtyard and passed on to an inner court under the black shadow of the high walls  whats the time said noel  halfpast ten  already lets sit here in the dark and watch for the moon  they sat down close together noels face still had on it that strange look of waiting and morland sat obedient with his hand on her heart and his own heart beating almost to suffocation they sat still as mice and the moon crept up it laid a first vague greyness on the high wall which spread slowly down and brightened till the lichen and the grasses up there were visible then crept on silvering the dark above their heads noel pulled his sleeve and whispered see there came the white owl soft as a snowflake drifting across in that unearthly light as if flying to the moon and just then the top of the moon itself looked over the wall a shaving of silvery gold it grew became a bright spread fan then balanced there full and round the colour of pale honey  ours noel whispered   2  from the side of the road noel listened till the sound of the car was lost in the folds of the valley she did not cry but passed her hands over her face and began to walk home keeping to the shadow of the trees how many years had been added to her age in those six hours since the telegram came several times in that mile and a half she stepped into a patch of brighter moonlight to take out and kiss a little photograph then slip it back next her heart heedless that so warm a place must destroy any effigy she felt not the faintest compunction for the recklessness of her loveit was her only comfort against the crushing loneliness of the night it kept her up made her walk on with a sort of pride as if she had got the best of fate he was hers for ever now in spite of anything that could be done she did not even think what she would say when she got in she came to the avenue and passed up it still in a sort of dream her uncle was standing before the porch she could hear his mutterings she moved out of the shadow of the trees went straight up to him and looking in his perturbed face said calmly  cyril asked me to say goodbye to you all uncle good night  but i say nollie look here you  she had passed on she went up to her room there by the door her aunt was standing and would have kissed her she drew back  no auntie not tonight and slipping by she locked her door  bob and thirza pierson meeting in their own room looked at each other askance relief at their nieces safe return was confused by other emotions bob pierson expressed his first  phew i was beginning to think we should w have to drag the river what girls are coming to  its the war bob  i didnt like her face old girl i dont know what it was but i didnt like her face  neither did thirza but she would not admit it and encourage bob to take it to heart he took things so hardly and with such a noise  she only said poor young things i suppose it will be a relief to edward  i love nollie said bob pierson suddenly shes an affectionate creature dnit im sorry about this its not so bad for young morland hes got the excitementthough i shouldnt like to be leaving nollie if i were young again thank god neither of our boys is engaged by george when i think of them out there and myself here i feel as if the top of my head would come off and those politician chaps spouting away in every countryhow they can have the cheek  thirza looked at him anxiously  and no dinner he said suddenly what dyou think theyve been doing with themselves  holding each others hands poor dears dyou know what time it is bob nearly one oclock  well all i can say is ive had a wretched evening get to bed old girl youll be fit for nothing  he was soon asleep but thirza lay awake not exactly worrying for that was not her nature but seeing noels face pale languid passionate possessed by memory     vi  1  noel reached her fathers house next day late in the afternoon there was a letter in the hall for her she tore it open and read   my darling love  i got back all right and am posting this at once to tell you we shall pass through london and go from charing cross i expect about nine oclock tonight i shall look out for you there in case you are up in time every minute i think of you and of last night oh noel  your devoted lover  c   she looked at the wristwatch which like every other little patriot she possessed past seven if she waited gratian or her father would seize on her  take my things up dinah ive got a headache from travelling im going to walk it off perhaps i shant be in till past nine or so give my love to them all  oh miss noel you cant  but noel was gone she walked towards charing cross and to kill time went into a restaurant and had that simple repast coffee and a bun which those in love would always take if society did not forcibly feed them on other things food was ridiculous to her she sat there in the midst of a perfect hive of creatures eating hideously the place was shaped like a modern prison having tiers of gallery round an open space and in the air was the smell of viands and the clatter of plates and the music of a band men in khaki everywhere and noel glanced from form to form to see if by chance one might be that which represented for her life and the british army at halfpast eight she went out and made her way through the crowd still mechanically searching khaki for what she wanted and it was perhaps fortunate that there was about her face and walk something which touched people at the station she went up to an old porter and putting a shilling into his astonished hand asked him to find out for her whence morlands regiment would start he came back presently and said  come with me miss  noel went he was rather lame had grey whiskers and a ghostly thin resemblance to her uncle bob which perhaps had been the reason why she had chosen him 64  brother goin out miss  noel nodded  ah its a crool war i shant be sorry when its over goin out and comin in we see some sad sights ere wonderful spirit theyve got too i never look at the clock now but what i think there you go slowcoach id like to set you on to the day the boys come back when i puts a bag in another for ell i thinks and so it is miss from all i can ear ive got a son out there meself its ere theyll come along you stand quiet and keep a lookout and youll get a few minutes with him when hes done with is men i wouldnt move if i were you hell come to you all rightcant miss you there and looking at her face he thought astonishin what a lot o brothers go wot oh poor little missy a little lady too wonderful collected she is its ard and trying to find something consoling to say he mumbled out you couldnt be in a better place for seenim off good night miss anything else i can do for you  no thank you youre very kind  he looked back once or twice at her blueclad figure standing very still he had left her against a little oasis of piledup empty milkcans far down the platform where a few civilians in similar case were scattered the trainway was empty as yet in the grey immensity of the station and the turmoil of its noise she felt neither lonely nor conscious of others waiting too absorbed in the one thought of seeing him and touching him again the empty train began backing in stopped and telescoped with a series of little clattering bangs backed on again and subsided to rest noel turned her eyes towards the station arch ways already she felt tremulous as though the regiment were sending before it the vibration of its march  she had not as yet seen a trooptrain start and vague images of brave array of a flag fluttering and the stir of drums beset her suddenly she saw a brown swirling mass down there at the very edge out of which a thin brown trickle emerged towards her no sound of music no waved flag she had a longing to rush down to the barrier but remembering the words of the porter stayed where she was with her hands tightly squeezed together the trickle became a stream a flood the head of which began to reach her with a turbulence of voices sunburnt men burdened up to the nose passed with rifles jutting at all angles she strained her eyes staring into that stream as one might into a walking wood to isolate a single tree her head reeled with the strain of it and the effort to catch his voice among the hubbub of all those cheery common happygolucky sounds some who saw her clucked their tongues some went by silent others seemed to scan her as though she might be what they were looking for and ever the stream and the hubbub melted into the train and yet came pouring on and still she waited motionless with an awful fear how could he ever find her or she him then she saw that others of those waiting had found their men and the longing to rush up and down the platform almost overcame her but still she waited and suddenly she saw him with two other officer boys close to the carriages coming slowly down towards her she stood with her eyes fixed on his face they passed and she nearly cried out then he turned broke away from the other two and came straight to her he had seen her before she had seen him he was very flushed had a little fixed frown between his blue eyes and a set jaw they stood looking at each other their hands hard gripped all the emotion of last night welling up within them so that to speak would have been to break down the milkcans formed a kind of shelter and they stood so close together that none could see their faces noel was the first to master her power of speech her words came out dainty as ever through trembling lips  write to me as much as ever you can cyril im going to be a nurse at once and the first leave you get i shall come to youdont forget  forget move a little back darling they cant see us here kiss me she moved back thrust her face forward so that he need not stoop and put her lips up to his then feeling that she might swoon and fall over among the cans she withdrew her mouth leaving her forehead against his lips he murmured  was it all right when you got in last night  yes i said goodbye for you  oh noelive been afraidi oughtnti oughtnt  yes yes nothing can take you from me now  you have got pluck more than  along whistle sounded morland grasped her hands convulsively  goodbye my little wife dont fret goodbye i must go god bless you noel  i love you  they looked at each other just another moment then she took her hands from his and stood back in the shadow of the milkcans rigid following him with her eyes till he was lost in the train  every carriage window was full of those brown figures and redbrown faces hands were waving vaguely voices calling vaguely here and there one cheered someone leaning far out started to sing if auld acquaintance but noel stood quite still in the shadow of the milkcans her lips drawn in her hands hard clenched in front of her and young morland at his window gazed back at her   2  how she came to be sitting in trafalgar square she did not know tears had formed a mist between her and all that seething summerevening crowd her eyes mechanically followed the wandering searchlights those new milky ways quartering the heavens and leading nowhere all was wonderfully beautiful the sky a deep dark blue the moonlight whitening the spire of st martins and everywhere endowing the great blackedout buildings with dreamlife even the lions had come to life and stared out over this moonlit desert of little human figures too small to be worth the stretching out of a paw she sat there aching dreadfully as if the longing of every bereaved heart in all the town had settled in her she felt it tonight a thousand times worse for last night she had been drugged on the new sensation of love triumphantly fulfilled now she felt as if life had placed her in the corner of a huge silent room blown out the flame of joy and locked the door a little dry sob came from her the hayfields and cyril with shirt unbuttoned at the neck pitching hay and gazing at her while she dabbled her fork in the thin leavings the bright river and their boat grounded on the shallows and the swallows flitting over them and that long dance with the feel of his hand between her shoulderblades memories so sweet and sharp that she almost cried out she saw again their dark grassy courtyard in the abbey and the white owl flying over them the white owl flying there again tonight with no lovers on the grass below she could only picture cyril now as a brown atom in that swirling brown flood of men flowing to a huge brown sea those cruel minutes on the platform when she had searched and searched the walking wood for her one tree seemed to have burned themselves into her eyes cyril was lost she could not single him out all blurred among those thousand other shapes and suddenly she thought and iim lost to him hes never seen me at home never seen me in london he wont be able to imagine me its all in the past only the pastfor both of us is there anybody so unhappy and the towns voiceswheels and passing feet whistles talk laughterseemed to answer callously not one she looked at her wristwatch like his it had luminous hands halfpast ten was greenishly imprinted there she got up in dismay they would think she was lost or run over or something silly she could not find an empty taxi and began to walk uncertain of her way at night at last she stopped a policeman and said  which is the way towards bloomsbury please i cant find a taxi the man looked at her and took time to think it over then he said  theyre linin up for the theatres and looked at her again something seemed to move in his mechanism  im goin that way miss if you like you can step along with me noel stepped along  the streets arent what they ought to be the policeman said what with the darkness and the war turning the girls headsyoud be surprised the number of them that comes out its the soldiers of course  noel felt her cheeks burning  i daresay you wouldnt have noticed it the policeman went on but this wars a funny thing the streets are gayer and more crowded at night than ive ever seen them its a fair picnic all the time what were goin to settle down to when peace comes i dont know i suppose you find it quiet enough up your way miss  yes said noel quite quiet  no soldiers up in bloomsbury you got anyone in the army miss  noel nodded  ah its anxious times for ladies what with the zeps and their brothers and all in france its arassin ive lost a brother meself and ive got a boy out there in the garden of eden his mother carries on dreadful about him what we shall think of it when its all over i cant tell these huns are a wicked tough lot  noel looked at him a tall man regular and orderly with one of those perfectly decent faces so often seen in the london police  im sorry youve lost someone she said i havent lost anyone very near yet  well lets ope you wont miss these times make you feel for others an thats something ive noticed a great change in folks youd never think would feel for anyone and yet ive seen some wicked things too we do in the police some of these english wives of aliens and armless little german bakers an austrians and whatnot they get a crool time its their misfortune not their fault thats what i think and the way they get servedwell it makes you ashamed o bein english sometimesit does straight and the women are the worst i said to my wife only last night i said they call themselves christians i said but for all the charity thats in em they might as well be huns she couldnt see itnot she well why do they drop bombs she says what i said those english wives and bakers drop bombs dont be silly i said theyre as innocent as we its the innocent that gets punished for the guilty but theyre all spies she says oh i said old lady now really at your time of life but there it is you cant get a woman to see reason its readin the papers i often think they must be written by womenbeggin your pardon missbut reely the ysterics and the atredtheyre a fair knockout dyou find much hatred in your household miss  noel shook her head no my fathers a clergyman you see  ah said the policeman and in the glance he bestowed on her could be seen an added respect  of course he went on youre bound to have a sense of justice against these huns some of their ways of goin on have been above the limit but what i always think isof course i dont say these thingsno use to make yourself unpopularbut to meself i often think take em man for man and youd find em much the same as we are i daresay its the vicious way theyre brought up of actin in the mass thats made em such a crool lot i see a good bit of crowds in my profession and ive a very low opinion of them crowds are the most blunderin blighted things that ever was theyre like an angry woman with a bandage over her eyes an you cant have anything more dangerous than that these germans it seems are always in a crowd they get a state o mind read out to them by bill kaser and all that bloodyminded lot an they never stop to think for themselves  i suppose theyd be shot if they did said noel  well there is that said the policeman reflectively theyve brought discipline to an igh pitch no doubt an if you ask mehe lowered his voice till it was almost lost in his chinstrap well be runnin em a good second ere before long the things we ave to protect now are gettin beyond a joke theres the city against lights theres the streets against darkness theres the aliens theres the aliens shops theres the belgians theres the british wives theres the soldiers against the women theres the women against the soldiers theres the peace party theres orses against croolty theres a cabinet minister every now an then and now weve got these conchies and mind you they havent raised our pay no war wages in the police so far as i can see theres only one good result of the warthe burglaries are off but there again you wait a bit and see if we dont have a prize crop of m or my names not arris  you must have an awfully exciting life said noel  the policeman looked down at her sideways without lowering his face as only a policeman can and said indulgently  were used to it you see theres no excitement in what youre used to they find that in the trenches im told take our seamentheres lots of em been blown up over and over again and there they go and sign on again next day thats where the germans make their mistake england in wartime i think a lot you know on my go you cant elp itthe mind will workan the more i think the more i see the fightin spirit in the people we dont make a fuss about it like bill kaser but you watch a little shopman one o those fellows whos had his house bombed you watch the way he looks at the messsort of disgusted you watch his face and you see hes got his teeth into it you watch one of our tommies on is crutches with the sweat pourin off his forehead an is eyes all strainy stumpin alongthat gives you an idea i pity these peace fellows reely i pity them they dont know what theyre up against i expect theres times when you wish you was a man dont you miss im sure theres times when i feel id like to go in the trenches thats the worst o my job you cant be a human beinnot in the full sense of the word you mustnt let your passions rise you mustnt drink you mustnt talk its a narrow walk o life well here you are miss your squares the next turnin to the right good night and thank you for your conversation  noel held out her hand good night she said  the policeman took her hand with a queer flattered embarrassment  good night miss he said again i see youve got a trouble and im sure i hope itll turn out for the best  noel gave his huge hand a squeeze her eyes had filled with tears and she turned quickly up towards the square where a dark figure was coming towards her in whom she recognised her father his face was worn and harassed he walked irresolutely like a man who has lost something  nollie he said thank god in his voice was an infinite relief my child where have you been  its all right daddy cyril has just gone to the front ive been seeing him off from charing cross  pierson slipped his arm round her they entered the house without speaking   3  by the rail of his transport as farabout two feetas he could get from anyone cyril morland stood watching calais a dream city brighten out of the heat and grow solid he could hear the guns already the voice of his new lifetalking in the distance it came with its strange excitement into a being held by soft and marvellous memories by one long vision of noel and the moonlit grass under the dark abbey wall this moment of passage from wonder to wonder was quite too much for a boy unused to introspection and he stood staring stupidly at calais while the thunder of his new life came rolling in on that passionate moonlit dream     vii  after the emotions of those last three days pierson woke with the feeling a ship must have when it makes landfall such reliefs are natural and as a rule delusive for events are as much the parents of the future as they were the children of the past to be at home with both his girls and restingfor his holiday would not be over for ten dayswas like old times now george was going on so well gratian would be herself again now cyril morland was gone noel would lose that sudden youthful love fever perhaps in two or three days if george continued to progress one might go off with noel somewhere for ones last week in the meantime the old house wherein was gathered so much remembrance of happiness and pain was just as restful as anywhere else and the companionship of his girls would be as sweet as on any of their past rambling holidays in wales or ireland and that first morning of perfect idlenessfor no one knew he was back in londonpottering and playing the piano in the homely drawingroom where nothing to speak of was changed since his wifes day was very pleasant he had not yet seen the girls for noel did not come down to breakfast and gratian was with george  discovery that there was still a barrier between him and them came but slowly in the next two days he would not acknowledge it yet it was there in their voices in their movementsrather an absence of something old than the presence of something new it was as if each had said to him we love you but you are not in our secretsand you must not be for you would try to destroy them they showed no fear of him but seemed to be pushing him unconsciously away lest he should restrain or alter what was very dear to them they were both fond of him but their natures had set foot on definitely diverging paths the closer the affection the more watchful they were against interference by that affection noel had a look on her face half dazed half proud which touched yet vexed him what had he done to forfeit her confidencesurely she must see how natural and right his opposition had been he made one great effort to show the real sympathy he felt for her but she only said i cant talk of cyril daddy i simply cant and he who easily shrank into his shell could not but acquiesce in her reserve  with gratian it was different he knew that an encounter was before him a struggle between him and her husbandfor characteristically he set the change in her the defection of her faith down to george not to spontaneous thought and feeling in herself he dreaded and yet looked forward to this encounter it came on the third day when laird was up lying on that very sofa where pierson had sat listening to gratians confession of disbelief except for putting in his head to say good morning he had not yet seen his soninlaw the young doctor could not look fragile the build of his face with that law and those heavy cheekbones was too much against it but there was about him enough of the look of having come through a hard fight to give piersons heart a squeeze  well george he said you gave us a dreadful fright i thank gods mercy with that halfmechanical phrase he had flung an unconscious challenge laird looked up whimsically  so you really think god merciful sir  dont let us argue george youre not strong enough  oh im pining for something to bite on  pierson looked at gratian and said softly  gods mercy is infinite and you know it is  laird also looked at gratian before he answered  gods mercy is surely the amount of mercy man has succeeded in arriving at how much that is this war tells you sir  pierson flushed i dont follow you he said painfully how can you say such things when you yourself are only justno i refuse to argue george i refuse  laird stretched out his hand to his wife who came to him and stood clasping it with her own well im going to argue he said im simply bursting with it i challenge you sir to show me where theres any sign of altruistic pity except in man mother love doesnt countmother and child are too much one  the curious smile had come already on both their faces  my dear george is not man the highest work of god and mercy the highest quality in man  not a bit if geological time be taken as twentyfour hours mans existence on earth so far equals just two seconds of it after a few more seconds when man has been frozen off the earth geological time will stretch for as long again before the earth bumps into something and becomes nebula once more gods hands havent been particularly full sir have theytwo seconds out of twentyfour hoursif man is his pet concern and as to mercy being the highest quality in man thats only a modern fashion of talking mans highest quality is the sense of proportion for thats what keeps him alive and mercy logically pursued would kill him off its a sort of a luxury or byproduct  george you can have no music in your soul science is such a little thing if you could only see  show me a bigger sir  faith  in what  in what has been revealed to us  ah there it is again by whomhow  by god himselfthrough our lord  a faint flush rose in lairds yellow face and his eyes brightened  christ he said if he existed which some people as you know doubt was a very beautiful character there have been others but to ask us to believe in his supernaturalness or divinity at this time of day is to ask us to walk through the world blindfold and thats what you do dont you  again pierson looked at his daughters face she was standing quite still with her eyes fixed on her husband somehow he was aware that all these words of the sick mans were for her benefit anger and a sort of despair rose within him and he said painfully  i cannot explain there are things that i cant make clear because you are wilfully blind to all that i believe in for what do you imagine we are fighting this great war if it is not to reestablish the belief in love as the guiding principle of life  laird shook his head we are fighting to redress a balance which was in danger of being lost  the balance of power  heavensno the balance of philosophy  pierson smiled that sounds very clever george but again i dont follow you  the balance between the sayings might is right and right is might theyre both halftruth but the first was beating the other out of the field all the rest of it is cant you know and by the way sir your church is solid for punishment of the evildoer wheres mercy there either its god is not merciful or else it doesnt believe in its god  just punishment does not preclude mercy george  it does in nature  ah nature georgealways nature god transcends nature  then why does he give it a free rein a man too fond of drink or womenhow much mercy does he get from nature his overindulgence brings its exact equivalent of penalty let him pray to god as much as he likesunless he alters his ways he gets no mercy if he does alter his ways he gets no mercy either he just gets natures due reward we english who have neglected brain and educationhow much mercy are we getting in this war mercys a manmade ornament disease or luxurycall it what you will except that ive nothing to say against it on the contrary i am all for it  once more pierson looked at his daughter something in her face hurt himthe silent intensity with which she was hanging on her husbands words the eager search of her eyes and he turned to the door saying  this is bad for you george  he saw gratian put her hand on her husbands forehead and thoughtjealously how can i save my poor girl from this infidelity are my twenty years of care to go for nothing against this modern spirit  down in his study the words went through his mind holy holy holy merciful and mighty and going to the little piano in the corner he opened it and began playing the hymn he played it softly on the shabby keys of this thirtyyear old friend which had been with him since college days and sang it softly in his worn voice  a sound made him look up gratian had come in she put her hand on his shoulder and said  i know it hurts you dad but weve got to find out for ourselves havent we all the time you and george were talking i felt that you didnt see that its i whove changed its not what he thinks but what ive come to think of my own accord i wish youd understand that ive got a mind of my own dad  pierson looked up with amazement  of course you have a mind  gratian shook her head no you thought my mind was yours and now you think its georges but its my own when you were my age werent you trying hard to find the truth yourself and differing from your father  pierson did not answer he could not remember it was like stirring a stick amongst a drift of last years leaves to awaken but a dry rustling a vague sense of unsubstantiality searched no doubt he had searched but the process had brought him nothing knowledge was all smoke emotional faith alone was truthreality  ah gracie he said search if you must but where will you find bottom the well is too deep for us you will come back to god my child when youre tired out the only rest is there  i dont want to rest some people search all their lives and die searching why shouldnt i  you will be most unhappy my child  if im unhappy dad itll be because the worlds unhappy i dont believe it ought to be i think it only is because it shuts its eyes  pierson got up you think i shut my eyes  gratian nodded  if i do it is because there is no other way to happiness  are you happy dad  as happy as my nature will let me be i miss your mother if i lose you and noel  oh but we wont let you  pierson smiled my dear he said i think i have     viii  1  some wag with a bit of chalk had written the word peace on three successive doors of a little street opposite buckingham palace  it caught the eye of jimmy fort limping home to his rooms from a very late discussion at his club and twisted his lean shaven lips into a sort of smile he was one of those rollingstone englishmen whose early lives are spent in all parts of the world and in all kinds of physical conflicta man like a hickory stick tall thin boltupright knotty hard as nails with a curved fighting back to his head and a straight fighting front to his brown face his was the type which becomes in a generation or so typically colonial or american but no one could possibly have taken jimmy fort for anything but an englishman though he was nearly forty there was still something of the boy in his face something frank and curlyheaded gallant and full of steam and his small steady grey eyes looked out on life with a sort of combative humour he was still in uniform though they had given him up as a bad job after keeping him nine months trying to mend a wounded leg which would never be sound again and he was now in the war office in connection with horses about which he knew he did not like it having lived too long with all sorts and conditions of men who were neither english nor official a combination which he found trying his life indeed just now bored him to distraction and he would ten times rather have been back in france this was why he found the word peace so exceptionally tantalising  reaching his rooms he threw off his tunic to whose stiff regularity he still had a rooted aversion and pulling out a pipe filled it and sat down at his window  moonshine could not cool the hot town and it seemed sleeping badlythe seven million sleepers in their million homes sound lingered on never quite ceased the stale odours clung in the narrow street below though a little wind was creeping about to sweeten the air curse the war he thought what wouldnt i give to be sleeping out instead of in this damned city they who slept in the open neglecting morality would certainly have the best of it tonight for no more dew was falling than fell into jimmy forts heart to cool the fret of that ceaseless thought the war the cursed war in the unending rows of little grey houses in huge caravanserais and the mansions of the great in villas and high slum tenements in the government offices and factories and railway stations where they worked all night in the long hospitals where they lay in rows in the camp prisons of the interned in bar racks workhouses palacesno head sleeping or waking would be free of that thought the cursed war a spire caught his eye rising ghostly over the roofs ah churches alone void of the human soul would be unconscious but for the rest even sleep would not free them here a mother would be whispering the name of her boy there a merchant would snore and dream he was drowning weighted with gold and a wife would be turning to stretch out her arms tono one and a wounded soldier wake out of a dream trench with sweat on his brow and a newsvendor in his garret mutter hoarsely by thousands the bereaved would be tossing stifling their moans by thousands the ruined would be gazing into the dark future and housewives struggling with sums and soldiers sleeping like logsfor to morrow they died and children dreaming of them and prostitutes lying in stale wonder at the busyness of their lives and journalists sleeping the sleep of the just and over them all in the moonlight that thought the cursed war flapped its black wings like an old crow if christ were real he mused hed reach that moon down and go chalking peace with it on every door of every house all over europe but christs not real and hindenburg and harmsworth are as real they were as two great bulls he had once seen in south africa fighting he seemed to hear again the stamp and snort and crash of those thick skulls to see the beasts recoiling and driving at each other and the little red eyes of them and pulling a letter out of his pocket he read it again by the light of the moon   15 camelot mansions  st johns wood  dear mr fort i came across your club address tonight looking at some old letters did you know that i was in london i left steenbok when my husband died five years ago ive had a simply terrific time since while the german south west campaign was on i was nursing out there but came back about a year ago to lend a hand here it would be awfully nice to meet you again if by any chance you are in england im working in a v a d hospital in these parts but my evenings are usually free do you remember that moonlit night at grape harvest the nights here arent scented quite like that listerine oh this war with all good remembrances  leila lynch   a terrific time if he did not mistake leila lynch had always had a terrific time and he smiled seeing again the stoep of an old dutch house at high constantia and a woman sitting there under the white flowers of a sweetscented creepera pretty woman with eyes which could put a spell on you a woman he would have got entangled with if he had not cut and run for it ten years ago and here she was again refreshing him out of the past he sniffed the fragrance of the little letter how everybody always managed to work into a letter what they were doing in the war if he answered her he would be sure to say since i got lamed ive been at the war office working on remounts and a dull job it is leila lynch women didnt get younger and he suspected her of being older than himself but he remembered agreeably her white shoulders and that turn of her neck when she looked at you with those big grey eyes of hers only a fiveday acquaintanceship but they had crowded much into it as one did in a strange land the episode had been a green and dangerous spot like one of those bright mossy bits of bog when you were snipeshooting to set foot on which was to let you down up to the neck at least well there was none of that danger now for her husband was deadpoor chap it would be nice in these dismal days when nobody spent any time whatever except in the service of the country to improve his powers of service by a few hours recreation in her society what humbugs we are he thought to read the newspapers and the speeches youd believe everybody thought of nothing but how to get killed for the sake of the future drunk on verbiage what heads and mouths we shall all have when we wake up some fine morning with peace shining in at the window ah if only we could and enjoy ourselves again and he gazed at the moon she was dipping already reeling away into the dawn water carts and street sweepers had come out into the glimmer sparrows twittered in the eaves the city was raising a strange unknown face to the grey light shuttered and deserted as babylon jimmy fort tapped out his pipe sighed and got into bed   2  coming off duty at that very moment leila lynch decided to have her hours walk before she went home she was in charge of two wards and as a rule took the day watches but some slight upset had given her this extra spell she was therefore at her worst or perhaps at her best after eighteen hours in hospital her cheeks were pale and about her eyes were little lines normally in hiding there was in this face a puzzling blend of the soft and hard for the eyes the rather full lips and pale cheeks were naturally soft but they were hardened by the selfcontainment which grows on women who have to face life for themselves and conscious of beauty intend to keep it in spite of age her figure was contradictory also its soft modelling a little too rigidified by stays in this desert of the dawn she let her long blue overcoat flap loose and swung her hat on a finger so that her lightbrown touchedup hair took the morning breeze with fluffy freedom though she could not see herself she appreciated her appearance swaying along like that past lonely trees and houses a pity there was no one to see her in that round of regents park which took her the best part of an hour walking in meditation enjoying the colour coming back into the world as if especially for her  there was character in leila lynch and she had lived an interesting life from a certain point of view in her girlhood she had fluttered the hearts of many besides cousin edward pierson and at eighteen had made a passionate love match with a goodlooking young indian civilian named fane they had loved each other to a standstill in twelve months then had begun five years of petulance boredom and growing cynicism with increasing spells of simla and voyages home for her health which was really harmed by the heat all had culminated of course in another passion for a rifleman called lynch divorce had followed remarriage and then the boer war in which he had been badly wounded she had gone out and nursed him back to half his robust health and at twentyeight taken up life with him on an upcountry farm in cape colony this middle period had lasted ten years between the lonely farm and an old dutch house at high constantia lynch was not a bad fellow but like most soldiers of the old army had been quite carefully divested of an aesthetic sense and it was leilas misfortune to have moments when aesthetic sense seemed necessary she had struggled to overcome this weakness and that other weakness of hersa liking for mens admiration but there had certainly been intervals when she had not properly succeeded her acquaintance with jimmy fort had occurred during one of these intervals and when he went back to england so abruptly she had been feeling very tenderly towards him she still remembered him with a certain pleasure before lynch died these intervals had been interrupted by a spell of returning warmth for the invalided man to whom she had joined her life under the romantic conditions of divorce he had failed of course as a farmer and his death left her with nothing but her own settled income of a hundred and fifty pounds a year faced by the prospect of having almost to make her living at thirtyeight she felt but momentary dismayfor she had real pluck like many who have played with amateur theatricals she fancied herself as an actress but after much effort found that only her voice and the perfect preservation of her legs were appreciated by the discerning managers and public of south africa and for three chequered years she made face against fortune with the help of them under an assumed name what she didkeeping a certain bloom of refinement was far better than the achievements of many more respectable ladies in her shoes at least she never bemoaned her reduced circumstances and if her life was irregular and had at least three episodes it was very human she bravely took the rough with the smooth never lost the power of enjoying herself and grew in sympathy with the hardships of others but she became deadly tired when the war broke out remembering that she was a good nurse she took her real name again and a change of occupation for one who liked to please men and to be pleased by them there was a certain attraction about that life in wartime and after two years of it she could still appreciate the way her tommies turned their heads to look at her when she passed their beds but in a hard school she had learned perfect selfcontrol and though the sour and puritanical perceived her attraction they knew her to be fortythree besides the soldiers liked her and there was little trouble in her wards the war moved her in simple ways for she was patriotic in the direct fashion of her class her father had been a sailor her husbands an official and a soldier the issue for her was uncomplicated by any abstract meditation the country before everything and though she had tended during those two years so many young wrecked bodies she had taken it as all in the a days work lavishing her sympathy on the individual without much general sense of pity and waste yes she had worked really hard had done her bit but of late she had felt rising within her the old vague craving for life for pleasure for something more than the mere negative admiration bestowed on her by her tommies those old lettersto look them through them had been a sure sign of this vague cravinghad sharpened to poignancy the feeling that life was slipping away from her while she was still comely she had been long out of england and so hardworked since she came back that there were not many threads she could pick up suddenly two letters out of that little budget of the past with a far cry between them had awakened within her certain sentimental longings   dear lady of the starry flowers  exiturus sic to saluto the tender carries you this message of goodbye simply speaking i hate leaving south africa and of all my memories the last will live the longest grape harvest at constantia and you singing if i could be the falling dew if ever you and your husband come to england do let me know that i may try and repay a little the happiest five days ive spent out here  your very faithful servant  timmy fort   she remembered a very brown face a tall slim figure and something gallant about the whole of him what was he like after ten years grizzled married with a large family an odious thingtime and cousin edwards little yellow letter  good heavens twentysix years agobefore he was a parson or married or anything such a good partner really musical a queer dear fellow devoted absentminded easily shocked yet with flame burning in him somewhere   dear leila  after our last dance i went straight offi couldnt go in i went down to the river and walked along the bank it was beautiful all grey and hazy and the trees whispered and the cows looked holy and i walked along and thought of you and a farmer took me for a lunatic in my dress clothes dear leila you were so pretty last night and i did love our dances i hope you are not tired and that i shall see you soon again  your affectionate cousin  edward pierson   and then he had gone and become a parson and married and been a widower fifteen years she remembered the death of his wife just before she left for south africa at that period of disgrace when she had so shocked her family by her divorce poor edwardquite the nicest of her cousins the only one she would care to see again he would be very old and terribly good and proper by now  her wheel of regents park was coming full circle and the sun was up behind the houses but still no sound of traffic stirred she stopped before a flowerbed where was some heliotrope and took a long luxurious sniff she could not resist plucking a sprig too and holding it to her nose a sudden want of love had run through every nerve and fibre of her she shivered standing there with her eyes half closed above the pale violet blossom then noting by her wristwatch that it was four oclock she hurried on to get to her bed for she would have to be on duty again at noon oh the war she was tired if only it were over and one could live  somewhere by twickenham the moon had floated down somewhere up from kentish town the sun came soaring wheels rolled again and the seven million sleepers in their million houses woke from morning sleep to that same thought     ix  edward pierson dreaming over an egg at breakfast opened a letter in a handwriting which he did not recognise   v a d hospital  mulberry road st johns wood n w  dear cousin edward  do you remember me or have i gone too far into the shades of night i was leila pierson once upon a time and i often think of you and wonder what you are like now and what your girls are like i have been here nearly a year working for our wounded and for a year before that was nursing in south africa my husband died five years ago out there though we havent met for i dare not think how long i should awfully like to see you again would you care to come some day and look over my hospital i have two wards under me our men are rather dears  your forgotten but still affectionate cousin  leila lynch  p s i came across a little letter you once wrote me it brought back old days   no he had not forgotten there was a reminder in the house and he looked up at noel sitting opposite how like the eyes were and he thought i wonder what leila has become one mustnt be uncharitable that man is dead she has been nursing two years she must be greatly changed i should certainly like to see her i will go again he looked at noel only yesterday she had renewed her request to be allowed to begin her training as a nurse  im going to see a hospital today nollie he said if you like ill make enquiries im afraid itll mean you have to begin by washing up  i know anything so long as i do begin  very well ill see about it and he went back to his egg  noels voice roused him do you feel the war much daddy does it hurt you here she had put her hand on her heart perhaps it doesnt because you live half in the next world dont you  the words god forbid sprang to piersons lips he did not speak them but put his eggspoon down hurt and bewildered what did the child mean not feel the war he smiled  i hope im able to help people sometimes nollie and was conscious that he had answered his own thoughts not her words he finished his breakfast quickly and very soon went out he crossed the square and passed east down two crowded streets to his church in the traffic of those streets all slipshod and confused his blackclothed figure and grave face with its vandyk beard had a curious remote appearance like a moving remnant of a past civilisation he went in by the side door only five days he had been away but they had been so full of emotion that the empty familiar building seemed almost strange to him he had come there unconsciously groping for anchorage and guidance in this sudden change of relationship between him and his daughters he stood by the pale brazen eagle staring into the chancel the choir were wanting new hymnbookshe must not forget to order them his eyes sought the stainedglass window he had put in to the memory of his wife the sun too high to slant was burnishing its base till it glowed of a deep sherry colour in the next world what strange words of noels his eyes caught the glimmer of the organpipes and mounting to the loft he began to play soft chords wandering into each other he finished and stood gazing down this space within high walls under high vaulted roof where light was toned to a perpetual twilight broken here and there by a little glow of colour from glass and flowers metal and dark wood was his home his charge his refuge nothing moved down there and yetwas not emptiness mysteriously living the closedin air imprinted in strange sort as though the drone of music and voices in prayer and praise clung there still had not sanctity a presence outside a barrelorgan drove its tune along a wagon staggered on the paved street and the driver shouted to his horses some distant guns boomed out in practice and the rolling of wheels on wheels formed a net of sound but those invading noises were transmuted to a mere murmuring in here only the silence and the twilight were real to pierson standing there a little black figure in a great empty space  when he left the church it was still rather early to go to leilas hospital and having ordered the new hymnbooks he called in at the house of a parishioner whose son had been killed in france he found her in her kitchen an oldish woman who lived by charing she wiped a seat for the vicar  i was just makin meself a cup o tea sir  ah what a comfort tea is mrs soles and he sat down so that she should feel at home  yes it gives me eartburn i take eight or ten cups a day now i take em strong too i dont seem able to

getting on we must all look forward to meeting our beloved again in gods mercy and one of these days soon i shall be seeing you in church shant i  mrs soles shifted her weight from one slippered foot to the other  well lets ope so she said but i dunno when i shall ave the spirit good day sir and thank you kindly for calling im sure  pierson walked away with a very faint smile poor queer old soulshe was no older than himself but he thought of her as ancientcut off from her son like so manyso many and how good and patient the melody of an anthem began running in his head his fingers moved on the air beside him and he stood still waiting for an omnibus to take him to st johns wood a thousand people went by while he was waiting but he did not notice them thinking of that anthem of his daughters and the mercy of god and on the top of his bus when it came along he looked lonely and apart though the man beside him was so fat that there was hardly any seat left to sit on getting down at lords cricketground he asked his way of a lady in a nurses dress  if youll come with me she said im just going there  oh do you happen to know a mrs lynch who nurses  i am mrs lynch why youre edward pierson  he looked into her face which he had not yet observed  leila he said  yes leila how awfully nice of you to come edward  they continued to stand searching each for the others youth till she murmured  in spite of your beard i should have known you anywhere but she thought poor edward he is old and monklike  and pierson in answer murmured  youre very little changed leila we havent seen each other since my youngest girl was born shes just a little like you but he thought my nollie so much more dewy poor leila  they walked on talking of his daughters till they reached the hospital  if youll wait here a minute ill take you over my wards  she had left him in a bare hall holding his hat in one hand and touching his gold cross with the other but she soon came hack and a little warmth crept about his heart how works of mercy suited women she looked so different so much softer beneath the white coif with a white apron over the bluish frock  at the change in his face a little warmth crept about leila too just where the bib of her apron stopped and her eyes slid round at him while they went towards what had once been a billiardroom  my men are dears she said they love to be talked to  under a skylight six beds jutted out from a green distempered wall opposite to six beds jutting out from another green distempered wall and from each bed a face was turned towards them young faces with but little expression in them a nurse at the far end looked round and went on with her work the sight of the ward was no more new to pierson than to anyone else in these days it was so familiar indeed that it had practically no significance he stood by the first bed and leila stood alongside the man smiled up when she spoke and did not smile when he spoke and that again was familiar to him they passed from bed to bed with exactly the same result till she was called away and he sat down by a young soldier with a long very narrow head and face and a heavily bandaged shoulder touching the bandage reverently pierson said  well my dear fellowstill bad  ah replied the soldier shrapnel wound its cut the flesh properly  but not the spirit i can see  the young soldier gave him a quaint look as much as to say not arf bad and a gramophone close to the last bed began to play god bless daddy at the war  are you fond of music  i like it well enough passes the time  im afraid the time hangs heavy in hospital  yes it hangs a bit eavy its just orspital life ive been wounded before you see its better than bein out there i expect ill lose the proper use o this arm i dont worry ill get my discharge  youve got some good nurses here  yes i like mrs lynch shes the lady i like  my cousin  i see you come in together i see everything ere i think a lot too passes the time  do they let you smoke  oh yes they let us smoke  have one of mine  the young soldier smiled for the first time thank you ive got plenty  the nurse came by and smiled at pierson  hes one of our blase ones been in before havent you simson  pierson looked at the young man whose long narrow face where one sandylashed eyelid drooped just a little seemed armoured with a sort of limited omniscience the gramophone had whirred and grunted into sidi brahim the nurse passed on  seedy abram said the young soldier the frenchies sing it they takes it up one after the other ye know  ah murmured pierson its pretty and his fingers drummed on the counterpane for the tune was new to him something seemed to move in the young mans face as if a blind had been drawn up a little  i dont mind france he said abruptly i dont mind the shells and that but i cant stick the mud theres a lot o wounded die in the mud cant get upsmothered his unwounded arm made a restless movement i was nearly smothered myself just managed to keep me nose up  pierson shuddered thank god you did  yes i didnt like that i told mrs lynch about that one day when i had the fever shes a nice lady shes seen a lot of us boys that muds not right you know and again his unwounded arm made that restless movement while the gramophone struck up the boys in brown the movement of the arm affected pierson horribly he rose and touching the bandaged shoulder said  goodbye i hope youll soon be quite recovered  the young soldiers lips twisted in the semblance of a smile his drooped eyelid seemed to try and raise itself  good day sir he said and thank you  pierson went back to the hall the sunlight fell in a pool just inside the open door and an uncontrollable impulse made him move into it so that it warmed him up to the waist the mud how ugly life was life and death both ugly poor boys poor boys  a voice behind him said  oh there you are edward would you like to see the other ward or shall i show you our kitchen  pierson took her hand impulsively youre doing a noble work leila i wanted to ask you could you arrange for noel to come and get trained here she wants to begin at once the fact is a boy she is attracted to has just gone out to the front  ah murmured leila and her eyes looked very soft poor child we shall be wanting an extra hand next week ill see if she could come now ill speak to our matron and let you know tonight she squeezed his hand hard  dear edward im so glad to see you again youre the first of our family ive seen for sixteen years i wonder if youd bring noel to have supper at my flat tonightjust nothing to eat you know its a tiny place theres a captain fort coming a nice man  pierson accepted and as he walked away he thought dear leila i believe it was providence she wants sympathy she wants to feel the past is the past how good women are  and the sun blazing suddenly out of a cloud shone on his black figure and the little gold cross in the middle of portland place     x  men even if they are not artistic who have been in strange places and known many nooks of the world get the scenic habit become open to pictorial sensation it was as a picture or series of pictures that jimmy fort ever afterwards remembered his first supper at leilas he happened to have been all day in the open motoring about to horse farms under a hot sun and leilas hock cup possessed a bland and subtle strength the scenic sense derived therefrom had a certain poignancy the more so because the tall child whom he met there did not drink it and her father seemed but to wet his lips so that leila and he had all the rest rather a wonderful little scene it made in his mind very warm glowing yet with a strange dark sharpness to it which came perhaps from the black walls  the flat had belonged to an artist who was at the war it was but a pocket dwelling on the third floor the two windows of the little square sittingroom looked out on some trees and a church but leila who hated dining by daylight had soon drawn curtains of a deep blue over them the picture which fort remembered was this a little foursquare table of dark wood with a chinese mat of vivid blue in the centre whereon stood a silver lustre bowl of clove carnations some greenish glasses with hock cup in them on his left leila in a low lilac frock her neck and shoulders very white her face a little powdered her eyes large her lips smiling opposite him a blackclothed padre with a little gold cross over whose thin darkish face with its grave pointed beard passed little gentle smiles but whose deep sunk grey eyes were burnt and bright on his right a girl in a high grey frock almost white just hollowed at the neck with full sleeves to the elbow so that her slim arms escaped her short fair hair a little tumbled her big grey eyes grave her full lips shaping with a strange daintiness round every wordand they not many brilliant red shades over golden lights dotting the black walls a blue divan a little black piano flush with the wall a dark polished floor four japanese prints a white ceiling he was conscious that his own khaki spoiled something as curious and rare as some old chinese teachest he even remembered what they ate lobster cold pigeon pie asparagus st ivel cheese raspberries and cream he did not remember half so well what they talked of except that he himself told them stories of the boer war in which he had served in the yeomanry and while he was telling them the girl like a child listening to a fairytale never moved her eyes from his face he remembered that after supper they all smoked cigarettes even the tall child after the padre had said to her mildly my dear and she had answered i simply must daddy just one he remembered leila brewing turkish coffeevery good and how beautiful her white arms looked hovering about the cups he remembered her making the padre sit down at the piano and play to them and she and the girl on the divan together side by side a strange contrast with just as strange a likeness to each other he always remembered how fine and rare that music sounded in the little room flooding him with a dreamy beatitude thenhe rememberedleila sang the padre standingby and the tall child on the divan bending forward over her knees with her chin on her hands he remembered rather vividly how leila turned her neck and looked up now at the padre now at himself and all through the delightful sense of colour and warmth a sort of glamour over all the evening and the lingering pressure of leilas hand when he said goodbye and they went away for they all went together he remembered talking a great deal to the padre in the cab about the public school they had both been at and thinking its a good padrethis he remembered how their taxi took them to an old square which he did not know where the garden trees looked densely black in the starshine he remembered that a man outside the house had engaged the padre in earnest talk while the tall child and himself stood in the open doorway where the hall beyond was dark very exactly he remembered the little conversation which then took place between them while they waited for her father  is it very horrid in the trenches captain fort  yes miss pierson it is very horrid as a rule  is it dangerous all the time  pretty well  do officers run more risks than the men  not unless theres an attack  are there attacks very often  it had seemed to him so strangely primitive a little catechism that he had smiled and though it was so dark she had seen that smile for her face went proud and close all of a sudden he had cursed himself and said gently  have you a brother out there  she shook her head  but someone  yes  someone he had heard that answer with a little shock this childthis fairy princess of a child already to have someone he wondered if she went about asking everyone these questions with that someone in her thoughts poor child and quickly he said  after all look at me i was out there a year and here i am with only half a game leg times were a lot worse then too i often wish i were back there anythings better than london and the war office but just then he saw the padre coming and took her hand good night miss pierson dont worry that does no good and there isnt half the risk you think  her hand stirred squeezed his gratefully as a childs would squeeze  good night she murmured thank you awfully  and in the dark cab again he remembered thinking fancy that child a jolly lucky boy out there too bad poor little fairy princess     part ii     i   1  to wash up is not an exciting operation to wash up in august became for noel a process which taxed her strength and enthusiasm she combined it with other forms of instruction in the art of nursing had very little leisure and in the evenings at home would often fall asleep curled up in a large chintzcovered chair  george and gratian had long gone back to their respective hospitals and she and her father had the house to themselves she received many letters from cyril which she carried about with her and read on her way to and from the hospital and every other day she wrote to him he was not yet in the firing line his letters were descriptive of his men his food or the natives or reminiscent of kestrel hers descriptive of washing up or reminiscent of kestrel but in both there was always some little word of the longing within them  it was towards the end of august when she had the letter which said that he had been moved up from now on he would be in hourly danger that evening after dinner she did not go to sleep in the chair but sat under the open window clenching her hands and reading pride and prejudice without understanding a word while she was so engaged her father came up and said  captain fort nollie will you give him some coffee im afraid i must go out  when he had gone noel looked at her visitor drinking his coffee he had been out there too and he was alive with only a little limp the visitor smiled and said  what were you thinking about when we came in  only the war  any news of him  noel frowned she hated to show her feelings  yes hes gone to the front wont you have a cigarette  thanks will you  i want one awfully i think sitting still and waiting is more dreadful than anything in the world  except knowing that others are waiting when i was out there i used to worry horribly over my mother she was ill at the time the cruelest thing in war is the anxiety of people about each othernothing touches that  the words exactly summed up noels hourly thought he said nice things this man with the long legs and the thin brown bumpy face  i wish i were a man she said i think women have much the worst time in the war is your mother old but of course she was old why he was old himself  she died last christmas  oh im so sorry  you lost your mother when you were a babe didnt you  yes thats her portrait at the end of the room hanging on a strip of black velvet was a pastel very faint in colouring as though faded of a young woman with an eager sweet face dark eyes and bent a little forward as if questioning her painter fort went up to it  its not a bit like you but she must have been a very sweet woman  its a sort of presence in the room i wish i were like her  fort turned no he said no better as you are it would only have spoiled a complete thing  she was good  and arent you  oh no i get a devil  you why youre out of a fairytale  it comes from daddyonly he doesnt know because hes a perfect saint but i know hes had a devil somewhere or he couldnt be the saint he is  hm said fort thats very deep and i believe its truethe saints did have devils  poor daddys devil has been dead ages its been starved out of him i think  does your devil ever get away with you  noel felt her cheeks growing red under his stare and she turned to the window  yes its a real devil  vividly there had come before her the dark abbey and the moon balancing over the top of the crumbling wall and the white owl flying across and speaking to the air she said  it makes you do things that you want to do  she wondered if he would laughit sounded so silly but he did not  and damn the consequences i know its rather a jolly thing to have  noel shook her head heres daddy coming back  fort held out his hand  i wont stay good night and dont worry too much will you  he kept her hand rather a long time and gave it a hard squeeze  dont worry what advice ah if she could see cyril just for a minute   2  in september 1916 saturday still came before sunday in spite of the war for edward pierson this saturday had been a strenuous day and even now at nearly midnight he was still conning his justcompleted sermon  a patriot of patriots he had often a passionate longing to resign his parish and go like his curate for a chaplain at the front it seemed to him that people must think his life idle and sheltered and useless even in times of peace he had been sensitive enough to feel the cold draughty blasts which the church encounters in a material age he knew that nine people out of ten looked on him as something of a parasite with no real work in the world and since he was nothing if not conscientious he always worked himself to the bone  today he had risen at halfpast six and after his bath and exercises had sat down to his sermonfor even now he wrote a new sermon once a month though he had the fruits of twentysix years to choose from true these new sermons were rather compiled than written because bereft of his curate he had not time enough for fresh thought on old subjects at eight he had breakfasted with noel before she went off to her hospital whence she would return at eight in the evening nine to ten was his hour for seeing parishioners who had troubles or wanted help or advice and he had received three today who all wanted help which he had given from ten to eleven he had gone back to his sermon and had spent from eleven to one at his church attending to small matters writing notices fixing hymns holding the daily halfhour service instituted during wartime to which but few ever came he had hurried back to lunch scamping it so that he might get to his piano for an hour of forgetfulness at three he had christened a very noisy baby and been detained by its parents who wished for information on a variety of topics at halfpast four he had snatched a cup of tea reading the paper and had spent from five to seven visiting two parish clubs and those whose warpension matters he had in hand and filling up forms which would be kept in official places till such time as the system should be changed and a fresh set of forms issued from seven to eight he was at home again in case his flock wanted to see him today four sheep had come and gone away he was afraid but little the wiser from halfpast eight to halfpast nine he had spent in choir practice because the organist was on his holiday slowly in the cool of the evening he had walked home and fallen asleep in his chair on getting in at eleven he had woken with a start and hardening his heart had gone back to his sermon and now at nearly midnight it was still less than twenty minutes long he lighted one of his rare cigarettes and let thought wander how beautiful those pale pink roses were in that old silver bowllike a little strange poem or a piece of debussy music or a mathieu maris picturereminding him oddly of the word leila was he wrong in letting noel see so much of leila but then she was so improveddear leila the pink roses were just going to fall and yet how beautiful it was quiet tonight he felt very drowsy did nollie still think of that young man or had it passed she had never confided in him since after the war it would be nice to take her to italy to all the little towns they would see the assisi of st francis the little flowers of st francis the little flowers his hand dropped the cigarette went out he slept with his face in shadow slowly into the silence of his sleep little sinister sounds intruded short concussions dragging him back out of that deep slumber he started up noel was standing at the door in a long coat she said in her calm voice  zeps daddy  yes my dear where are the maids  an irish voice answered from the hall here sir trustin in god but tis better on the ground floor  he saw a huddle of three figures queerly costumed against the stairs  yes yes bridgie youre safe down here then he noticed that noel was gone he followed her out into the square alive with faces faintly luminous in the darkness and found her against the garden railings  you must come back in nollie  oh no cyril has this every day  he stood beside her not loth for excitement had begun to stir his blood they stayed there for some minutes straining their eyes for sight of anything save the little zagged splashes of bursting shrapnel while voices buzzed and muttered look there there there it is  but the seers had eyes of greater faith than piersons for he saw nothing he took her arm at last and led her in in the hall she broke from him  lets go up on the roof daddy and ran upstairs  again he followed mounting by a ladder through a trapdoor on to the roof  its splendid up here she cried  he could see her eyes blazing and thought how my child does love excitementits almost terrible  over the wide dark starstrewn sky travelling searchlights were lighting up the few little clouds the domes and spires rose from among the spreadout roofs all fine and ghostly the guns had ceased firing as though puzzled one distant bang rumbled out  a bomb oh if we could only get one of the zeps  a furious outburst of firing followed lasting perhaps a minute then ceased as if by magic they saw two searchlights converge and meet right overhead  its above us murmured noel  pierson put his arm round her waist she feels no fear he thought the searchlights switched apart and suddenly from far away came a confusion of weird sounds  what is it theyre cheering oh daddy look there in the heavens towards the east hung a dull red thing lengthening as they gazed  theyve got it its on fire hurrah  through the dark firmament that fiery orange shape began canting downward and the cheering swelled in a savage frenzy of sound and piersons arm tightened on her waist  thank god he muttered  the bright oblong seemed to break and spread tilted down below the level of the roofs and suddenly the heavens flared as if some huge jug of crimson light had been flung out on them something turned over in piersons heart he flung up his hand to his eyes  the poor men in it he said how terrible  noels voice answered hard and pitiless  they neednt have come theyre murderers  yes they were murderersbut how terrible and he stood quivering with his hands pressed to his face till the cheering had died out into silence  lets pray nollie he whispered o god who in thy great mercy hath delivered us from peril take into thy keeping the souls of these our enemies consumed by thy wrath before our eyes give us the power to pity themmen like ourselves  but even while he prayed he could see noels face flamewhite in the darkness and as that glow in the sky faded out he felt once more the thrill of triumph  they went down to tell the maids and for some time after sat up together talking over what they had seen eating biscuits and drinking milk which they warmed on an etna it was nearly two oclock before they went to bed pierson fell asleep at once and never turned till awakened at halfpast six by his alarum he had holy communion to administer at eight and he hurried to get early to his church and see that nothing untoward had happened to it there it stood in the sunlight tall grey quiet unharmed with bell gently ringing   3  and at that hour cyril morland under the parapet of his trench tightening his belt was looking at his wristwatch for the hundredth time calculating exactly where he meant to put foot and hand for the going over i absolutely mustnt let those chaps get in front of me he thought so many yards before the first line of trenches so many yards to the second line and there stop so his rehearsals had gone it was the performance now another minute before the terrific racket of the drumfire should become the curtainfire which would advance before them he ran his eye down the trench the man next him was licking his two first fingers as if he might be going to bowl at cricket further down a man was feeling his puttees a voice said wot price the orchestra nah he saw teeth gleam in faces burnt almost black then he looked up the sky was blue beyond the brownish film of dust raised by the striking shells noel noel noel he dug his fingers deep into the left side of his tunic till he could feel the outline of her photograph between his dispatchcase and his heart his heart fluttered just as it used when he was stretched out with hand touching the ground before the start of the hundred yards at school out of the corner of his eye he caught the flash of a mans briquet lighting a cigarette all right for those chaps but not for him he wanted all his breaththis rifle and kit were handicap enough two days ago he had been reading in some paper how men felt just before an attack and now he knew he just felt nervous if only the moment would come and get itself over for all the thought he gave to the enemy there might have been nonenothing but shells and bullets with lives of their own he heard the whistle his foot was on the spot he had marked down his hand where he had seen it he called out now boys his head was over the top his body over he was conscious of someone falling and two men neck and neck beside him not to try and run not to break out of a walk to go steady and yet keep ahead dn these holes a bullet tore through his sleeve grazing his arma redhot sensation like the touch of an iron a british shell from close over his head burst sixty yards ahead he stumbled fell flat picked himself up three ahead of him now he walked faster and drew alongside two of them fell what luck he thought and gripping his rifle harder pitched headlong into a declivity dead bodies lay there the first german trench line and nothing alive in it nothing to clean up nothing of it left he stopped getting his wind watching the men panting and stumbling in the roar of the guns was louder than ever again barraging the second line so far good and here was his captain  ready boys on then  this time he moved more slowly still over terrible going all holes and hummocks half consciously he took cover all he could the air was alive with the whistle from machinegun fire storming across zigzag fashionalive it was with bullets dust and smoke how shall i tell her he thought there would be nothing to tell but just a sort of jagged brown sensation he kept his eyes steadily before him not wanting to seethe men falling not wanting anything to divert him from getting there he felt the faint fanning of the passing bullets the second line must be close now why didnt that barrage lift was this new dodge of firing till the last second going to do them in another hundred yards and he would be bang into it he flung himself flat and waited looking at his wristwatch he noted that his arm was soaked with blood he thought a wound now i shall go home thank god oh noel the passing bullets whirled above him he could hear them even through the screech and thunder of the shellfire the beastly things he thought a voice beside him gasped out  its lifted sir  he called come on boys and went forward stooping a bullet struck his rifle the shock made him stagger and sent an electric shock spinning up his arm luck again he thought now for it i havent seen a german yet he leaped forward spun round flung up his arms and fell on his back shot through and through  the position was consolidated as they say and in the darkness stretcherbearers were out over the halfmile like willothewisps with their shaded lanterns they moved hour after hour slowly quartering the black honeycomb which lay behind the new british line now and then in the light of some starshell their figures were disclosed bending and raising the forms of the wounded or wielding pick and shovel  officer  dead  sure  search  from the shaded lantern lowered to just above the body a yellowish glare fell on face and breast the hands of the searcher moved in that little pool of light the bearer who was taking notes bent down  another boy he said that all he has  the searcher raised himself  just those and a photo  dispatchcase pound loose cigarettecase wristwatch photo lets see it  the searcher placed the photo in the pool of light the tiny face of a girl stared up at them unmoved from its short hair  noel said the searcher reading  hm take care of it stick it in his case come on  the pool of light dissolved and darkness for ever covered cyril morland     ii  when those four took their seats in the grand circle at queens hall the programme was already at the second number which in spite of all the efforts of patriotism was of german origina brandenburg concerto by bach more curious still it was encored pierson did not applaud he was too far gone in pleasure and sat with a rapt smile on his face oblivious of his surroundings he remained thus removed from mortal joys and sorrows till the last applause had died away and leilas voice said in his ear  isnt it a wonderful audience edward look at all that khaki whod have thought those young men cared for musicgood musicgerman music too  pierson looked down at the patient mass of standing figures in straw hats and military caps with faces turned all one way and sighed  i wish i could get an audience like that in my church  a smile crept out at the corner of leilas lips she was thinking ah your church is out of date my dear and so are you your church with its smell of mould and incense its stainedglass and narrowed length and droning organ poor edward so out of the world but she only pressed his arm and whispered  look at noel  the girl was talking to jimmy fort her cheeks were gushed and she looked prettier than pierson had seen her look for a long time now ever since kestrel indeed he heard leila sigh  does she get news of her boy do you remember that may week edward we were very young then even you were young that was such a pretty little letter you wrote me i can see you stillwandering in your dress clothes along the river among the holy cows  but her eyes slid round again watching her other neighbour and the girl a violinist had begun to play the cesar franck sonata it was piersons favourite piece of music bringing him as it were a view of heaven of devotional blue air where devout stars were shining in a sunlit noon above ecstatic trees and waters where ecstatic swans were swimming  queer world mr pierson fancy those boys having to go back to barrack life after listening to that whats your feeling are we moving back to the apes did we touch top note with that sonata  pierson turned and contemplated his questioner shrewdly  no captain fort i do not think we are moving back to the apes if we ever came from them those boys have the souls of heroes  i know that sir perhaps better than you do  ah yes said pierson humbly i forgot of course but he still looked at his neighbour doubtfully this captain fort who was a friend of leilas and who had twice been to see them puzzled him he had a frank face a frank voice but queer opinions or so it seemed to piersonlittle bits of moslemism little bits of the backwoods and the veldt queer unexpected cynicisms all sorts of side views on england had lodged in him and he did not hide them they came from him like bullets in that frank voice and drilled little holes in the listener those critical sayings flew so much more poignantly from one who had been through the same educational mill as himself than if they had merely come from some rough diamond some artist some foreigner even from a doctor like george and they always made him uncomfortable like the touch of a prickly leaf they did not amuse him certainly edward pierson shrank from the rough touches of a knockabout philosophy after all it was but natural that he should  he and noel left after the first part of the concert parting from the other two at the door he slipped his hand through her arm and following out those thoughts of his in the concerthall asked  do you like captain fort nollie  yes hes a nice man  he seems a nice man certainly he has a nice smile but strange views im afraid  he thinks the germans are not much worse than we are he says that a good many of us are bullies too  yes that is the sort of thing i mean  but are we daddy  surely not  a policeman i talked to once said the same captain fort says that very few men can stand having power put into their hands without being spoiled he told me some dreadful stories he says we have no imagination so that we often do things without seeing how brutal they are  were not perfect nollie but on the whole i think were a kind people  noel was silent a moment then said suddenly  kind people often think others are kind too when they really arent captain fort doesnt make that mistake  i think hes a little cynical and a little dangerous  are all people dangerous who dont think like others daddy  pierson incapable of mockery was not incapable of seeing when he was being mocked he looked at his daughter with a smile  not quite so bad as that nollie but mr fort is certainly subversive i think perhaps he has seen too many queer sides of life  i like him the better for that  well well pierson answered absently he had work to do in preparation for a confirmation class and sought his study on getting in  noel went to the diningroom to drink her hot milk the curtains were not drawn and bright moonlight was coming in without lighting up she set the etna going and stood looking at the moonfull for the second time since she and cyril had waited for it in the abbey and pressing her hands to her breast she shivered if only she could summon him from the moonlight out there if only she were a witchcould see him know where he was what doing for a fortnight now she had received no letter every day since he had left she had read the casualty lists with the superstitious feeling that to do so would keep him out of them she took up the times there was just enough light and she read the roll of honourtill the moon shone in on her lying on the floor with the dropped journal  but she was proud and soon took grief to her room as on that night after he left her she had taken love no sign betrayed to the house her disaster the journal on the floor and the smell of the burnt milk which had boiled over revealed nothing after all she was but one of a thousand hearts which spent that moonlit night in agony each night year in year out a thousand faces were buried in pillows to smother that first awful sense of desolation and grope for the secret spiritplace where bereaved souls go to receive some feeble touch of healing from knowledge of each others trouble  in the morning she got up from her sleepless bed seemed to eat her breakfast and went off to her hospital there she washed up plates and dishes with a stony face dark under the eyes  the news came to pierson in a letter from thirza received at lunchtime he read it with a dreadful aching poor poor little nollie what an awful trouble for her and he too went about his work with the nightmare thought that he had to break the news to her that evening never had he felt more lonely more dreadfully in want of the mother of his children she would have known how to soothe how to comfort on her heart the child could have sobbed away grief and all that hour from seven to eight when he was usually in readiness to fulfil the functions of gods substitute to his parishioners he spent in prayer of his own for guidance how to inflict and heal this blow when at last noel came he opened the door to her himself and putting back the hair from her forehead said come in here a moment my darling noel followed him into the study and sat down i know already daddy pierson was more dismayed by this stoicism than he would have been by any natural out burst he stood timidly stroking her hair murmuring to her what he had said to gratian and to so many others in these days there is no death look forward to seeing him again god is merciful and he marvelled at the calmness of that pale faceso young  you are very brave my child he said  theres nothing else to be is there  isnt there anything i can do for you nollie  no daddy  when did you see it  last night she had already known for twentyfour hours without telling him  have you prayed my darling  no  try nollie  no  ah try  it would be ridiculous daddy you dont know  grievously upset and bewildered pierson moved away from her and said  you look dreadfully tired would you like a hot bath and your dinner in bed  id like some tea thats all and she went out  when he had seen that the tea had gone up to her he too went out and moved by a longing for womans help took a cab to leilas flat     iii   on leaving the concert leila and jimmy fort had secured a taxi a vehicle which at night in wartime has certain advantages for those who desire to become better acquainted vibration sufficient noise darkness are guaranteed and all that is lacking for the furtherance of emotion is the scent of honeysuckle and roses or even of the white flowering creeper which on the stoep at high constantia had smelled so much sweeter than petrol  when leila found herself with fort in that loneliness to which she had been looking forward she was overcome by an access of nervous silence she had been passing through a strange time for weeks past every night she examined her sensations without quite understanding them as yet when a woman comes to her age the worldforce is liable to take possession saying  you were young you were beautiful you still have beauty you are not cannot be old cling to youth cling to beauty take all you can get before your face gets lines and your hair grey it is impossible that you have been loved for the last time  to see jimmy fort at the concert talking to noel had brought this emotion to a head she was not of a grudging nature and could genuinely admire noel but the idea that jimmy fort might also admire disturbed her greatly he must not it was not fair he was too oldbesides the girl had her boy and she had taken care that he should know it so leaning towards him while a bareshouldered young lady sang she had whispered  penny  and he had whispered back  tell you afterwards  that had comforted her she would make him take her home it was time she showed her heart  and now in the cab resolved to make her feelings known in sudden shyness she found it very difficult love to which for quite three years she had been a stranger was come to life within her the knowledge was at once so sweet and so disturbing that she sat with face averted unable to turn the precious minutes to account they arrived at the flat without having done more than agree that the streets were dark and the moon bright she got out with a sense of bewilderment and said rather desperately  you must come up and have a cigarette its quite early still  he went up  wait just a minute said leila  sitting there with his drink and his cigarette he stared at some sunflowers in a bowlfamille roseand waited just ten smiling a little recalling the nose of the fairy princess and the dainty way her lips shaped the words she spoke if she had not had that lucky young devil of a soldier boy one would have wanted to buckle her shoes lay ones coat in the mud for her or whatever they did in fairytales one would have wantedah what would one not have wanted hang that soldier boy leila said he was twentytwo by george how old it made a man feel who was rising forty and tender on the offfore no fairy princesses for him then a whiff of perfume came to his nostrils and looking up he saw leila standing before him in a long garment of dark silk whence her white arms peeped out  another penny do you remember these things jimmy the malay women used to wear them in cape town you cant think what a relief it is to get out of my slaves dress oh im so sick of nursing jimmy i want to live again a little  the garment had taken fifteen years off her age and a gardenia just where the silk crossed on her breast seemed no whiter than her skin he wondered whimsically whether it had dropped to her out of the dark  live he said why dont you always  she raised her hands so that the dark silk fell back from the whole length of those white arms  i havent lived for two years oh jimmy help me to live a little lifes so short now  her eyes disturbed him strained and pathetic the sight of her arms the scent of the flower disturbed him he felt his cheeks growing warm and looked down  she slipped suddenly forward on to her knees at his feet took his hand pressed it with both of hers and murmured  love me a little what else is there oh jimmy what else is there  and with the scent of the flower crushed by their hands stirring his senses fort thought ah what else is there in these forsaken days  to jimmy fort who had a sense of humour and was in some sort a philosopher the haphazard way life settled things seldom failed to seem amusing but when he walked away from leilas he was pensive she was a good sort a pretty creature a sportswoman an enchantress butshe was decidedly mature and here he wasinvolved in helping her to live involved almost alarmingly for there had been no mistaking the fact that she had really fallen in love with him  this was flattering and sweet times were sad and pleasure scarce but the roving instinct which had kept him from his youth up rolling about the world shied instinctively at bonds however pleasant the strength and thickness of which he could not gauge or was it that perhaps for the first time in his life he had been peeping into fairyland of late and this affair with leila was by no means fairyland he had another reason more unconscious for uneasiness his heart for all his wanderings was soft he had always found it difficult to hurt anyone especially anyone who did him the honour to love him a sort of presentiment weighed on him while he walked the moonlit streets at this most empty hour when even the late taxis had ceased to run would she want him to marry her would it be his duty if she did and then he found himself thinking of the concert and that girls face listening to the tales he was telling her deuced queer world he thought the way things go i wonder what she would think of us if she knewand that good padre phew  he made such very slow progress for fear of giving way in his leg and having to spend the night on a doorstep that he had plenty of time for rumination but since it brought him no confidence whatever he began at last to feel well it might be a lot worse take the goods the gods send you and dont fuss and suddenly he remembered with extreme vividness that night on the stoep at high constantia and thought with dismay i could have plunged in over head and ears then and nowi cant thats life all over poor leila me miserum too perhapswho knows     iv  when leila opened her door to edward pierson her eyes were smiling and her lips were soft she seemed to smile and be soft all over and she took both his hands everything was a pleasure to her that day even the sight of this sad face she was in love and was loved again had a present and a future once more not only her own full past and she must finish with edward in half an hour for jimmy was coming she sat down on the divan took his hand in a sisterly way and said  tell me edward i can see youre in trouble what is it  noel the boy she was fond of has been killed  she dropped his hand  oh no poor child its too cruel tears started up in her grey eyes and she touched them with a tiny handkerchief poor poor little noel was she very fond of him  a very sudden short engagement but im afraid she takes it desperately to heart i dont know how to comfort her only a woman could i came to ask you do you think she ought to go on with her work what do you think leila i feel lost  leila gazing at him thought lost yes you look lost my poor edward  i should let her go on she said it helps its the only thing that does help ill see if i can get them to let her come into the wards she ought to be in touch with suffering and the men that kitchen work will try her awfully just now was he very young  yes they wanted to get married i was opposed to it  leilas lip curled ever so little you would be she thought  i couldnt bear to think of nollie giving herself hastily like that they had only known each other three weeks it was very hard for me leila and then suddenly he was sent to the front  resentment welled up in leila the killjoys as if life didnt kill joy fast enough her cousins face at that moment was almost abhorrent to her its gentle perplexed goodness darkened and warped by that monkish look she turned away glanced at the clock over the hearth and thought yes and he would stop jimmy and me he would say oh no dear leilayou mustnt loveits sin how i hate that word  i think the most dreadful thing in life she said abruptly is the way people suppress their natural instincts what they suppress in themselves they make other people suppress too if they can and thats the cause of half the misery in this world  then at the surprise on his face at this little outburst whose cause he could not know she added hastily i hope noel will get over it quickly and find someone else  yes if they had been marriedhow much worse it would have been thank god they werent  i dont know they would have had an hour of bliss even an hour of bliss is worth something in these days  to those who only believe in this lifeperhaps  ten minutes more she thought oh why doesnt he go but at that very moment he got up and instantly her heart went out to him again  im so sorry edward if i can help in any wayill try my best with noel tomorrow and do come to me whenever you feel inclined  she took his hand in hers afraid that he would sit down again she yet could not help a soft glance into his eyes and a little rush of pitying warmth in the pressure of her hand  pierson smiled the smile which always made her sorry for him  goodbye leila youre very good and kind to me goodbye  her bosom swelled with relief and compassion andshe let him out  running upstairs again she thought ive just time what shall i put on poor edward poor noel what colour does jimmy like oh why didnt i keep him those ten years agowhat utter waste and feverishly adorning herself she came back to the window and stood there in the dark to watch while some jasmine which grew below sent up its scent to her would i marry him she thought if he asked me but he wont ask mewhy should he now besides i couldnt bear him to feel i wanted position or money from him i only want lovelovelove the silent repetition of that word gave her a wonderful sense of solidity and comfort so long as she only wanted love surely he would give it  a tall figure turned down past the church coming towards her it was he and suddenly she bethought herself she went to the little black piano sat down and began to sing the song she had sung to him ten years ago if i could be the falling dew and fall on thee all day she did not even look round when he came in but continued to croon out the words conscious of him just behind her shoulder in the dark but when she had finished she got up and threw her arms round him strained him to her and burst into tears on his shoulder thinking of noel and that dead boy thinking of the millions of other boys thinking of her own happiness thinking of those ten years wasted of how short was life and love thinkinghardly knowing what she thought and jimmy fort very moved by this emotion which he only half understood pressed her tightly in his arms and kissed her wet cheeks and her neck pale and warm in the darkness     v  1  noel went on with her work for a month and then one morning fainted over a pile of dishes the noise attracted attention and mrs lynch was summoned  the sight of her lying there so deadly white taxed leilas nerves severely but the girl revived quickly and a cab was sent for leila went with her and told the driver to stop at camelot mansions why take her home in this state why not save the jolting and let her recover properly they went upstairs arm in arm leila made her lie down on the divan and put a hotwater bottle to her feet noel was still so passive and pale that even to speak to her seemed a cruelty and going to her little sideboard leila stealthily extracted a pint bottle of some champagne which jimmy fort had sent in and took it with two glasses and a corkscrew into her bedroom she drank a little herself and came out bearing a glass to the girl noel shook her head and her eyes seemed to say do you really think im so easily mended but leila had been through too much in her time to despise earthly remedies and she held it to the girls lips until she drank it was excellent champagne and since noel had never yet touched alcohol had an instantaneous effect her eyes brightened little red spots came up in her cheeks and suddenly she rolled over and buried her face deep in a cushion with her short hair she looked so like a child lying there that leila knelt down stroking her head and saying there there my love there there  at last the girl raised herself now that the pallid masklike despair of the last month was broken she seemed on fire and her face had a wild look she withdrew herself from leilas touch and crossing her arms tightly across her chest said  i cant bear it i cant sleep i want him back i hate lifei hate the world we hadnt done anythingonly just loved each other god likes punishing just because we loved each other we had only one day to love each otheronly one dayonly one  leila could see the long white throat above those rigid arms straining and swallowing it gave her a choky feeling to watch it the voice uncannily dainty for all the wildness of the words and face went on  i wonti dont want to live if theres another life i shall go to him and if there isntits just sleep  leila put out her hand to ward of these wild wanderings like most women who live simply the life of their senses and emotions she was orthodox or rather never speculated on such things  tell me about yourself and him she said  noel fastened her great eyes on her cousin we loved each other and children are born arent they after youve loved but mine wont be from the look on her face rather than from her words the full reality of her meaning came to leila vanished came again nonsense butwhat an awful thing if true that which had always seemed to her such an exaggerated occurrence in the common walks of lifewhy now it was a tragedy instinctively she raised herself and put her arms round the girl  my poor dear she said youre fancying things  the colour had faded out of noels face and with her head thrown back and her eyelids halfclosed she looked like a scornful young ghost  if it isi shant live i dont mean toits easy to die i dont mean daddy to know  oh my dear my dear was all leila could stammer  was it wrong leila  wrong i dont knowwrong if it really is soit wasunfortunate but surely surelyyoure mistaken  noel shook her head i did it so that we should belong to each other nothing could have taken him from me  leila caught at the girls words  then my dearhe hasnt quite gone from you you see  noels lips formed a no which was inaudible but daddy she whispered  edwards face came before leila so vividly that she could hardly see the girl for the tortured shape of it then the hedonist in her revolted against that ascetic vision her worldly judgment condemned and deplored this calamity her instinct could not help applauding that hour of life and love snatched out of the jaws of death need he ever know she said  i could never lie to daddy but it doesnt matter why should one go on living when life is rotten  outside the sun was shining brightly though it was late october leila got up from her knees she stood at the window thinking hard  my dear she said at last you mustnt get morbid look at me ive had two husbands andandwell a pretty stormy up and down time of it and i daresay ive got lots of trouble before me but im not going to cave in nor must you the piersons have plenty of pluck you mustnt be a traitor to your blood thats the last thing your boy would have told you to stick it these are your trenches and youre not going to be downed are you  after she had spoken there was a long silence before noel said  give me a cigarette leila  leila produced the little flat case she carried  thats brave she said nothings incurable at your age only one things incurablegetting old  noel laughed thats curable too isnt it  not without surrender  again there was a silence while the blue fume from two cigarettes fastsmoked rose towards the low ceiling then noel got up from the divan and went over to the piano she was still in her hospital dress of lilaccoloured linen and while she stood there touching the keys playing a chord now and then leilas heart felt hollow from compassion she was so happy herself just now and this child so very wretched  play to me she said nodont ill play to you and sitting down she began to play and sing a little french song whose first line ran si on est jolie jolie comme vous it was soft gay charming if the girl cried so much the better but noel did not cry she seemed suddenly to have recovered all her selfpossession she spoke calmly answered leilas questions without emotion and said she would go home leila went out with her and walked some way in the direction of her home distressed but frankly at a loss at the bottom of portland place noel stopped and said im quite all right now leila thank you awfully i shall just go home and lie down and i shall come tomorrow the same as usual goodbye leila could only grasp the girls hand and say my dear thats splendid theres many a slipbesides its wartime  with that saying enigmatic even to herself she watched the girl moving slowly away and turned back herself towards her hospital with a disturbed and compassionate heart   2  but noel did not go east she walked down regent street she had received a certain measure of comfort been steadied by her experienced cousins vitality and the new thoughts suggested by those words he hasnt quite gone from you has he besides its wartime leila had spoken freely too and the physical ignorance in which the girl had been groping these last weeks was now removed like most proud natures she did not naturally think much about the opinion of other people besides she knew nothing of the world its feelings and judgments her nightmare was the thought of her fathers horror and grief she tried to lessen that nightmare by remembering his opposition to her marriage and the resentment she had felt he had never realised never understood how she and cyril loved now if she were really going to have a child it would be cyrilscyrils soncyril over again the instinct stronger than reason refinement tradition upbringing which had pushed her on in such haste to make sure of unionthe irrepressible pulse of life faced with annihilationseemed to revive within her and make her terrible secret almost precious she had read about war babies in the papers read with a dull curiosity but now the atmosphere as it were of those writings was illumined for her these babies were wrong were a problem and yet behind all that she seemed now to know that people were glad of them they made up they filled the gaps perhaps when she had one she would be proud secretly proud in spite of everyone in spite of her father they had tried to kill cyrilgod and everyone but they hadnt been able he was alive within her a glow came into her face walking among the busy shopping crowd and people turned to look at her she had that appearance of seeing no one nothing which is strange and attractive to those who have a moment to spare from contemplation of their own affairs fully two hours she wandered thus before going in and only lost that exalted feeling when in her own little room she had taken up his photograph and was sitting on her bed gazing at it she had a bad breakdown then locked in there she lay on her bed crying dreadfully lonely till she fell asleep exhausted with the tearstained photograph clutched in her twitching fingers she woke with a start it was dark and someone was knocking on her door  miss noel  childish perversity kept her silent why couldnt they leave her alone they would leave her alone if they knew then she heard another kind of knocking and her fathers voice  nollie nollie  she scrambled up and opened he looked scared and her heart smote her  its all right daddy i was asleep  my dear im sorry but dinners ready  i dont want any dinner i think ill go to bed  the frown between his brows deepened  you shouldnt lock your door nollie i was quite frightened i went round to the hospital to bring you home and they told me about your fainting i want you to see a doctor  noel shook her head vigorously oh no its nothing  nothing to faint like that come my child to please me he took her face in his hands noel shrank away  no daddy i wont see a doctor extravagance in wartime i wont its no good trying to make me ill come down if you like i shall be all right tomorrow  with this pierson had to be content but often that evening she saw him looking at her anxiously and when she went up he came out of his study followed to her room and insisted on lighting her fire kissing her at the door he said very quietly  i wish i could be a mother to you my child  for a moment it flashed through noel he knows then by the puzzled look on his face she knew that he did not if only he did know what a weight it would be off her mind but she answered quietly too good night daddy dear kissed him and shut the door  she sat down before the little new fire and spread her hands out to it all was so cold and wintry in her heart and the firelight flickered on her face where shadows lay thick under her eyes for all the roundness of her cheeks and on her slim pale hands and the supple grace of her young body and out in the night clouds raced over the moon which had come full once more     vi   1  pierson went back to his study and wrote to gratian   if you can get leave for a few days my dear i want you at home i am troubled about nollie ever since that disaster happened to her she has been getting paler and today she fainted she wont see a doctor but perhaps you could get her to see george if you come up he will surely be able to run up to us for a day or two if not you must take her down to him at the sea i have just seen the news of your second cousin charlie piersons death he was killed in one of the last attacks on the somme he was nephew of my cousin leila whom as you know noel sees every day at her hospital bertram has the d s o i have been less hardpressed lately lauder has been home on leave and has taken some services for me and now the colder weather has come i am feeling much fresher try your best to come i am seriously concerned for our beloved child  your affectionate father  edward pierson   gratian answered that she could get weekend leave and would come on friday he met her at the station and they drove thence straight to the hospital to pick up noel leila came to them in the waitingroom and pierson thinking they would talk more freely about noels health if he left them alone went into the recreation room and stood watching a game of bagatelle between two convalescents when he returned to the little sittingroom they were still standing by the hearth talking in low voices gratian must surely have been stooping over the fire for her face was red almost swollen and her eyes looked as if she had scorched them  leila said lightly  well edward arent the men delightful when are we going to another concert together  she too was flushed and looking almost young  ah if we could do the things we want to  thats very pretty edward but you should you knowfor a tonic he shook his head and smiled  youre a temptress leila will you let nollie know please that we can take her back with us can you let her off tomorrow  for as long as you like she wants a rest ive been talking to gratian we oughtnt to have let her go on after a shock like thatmy fault im afraid i thought that work might be best  pierson was conscious of gratian walking past him out of the room he held out his hand to leila and followed a small noise occurred behind him such as a woman makes when she has put a foot through her own skirt or has other powerful cause for dismay then he saw noel in the hall and was vaguely aware of being the centre of a triangle of women whose eyes were playing catchglance his daughters kissed each other and he became seated between them in the taxi the most unobservant of men he parted from them in the hall without having perceived anything except that they were rather silent and going to his study he took up a life of sir thomas more there was a passage therein which he itched to show george laird who was coming up that evening  gratian and noel had mounted the stairs with lips tight set and eyes averted both were very pale when they reached the door of gratians room the room which had been their mothersnoel was for passing on but gratian caught her by the arm and said come in the fire was burning brightly in there and the two sisters stood in front of it one on each side their hands clutching the mantelshelf staring at the flames at last noel put one hand in front of her eyes and said  i asked her to tell you  gratian made the movement of one who is gripped by two strong emotions and longs to surrender to one or to the other  its too horrible was all she said  noel turned towards the door  stop nollie  noel stopped with her hand on the door knob i dont want to be forgiven and sympathised with i just want to be let alone  how can you be let alone  the tide of misery surged up in noel and she cried out passionately  i hate sympathy from people who cant understand i dont want anyones i can always go away and lose myself  the words cant understand gave gratian a shock  i can understand she said  you cant you never saw him you never saw her lips quivered so that she had to stop and bite them to keep back a rush of tears  besides you would never have done it yourself  gratian went towards her but stopped and sat down on the bed it was true she would never have done it herself it was just that which for all her longing to help her sister iced her love and sympathy how terrible wretched humiliating her own sister her only sister in the position of all those poor badly brought up girls who forgot themselves and her fathertheir father till that moment she had hardly thought of him too preoccupied by the shock to her own pride the word dad was forced from her  noel shuddered  that boy said gratian suddenly i cant forgive him if you didnt knowhe did it wasit was she stopped at the sight of noels face  i did know she said it was i he was my husband as much as yours is if you say a word against him ill never speak to you again im glad and you would be if you were going to have one whats the difference except that youve had luck and ihavent her lips quivered again and she was silent  gratian stared up at her she had a longing for georgeto know what he thought and felt  do you mind if i tell george she said  noel shook her head no not now tell anybody and suddenly the misery behind the mask of her face went straight to gratians heart she got up and put her arms round her sister  nollie dear dont look like that  noel suffered the embrace without response but when it was over went to her own room  gratian stayed sorry sore and vexed uncertain anxious her pride was deeply wounded her heart torn she was angry with herself why couldnt she have been more sympathetic and yet now that noel was no longer there she again condemned the dead what he had done was unpardonable nollie was sucha child he had committed sacrilege if only george would come and she could talk it all out with him she who had married for love and known passion had insight enough to feel that noels love had been deepso far as anything of course could be deep in such a child gratian was at the mature age of twenty but to have forgotten herself like that and this boy if she had known him that feeling might have been mitigated by the personal element so important to all human judgment but never having seen him she thought of his conduct as caddish and she knew that this was and would be the trouble between her and her sister however she might disguise it noel would feel that judgment underneath  she stripped off her nurses garb put on an evening frock and fidgeted about the room anything rather than go down and see her father again before she must this which had happened was beyond words terrible for him she dreaded the talk with him about noels health which would have to come she could say nothing of course until noel wished and very truthful by nature the idea of having to act a lie distressed her  she went down at last and found them both in the drawingroom already noel in a frilly evening frock sitting by the fire with her chin on her hand while her father was reading out the war news from the evening paper at sight of that cool dainty girlish figure brooding over the fire and of her fathers worn face the tragedy of this business thrust itself on her with redoubled force poor dad poor nollie awful then noel turned and gave a little shake of her head and her eyes said almost as plainly as lips could have said it silence gratian nodded and came forward to the fire and so began one of those calm domestic evenings which cover sometimes such depths of heartache   2  noel stayed up until her father went to bed then went upstairs at once she had evidently determined that they should not talk about her gratian sat on alone waiting for her husband it was nearly midnight when he came and she did not tell him the family news till next morning he received it with a curious little grunt gratian saw his eyes contract as they might have perhaps looking at some bad and complicated wound and then stare steadily at the ceiling though they had been married over a year she did not yet know what he thought about many things and she waited with a queer sinking at her heart this skeleton in the family cupboard was a test of his affection for herself a test of the quality of the man she had married he did not speak for a little and her anxiety grew then his hand sought hers and gave it a hard squeeze  poor little nollie this is a case for mark tapleyism but cheer up gracie well get her through somehow  but father its impossible to keep it from him and impossible to tell him oh george i never knew what family pride was till now its incredible that wretched boy  de mortuis come gracie in the midst of death we are in life nollie was a plumb little idiot but its the warthe war your father must get used to it its a rare chance for his christianity  dad will be as sweet as anythingthats what makes it so horrible  george laird redoubled his squeeze quite right the oldfashioned father could let himself go but need he know we can get her away from london and later on we must manage somehow if he does hear we must make him feel that nollie was doing her bit  gratian withdrew her hand dont she said in a muffled voice  george laird turned and looked at her he was greatly upset himself realising perhaps more truly than his young wife the violence of this disaster he was quite capable too of feeling how deeply she was stirred and hurt but a born pragmatist confronting life always in the experimental spirit he was impatient of the how awful attitude and this streak of her fathers ascetic traditionalism in gratian always roused in him a wish to break it up if she had not been his wife he would have admitted at once that he might just as well try and alter the boneformation of her head as break down such a fundamental trait of character but being his wife he naturally considered alteration as possible as putting a new staircase in a house or throwing two rooms into one and taking her in his arms he said i know but itll all come right if we put a good face on it shall i talk to nollie  gratian assented from the desire to be able to say to her father george is seeing her and so stay the need for a discussion but the whole thing seemed to her more and more a calamity which nothing could lessen or smooth away  george laird had plenty of cool courage invaluable in men who have to inflict as well as to alleviate pain but he did not like his mission a little bit as he would have said and he proposed a walk because he dreaded a scene noel accepted for the same reason she liked george and with the disinterested detachment of a sisterinlaw and the shrewdness of extreme youth knew him perhaps better than did his wife she was sure at all events of being neither condemned nor sympathised with  they might have gone of course in any direction but chose to make for the city such deep decisions are subconscious they sought no doubt a dry unemotional region or perhaps one where george who was in uniform might rest his arm from the automatictoy game which the military play they had reached cheapside before he was conscious to the full of the bizarre nature of this walk with his pretty young sisterinlaw among all the bustling blackcoated mob of moneymakers i wish the devil we hadnt come out he thought it would have been easier indoors after all  he cleared his throat however and squeezing her arm gently began gratians told me nollie the great thing is to keep your spirit up and not worry  i suppose you couldnt cure me  the words in that delicate spurning voice absolutely staggered george but he said quickly  out of the question nollie impossible what are you thinking of  daddy  the words dn daddy rose to his teeth he bit them off and said bless him we shall have to see to all that do you really want to keep it from him it must be one way or the other no use concealing it if its to come out later  no  he stole a look at her she was gazing straight before her how damnably young she was how pretty a lump came up in his throat  i shouldnt do anything yet he said too early later on if youd like me to tell him but thats entirely up to you my dear he need never know  no  he could not follow her thought then she said  gratian condemns cyril dont let her i wont have him badly thought of it was my doing i wanted to make sure of him  george answered stoutly  gracies upset of course but shell soon be all right you mustnt let it come between you the thing youve got to keep steadily before you is that lifes a huge wide adaptable thing look at all these people theres hardly one of them who hasnt got now or hasnt had some personal difficulty or trouble before them as big as yours almost bigger perhaps and here they are as lively as fleas thats what makes the fascination of lifethe jolly irony of it all it would do you good to have a turn in france and see yourself in proportion to the whole he felt her fingers suddenly slip under his arm and went on with greater confidence  lifes going to be the important thing in the future nollie not comfort and cloistered virtue and security but living and pressure to the square inch do you twig all the old hardandfast traditions and drags on life are in the meltingpot deaths boiling their bones and theyll make excellent stock for the new soup when you prune and dock things the sap flows quicker regrets and repinings and repressions are going out of fashion we shall have no time or use for them in the future youre going to make lifewell thats something to be thankful for anyway youve kept cyril morland alive andwell you know weve all been born some of us properly and some improperly and there isnt a haporth of difference in the value of the article or the trouble of bringing it into the world the cheerier you are the better your child will be and thats all youve got to think about you neednt begin to trouble at all for another couple of months at least after that just let us know where youd like to go and ill arrange it somehow  she looked round at him and under that young clear brooding gaze he had the sudden uncomfortable feeling of having spoken like a charlatan had he really touched the heart of the matter what good were his generalities to this young fastidiously nurtured girl brought up to tell the truth by a father so oldfashioned and devoted whom she loved it was georges nature too to despise words and the conditions of his life these last two years had given him a sort of horror of those who act by talking he felt inclined to say dont pay the slightest attention to me its all humbug what will be will be and theres an end of it  then she said quietly  shall i tell daddy or not  he wanted to say no but somehow couldnt after all the straightforward course was probably the best for this would have to be a lifelong concealment it was impossible to conceal a thing for ever sooner or later he would find out but the doctor rose up in him and he said  dont go to meet trouble nollie itll be time enough in two months then tell him or let me  she shook her head no i will if it is to be done  he put his hand on hers within his arm and gave it a squeeze  what shall i do till then she asked  take a weeks complete rest and then go on where you are  noel was silent a minute then said yes i will  they spoke no more on the subject and george exerted himself to talk about hospital experiences and that phenomenon the british soldier but just before they reached home he said  look here nollie if youre not ashamed of yourself no one will be ashamed of you if you put ashes on your own head your fellowbeings will assist you for of such is their charity  and receiving another of those clear brooding looks he left her with the thought a lonely child     vii  noel went back to her hospital after a weeks rest george had done more for her than he suspected for his saying lifes a huge wide adaptable thing had stuck in her mind did it matter what happened to her and she used to look into the faces of the people she met and wonder what was absorbing them what secret griefs and joys were they carrying about with them the loneliness of her own life now forced her to this speculation concerning others for she was extraordinarily lonely gratian and george were back at work her father must be kept at bay with leila she felt ill at ease for the confession had hurt her pride and family friends and acquaintances of all sorts she shunned like the plague the only person she did not succeed in avoiding was jimmy fort who came in one evening after dinner bringing her a large bunch of hothouse violets but then he did not seem to mattertoo new an acquaintance too detached something he said made her aware that he had heard of her loss and that the violets were a token of sympathy he seemed awfully kind that evening telling her tales of araby and saying nothing which would shock her father it was wonderful to be a man and roll about the world as he had and see all life and queer places and peoplechinamen and gauchos and boers and mexicans it gave her a kind of thirst and she liked to watch his brown humorous face which seemed made of dried leather it gave her the feeling that life and experience were all that mattered doing and seeing things it made her own trouble seem smaller less important she squeezed his hand when she said good night thank you for my violets and for coming it was awfully kind of you i wish i could have adventures and he answered you will my dear fairy princess he said it queerly and very kindly  fairy princess what a funny thing to call her if he had only known  there were not many adventures to be had in those regions where she washed up not much wide and adaptable life to take her thoughts off herself but on her journeys to and from the hospital she had more than one odd little experience one morning she noticed a poorly dressed woman with a red and swollen face flapping along regent street like a wounded bird and biting strangely at her hand hearing her groan noel asked her what the matter was the woman held out the hand oh she moaned i was scrubbin the floor and i got this great needle stuck through my and and its broke off and i cant get it out oh oh she bit at the needleend not quite visible but almost within reach of teeth and suddenly went very white in dismay noel put an arm round her and turned her into a fine chemists shop several ladies were in there buying perfumes and they looked with acerbity at this disordered dirty female entering among them noel went up to a man behind the counter please give me something quick for this poor woman i think shes going to faint shes run a needle through her hand and cant get it out the man gave her something quick and noel pushed past two of the dames back to where the woman was sitting she was still obstinately biting at her hand and suddenly her chin flew up and there between her teeth was the needle she took it from them with her other hand stuck it proudly in the front of her dress and out tumbled the words oh thereive got it  when she had swallowed the draught she looked round her bewildered and said  thank you kindly miss and shuffled out noel paid for the draught and followed and behind her the shining shop seemed to exhale a perfumed breath of relief  you cant go back to work she said to the woman where do you live  ornsey miss  you must take a bus and go straight home and put your hand at once into weak condys fluid and water its swelling heres five shillings  yes miss thank you miss im sure its very kind of you it does ache cruel  if its not better this afternoon you must go to a doctor promise  oh dear yes eres my bus thank you kindly miss  noel saw her borne away still sucking at her dirty swollen hand she walked on in a glow of love for the poor woman and hate for the ladies in the chemists shop and forgot her own trouble till she had almost reached the hospital  another november day a saturday leaving early she walked to hyde park the planetrees were just at the height of their spotted beauty fewvery fewyellow leaves still hung and the slender pretty trees seemed rejoicing in their freedom from summer foliage all their delicate boughs and twigs were shaking and dancing in the wind and their rainwashed leopardlike bodies had a lithe unenglish gaiety noel passed down their line and seated herself on a bench close by an artist was painting his easel was only some three yards away from her and she could see the picture a vista of the park lane houses through the gay planetree screen he was a tall man about forty evidently foreign with a thin long oval beardless face high brow large grey eyes which looked as if he suffered from headaches and lived much within himself he cast many glances at her and pursuant of her new interest in life she watched him discreetly a little startled however when taking off his broadbrimmed squash hat he said in a broken accent  forgive me the liberty i take mademoiselle but would you so very kindly allow me to make a sketch of you sitting there i work very quick i beg you will let me i am belgian and have no manners you see and he smiled  if you like said noel  i thank you very much  he shifted his easel and began to draw she felt flattered and a little fluttered he was so pale and had a curious halffed look which moved her  have you been long in england she said presently  ever since the first months of the war  do you like it  i was very homesick at first but i live in my pictures there are wonderful things in london  why did you want to sketch me  the painter smiled again mademoiselle youth is so mysterious those young trees i have been painting mean so much more than the old big trees your eyes are seeing things that have not yet happened there is fate in them and a look of defending us others from seeing it we have not such faces in my country we are simpler we do not defend our expressions the english are very mysterious we are like children to them yet in some ways you are like children to us you are not people of the world at all you english have been good to us but you do not like us  and i suppose you do not like us either  he smiled again and she noticed how white his teeth were  well not very much the english do things from duty but their hearts they keep to themselves and their artwell that is really amusing  i dont know much about art noel murmured  it is the world to me said the painter and was silent drawing with increased pace and passion  it is so difficult to get subjects he remarked abruptly i cannot afford to pay models and they are not fond of me painting out of doors if i had always a subject like you youyou have a grief have you not  at that startling little question noel looked up frowning  everybody has now  the painter grasped his chin his eyes had suddenly become tragical  yes he said everybody tragedy is daily bread i have lost my family they are in belgium how they live i do not know  im sorry very sorry too if we arent nice to you here we ought to be  he shrugged his shoulders what would you have we are different that is unpardonable an artist is always lonely too he has a skin fewer than other people and he sees things that they do not people do not like you to be different if ever in your life you act differently from others you will find it so mademoiselle  noel felt herself flushing was he reading her secret his eyes had such a peculiar secondsighted look  have you nearly finished she asked  no mademoiselle i could go on for hours but i do not wish to keep you it is cold for you sitting there  noel got up may i look  certainly  she did not quite recognise herselfwho doesbut she saw a face which affected her oddly of a girl looking at something which was and yet was not in front of her  my name is lavendie the painter said my wife and i live here and he gave her a card  noel could not help answering my name is noel pierson i live with my father heres the addressshe found her case and fished out a card my father is a clergyman would you care to come and see him he loves music and painting  it would be a great pleasure and perhaps i might be allowed to paint you alas i have no studio  noel drew back im afraid that i work in a hospital all day andand i dont want to be painted thank you but daddy would like to meet you im sure  the painter bowed again she saw that he was hurt  of course i can see that youre a very fine painter she said quickly onlyonlyi dont want to you see perhaps youd like to paint daddy hes got a most interesting face  the painter smiled he is your father mademoiselle may i ask you one question why do you not want to be painted  becausebecause i dont im afraid she held out her hand the painter bowed over it au revoir mademoiselle  thank you said noel it was awfully interesting and she walked away the sky had become full of clouds round the westerly sun and the foreign crinkled tracery of the planetree branches against that frenchgrey goldenedged mass was very lovely beauty and the troubles of others soothed her she felt sorry for the painter but his eyes saw too much and his words if ever you act differently from others made her feel him uncanny was it true that people always disliked and condemned those who acted differently if her old schoolfellows now knew what was before her how would they treat her in her fathers study hung a little reproduction of a tiny picture in the louvre a rape of europa by an unknown paintera humorous delicate thing of an enraptured fairhaired girl mounted on a prancing white bull crossing a shallow stream while on the bank all her white girlcompanions were gathered turning halfsour halfenvious faces away from that toofearful spectacle while one of them tried with timid desperation to mount astride of a sitting cow and follow the face of the girl on the bull had once been compared by someone with her own she thought of this picture now and saw her school fellowsa throng of shocked and wondering girls suppose one of them had been in her position should i have been turning my face away like the rest i wouldnt no i wouldnt she thought i should have understood but she knew there was a kind of false emphasis in her thought instinctively she felt the painter right one who acted differently from others was lost  she told her father of the encounter adding  i expect hell come daddy  pierson answered dreamily poor fellow i shall be glad to see him if he does  and youll sit to him wont you  my deari  hes lonely you know and people arent nice to him isnt it hateful that people should hurt others because theyre foreign or different  she saw his eyes open with mild surprise and went on i know you think people are charitable daddy but they arent of course  thats not exactly charitable nollie  you know theyre not i think sin often just means doing things differently its not real sin when it only hurts yourself but that doesnt prevent people condemning you does it  i dont know what you mean nollie  noel bit her lips and murmured are you sure were really christians daddy  the question was so startling from his own daughter that pierson took refuge in an attempt at wit i should like notice of that question nollie as they say in parliament  that means you dont  pierson flushed were fallible enough but dont get such ideas into your head my child theres a lot of rebellious talk and writing in these days  noel clasped her hands behind her head i think she said looking straight before her and speaking to the air that christianity is what you do not what you think or say and i dont believe people can be christians when they act like othersi mean when they join together to judge and hurt people  pierson rose and paced the room you have not seen enough of life to talk like that he said but noel went on  one of the men in her hospital told gratian about the treatment of conscientious objectorsit was horrible why do they treat them like that just because they disagree captain fort says its fear which makes people bullies but how can it be fear when theyre hundreds to one he says man has domesticated his animals but has never succeeded in domesticating himself man must be a wild beast you know or the world couldnt be so awfully brutal i dont see much difference between being brutal for good reasons and being brutal for bad ones  pierson looked down at her with a troubled smile there was something fantastic to him in this sudden philosophising by one whom he had watched grow up from a tiny thing out of the mouths of babes and sucklingssometimes but then the young generation was always something of a sealed book to him his sensitive shyness and still more his cloth placed a sort of invisible barrier between him and the hearts of others especially the young there were so many things of which he was compelled to disapprove or which at least he couldnt discuss and they knew it too well until these last few months he had never realised that his own daughters had remained as undiscovered by him as the interior of brazil and now that he perceived this he was bewildered yet could not imagine how to get on terms with them  and he stood looking at noel intensely puzzled suspecting nothing of the hard fact which was altering hervaguely jealous anxious pained and when she had gone up to bed he roamed up and down the room a long time thinking he longed for a friend to confide in and consult but he knew no one he shrank from them all as too downright bluff and active too worldly and unaesthetic or too stiff and narrow amongst the younger men in his profession he was often aware of faces which attracted him but one could not confide deep personal questions to men half ones age but of his own generation or his elders he knew not one to whom he could have gone     viii   leila was deep in her new draught of life when she fell in love it had always been over head and ears and so far her passion had always burnt itself out before that of her partner this had been of course a great advantage to her not that leila had ever expected her passions to burn themselves out when she fell in love she had always thought it was for always this time she was sure it was surer than she had ever been jimmy fort seemed to her the man she had been looking for all her life he was not so goodlooking as either farie or lynch but beside him these others seemed to her now almost ridiculous indeed they did not figure at all they shrank they withered they were husks together with the others for whom she had known passing weaknesses there was only one man in the world for her now and would be for evermore she did not idealise him either it was more serious than that she was thrilled by his voice and his touch she dreamed of him longed for him when he was not with her she worried too for she was perfectly aware that he was not half as fond of her as she was of him such a new experience puzzled her kept her instincts painfully on the alert it was perhaps just this uncertainty about his affection which made him seem more precious than any of the others but there was ever the other reason tooconsciousness that time was after her and this her last grand passion she watched him as a mothercat watches her kitten without seeming to of course for she had much experience she had begun to have a curious secret jealousy of noel though why she could not have said it was perhaps merely incidental to her age or sprang from that vague resemblance between her and one who outrivalled even what she had been as a girl or from the occasional allusions fort made to what he called that little fairy princess something intangible instinctive gave her that jealousy until the death of her young cousins lover she had felt safe for she knew that jimmy fort would not hanker after another mans property had he not proved that in old days with herself by running away from her and she had often regretted having told him of cyril morlands death one day she determined to repair that error it was at the zoo where they often went on sunday afternoons they were standing before a creature called the meercat which reminded them both of old days on the veldt without turning her head she said as if to the little animal do you know that your fairy princess as you call her is going to have what is known as a warbaby  the sound of his what gave her quite a stab it was so utterly horrified  she said stubbornly she came and told me all about it the boy is dead as you know yes terrible isnt it and she looked at him his face was almost comic so wrinkled up with incredulity  that lovely child but its impossible  the impossible is sometimes true jimmy  i refuse to believe it  i tell you it is so she said angrily  what a ghastly shame  it was her own doing she said so herself  and her fatherthe padre my god  leila was suddenly smitten with a horrible doubt she had thought it would disgust him cure him of any little tendency to romanticise that child and now she perceived that it was rousing in him instead a dangerous compassion she could have bitten her tongue out for having spoken when he got on the high horse of some championship he was not to be trusted she had found that out was even finding it out bitterly in her own relations with him constantly aware that half her hold on him at least lay in his sense of chivalry aware that he knew her lurking dread of being flung on the beach by age only ten minutes ago he had uttered a tirade before the cage of a monkey which seemed unhappy and now she had roused that dangerous side of him in favour of noel what an idiot she had been  dont look like that jimmy im sorry i told you  his hand did not answer her pressure in the least but he muttered  well i do think thats the limit whats to be done for her  leila answered softly nothing im afraid do you love me and she pressed his hand hard  of course  but leila thought if i were that meercat hed have taken more notice of my paw her heart began suddenly to ache and she walked on to the next cage with head up and her mouth hard set  jimmy fort walked away from camelot mansions that evening in extreme discomfort of mind leila had been so queer that he had taken leave immediately after supper she had refused to talk about noel had even seemed angry when he had tried to how extraordinary some women were did they think that a man could hear of a thing like that about such a dainty young creature without being upset it was the most perfectly damnable news what on earth would she dopoor little fairy princess down had come her house of cards with a vengeance the whole of her lifethe whole of her life with her bringingup and her father and allit seemed inconceivable that she could ever survive it and leila had been almost callous about the monstrous business women were hard to each other bad enough these things when it was a simple working girl but this dainty sheltered beautiful child no it was altogether too strongtoo painful and following an impulse which he could not resist he made his way to the old square but having reached the house he nearly went away again while he stood hesitating with his hand on the bell a girl and a soldier passed appearing as if by magic out of the moonlit november mist blurred and solid shapes embraced then vanished into it again leaving the sound of footsteps fort jerked the bell he was shown into what seemed to one coming out of that mist to be a brilliant crowded room though in truth there were but two lamps and five people in it they were sitting round the fire talking and paused when he came in when he had shaken hands with pierson and been introduced to my daughter gratian and a man in khaki my soninlaw george laird to a tall thinfaced foreignlooking man in a black stock and seemingly no collar he went up to noel who had risen from a chair before the fire no he thought ive dreamed it or leila has lied she was so perfectly the selfpossessed dainty maiden he remembered even the feel of her hand was the samewarm and confident and sinking into a chair he said please go on and let me chip in  we were quarrelling about the universe captain fort said the man in khaki delighted to have your help i was just saying that this particular world has no particular importance no more than a newspaperseller would accord to it if it were completely destroyed tomorroworrible catastrophe total destruction of the worldsix oclock editionpyper i say that it will become again the nebula out of which it was formed and by friction with other nebula reform into a fresh shape and so on ad infinitumbut i cant explain why my wife wonders if it exists at all except in the human mindbut she cant explain what the human mind is my fatherinlaw thinks that it is gods hobbybut he cant explain who or what god is nollie is silent and monsieur lavendie hasnt yet told us what he thinks what do you think monsieur the thinfaced bigeyed man put up his hand to his high veined brow as if he had a headache reddened and began to speak in french which fort followed with difficulty  for me the universe is a limitless artist monsieur who from all time and to all time is ever expressing himself in differing formsalways trying to make a masterpiece and generally failing for me this world and all the worlds are like ourselves and the flowers and treeslittle separate works of art more or less perfect whose little lives run their course and are spilled or powdered back into this creative artist whence issue ever fresh attempts at art i agree with monsieur laird if i understand him right but i agree also with madame laird if i understand her you see i think mind and matter are one or perhaps there is no such thing as either mind or matter only growth and decay and growth again for ever and ever but always conscious growthan artist expressing himself in millions of everchanging forms decay and death as we call them being but rest and sleep the ebbing of the tide which must ever come between two rising tides or the night which comes between two days but the next day is never the same as the day before nor the tide as the last tide so the little shapes of the world and of ourselves these works of art by the eternal artist are never renewed in the same form are never twice alike but always freshfresh worlds fresh individuals fresh flowers fresh everything i do not see anything depressing in that to me it would be depressing to think that i would go on living after death or live again in a new body myself yet not myself how stale that would be when i finish a picture it is inconceivable to me that this picture should ever become another picture or that one can divide the expression from the mindstuff it has expressed the great artist who is the whole of everything is ever in fresh effort to achieve new things he is as a fountain who throws up new drops no two ever alike which fall back into the water flow into the pipe and so are thrown up again in freshshaped drops but i cannot explain why there should be this eternal energy ever expressing itself in fresh individual shapes this eternal working artist instead of nothing at alljust empty dark for always except indeed that it must be one thing or the other either all or nothing and it happens to be this and not that the all and not the nothing  he stopped speaking and his big eyes which had fixed themselves on forts face seemed to the latter not to be seeing him at all but to rest on something beyond the man in khaki who had risen and was standing with his hand on his wifes shoulder said  bravo monsieur jolly well put from the artists point of view the idea is pretty anyway but is there any need for an idea at all things are and we have just to take them fort had the impression of something dark and writhing the thin black form of his host who had risen and come close to the fire  i cannot admit he was saying the identity of the creator with the created god exists outside ourselves nor can i admit that there is no defnite purpose and fulfilment all is shaped to his great ends i think we are too given to spiritual pride the world has lost reverence i regret it i bitterly regret it  i rejoice at it said the man in khaki now captain fort your turn to bat  fort who had been looking at noel gave himself a shake and said i think what monsieur calls expression i call fighting i suspect the universe of being simply a long fight a sum of conquests and defeats conquests leading to defeats defeats to conquests i want to win while im alive and because i want to win i want to live on after death death is a defeat i dont want to admit it while i have that instinct i dont think i shall really die when i lose it i think i shall he was conscious of noels face turning towards him but had the feeling that she wasnt really listening i suspect that what we call spirit is just the fighting instinct that what we call matter is the mood of lying down whether as mr pierson says god is outside us or as monsieur thinks we are all part of god i dont know im sure  ah there we are said the man in khaki we all speak after our temperaments and none of us know the religions of the world are just the poetic expressions of certain strongly marked temperaments monsieur was a poet just now and his is the only temperament which has never yet been rammed down the worlds throat in the form of religion go out and proclaim your views from the housetops monsieur and see what happens  the painter shook his head with a smile which seemed to fort very bright on the surface and very sad underneath  non monsieur he said the artist does not wish to impose his temperament difference of temperament is the very essence of his joy and his belief in life without difference there would be no life for him tout casse tout lasse but change goes on for ever we artists reverence change monsieur we reverence the newness of each morning of each night of each person of each expression of energy nothing is final for us we are eager for all and always for more we are in love you see even withdeath  there was a silence then fort heard pierson murmur  that is beautiful monsieur but oh how wrong and what do you think nollie said the man in khaki suddenly the girl had been sitting very still in her low chair with her hands crossed in her lap her eyes on the fire and the lamplight shining down on her fair hair she looked up startled and her eyes met forts  i dont know i wasnt listening something moved in him a kind of burning pity a rage of protection he said quickly  these are times of action philosophy seems to mean nothing nowadays the one thing is to hate tyranny and cruelty and protect everything thats weak and lonely its all thats left to make life worth living when all the packs of all the world are out for blood  noel was listening now and he went on fervently why even we who started out to fight this prussian pack have caught the pack feelingso that its hunting all over the country on every sort of scent its a most infectious thing  i cannot see that we are being infected captain fort  im afraid we are mr pierson the great majority of people are always inclined to run with the hounds the pressures great just now the pack spirits in the air  pierson shook his head no i cannot see it he repeated it seems to me that we are all more brotherly and more tolerant  ah monsieur le cure fort heard the painter say very gently it is difficult for a good man to see the evil round him there are those whom the worlds march leaves apart and reality cannot touch they walk with god and the bestialities of us animals are fantastic to them the spirit of the pack as monsieur says is in the air i see all human nature now running with gaping mouths and red tongues lolling out their breath and their cries spouting thick before them on whom they will fall nextone never knows the innocent with the guilty perhaps if you were to see some one dear to you devoured before your eyes monsieur le cure you would feel it too and yet i do not know  fort saw noel turn her face towards her father her expression at that moment was very strange searching half frightened no leila had not lied and he had not dreamed that thing was true  when presently he took his leave and was out again in the square he could see nothing but her face and form before him in the moonlight its soft outline fair colouring slender delicacy and the brooding of the big grey eyes he had already crossed new oxford street and was some way down towards the strand when a voice behind him murmured ah cest vous monsieur and the painter loomed up at his elbow  are you going my way said fort i go slowly im afraid  the slower the better monsieur london is so beautiful in the dark it is the despair of the painterthese moonlit nights there are moments when one feels that reality does not exist all is in dreamslike the face of that young lady  fort stared sharply round at him oh she strikes you like that does she  ah what a charming figure what an atmosphere of the past and future round her and she will not let me paint her well perhaps only mathieu maris he raised his broad bohemian hat and ran his fingers through his hair  yes said fort shed make a wonderful picture im not a judge of art but i can see that  the painter smiled and went on in his rapid french  she has youth and age all at oncethat is rare her father is an interesting man too i am trying to paint him he is very difficult he sits lost in some kind of vacancy of his own a man whose soul has gone before him somewhere like that of his church escaped from this age of machines leaving its body behindis it not he is so kind a saint i think the other clergymen i see passing in the street are not at all like him they look buttonedup and busy with faces of men who might be schoolmasters or lawyers or even soldiersmen of this world do you know this monsieurit is ironical but it is true i think a man cannot be a successful priest unless he is a man of this world i do not see any with that look of monsieur pierson a little tortured within and not quite present he is half an artist really a lover of music that man i am painting him at the piano when he is playing his face is alive but even then so far away to me monsieur he is exactly like a beautiful church which knows it is being deserted i find him pathetic je suis socialiste but i have always an aesthetic admiration for that old church which held its children by simple emotion the times have changed it can no longer hold them so it stands in the dusk with its spire to a heaven which exists no more its bells still beautiful but out of tune with the music of the streets it is something of that which i wish to get into my picture of monsieur pierson and sapristi it is difficult fort grunted assent so far as he could make out the painters words it seemed to him a large order  to do it you see went on the painter one should have the proper backgroundthese currents of modern life and modern types passing him and leaving him untouched there is no illusion and no dreaming in modern life look at this street la la  in the darkened strand hundreds of khakiclad figures and girls were streaming by and all their voices had a hard halfjovial vulgarity the motorcabs and buses pushed along remorselessly newspapersellers muttered their ceaseless invitations again the painter made his gesture of despair how am i to get into my picture this modern life which washes round him as round that church there standing in the middle of the street see how the currents sweep round it as if to wash it away yet it stands seeming not to see them if i were a phantasist it would be easy enough but to be a phantasist is too simple for methose romantic gentlemen bring what they like from anywhere to serve their ends moi je suis realiste and so monsieur i have invented an idea i am painting over his head while he sits there at the piano a picture hanging on the wallof one of these young town girls who have no mysteriousness at all no youth nothing but a cheap knowledge and defiance and good humour he is looking up at it but he does not see it i will make the face of that girl the face of modern life and he shall sit staring at it seeing nothing what do you think of my idea  but fort had begun to feel something of the revolt which the man of action so soon experiences when he listens to an artist talking  it sounds all right he said abruptly all the same monsieur all my sympathy is with modern life take these young girls and these tommies for all their featherpated vulgarity and they are damned vulgar i must saytheyre marvellous people they do take the rough with the smooth theyre all doing their bit you know and facing this particularly beastly world aesthetically i daresay theyre deplorable but can you say that on the whole their philosophy isnt an advance on anything weve had up till now they worship nothing its true but they keep their ends up marvellously  the painter who seemed to feel the wind blowing cold on his ideas shrugged his shoulders  i am not concerned with that monsieur i set down what i see better or worse i do not know but look at this and he pointed down the darkened and moonlit street it was all jewelled and enamelled with little spots and splashes of subdued red and greenblue light and the downward orange glow of the high lampslike an enchanted dreamstreet peopled by countless moving shapes which only came to earthreality when seen close to the painter drew his breath in with a hiss  ah he said what beauty and they dont see itnot one in a thousand pity isnt it beauty is the holy thing  fort in his turn shrugged his shoulders every man to his vision he said my legs beginning to bother me im afraid i must take a cab heres my address any time you like to come im often in about seven i cant take you anywhere i suppose  a thousand thanks monsieur but i go north i loved your words about the pack i often wake at night and hear the howling of all the packs of the world those who are by nature gentle nowadays feel they are strangers in a far land good night monsieur  he took off his queer hat bowed low and crossed out into the strand like one who had come in a dream and faded out with the waking fort hailed a cab and went home still seeing noels face there was one if you liked waiting to be thrown to the wolves waiting for the worlds pack to begin howling round herthat lovely child and the first the loudest of all the pack perhaps must be her own father the lean dark figure with the gentle face and the burnt bright eyes what a ghastly business his dreams that night were not such as leila would have approved     ix  when in the cupboard there is a real and very bony skeleton carefully kept from the sight of a single member of the family the position of that member is liable to become lonely but pierson who had been lonely fifteen years did not feel it so much perhaps as most men would have in his dreamy nature there was a curious selfsufficiency which only violent shocks disturbed and he went on with his routine of duty which had become for him as set as the pavements he trod on his way to and from it it was not exactly true as the painter had said that this routine did not bring him into touch with life after all he saw people when they were born when they married when they died he helped them when they wanted money and when they were ill he told their children bible stories on sunday afternoons he served those who were in need with soup and bread from his soup kitchen he never spared himself in any way and his ears were always at the service of their woes and yet he did not understand them and they knew that it was as though he or they were colourblind the values were all different he was seeing one set of objects they another  one street of his parish touched a main line of thoroughfare and formed a little part of the new huntinggrounds of women who chased forth from their usual haunts by the authorities under pressure of the countrys danger now pursued their calling in the dark this particular evil had always been a sort of nightmare to pierson the starvation which ruled his own existence inclined him to a particularly severe view and severity was not his strong point in consequence there was ever within him a sort of very personal and poignant struggle going on beneath that seeming attitude of rigid disapproval he joined the hunters as it were because he was afraidnot of course of his own instincts for he was fastidious a gentleman and a priest but of being lenient to a sin to something which god abhorred he was as it were bound to take a professional view of this particular offence when in his walks abroad he passed one of these women he would unconsciously purse his lips and frown the darkness of the streets seemed to lend them such power such unholy sovereignty over the night they were such a danger to the soldiers too and in turn the soldiers were such a danger to the lambs of his flock domestic disasters in his parish came to his ears from time to time cases of young girls whose heads were turned by soldiers so that they were about to become mothers they seemed to him pitiful indeed but he could not forgive them for their giddiness for putting temptation in the way of brave young men fighting or about to fight the glamour which surrounded soldiers was not excuse enough when the babies were born and came to his notice he consulted a committee he had formed of three married and two maiden ladies who visited the mothers and if necessary took the babies into a creche for those babies had a new value to the country and were notpoor little thingsto be held responsible for their mothers faults he himself saw little of the young mothers shy of them secretly afraid perhaps of not being censorious enough but once in a way life set him face to face with one  on new years eve he was sitting in his study after tea at that hour which he tried to keep for his parishioners when a mrs mitchett was announced a small booksellers wife whom he knew for an occasional communicant she came in accompanied by a young darkeyed girl in a loose mousecoloured coat at his invitation they sat down in front of the long bookcase on the two green leather chairs which had grown worn in the service of the parish and screwed round in his chair at the bureau with his long musicians fingers pressed together he looked at them and waited the woman had taken out her handkerchief and was wiping her eyes but the girl sat quiet as the mouse she somewhat resembled in that coat  yes mrs mitchett he said gently at last  the woman put away her handkerchief sniffed resolutely and began  its ilda sir such a thing mitchett and me never could ave expected comin on us so sudden i thought it best to bring er round poor girl of course its all the war ive warned er a dozen times but there it is comin next month and the man in france pierson instinctively averted his gaze from the girl who had not moved her eyes from his face which she scanned with a seeming absence of interest as if she had long given up thinking over her lot and left it now to others  that is sad he said very very sad  yes murmured mrs mitchett thats what i tell ilda  the girls glance lowered for a second resumed its impersonal scrutiny of piersons face  what is the mans name and regiment perhaps we can get leave for him to come home and marry hilda at once  mrs mitchett sniffed she wont give it sir now ilda give it to mr pierson and her voice had a real note of entreaty the girl shook her head mrs mitchett murmured dolefully thats ow she is sir not a word will she say and as i tell her we can only think there must ave been more than one and that does put us to shame so  but still the girl made no sign  you speak to her sir im really at my wits end  why wont you tell us said pierson the man will want to do the right thing im sure  the girl shook her head and spoke for the first time  i dont know his name  mrs mitchetts face twitched  oh dear she said think of that shes never said as much to us  not know his name pierson murmured but howhow could you he stopped but his face had darkened surely you would never have done such a thing without affection come tell me  i dont know it the girl repeated  its these parks said mrs mitchett from behind her handkerchief and to think that thisll be our first grandchild and all ilda is difficult as quiet as quiet but that stubborn  pierson looked at the girl who seemed if anything less interested than ever this impenetrability and something mulish in her attitude annoyed him i cant think he said how you could so have forgotten yourself its truly grievous  mrs mitchett murmured yes sir the girls gets it into their heads that theres going to be no young men for them  thats right said the girl sullenly  piersons lips grew tighter well what can i do for you mrs mitchett he said does your daughter come to church  mrs mitchett shook her head mournfully never since she had her byke  pierson rose from his chair the old story control and discipline undermined and these bitter apples the result  well he said if you need our creche you have only to come to me and he turned to the girl and youwont you let this dreadful experience move your heart my dear girl we must all master ourselves our passions and our foolish wilfulness especially in these times when our country needs us strong and selfdisciplined not thinking of ourselves im sure youre a good girl at heart  the girls dark eyes unmoved from his face roused in him a spasm of nervous irritation your soul is in great danger and youre very unhappy i can see turn to god for help and in his mercy everything will be made so different for youso very different come  the girl said with a sort of surprising quietness i dont want the baby  the remark staggered him almost as if she had uttered a hideous oath  ilda was in munitions said her mother in an explanatory voice earnin a matter of four pound a week oh dear it is a waste an all a queer rather terrible little smile curled piersons lips  a judgment he said good evening mrs mitchett good evening hilda if you want me when the time comes send for me  they stood up he shook hands with them and was suddenly aware that the door was open and noel standing there he had heard no sound and how long she had been there he could not tell there was a singular fixity in her face and attitude she was staring at the girl who as she passed lifted her face so that the dark eyes and the grey eyes met the door was shut and noel stood there alone with him  arent you early my child said pierson you came in very quietly  yes i heard  a slight shock went through him at the tone of her voice her face had that possessed look which he always dreaded what did you hear he said  i heard you say a judgment youll say the same to me wont you only i do want my baby  she was standing with her back to the door over which a dark curtain hung her face looked young and small against its stuff her eyes very large with one hand she plucked at her blouse just over her heart  pierson stared at her and gripped the back of the chair he had been sitting in a lifetime of repression served him in the halfrealised horror of that moment he stammered out the single word  nollie  its quite true she said turned round and went out  pierson had a sort of vertigo if he had moved he must have fallen down nollie he slid round and sank into his chair and by some horrible cruel fiction of his nerves he seemed to feel noel on his knee as when a little girl she had been wont to sit with her fair hair fluffing against his cheek he seemed to feel that hair tickling his skin it used to be the greatest comfort he had known since her mother died at that moment his pride shrivelled like a flower held to a flame all that abundant secret pride of a father who loves and admires who worships still a dead wife in the children she has left him who humble by nature yet never knows how proud he is till the bitter thing happens all the long pride of the priest who by dint of exhortation and remonstrance has coated himself in a superiority he hardly suspectsall this pride shrivelled in him then something writhed and cried within as a tortured beast cries at loss to know why it is being tortured how many times has not a man used those words my god my god why hast thou forsaken me he sprang up and tried to pace his way out of this cage of confusion his thoughts and feelings made the strangest medley spiritual and worldlysocial ostracismher soul in perila trial sent by god the future imagination failed him he went to his little piano opened it closed it again took his hat and stole out he walked fast without knowing where it was very colda clear bitter evening silent rapid motion in the frosty air was some relief as noel had fled from him having uttered her news so did he fly from her the afflicted walk fast he was soon down by the river and turned west along its wall the moon was up bright and nearly full and the steellike shimmer of its light burnished the ebbing water a cruel night he came to the obelisk and leaned against it overcome by a spasm of realisation he seemed to see his dead wifes face staring at him out of the past like an accusation how have you cared for nollie that she should have come to this it became the face of the moonlit sphinx staring straight at him the broad dark face with wide nostrils cruel lips full eyes blank of pupils all livened and whitened by the moonlightan embodiment of the marvellous unseeing energy of life twisting and turning hearts without mercy he gazed into those eyes with a sort of scared defiance the great clawed paws of the beast the strength and remorseless serenity of that crouching creature with human head made living by his imagination and the moonlight seemed to him like a temptation to deny god like a refutation of human virtue  then the sense of beauty stirred in him he moved where he could see its flanks coated in silver by the moonlight the ribs and the great muscles and the tail with tip coiled over the haunch like the head of a serpent it was weirdly living fine and cruel that great manmade thing it expressed something in the soul of man pitiless and remote from loveor rather the remorselessness which man had seen lurking within mans fate pierson recoiled from it and resumed his march along the embankment almost deserted in the bitter cold he came to where in the opening of the underground railway he could see the little forms of people moving little orange and red lights glowing the sight arrested him by its warmth and motion was it not all a dream that woman and her daughter had they really come had not noel been but an apparition her words a trick which his nerves had played him then too vividly again he saw her face against the dark stuff of the curtain the curve of her hand plucking at her blouse heard the sound of his own horrified nollie no illusion no deception the edifice of his life was in the dust and a queer and ghastly company of faces came about him faces he had thought friendly of good men and women whom he knew yet at that moment did not know all gathered round noel with fingers pointing at her he staggered back from that vision could not bear it could not recognise this calamity with a sort of comfort yet an aching sense of unreality his mind flew to all those summer holidays spent in scotland ireland cornwall wales by mountain and lake with his two girls what sunsets and turning leaves birds beasts and insects they had watched together from their youthful companionship their eagerness their confidence in him he had known so much warmth and pleasure if all those memories were true surely this could not be true he felt suddenly that he must hurry back go straight to noel tell her that she had been cruel to him or assure himself that for the moment she had been insane his temper rose suddenly took fire he felt anger against her against every one he knew against life itself thrusting his hands deep into the pockets of his thin black overcoat he plunged into that narrow glowing tunnel of the station bookingoffice which led back to the crowded streets but by the time he reached home his anger had evaporated he felt nothing but utter lassitude it was nine oclock and the maids had cleared the dining table in despair noel had gone up to her room he had no courage left and sat down supperless at his little piano letting his fingers find soft painful harmonies so that noel perhaps heard the faint far thrumming of that music through uneasy dreams and there he stayed till it became time for him to go forth to the old years midnight service  when he returned pierson wrapped himself in a rug and lay down on the old sofa in his study the maid coming in next morning to do the grate found him still asleep she stood contemplating him in awe a broadfaced kindly freshcoloured girl he lay with his face resting on his hand his dark just grizzling hair unruffled as if he had not stirred all night his other hand clutched the rug to his chest and his booted feet protruded beyond it to her young eyes he looked rather appallingly neglected she gazed with interest at the hollows in his cheeks and the furrows in his brow and the lips darkmoustached and bearded so tightly compressed even in sleep being holy didnt make a man happy it seemed what fascinated her were the cindery eyelashes resting on the cheeks the faint movement of face and body as he breathed the gentle hiss of breath escaping through the twitching nostrils she moved nearer bending down over him with the childlike notion of counting those lashes her lips parted in readiness to say oh if he waked something in his face and the little twitches which passed over it made her feel that sorry for him he was a gentleman had money preached to her every sunday and was not so very oldwhat more could a man want and yethe looked so tired with those cheeks  she pitied him helpless and lonely he seemed to her asleep there instead of going to bed properly and sighing she tiptoed towards the door  is that you bessie  the girl turned yes sir im sorry i woke you sir appy new year sir  ah yes a happy new year bessie  she saw his usual smile saw it die and a fixed look come on his face it scared her and she hurried away pierson had remembered for full five minutes he lay there staring at nothing then he rose folded the rug mechanically and looked at the clock eight he went upstairs knocked on noels door and entered  the blinds were drawn up but she was still in bed he stood looking down at her a happy new year my child he said and he trembled all over shivering visibly she looked so young and innocent so roundfaced and fresh after her nights sleep that the thought sprang up in him again it must have been a dream she did not move but a slow flush came up in her cheeks no dreamdream he said tremulously i cant realise ii hoped i had heard wrong didnt i nollie didnt i  she just shook her head  tell meeverything he said for gods sake  he saw her lips moving and caught the murmur there s nothing more gratian and george know and leila it cant be undone daddy perhaps i wouldnt have wanted to make sure if you hadnt tried to stop cyril and meand im glad sometimes because i shall have something of his she looked up at him after all its the same really only theres no ring its no good talking to me now as if i hadnt been thinking of this for ages im used to anything you can say ive said it to myself you see theres nothing but to make the best of it  her hot hand came out from under the bedclothes and clutched his very tight her flush had deepened and her eyes seemed to him to glitter  oh daddy you do look tired havent you been to bed poor daddy  that hot clutch and the words poor daddy brought tears into his eyes they rolled slowly down to his beard and he covered his face with the other hand her grip tightened convulsively suddenly she dragged it to her lips kissed it and let it drop  dont she said and turned away her face  pierson effaced his emotion and said quite calmly  shall you wish to be at home my dear or to go elsewhere  noel had begun to toss her head on her pillow like a feverish child whose hair gets in its eyes and mouth  oh i dont know what does it matter  kestrel would you like to go there your aunti could write to her noel stared at him a moment a struggle seemed going on within her  yes she said i would only not uncle bob  perhaps your uncle would come up here and keep me company  she turned her face away and that tossing movement of the limbs beneath the clothes began again i dont care she said anywhereit doesnt matter  pierson put his chilly hand on her forehead gently he said and knelt down by the bed merciful father he murmured give us strength to bear this dreadful trial keep my beloved child safe and bring her peace and give me to understand how i have done wrong how i have failed towards thee and her in all things chasten and strengthen her my child and me  his thoughts moved on in the confused inarticulate suspense of prayer till he heard her say you havent failed why do you talk of failingit isnt true and dont pray for me daddy  pierson raised himself and moved back from the bed her words confounded him yet he was afraid to answer she pushed her head deep into the pillow and lay looking up at the ceiling  i shall have a son cyril wont quite have died and i dont want to be forgiven  he dimly perceived what long dumb processes of thought and feeling had gone on in her to produce this hardened state of mind which to him seemed almost blasphemous and in the very midst of this turmoil in his heart he could not help thinking how lovely her face looked lying back so that the curve of her throat was bared with the short tendrils of hair coiling about it that flungback head moving restlessly from side to side in the heat of the soft pillow had such a passion of protesting life in it and he kept silence  i want you to know it was all me but i cant pretend of course ill try and not let it hurt you more than i possibly can im sorry for you poor daddy oh im sorry for you with a movement incredibly lithe and swift she turned and pressed her face down in the pillow so that all he could see was her tumbled hair and the bedclothes trembling above her shoulders he tried to stroke that hair but she shook her head free and he stole out  she did not come to breakfast and when his own wretched meal was over the mechanism of his professional life caught him again at once new years day he had much to do he had before all to be of a cheerful countenance before his flock to greet all and any with an air of hope and courage     x  1  thirza pierson seeing her brotherinlaws handwriting naturally said heres a letter from ted  bob pierson with a mouth full of sausage as naturally responded  what does he say  in reading on she found that to answer that question was one of the most difficult tasks ever set her its news moved and disturbed her deeply under her wing this disaster had happened down here had been wrought this most deplorable miracle fraught with such dislocation of lives noels face absorbed and passionate outside the door of her room on the night when cyril morland went awayher instinct had been right  he wants you to go up and stay with him bob  why not both of us  he wants nollie to come down to me shes not well  not well whats the matter  to tell him seemed disloyalty to her sex not to tell him disloyalty to her husband a simple consideration of fact and not of principle decided her he would certainly say in a moment here pitch it over and she would have to she said tranquilly  you remember that night when cyril morland went away and noel behaved so strangely well my dear she is going to have a child at the beginning of april the poor boy is dead bob he died for the country  she saw the red tide flow up into his face  what  poor edward is dreadfully upset we must do what we can i blame myself by instinct she used those words  blame yourself stuff that young he stopped  thirza said quietly no bob of the two im sure it was noel she was desperate that day dont you remember her face oh this war its turned the whole world upside down thats the only comfort nothings normal  bob pierson possessed beyond most men the secret of happiness for he was always absorbed in the moment to the point of unselfconsciousness eating an egg cutting down a tree sitting on a tribunal making up his accounts planting potatoes looking at the moon riding his cob reading the lessonsno part of him stood aside to see how he was doing it or wonder why he was doing it or not doing it better he grew like a corktree and acted like a sturdy and wellnatured dog his griefs angers and enjoyments were simple as a childs or as his somewhat noisy slumbers they were notably wellsuited for thirza had the same secret of happiness though her absorption in the moment did notas became a womanprevent her being conscious of others indeed such formed the chief subject of her absorptions one might say that they neither of them had philosophy yet were as philosophic a couple as one could meet on this earth of the selfconscious daily life to these two was still of simple savour to be absorbed in lifethe queer endless tissue of moments and things felt and done and said and made the odd inspiriting conjunctions of countless peoplewas natural to them but they never thought whether they were absorbed or not or had any particular attitude to life or deatha great blessing at the epoch in which they were living  bob pierson then paced the room so absorbed in his dismay and concern that he was almost happy  by jove he said what a ghastly thing  nollie of all people i feel perfectly wretched thirza wretched beyond words but with each repetition his voice grew cheerier and thirza felt that he was already over the worst  your coffees getting cold she said  what do you advise shall i go up heh  i think youll be a godsend to poor ted youll keep his spirits up eve wont get any leave till easter and i can be quite alone and see to nollie here the servants can have a holiday nurse and i will run the house together i shall enjoy it  youre a good woman thirza taking his wifes hand he put it to his lips there isnt another woman like you in the world  thirzas eyes smiled pass me your cup ill give you some fresh coffee  it was decided to put the plan into operation at midmonth and she bent all her wits to instilling into her husband the thought that a baby more or less was no great matter in a world which already contained twelve hundred million people with a mans keener sense of family propriety he could not see that this baby would be the same as any other baby by heaven he would say i simply cant get used to it in our family and ted a parson what the devil shall we do with it  if nollie will let us why shouldnt we adopt it itll be something to take my thoughts off the boys  thats an idea but teds a funny fellow hell have some doctrine of atonement or other in his bonnet  oh bother said thirza with asperity  the thought of sojourning in town for a spell was not unpleasant to bob pierson his tribunal work was over his early potatoes in and he had visions of working for the country of being a special constable and dining at his club the nearer he was to the front and the more he could talk about the war the greater the service he felt he would be doing he would ask for a job where his brains would be of use he regretted keenly that thirza wouldnt be with him a long separation like this would be a great trial and he would sigh and run his fingers through his whiskers still for the country and for nollie one must put up with it  when thirza finally saw him into the train tears stood in the eyes of both for they were honestly attached and knew well enough that this job once taken in hand would have to be seen through a three months separation at least  i shall write every day  so shall i bob  you wont fret old girl  only if you do  i shall be up at 55 and shell be down at 450 give us a kissdamn the porters god bless you i suppose shed mind ifiwere to come down now and then  im afraid she would itsitswell you know  yes yes i do and he really did for underneath he had true delicacy  her last words youre very sweet bob remained in his ears all the way to severn junction  she went back to the house emptied of her husband daughter boys and maids only the dogs left and the old nurse whom she had taken into confidence even in that sheltered wooded valley it was very cold this winter the birds hid themselves not one flower bloomed and the redbrown river was full and swift the sound of trees being felled for trench props in the wood above the house resounded all day long in the frosty air she meant to do the cooking herself and for the rest of the morning and early afternoon she concocted nice things and thought out how she herself would feel if she were noel and noel she so as to smooth out of the way anything which would hurt the girl in the afternoon she went down to the station in the village car the same which had borne cyril morland away that july night for their coachman had been taken for the army and the horses were turned out  noel looked tired and white but calmtoo calm her face seemed to thirza to have fined down and with those brooding eyes to be more beautiful in the car she possessed herself of the girls hand and squeezed it hard their only allusion to the situation except noels formal  thank you so much auntie for having me its most awfully sweet of you and uncle bob  theres no one in the house my dear except old nurse itll be very dull for you but i thought id teach you to cook its rather useful  the smile which slipped on to noels face gave thirza quite a turn  she had assigned the girl a different room and had made it extraordinarily cheerful with a log fire chrysanthemums bright copper candlesticks warmingpans and such like  she went up with her at bedtime and standing before the fire said  you know nollie i absolutely refuse to regard this as any sort of tragedy to bring life into the worlds in these days no matter how ought to make anyone happy i only wish i could do it again then i should feel some use good night dear and if you want anything knock on the wall im next door bless you she saw that the girl was greatly moved underneath her pale mask and went out astonished at her nieces powers of selfcontrol  but she did not sleep at all well for in imagination she kept on seeing noel turning from side to side in the big bed and those great eyes of hers staring at the dark   2  the meeting of the brothers pierson took place at the dinnerhour and was characterised by a truly english lack of display they were so extremely different and had been together so little since early days in their old buckinghamshire home that they were practically strangers with just the potent link of fardistant memories in common it was of these they talked and about the war on this subject they agreed in the large and differed in the narrow for instance both thought they knew about germany and other countries and neither of course had any real knowledge of any country outside their own for though both had passed through considerable tracts of foreign ground at one time or another they had never remarked anything except its surfaceits churches and its sunsets again both assumed that they were democrats but neither knew the meaning of the word nor felt that the working man could be really trusted and both revered church and king both disliked conscription but considered it necessary both favoured home rule for ireland but neither thought it possible to grant it both wished for the war to end but were for prosecuting it to victory and neither knew what they meant by that word so much for the large on the narrower issues such as strategy and the personality of their countrys leaders they were opposed edward was a westerner robert an easterner as was natural in one who had lived twentyfive years in ceylon edward favoured the fallen government robert the risen neither had any particular reasons for their partisanship except what he had read in the journals after allwhat other reasons could they have had edward disliked the harmsworth press robert thought it was doing good robert was explosive and rather vague edward dreamy and a little didactic robert thought poor ted looking like a ghost edward thought poor bob looking like the setting sun their faces were indeed as curiously contrasted as their views and voices the paledark hollowed narrow face of edward with its short pointed beard and the redskinned broad full whiskered face of robert they parted for the night with an affectionate handclasp so began a queer partnership which consisted as the days went on of half an hours companionship at breakfast each reading the paper and of dinner together perhaps three times a week each thought his brother very odd but continued to hold the highest opinion of him and behind it all the deep tribal sense that they stood together in trouble grew but of that trouble they never spoke though not seldom robert would lower his journal and above the glasses perched on his wellshaped nose contemplate his brother and a little frown of sympathy would ridge his forehead between his bushy eyebrows and once in a way he would catch edwards eyes coming off duty from his journal to look not at his brother but atthe skeleton when that happened robert would adjust his glasses hastily damn the newspaper type and apologise to edward for swearing and he would think poor ted he ought to drink port andand enjoy himself and forget it what a pity hes a parson  in his letters to thirza he would deplore edwards asceticism he eats nothing he drinks nothing he smokes a miserable cigarette once in a blue moon hes as lonely as a coot its a thousand pities he ever lost his wife i expect to see his wings sprout any day butdash it all ii dont believe hes got the flesh to grow them on send him up some clotted cream ill see if i can get him to eat it when the cream came he got edward to eat some the first morning and at tea time found that he had finished it himself we never talk about nollie he wrote im always meaning to have it out with him and tell him to buck up but when it comes to the point i dry up because after all i feel it too it sticks in my gizzard horribly we piersons are pretty old and weve always been respectable ever since st bartholomew when that huguenot chap came over and founded us the only black sheep i ever heard of is cousin leila by the way i saw her the other day she came round here to see ted i remember going to stay with her and her first husband young fane at simla when i was coming home just before we were married phew that was a queer menage all the young chaps fluttering round her and young fane looking like a cynical ghost even now she cant help setting her cap a little at ted and he swallows her whole thinks her a devoted creature reformed to the nines with her hospital and all that poor old ted he is the most dreamy chap that ever was  we have had gratian and her husband up for the weekend he wrote a little later i dont like her so well as nollie too serious and downright for me her husband seems a sensible fellow though but the devil of a freethinker he and poor ted are like cat and dog we had leila in to dinner again on saturday and a man called fort came too shes sweet on him i could see with half an eye but poor old ted cant the doctor and ted talked up hill and down dale the doctor said a thing which struck me what divides us from the beasts will power nothing else whats this war really but a death carnival of proof that mans will is invincible i stuck it down to tell you when i got upstairs hes a clever fellow i believe in god as you know but i must say when it comes to an argument poor old ted does seem a bit weak with his were told this and were told that nobody mentioned nollie i must have the whole thing out with ted we must know how to act when its all over  but not till the middle of march when the brothers had been sitting opposite each other at meals for two months was the subject broached between them and then not by robert edward standing by the hearth after dinner in his familiar attitude one foot on the fender one hand grasping the mantelshelf and his eyes fixed on the flames said ive never asked your forgiveness bob  robert lingering at the table over his glass of port started looked at edwards back in its parsons coat and answered  my dear old chap  it has been very difficult to speak of this  of course of course and there was a silence while roberts eyes travelled round the walls for inspiration they encountered only the effigies of past piersons very oily works and fell back on the diningtable edward went on speaking to the fire  it still seems to me incredible day and night i think of what its my duty to do  nothing ejaculated robert leave the baby with thirza well take care of it and when nollies fit let her go back to work in a hospital again shell soon get over it he saw his brother shake his head and thought ah yes now theres going to be some dd conscientious complication  edward turned round on him that is very sweet of you both but it would be wrong and cowardly for me to allow it  the resentment which springs up in fathers when other fathers dispose of young lives rose in robert  dash it all my dear ted thats for nollie to say shes a woman now remember  a smile went straying about in the shadows of his brothers face a woman little nollie bob ive made a terrible mess of it with my girls he hid his lips with his hand and turned again to the flames robert felt a lump in his throat oh hang it old boy i dont think that what else could you have done you take too much on yourself after all theyre fine girls im sure nollies a darling its these modern notions and this war cheer up itll all dry straight he went up to his brother and put a hand on his shoulder edward seemed to stiffen under that touch  nothing comes straight he said unless its faced you know that bob  roberts face was a study at that moment his cheeks filled and collapsed again like a dogs when it has been rebuked his colour deepened and he rattled some money in a trouser pocket  something in that of course he said gruffly all the same the decisions with nollie well see what thirza says anyway theres no hurry its a thousand pities youre a parson the troubles enough without that  edward shook his head my position is nothing its the thought of my child my wifes child its sheer pride and i cant subdue it i cant fight it down god forgive me i rebel  and robert thought by george he does take it to heart well so should i i do as it is he took out his pipe and filled it pushing the tobacco down and down  im not a man of the world he heard his brother say im out of touch with many things its almost unbearable to me to feel that im joining with the world to condemn my own daughter not for their reasons perhapsi dont know i hope not but still im against her  robert lit his pipe  steady old man he said its a misfortune but if i were you i should feel shes done a wild silly thing but hang it if anybody says a word against her ill wring his neck and whats more youll feel much the same when it comes to the point he emitted a huge puff of smoke which obscured his brothers face and the blood buzzing in his temples seemed to thicken the sound of edwards voice  i dont know ive tried to see clearly i have prayed to be shown what her duty is and mine it seems to me there can be no peace for her until she has atoned by open suffering that the worlds judgment is her cross and she must bear it especially in these days when all the world is facing suffering so nobly and then it seems so hardso bitter my poor little nollie  there was a silence broken only by the gurgling of roberts pipe till he said abruptly  i dont follow you ted no i dont i think a man should screen his children all he can talk to her as you like but dont let the world do it dash it the worlds a rotten gabbling place i call myself a man of the world but when it comes to private matterswell then i draw the line it seems to me it seems to me inhuman what does george laird think about it hes a knowing chap i suppose youveno i suppose you havent for a peculiar smile had come on edwards face  no he said i should hardly ask george lairds opinion  and robert realised suddenly the stubborn loneliness of that thin black figure whose fingers were playing with a little gold cross by jove he thought i believe old teds like one of those eastern chaps who go into lonely places hes got himself surrounded by visions of things that arent there he lives in unrealitysomething we cant understand i shouldnt be surprised if he heard voices likewho was it tt tt what a pity ted was deceptive he was gentle andall that a gentleman of course and that disguised him but underneath what was therea regular ascetic a fakir and a sense of bewilderment of dealing with something which he could not grasp beset bob pierson so that he went back to the table and sat down again beside his port  it seems to me he said rather gruffly that the chicken had better be hatched before we count it and then sorry for his brusqueness emptied his glass as the fluid passed over his palate he thought poor old ted he doesnt even drinkhasnt a pleasure in life so far as i can see except doing his duty and doesnt even seem to know what that is there arent many like himluckily and yet i love himpathetic chap  the pathetic chap was still staring at the flames 3  and at this very hour when the brothers were talkingfor thought and feeling do pass mysteriously over the invisible wires of space cyril morlands son was being born of noel a little before his time     part iii     i  down by the river wye among plumtrees in blossom noel had laid her baby in a hammock and stood reading a letter   my dearest nollie  now that you are strong again i feel that i must put before you my feeling as to your duty in this crisis of your life your aunt and uncle have made the most kind and generous offer to adopt your little boy i have known that this was in their minds for some time and have thought it over day and night for weeks in the worldly sense it would be the best thing no doubt but this is a spiritual matter the future of our souls depends on how we meet the consequences of our conduct and painful dreadful indeed as they must be i am driven to feel that you can only reach true peace by facing them in a spirit of brave humility i want you to think and thinktill you arrive at a certainty which satisfies your conscience if you decide as i trust you will to come back to me here with your boy i shall do all in my power to make you happy while we face the future together to do as your aunt and uncle in their kindness wish would i am sore afraid end in depriving you of the inner strength and happiness which god only gives to those who do their duty and try courageously to repair their errors i have confidence in you my dear child  ever your most loving father  edward pierson  she read it through a second time and looked at her baby daddy seemed to think that she might be willing to part from this wonderful creature sunlight fell through the plum blossom in an extra patchwork quilt over the bundle lying there touched the babys nose and mouth so that he sneezed noel laughed and put her lips close to his face give you up she thought oh no and im going to be happy too they shant stop me  in answer to the letter she said simply that she was coming up and a week later she went to the dismay of her uncle and aunt the old nurse went too everything had hitherto been so carefully watched and guarded against by thirza that noel did not really come face to face with her position till she reached home  gratian who had managed to get transferred to a london hospital was now living at home she had provided the house with new maids against her sisters return and though noel was relieved not to meet her old familiars she encountered with difficulty the stolid curiosity of new faces that morning before she left kestrel her aunt had come into her room while she was dressing taken her left hand and slipped a little gold band on to its third finger to please me nollie now that youre going just for the foolish who know nothing about you  noel had suffered it with the thought its all very silly but now when the new maid was pouring out her hot water she was suddenly aware of the girls round blue eyes wandering as it were mechanically to her hand this little hoop of gold then had an awful power a rush of disgust came over her all life seemed suddenly a thing of forms and sham everybody then would look at that little ring and she was a coward saving herself from them when she was alone again she slipped it off and laid it on the washstand where the sunlight fell only this little shining band of metal this little yellow ring stood between her and the worlds hostile scorn her lips trembled she took up the ring and went to the open window to throw it out but she did not uncertain and unhappyhalf realising the cruelty of life a knock at the door sent her flying back to the washstand the visitor was gratian  ive been looking at him she said softly hes like you nollie except for his nose  hes hardly got one yet but arent his eyes intelligent i think theyre wonderful she held up the ring what shall i do about this gratian  gratian flushed wear it i dont see why outsiders should know for the sake of dad i think you ought theres the parish  noel slipped the ring back on to her finger would you  i cant tell i think i would  noel laughed suddenly im going to get cynical i can feel it in my bones how is daddy looking  very thin mr lauder is back again from the front for a bit and taking some of the work now  do i hurt him very much still  hes awfully pleased that youve come hes as sweet as he can be about you  yes murmured noel thats whats dreadful im glad he wasnt in when i came has he told anyone  gratian shook her head i dont think anybody knows unlessperhaps captain fort he came in again the other night and somehow  noel flushed leila she said enigmatically have you seen her  i went to her flat last week with dadhe likes her  delilah is her real name you know all men like her and captain fort is her lover  gratian gasped noel would say things sometimes which made her feel the younger of the two  of course he is went on noel in a hard voice she has no men friends her sort never have only lovers why do you think he knows about me  when he asked after you he looked  yes ive seen him look like that when hes sorry for anything i dont care has monsieur lavendie been in lately  yes he looks awfully unhappy  his wife drugs  oh nollie how do you know  i saw her once im sure she does there was a smell and shes got wandering eyes that go all glassy he can paint me now if he likes i wouldnt let him before does he know  of course not  he knows there was something hes got second sight i think but i mind him less than anybody is his picture of daddy good  powerful but it hurts somehow  lets go down and see it  the picture was hung in the drawingroom and its intense modernity made that oldfashioned room seem lifeless and strange the black figure with long pale fingers touching the paler piano keys had a frightening actuality the face threequarters full was raised as if for inspiration and the eyes rested dreamy and unseeing on the face of a girl painted and hung on a background of wall above the piano  its the face of that girl said gratian when they had looked at the picture for some time in silence  no said noel its the look in his eyes  but why did he choose such a horrid common girl isnt she fearfully alive though she looks as if she were saying cheerio  she is its awfully pathetic i think poor daddy  its a libel said gratian stubbornly  no thats what hurts he isnt quitequite all there will he be coming in soon  gratian took her arm and pressed it hard would you like me at dinner or not i can easily be out  noel shook her head its no good to funk it he wanted me and now hes got me oh why did he itll be awful for him  gratian sighed ive tried my best but he always said ive thought so long about it all that i cant think any longer i can only feel the braver course is the best when things are bravely and humbly met there will be charity and forgiveness  there wont said noel daddys a saint and he doesnt see  yes he is a saint but one must think for oneselfone simply must i cant believe as he does any more can you nollie  i dont know when i was going through it i prayed but i dont know whether i really believed i dont think i mind much about that one way or the other  i mind terribly said gratian i want the truth  i dont know what i want said noel slowly except that sometimes i wantlife awfully  and the two sisters were silent looking at each other with a sort of wonder  noel had a fancy to put on a brightcoloured blue frock that evening and at her neck she hung a breton cross of old paste which had belonged to her mother when she had finished dressing she went into the nursery and stood by the babys cot the old nurse who was sitting there beside him got up at once and said  hes sleeping beautifulthe lamb ill go down and get a cup o tea and come up maam when the gong goes in the way peculiar to those who have never to initiate but only to support positions in which they are placed by others she had adopted for herself the theory that noel was a real warwidow she knew the truth perfectly for she had watched that hurried little romance at kestrel but by dint of charity and blurred meditations it was easy for her to imagine the marriage ceremony which would and should have taken place and she was zealous that other people should imagine it too it was so much more regular and natural like that and her baby invested with his proper dignity she went downstairs to get a cup o tea thinking a picture they makethat they do bless his little heart and his pretty little motherno more than a child all said and done  noel had been standing there some minutes in the failing light absorbed in the face of the sleeping baby when raising her eyes she saw in a mirror the refection of her fathers dark figure by the door she could hear him breathing as if the ascent of the stairs had tired him and moving to the head of the cot she rested her hand on it and turned her face towards him he came up and stood beside her looking silently down at the baby she saw him make the sign of the cross above it and the movement of his lips in prayer love for her father and rebellion against this intercession for her perfect baby fought so hard in the girls heart that she felt suffocated and glad of the dark so that he could not see her eyes then he took her hand and put it to his lips but still without a word and for the life of her she could not speak either in silence he kissed her forehead and there mounted in noel a sudden passion of longing to show him her pride and love for her baby she put her finger down and touched one of his hands the tiny sleeping fingers uncurled and like some little sea anemone clutched round it she heard her father draw his breath in saw him turn away quickly silently and go out and she stayed hardly breathing with the hand of her baby squeezing her finger     ii  1  when edward pierson afraid of his own emotion left the twilit nursery he slipped into his own room and fell on his knees beside his bed absorbed in the vision he had seen that young figure in madonna blue with the halo of bright hair the sleeping babe in the fine dusk the silence the adoration in that white room he saw too a vision of the past when noel herself had been the sleeping babe within her mothers arm and he had stood beside them wondering and giving praise it passed with its otherworldliness and the fine holiness which belongs to beauty passed and left the tormenting realism of life ah to live with only the inner meaning spiritual and beautifed in a rare wonderment such as he had experienced just now  his alarum clock while he knelt in his narrow monkish little roomticked the evening hour away into darkness and still he knelt dreading to come back into it all to face the worlds eyes and the sound of the worlds tongue and the touch of the rough the gross the unseemly how could he guard his child how preserve that vision in her life in her spirit about to enter such cold rough waters but the gong sounded he got up and went downstairs  but this first family moment which all had dreaded was relieved as dreaded moments so often are by the unexpected appearance of the belgian painter he had a general invitation of which he often availed himself but he was so silent and his thin beardless face which seemed all eyes and brow so mournful that all three felt in the presence of a sorrow deeper even than their own family grief during the meal he gazed silently at noel once he said you will let me paint you now mademoiselle i hope and his face brightened a little when she nodded there was never much talk when he came for any depth of discussion even of art brought out at once too wide a difference and pierson could never avoid a vague irritation with one who clearly had spirituality but of a sort which he could not understand after dinner he excused himself and went off to his study monsieur would be happier alone with the two girls gratian too got up she had remembered noels words i mind him less than anybody it was a chance for nollie to break the ice   2  i have not seen you for a long time mademoiselle said the painter when they were alone  noel was sitting in front of the empty drawingroom hearth with her arms stretched out as if there had been a fire there  ive been away how are you going to paint me monsieur  in that dress mademoiselle just as you are now warming yourself at the fire of life  but it isnt there  yes fires soon go out mademoiselle will you come and see my wife she is ill  now asked noel startled  yes now she is really ill and i have no one there that is what i came to ask of your sister butnow you are here its even better she likes you  noel got up wait one minute she said and ran upstairs her baby was asleep and the old nurse dozing putting on a cloak and cap of grey rabbits fur she ran down again to the hall where the painter was waiting and they went out together  i do not know if i am to blame he said my wife has been no real wife to me since she knew i had a mistress and was no real husband to her  noel stared round at his face lighted by a queer smile  yes he went on from that has come her tragedy but she should have known before i married her nothing was concealed bon dieu she should have known why cannot a woman see things as they are my mistress mademoiselle is not a thing of flesh it is my art it has always been first with me and always will she has never accepted that she is incapable of accepting it i am sorry for her but what would you i was a fool to marry her chere mademoiselle no troubles are anything beside the trouble which goes on day and night meal after meal year after year between two people who should never have married because one loves too much and requires all and the other loves not at allno not at all now it is long deadand can give but little  cant you separate asked noel wondering  it is hard to separate from one who craves for you as she craves her drugsyes she takes drugs now mademoiselle it is impossible for one who has any compassion in his soul besides what would she do we live from hand to mouth in a strange land she has no friends here not one how could i leave her while this war lasts as well could two persons on a desert island separate she is killing herself too with these drugs and i cannot stop her  poor madame murmured noel poor monsieur  the painter drew his hand across his eyes  i cannot change my nature he said in a stifled voice nor she hers so we go on but life will stop suddenly some day for one of us after all it is much worse for her than for me enter mademoiselle do not tell her i am going to paint you she likes you because you refused to let me  noel went up the stairs shuddering she had been there once before and remembered that sickly scent of drugs on the third floor they entered a small sittingroom whose walls were covered with paintings and drawings from one corner a triangular stack of canvases jutted out there was little furniture save an old red sofa and on this was seated a stoutish man in the garb of a belgian soldier with his elbows on his knees and his bearded cheeks resting on his doubled fists beside him on the sofa nursing a doll was a little girl who looked up at noel she had a most strange attractive pale little face with pointed chin and large eyes which never moved from this apparition in grey rabbits skins  ah barra you here said the painter  mademoiselle this is monsieur barra a friend of ours from the front and this is our landladys little girl a little refugee too arent you chica  the child gave him a sudden brilliant smile and resumed her grave scrutiny of the visitor the soldier who had risen heavily offered noel one of his podgy hands with a sad and heavy giggle  sit down mademoiselle said lavendie placing a chair for her i will bring my wife in and he went out through some double doors  noel sat down the soldier had resumed his old attitude and the little girl her nursing of the doll though her big eyes still watched the visitor overcome by strangeness noel made no attempt to talk and presently through the double doors the painter and his wife came in she was a thin woman in a red wrapper with hollow cheeks high cheekbones and hungry eyes her dark hair hung loose and one hand played restlessly with a fold of her gown she took noels hand and her uplifted eyes seemed to dig into the girls face to let go suddenly and flutter  how do you do she said in english so pierre brought you to see me again i remember you so well you would not let him paint you ah que cest drole you are so pretty too hein monsieur barra is not mademoiselle pretty  the soldier gave his heavy giggle and resumed his scrutiny of the floor  henriette said lavendie sit down beside chicayou must not stand sit down mademoiselle i beg  im so sorry youre not well said noel and sat down again  the painter stood leaning against the wall and his wife looked up at his tall thin figure with eyes which had in them anger and a sort of cunning  a great painter my husband is he not she said to noel you would not imagine what that man can do and how he paintsall day long and all night in his head and so you would not let him paint you after all  lavendie said impatiently voyons henriette causez dautre chose  his wife plucked nervously at a fold in her red gown and gave him the look of a dog that has been rebuked  i am a prisoner here mademoiselle i never leave the house here i live day after daymy husband is always painting who would go out alone under this grey sky of yours and the hatreds of the war in every face i prefer to keep my room my husband goes painting every face he sees interests him except that which he sees every day but i am a prisoner monsieur barra is our first visitor for a long time  the soldier raised his face from his fists prisonnier madame what would you say if you were out there and he gave his thick giggle we are the prisoners we others what would you say to imprisonment by explosion day and night never a minute free bom bom bom ah les tranchees its not so free as all that there  every one has his own prison said lavendie bitterly mademoiselle even has her prisonand little chica and her doll every one has his prison barra monsieur barra is also a painter mademoiselle  moi said barra lifting his heavy hairy hand i paint puddles starbombs horses ribsi paint holes and holes and holes wire and wire and wire and waterlong white ugly water i paint splinters and mens souls naked and mens bodies dead and nightmarenightmareall day and all nighti paint them in my head he suddenly ceased speaking and relapsed into contemplation of the carpet with his bearded cheeks resting on his fists and their souls as white as snow les camarades he added suddenly and loudly millions of belgians english french even the boches with white souls i paint those souls  a little shiver ran through noel and she looked appealingly at lavendie  barra he said as if the soldier were not there is a great painter but the front has turned his head a little what he says is true though there is no hatred out there it is here that we are prisoners of hatred mademoiselle avoid hatredsthey are poison  his wife put out her hand and touched the childs shoulder  why should we not hate she said who killed chicas father and blew her home torags who threw her out into this horrible englandpardon mademoiselle but it is horrible ah les boches if my hatred could destroy them there would not be one left even my husband was not so mad about his painting when we lived at home but here her eyes darted at his face again and then sank as if rebuked noel saw the painters lips move the sick womans whole figure writhed  it is mania your painting she looked at noel with a smile will you have some tea mademoiselle monsieur barra some tea  the soldier said thickly no madame in the trenches we have tea enough it consoles us but when we get awaygive us wine le bon vin le bon petit vin  get some wine pierre  noel saw from the painters face that there was no wine and perhaps no money to get any but he went quickly out she rose and said  i must be going madame  madame lavendie leaned forward and clutched her wrist wait a little mademoiselle we shall have some wine and pierre shall take you back presently you cannot go home aloneyou are too pretty is she not monsieur barra  the soldier looked up what would you say he said to bottles of wine bursting in the air bursting red and bursting white all day long all night long great steel bottles large as chica bits of bottles carrying off mens heads bsum garraaa and a house comes down and little bits of people ever so small ever so small tiny bits in the air and all over the ground great souls out there madame but i will tell you a secret and again he gave his heavy giggle all a little little mad nothing to speak ofjust a little bit mad like a watch you know that you can wind for ever that is the discovery of this war mademoiselle he said addressing noel for the first time you cannot gain a great soul till you are a little mad and lowering his piggy grey eyes at once he resumed his former attitude it is that madness i shall paint some day he announced to the carpet lurking in one tiny corner of each soul of all those millions as it creeps as it peeps ever so sudden ever so little when we all think it has been put to bed herethere nowthen when you least think in and out like a mouse with bright eyes millions of men with white souls all a little mad a great subject i think he added heavily involuntarily noel put her hand to her heart which was beating fast she felt quite sick  how long have you been at the front monsieur  two years mademoiselle time to go home and paint is it not but art he shrugged his heavy round shoulders his whole bearlike body a little mad he muttered once more i will tell you a story once in winter after i had rested a fortnight i go back to the trenches at night and i want some earth to fill up a hole in the ground where i was sleeping when one has slept in a bed one becomes particular well i scratch it from my parapet and i come to something funny i strike my briquet and there is a boches face all frozen and earthy and dead and greenywhite in the flame from my briquet  oh no  oh but yes mademoiselle true as i sit here very useful in the parapetdead boche once a man like me but in the morning i could not stand him we dug him out and buried him and filled the hole up with other things but there i stood in the night and my face as close to his as thisand he held his thick hand a foot before his face we talked of our homes he had a soul that man il me disait des choses how he had suffered and i too told him my sufferings dear god we know all we shall never know more than we know out there we others for we are madnothing to speak of but just a little little mad when you see us mademoiselle walking the streets remember that and he dropped his face on to his fists again  a silence had fallen in the roomvery queer and complete the little girl nursed her doll the soldier gazed at the floor the womans mouth moved stealthily and in noel the thought rushed continually to the verge of action couldnt i get up and run downstairs but she sat on hypnotised by that silence till lavendie reappeared with a bottle and four glasses  to drink our health and wish us luck mademoiselle he said  noel raised the glass he had given her i wish you all happiness  and you mademoiselle the two men murmured  she drank a little and rose  and now mademoiselle said lavendie if you must go i will see you home  noel took madame lavendies hand it was cold and returned no pressure her eyes had the glazed look that she remembered the soldier had put his empty glass down on the floor and was regarding it unconscious of her noel turned quickly to the door the last thing she saw was the little girl nursing her doll  in the street the painter began at once in his rapid french  i ought not to have asked you to come mademoiselle i did not know our friend barra was there besides my wife is not fit to receive a lady vous voyez quil y a de la manie dans cette pauvre tote i should not have asked you but i was so miserable  oh murmured noel i know  in our home over there she had interests in this great town she can only nurse her grief against me ah this war it seems to me we are all in the stomach of a great coiling serpent we lie there being digested in a way it is better out there in the trenches they are beyond hate they have attained a height that we have not it is wonderful how they still can be for going on till they have beaten the boche that is curious and it is very great did barra tell you how when they come backall these fightersthey are going to rule and manage the future of the world but it will not be so they will mix in with life separatebe scattered and they will be ruled as they were before the tongue and the pen will rule them those who have not seen the war will rule them  oh cried noel surely they will be the bravest and strongest in the future  the painter smiled  war makes men simple he said elemental life in peace is neither simple nor elemental it is subtle full of changing environments to which man must adapt himself the cunning the astute the adaptable will ever rule in times of peace it is pathetic the belief of those brave soldiers that thefuture is theirs  he said a strange thing murmured noel that they were all a little mad  he is a man of queer geniusbarra you should see some of his earlier pictures mad is not quite the word but something is loosened is rattling round in them they have lost proportion they are being forced in one direction i tell you mademoiselle this war is one great forcinghouse every living plant is being made to grow too fast each quality each passion hate and love intolerance and lust and avarice courage and energy yes and selfsacrificeall are being forced and forced beyond their strength beyond the natural flow of the sap forced till there has come a great wild luxuriant crop and thenpsum presto the change comes and these plants will wither and rot and stink but we who see life in forms of art are the only ones who feel that and we are so few the natural shape of things is lost there is a mist of blood before all eyes men are afraid of being fair see how we all hate not only our enemies but those who differ from us look at the streets toosee how men and women rush together how venus reigns in this forcinghouse is it not natural that youth about to die should yearn for pleasure for love for union before death  noel stared up at him now she thought i will  yes she said i know thats true because i rushed myself id like you to know we couldnt be marriedthere wasnt time andhe was killed but his son is alive thats why ive been away so long i want every one to know she spoke very calmly but her cheeks felt burning hot  the painter had made an upward movement of his hands as if they had been jerked by an electric current then he said quite quietly  my profound respect mademoiselle and my great sympathy and your father  its awful for him  the painter said gently ah mademoiselle i am not so sure perhaps he does not suffer so greatly perhaps not even your trouble can hurt him very much he lives in a world apart that i think is his true tragedy to be alive and yet not living enough to feel reality do you know anatole frances description of an old woman elle vivait mais si peu would that not be well said of the church in these days elle vivait mais si peu i see him always like a rather beautiful dark spire in the nighttime when you cannot see how it is attached to the earth he does not know he never will know life  noel looked round at him what do you mean by life monsieur im always reading about life and people talk of seeing life what is itwhere is it i never see anything that you could call life  the painter smiled  to see life he said ah that is different to enjoy yourself well it is my experience that when people are seeing life as they call it they are not enjoying themselves you know when one is very thirsty one drinks and drinks but the thirst remains all the same there are places where one can see life as it is called but the only persons you will see enjoying themselves at such places are a few humdrums like myself who go there for a talk over a cup of coffee perhaps at your age though it is different  noel clasped her hands and her eyes seemed to shine in the gloom i want music and dancing and light and beautiful things and faces but i never get them  no there does not exist in this town or in any other a place which will give you that foxtrots and ragtime and paint and powder and glare and halfdrunken young men and women with red lips you can get them in plenty but rhythm and beauty and charm never in brussels when i was younger i saw much life as they call it but not one lovely thing unspoiled it was all as ashes in the mouth ah you may smile but i know what i am talking of happiness never comes when you are looking for it mademoiselle beauty is in nature and in real art never in these false silly make believes there is a place just here where we belgians go would you like to see how true my words are  oh yes  tresbien let us go in  they passed into a revolving doorway with little glass compartments which shot them out into a shining corridor at the end of this the painter looked at noel and seemed to hesitate then he turned off from the room they were about to enter into a room on the right it was large full of gilt and plush and marble tables where couples were seated young men in khaki and older men in plain clothes together or with young women at these last noel looked face after face while they were passing down a long way to an empty table she saw that some were pretty and some only trying to be that nearly all were powdered and had their eyes darkened and their lips reddened till she felt her own face to be dreadfully ungarnished up in a gallery a small band was playing an attractive jingling hollow little tune and the buzz of talk and laughter was almost deafening  what will you have mademoiselle said the painter it is just nine oclock we must order quickly  may i have one of those green things  deux cremes de menthe said lavendie to the waiter  noel was too absorbed to see the queer bitter little smile hovering about his face she was busy looking at the faces of women whose eyes furtively cold and enquiring were fixed on her and at the faces of men with eyes that were furtively warm and wondering  i wonder if daddy was ever in a place like this she said putting the glass of green stuff to her lips is it nice it smells of peppermint  a beautiful colour good luck mademoiselle and he chinked his glass with hers  noel sipped held it away and sipped again  its nice but awfully sticky may i have a cigarette  des cigarettes said lavendie to the waiter et deux cafes noirs now mademoiselle he murmured when they were brought if we imagine that we have drunk a bottle of wine each we shall have exhausted all the preliminaries of what is called vice amusing isnt it he shrugged his shoulders  his face struck noel suddenly as tarnished and almost sullen  dont be angry monsieur its all new to me you see  the painter smiled his bright skindeep smile  pardon i forget myself only it hurts me to see beauty in a place like this it does not go well with that tune and these voices and these faces enjoy yourself mademoiselle drink it all in see the way these people look at each other what love shines in their eyes a pity too we cannot hear what they are saying believe me their talk is most subtle tresspirituel these young women are doing their bit as you call it bringing le plaisir to all these who are serving their country eat drink love for tomorrow we die who cares for the world simple or the world beautiful in days like these the house of the spirit is empty  he was looking at her sidelong as if he would enter her very soul  noel got up im ready to go monsieur  he put her cloak on her shoulders paid the bill and they went out threading again through the little tables through the buzz of talk and laughter and the fumes of tobacco while another hollow little tune jingled away behind them  through there said the painter pointing to another door they dance so it goes london in wartime well after all it is never very different no great town is did you enjoy your sight of life mademoiselle  i think one must dance to be happy is that where your friends go  oh no to a room much rougher and play dominoes and drink coffee and beer and talk they have no money to throw away  why didnt you show me  mademoiselle in that room you might see someone perhaps whom one day you would meet again in the place we visited you were safe enough at least i hope so  noel shrugged i suppose it doesnt matter now what i do  and a rush of emotion caught at her throata wave from the pastthe moonlit night the dark old abbey the woods and the river two tears rolled down her cheeks  i was thinking ofsomething she said in a muffled voice its all right  chere mademoiselle lavendie murmured and all the way home he was timid and distressed shaking his hand at the door she murmured  im sorry i was such a fool and thank you awfully monsieur good night  good night and better dreams there is a good time comingpeace and happiness once more in the world it will not always be this forcinghouse good night chere mademoiselle  noel went up to the nursery and stole in a nightlight was burning nurse and baby were fast asleep she tiptoed through into her own room once there she felt suddenly so tired that she could hardly undress and yet curiously rested as if with that rush of emotion cyril and the past had slipped from her for ever     iii   noels first encounter with opinion took place the following day the baby had just come in from its airing she had seen it comfortably snoozing and was on her way downstairs when a voice from the hall said  how do you do and she saw the khakiclad figure of adrian lauder her fathers curate hesitating just a moment she finished her descent and put her fingers in his he was a rather heavy doughcoloured young man of nearly thirty unsuited by khaki with a round white collar buttoned behind but his aspiring eyes redeemed him proclaiming the best intentions in the world and an inclination towards sentiment in the presence of beauty  i havent seen you for ages he said rather fatuously following her into her fathers study  no said noel howdo you like being at the front  ah he said theyre wonderful and his eyes shone its so nice to see you again  is it  he seemed puzzled by that answer stammered and said  i didnt know your sister had a baby a jolly baby  she hasnt  lauders mouth opened a silly mouth she thought  oh he said is it a protegeebelgian or something  no its mine my own and turning round she slipped the little ring off her finger when she turned back to him his face had not recovered from her words it had a hapless look as of one to whom such a thing ought not to have happened  dont look like that said noel didnt you understand its minemine she put out her left hand look theres no ring  he stammered i say you oughtnt toyou oughtnt to  what  joke aboutabout such things ought you  one doesnt joke if ones had a baby without being married you know  lauder went suddenly slack a shell might have burst a few paces from him and then just as one would in such a case he made an effort braced himself and said in a curious voice both stiff and heavy i cantone doesntits not  it is said noel if you dont believe me ask daddy  he put his hand up to his round collar and with the wild thought that he was going to tear it off she cried dont  you he said you but  noel turned away from him to the window she stood looking out but saw nothing whatever  i dont want it hidden she said without turning round i want every one to know its stupid as it isstupid and she stamped her foot cant you see how stupid it iseverybodys mouth falling open  he uttered a little sound which had pain in it and she felt a real pang of compunction he had gripped the back of a chair his face had lost its heaviness a dull flush coloured his cheeks noel had a feeling as if she had been convicted of treachery it was his silence the curious look of an impersonal pain beyond power of words she felt in him something much deeper than mere disapprovalsomething which echoed within herself she walked quickly past him and escaped she ran upstairs and threw herself on her bed he was nothing it was not that it was in herself the awful feeling for the first time developed and poignant that she had betrayed her caste forfeited the right to be thought a lady betrayed her secret reserve and refinement repaid with black ingratitude the love lavished on her up bringing by behaving like any uncaredfor common girl she had never felt this beforenot even when gratian first heard of it and they had stood one at each end of the hearth unable to speak then she still had her passion and her grief for the dead that was gone now as if it had never been and she had no defence nothing between her and this crushing humiliation and chagrin she had been mad she must have been mad the belgian barra was right all a little mad in this forcinghouse of a war she buried her face deep in the pillow till it almost stopped her power of breathing her head and cheeks and ears seemed to be on fire if only he had shown disgust done something which roused her temper her sense of justice her feeling that fate had been too cruel to her but he had just stood there bewilderment incarnate like a creature with some very deep illusion shattered it was horrible then feeling that she could not stay still must walk run get away somehow from this feeling of treachery and betrayal she sprang up all was quiet below and she slipped downstairs and out speeding along with no knowledge of direction taking the way she had taken day after day to her hospital it was the last of april trees and shrubs were luscious with blossom and leaf the dogs ran gaily people had almost happy faces in the sunshine if i could get away from myself i wouldnt care she thought easy to get away from people from london even from england perhaps but from oneselfimpossible she passed her hospital and looked at it dully at the red cross flag against its stucco wall and a soldier in his blue slops and red tie coming out she had spent many miserable hours there but none quite so miserable as this she passed the church opposite to the flats where leila lived and running suddenly into a tall man coming round the corner saw fort she bent her head and tried to hurry past but his hand was held out she could not help putting hers into it and looking up hardily she said  you know about me dont you  his face naturally so frank seemed to clench up as if he were riding at a fence hell tell a lie she thought bitterly but he did not  yes leila told me  and she thought i suppose hell try and pretend that ive not been a beast  i admire your pluck he said  i havent any  we never know ourselves do we i suppose you wouldnt walk my pace a minute or two would you im going the same way  i dont know which way im going  that is my case too  they walked on in silence  i wish to god i were back in france said fort abruptly one doesnt feel clean here  noels heart applauded  ah to get awayaway from oneself but at the thought of her baby her heart fell again is your leg quite hopeless she said  quite  that must be horrid  hundreds of thousands would look on it as splendid luck and so it is if you count it better to be alive than dead which i do in spite of the blues  how is cousin leila  very well she goes on pegging away at the hospital shes a brick but he did not look at her and again there was silence till he stopped by lords cricketground  i mustnt keep you crawling along at this pace  oh i dont mind  i only wanted to say that if i can be of any service to you at any time in any way whatever please command me  he gave her hand a squeeze took his hat off and noel walked slowly on the little interview with its suppressions and its implications had but exasperated her restlessness and yet in a way it had soothed the soreness of her heart captain fort at all events did not despise her and he was in trouble like herself she felt that somehow by the look of his face and the tone of his voice when he spoke of leila she quickened her pace georges words came back to her if youre not ashamed of yourself no one will be of you how easy to say the old days her school the little half grownup dances she used to go to when everything was happy gone all gone  but her meetings with opinion were not over for the day for turning again at last into the home square tired out by her three hours ramble she met an old lady whom she and gratian had known from babyhooda handsome dame the widow of an official who spent her days which showed no symptom of declining in admirable works her daughter the widow of an officer killed at the marne was with her and the two greeted noel with a shower of cordial questions so she was back from the country and was she quite well again and working at her hospital and how was her dear father they had thought him looking very thin and worn but now gratian was at homehow dreadfully the war kept husbands and wives apart and whose was the dear little baby they had in the house  mine said noel walking straight past them with her head up in every fibre of her being she could feel the hurt startled utterly bewildered looks of those firm friendly persons left there on the pavement behind her could feel the way they would gather themselves together and walk on perhaps without a word and then round the corner begin what has come to noel what did she mean and taking the little gold hoop out of her pocket she flung it with all her might into the square garden the action saved her from a breakdown and she went in calmly lunch was long over but her father had not gone out for he met her in the hall and drew her into the diningroom  you must eat my child he said and while she was swallowing down what he had caused to be kept back for her he stood by the hearth in that favourite attitude of his one foot on the fender and one hand gripping the mantelshelf  youve got your wish daddy she said dully everybody knows now ive told mr lauder and monsieur and the dinnafords  she saw his fingers uncrisp then grip the shelf again im glad he said  aunt thirza gave me a ring to wear but ive thrown it away  my dearest child he began but could not go on for the quivering of his lips  i wanted to say once more daddy that im fearfully sorry about you and i am ashamed of myself i thought i wasnt but i amonly i think it was cruel and im not penitent to god and its no good trying to make me  pierson turned and looked at her for a long time after she could not get that look out of her memory  jimmy fort had turned away from noel feeling particularly wretched ever since the day when leila had told him of the girls misfortune he had been aware that his liaison had no decent foundation save a sort of pity one day in a queer access of compunction he had made leila an offer of marriage she had refused and he had respected her the more realising by the quiver in her voice and the look in her eyes that she refused him not because she did not love him well enough but because she was afraid of losing any of his affection she was a woman of great experience  today he had taken advantage of the luncheon interval to bring her some flowers with a note to say that he could not come that evening letting himself in with his latchkey he had carefully put those japanese azaleas in the bowl famille rose taking water from her bedroom then he had sat down on the divan with his head in his hands  though he had rolled so much about the world he had never had much to do with women and there was nothing in him of the frenchman who takes what life puts in his way as so much enjoyment on the credit side and accepts the ends of such affairs as they naturally and rather rapidly arrive it had been a pleasure and was no longer a pleasure but this apparently did not dissolve it or absolve him he felt himself bound by an obscure but deep instinct to go on pretending that he was not tired of her so long as she was not tired of him and he sat there trying to remember any sign however small of such a consummation quite without success on the contrary he had even the wretched feeling that if only he had loved her she would have been much more likely to have tired of him by now for her he was still the unconquered in spite of his loyal endeavour to seem conquered he had made a fatal mistake that evening after the concert at queens hall to let himself go on a mixed tide of desire and pity  his folly came to him with increased poignancy after he had parted from noel how could he have been such a base fool as to have committed himself to leila on an evening when he had actually been in the company of that child was it the vague unseizable likeness between them which had pushed him over the edge ive been an ass he thought a horrible ass i would always have given every hour ive ever spent with leila for one real smile from that girl  this sudden sight of noel after months during which he had tried loyally to forget her existence and not succeeded at all made him realise as he never had yet that he was in love with her so very much in love with her that the thought of leila was become nauseating and yet the instincts of a gentleman seemed to forbid him to betray that secret to either of them it was an accursed coil he hailed a cab for he was late and all the way back to the war office he continued to see the girls figure and her face with its short hair and a fearful temptation rose within him was it not she who was now the real object for chivalry and pity had he not the right to consecrate himself to championship of one in such a deplorable position leila had lived her life but this childs lifepretty well wreckedwas all before her and then he grinned from sheer disgust for he knew that this was jesuitry not chivalry was moving him but love love love of the unattainable and with a heavy heart indeed he entered the great building where in a small room companioned by the telephone and surrounded by sheets of paper covered with figures he passed his days the war made everything seem dreary hopeless no wonder he had caught at any distraction which came alongcaught at it till it had caught him     iv  1  to find out the worst is for human nature only a question of time but where the worst is attached to a family haloed as it were by the authority and reputation of an institution like the church the process of discovery has to break through many a little hedge sheer unlikelihood genuine respect the defensive instinct in those identified with an institution who will themselves feel weaker if its strength be diminished the feeling that the scandal is too good to be trueall these little hedges and more had to be broken through to the dinnafords the unholy importance of what noel had said to them would have continued to keep them dumb out of selfprotection but its monstrosity had given them the feeling that there must be some mistake that the girl had been overtaken by a wild desire to pull their legs as dear charlie would say with the hope of getting this view confirmed they lay in wait for the old nurse who took the baby out and obtained the information shortly imparted oh yes miss noels her usband was killedpoor lamb and they felt rewarded they had been sure there was some mistake the relief of hearing that word usband was intense one of these hasty war marriages of which the dear vicar had not approved and so it had been kept dark quite intelligible but so sad enough misgiving however remained in their minds to prevent their going to condole with the dear vicar but not enough to prevent their roundly contradicting the rumours and gossip already coming to their ears and then one day when their friend mrs curtis had said too positively well she doesnt wear a weddingring that ill swear because i took very good care to look they determined to ask mr lauder he wouldindeed mustknow and of course would not tell a story when they asked him it was so manifest that he did know that they almost withdrew the question the poor young man had gone the colour of a tomato  i prefer not to answer he said the rest of a very short interview was passed in exquisite discomfort indeed discomfort exquisite and otherwise within a few weeks of noels return had begun to pervade all the habitual congregation of piersons church it was noticed that neither of the two sisters attended service now certain people who went in the sincere hope of seeing noel only fell off again when she did not appear after all she would not have the face and gratian was too ashamed no doubt it was constantly remarked that the vicar looked very grave and thin even for him as the rumours hardened into certainty the feeling towards him became a curious medley of sympathy and condemnation there was about the whole business that which english people especially resent by the very fact of his presence before them every sunday and his public ministrations he was exhibiting to them as it were the seamed and blushing face of his daughters private life besides affording one long and glaring demonstration of the failure of the church to guide its flock if a man could not keep his own daughter in the straight pathwhom could he resign the word began to be thought about but not yet spoken he had been there so long he had spent so much money on the church and the parish his gentle dreamy manner was greatly liked he was a gentleman and had helped many people and though his love of music and vestments had always caused heartburnings yet it had given a certain cachet to the church the women at any rate were always glad to know that the church they went to was capable of drawing their fellow women away from other churches besides it was wartime and moral delinquency which in time of peace would have bulked too large to neglect was now less insistently dwelt on by minds preoccupied by food and airraids things of course could not go on as they were but as yet they did go on  the talkedabout is always the last to hear the talk and nothing concrete or tangible came piersons way he went about his usual routine without seeming change and yet there was a change secret and creeping wounded almost to death himself he felt as though surrounded by one great wound in others but it was some weeks before anything occurred to rouse within him the weapon of anger or the protective impulse  and then one day a little swift brutality shook him to the very soul he was coming home from a long parish round and had turned into the square when a low voice behind him said  wot price the little barstard  a cold sick feeling stifled his very breathing he gasped and spun round to see two big loutish boys walking fast away with swift and stealthy passion he sprang after them and putting his hands on their two neighbouring shoulders wrenched them round so that they faced him with mouths fallen open in alarm shaking them with all his force he said  how dare youhow dare you use that word his face and voice must have been rather terrible for the scare in their faces brought him to sudden consciousness of his own violence and he dropped his hands in two seconds they were at the corner they stopped there for a second one of them shouted granpa then they vanished he was left with lips and hands quivering and a feeling that he had not known for yearsthe weak white empty feeling one has after yielding utterly to sudden murderous rage he crossed over and stood leaning against the garden railings with the thought god forgive me i could have killed themi could have killed them there had been a devil in him if he had had something in his hand he might now have been a murderer how awful only one had spoken but he could have killed them both and the word was true and was in all mouthsall low common mouths day after day of his own daughters child the ghastliness of this thought brought home so utterly made him writhe and grasp the railings as if he would have bent them  from that day on a creeping sensation of being rejected of men never left him the sense of identification with noel and her tiny outcast became ever more poignant more real the desire to protect them ever more passionate and the feeling that round about there were whispering voices pointing fingers and a growing malevolence was ever more sickening he was beginning too to realise the deep and hidden truth how easily the breath of scandal destroys the influence and sanctity of those endowed therewith by vocation how invaluable it is to feel untarnished and how difficult to feel that when others think you tarnished  he tried to be with noel as much as possible and in the evenings they sometimes went walks together without ever talking of what was always in their minds between six and eight the girl was giving sittings to lavendie in the drawingroom and sometimes pierson would come there and play to them he was always possessed now by a sense of the danger noel ran from companionship with any man on three occasions jimmy fort made his appearance after dinner he had so little to say that it was difficult to understand why he came but sharpened by this new dread for his daughter pierson noticed his eyes always following her he admires her he thought and often he would try his utmost to grasp the character of this man who had lived such a roving life is hecan he be the sort of man i would trust nollie to he would think oh that i should have to hope like this that some good man would marry hermy little nollie a child only the other day  in these sad painful lonely weeks he found a spot of something like refuge in leilas sittingroom and would go there often for half an hour when she was back from her hospital that little blackwalled room with its japanese prints and its flowers soothed him and leila soothed him innocent as he was of any knowledge of her latest aberration and perhaps conscious that she herself was not too happy to watch her arranging flowers singing her little french songs or to find her beside him listening to his confidences was the only real pleasure he knew in these days and leila in turn would watch him and think poor edward he has never lived and never will now but sometimes the thought would shoot through her perhaps hes to be envied he doesnt feel what i feel anyway why did i fall in love again  they did not speak of noel as a rule but one evening she expressed her views roundly  it was a great mistake to make noel come back edward it was quixotic youll be lucky if real mischief doesnt come of it shes not a patient character one day shell do something rash and mind you shell be much more likely to break out if she sees the world treating you badly than if it happens to herself i should send her back to the country before she makes bad worse  i cant do that leila we must live it down together  wrong edward you should take things as they are  with a heavy sigh pierson answered  i wish i could see her future shes so attractive and her defences are gone shes lost faith and belief in all that a good woman should be the day after she came back she told me she was ashamed of herself but sinceshes not given a sign shes so proudmy poor little nollie i see how men admire her too our belgian friend is painting her hes a good man but he finds her beautiful and who can wonder and your friend captain fort fathers are supposed to be blind but they see very clear sometimes  leila rose and drew down a blind  this sun she said does jimmy fort come to youoften  oh no very seldom but stilli can see  you batyou blunderer thought leila see you cant even see this beside you  i expect hes sorry for her she said in a queer voice  why should he be sorry he doesnt know  oh yes he knows i told him  you told him  yes leila repeated stubbornly and hes sorry for her  and even then this monk beside her did not see and went blundering on  no no its not merely that hes sorry by the way he looks at her i know im not mistaken ive wonderedwhat do you think leila hes too old for her but he seems an honourable kind man  oh a most honourable kind man but only by pressing her hand against her lips had she smothered a burst of bitter laughter he who saw nothing could yet notice forts eyes when he looked at noel and be positive that he was in love with her how plainly those eyes must speak her control gave way  all this is very interesting she said spurning her words like noel considering that hes more than my friend edward it gave her a sort of pleasure to see him wince these blind bats she thought terribly stung that he should so clearly assume her out of the running then she was sorry his face had become so still and wistful and turning away she said  oh i shant break my heart im a good loser and im a good fighter too perhaps i shant lose and snapping off a sprig of geranium she pressed it to her lips  forgive me said pierson slowly i didnt know im stupid i thought your love for your poor soldiers had left no room for other feelings  leila uttered a shrill laugh what have they to do with each other did you never hear of passion edward oh dont look at me like that do you think a woman cant feel passion at my age as much as ever more than ever because its all slipping away  she took her hand from her lips but a geranium petal was left clinging there like a bloodstain what has your life been all these years she went on vehementlysuppression of passion nothing else you monks twist nature up with holy words and try to disguise what the eeriest simpleton can see well i havent suppressed passion edward thats all  and are you happier for that  i was and i shall be again  a little smile curled piersons lips shall be he said i hope so its just two ways of looking at things leila  oh edward dont be so gentle i suppose you dont think a person like me can ever really love  he was standing before her with his head down and a sense that naive and batlike as he was there was something in him she could not reach or understand made her cry out  ive not been nice to you forgive me edward im so unhappy  there was a greek who used to say god is the helping of man by man it isnt true but its beautiful goodbye dear leila and dont be sorrowful  she squeezed his hand and turned to the window  she stood there watching his black figure cross the road in the sunshine and pass round the corner by the railings of the church he walked quickly very upright there was something unseeing even about that back view of him or was it that he sawanother world she had never lost the mental habits of her orthodox girlhood and in spite of all impatience recognised his sanctity when he had disappeared she went into her bedroom what he had said indeed was no discovery she had known oh she had known why didnt i accept jimmys offer why didnt i marry him is it too late she thought could i would heeven now but then she started away from her own thought marry him knowing his heart was with this girl  she looked long at her face in the mirror studying with a fearful interest the little hard lines and markings there beneath their light coating of powder she examined the cunning touches of colouring matter here and there in her front hair were they cunning enough did they deceive they seemed to her suddenly to stare out she fingered and smoothed the slight looseness and fulness of the skin below her chin she stretched herself and passed her hands down over her whole form searching as it were for slackness or thickness and she had the bitter thought im all out im doing all i can the lines of a little poem fort had showed her went thrumming through her head           time you old gipsy man             will you not stay           put up your caravan             just for a day  what more could she do he did not like to see her lips reddened she had marked his disapprovals watched him wipe his mouth after a kiss when he thought she couldnt see him i neednt she thought noels lips are no redder really what has she better than i youthdew on the grass that didnt last long but long enough to do her in as her soldiermen would say and suddenly she revolted against herself against fort against this chilled and foggy country felt a fierce nostalgia for african sun and the african flowers the happygolucky handtomouth existence of those five years before the war began high constantia at grape harvest how many years agoten years eleven years ah to have before her those ten years with him ten years in the sun he would have loved her then and gone on loving her and she would not have tired of him as she had tired of those others in half an hour she thought hell be here sit opposite me i shall see him struggling forcing himself to seem affectionate its too humbling but i dont care i want him  she searched her wardrobe for some garment or touch of colour novelty of any sort to help her but she had tried them allthose little trickswas bankrupt and such a discouraged heavy mood came on her that she did not even change but went back in her nurses dress and lay down on the divan pretending to sleep while the maid set out the supper she lay there moody and motionless trying to summon courage feeling that if she showed herself beaten she was beaten knowing that she only held him by pity but when she heard his footstep on the stairs she swiftly passed her hands over her cheeks as if to press the blood out of them and lay absolutely still she hoped that she was white and indeed she was with fingermarks under the eyes for she had suffered greatly this last hour through her lashes she saw him halt and look at her in surprise asleep orill which she did not move she wanted to watch him he tiptoed across the room and stood looking down at her there was a furrow between his eyes ah she thought it would suit you if i were dead my kind friend he bent a little towards her and she wondered suddenly whether she looked graceful lying there sorry now that she had not changed her dress she saw him shrug his shoulders ever so faintly with a puzzled little movement he had not seen that she was shamming how nice his face wasnot mean secret callous she opened her eyes which against her will had in them the despair she was feeling he went on his knees and lifting her hand to his lips hid them with it  jimmy she said gently im an awful bore to you poor jimmy no dont pretend i know what i know oh god what am i saying she thought its fatalfatal i ought never and drawing his head to her she put it to her heart then instinctively aware that this moment had been pressed to its uttermost she scrambled up kissed his forehead stretched herself and laughed  i was asleep dreaming dreaming you loved me wasnt it funny come along there are oysters for the last time this season  all that evening as if both knew they had been looking over a precipice they seemed to be treading warily desperately anxious not to rouse emotion in each other or touch on things which must bring a scene and leila talked incessantly of africa  dont you long for the sun jimmy couldnt wecouldnt you go oh why doesnt this wretched war end all that weve got here at home every scrap of wealth and comfort and age and art and music id give it all for the light and the sun out there wouldnt you  and fort said he would knowing well of one thing which he would not give and she knew that as well as he  they were both gayer than they had been for a long time so that when he had gone she fell back once more on to the divan and burying her face in a cushion wept bitterly     v  1  it was not quite disillusionment that pierson felt while he walked away perhaps he had not really believed in leilas regeneration it was more an acute discomfort an increasing loneliness a soft and restful spot was now denied him a certain warmth and allurement had gone out of his life he had not even the feeling that it was his duty to try and save leila by persuading her to marry fort he had always been too sensitive too much as it were of a gentleman for the robuster sorts of evangelism such delicacy had been a stumblingblock to him all through professional life in the eight years when his wife was with him all had been more certain more direct and simple with the help of her sympathy judgment and companionship at her death a sort of mist had gathered in his soul no one had ever spoken plainly to him to a clergyman who does no one had told him in so many words that he should have married againthat to stay unmarried was bad for him physically and spiritually fogging and perverting life not driving him indeed as it drove many to intolerance and cruelty but to that halfliving dreaminess and the vague unhappy yearnings which so constantly beset him all these celibate years he had really only been happy in his music or in faraway country places taking strong exercise and losing himself in the beauties of nature and since the war began he had only once for those three days at kestrel been out of london  he walked home going over in his mind very anxiously all the evidence he had of forts feeling for noel how many times had he been to them since she came back only three timesthree evening visits and he had not been alone with her a single minute before this calamity befell his daughter he would never have observed anything in forts demeanour but in his new watchfulness he had seen the almost reverential way he looked at her noticed the extra softness of his voice when he spoke to her and once a look of sudden pain a sort of dulling of his whole self when noel had got up and gone out of the room and the girl herself twice he had surprised her gazing at fort when he was not looking with a sort of brooding interest he remembered how as a little girl she would watch a grownup and then suddenly one day attach herself to him and be quite devoted yes he must warn her before she could possibly become entangled in his fastidious chastity the opinion he had held of fort was suddenly lowered he already a freethinker was now revealed as a freeliver poor little nollie endangered again already every man a kind of wolf waiting to pounce on her  he found lavendie and noel in the drawingroom standing before the portrait which was nearing completion he looked at it for a long minute and turned away  dont you think its like me daddy  its like you but it hurts me i cant tell why  he saw the smile of a painter whose picture is being criticised come on lavendies face  it is perhaps the colouring which does not please you monsieur  no no deeper the expression what is she waiting for  the defensive smile died on lavendies lips  it is as i see her monsieur le cure  pierson turned again to the picture and suddenly covered his eyes she looks fey he said and went out of the room  lavendie and noel remained staring at the picture fey what does that mean mademoiselle  possessed or something  and they continued to stare at the picture till lavendie said  i think there is still a little too much light on that ear  the same evening at bedtime pierson called noel back  nollie i want you to know something in all but the name captain fort is a married man  he saw her flush and felt his own face darkening with colour  she said calmly i know to leila  do you mean she has told you  noel shook her head  then how  i guessed daddy dont treat me as a child any more whats the use now  he sat down in the chair before the hearth and covered his face with his hands by the quivering of those hands and the movement of his shoulders she could tell that he was stifling emotion perhaps even crying and sinking down on his knees she pressed his hands and face to her murmuring oh daddy dear oh daddy dear  he put his arms round her and they sat a long time with their cheeks pressed together not speaking a word     vi  1  the day after that silent outburst of emotion in the drawingroom was a sunday and obeying the longing awakened overnight to be as good as she could to her father noel said to him  would you like me to come to church  of course nollie  how could he have answered otherwise to him church was the home of comfort and absolution where people must bring their sins and troublesa haven of sinners the fount of charity of forgiveness and love not to have believed that after all these years would have been to deny all his usefulness in life and to cast a slur on the house of god  and so noel walked there with him for gratian had gone down to george for the weekend she slipped quietly up the side aisle to their empty pew under the pulpit never turning her eyes from the chancel she remained unconscious of the stir her presence made during that hour and twenty minutes behind her the dumb currents of wonder disapproval and resentment ran a stealthy course on her all eyes were fixed sooner or later and every mind became the play ground of judgments from every soul kneeling standing or sitting while the voice of the service droned sang or spoke a kind of glare radiated on to that one small devoted head which seemed so ludicrously devout she disturbed their devotions this girl who had betrayed her father her faith her class she ought to repent of course and church was the right place yet there was something brazen in her repenting there before their very eyes she was too palpable a flaw in the crystal of the churchs authority too visible a rent in the raiment of their priest her figure focused all the uneasy amazement and heart searchings of these last weeks mothers quivered with the knowledge that their daughters could see her wives with the idea that their husbands were seeing her men experienced sensations varying from condemnation to a sort of covetousness young folk wondered and felt inclined to giggle old maids could hardly bear to look here and there a man or woman who had seen life face to face was simply sorry the consciousness of all who knew her personally was at stretch how to behave if they came within reach of her in going out for though only half a dozen would actually rub shoulders with her all knew that they might be and many felt it their duty to be of that halfdozen so as to establish their attitude once for all it was in fact too severe a test for human nature and the feelings which church ought to arouse the stillness of that young figure the impossibility of seeing her face and judging of her state of mind thereby finally a faint lurking shame that they should be so intrigued and disturbed by something which had to do with sex in this house of worshipall combined to produce in every mind that herdfeeling of defence which so soon becomes offensive and half unconscious half aware of it all noel stood and sat and knelt once or twice she saw her fathers eyes fixed on her and still in the glow of last nights pity and remorse felt a kind of worship for his thin grave face but for the most part her own wore the expression lavendie had translated to his canvasthe look of one ever waiting for the extreme moments of life for those few and fleeting poignancies which existence holds for the human heart a look neither hungry nor dissatisfied but dreamy and expectant which might blaze into warmth and depth at any moment and then go back to its dream  when the last notes of the organ died away she continued to sit very still without looking round  there was no second service and the congregation melted out behind her and had dispersed into the streets and squares long before she came forth after hesitating whether or no to go to the vestry door she turned away and walked home alone  it was this deliberate evasion of all contact which probably clinched the business the absence of vent of any escapepipe for the feelings is always dangerous they felt cheated if noel had come out amongst all those whose devotions her presence had disturbed if in that exit some had shown and others had witnessed one knows not what of a manifested ostracism the outraged sense of social decency might have been appeased and sleeping dogs allowed to lie for we soon get used to things and after all the war took precedence in every mind even over social decency but none of this had occurred and a sense that sunday after sunday the same little outrage would happen to them moved more than a dozen quite unrelated persons and caused the posting that evening of as many letters signed and unsigned to a certain quarter london is no place for parish conspiracy and a situation which in the country would have provoked meetings more or less public and possibly a resolution could perhaps only thus be dealt with besides in certain folk there is ever a mysterious itch to write an unsigned lettersuch missives satisfy some obscure sense of justice some uncontrollable longing to get even with those who have hurt or disturbed them without affording the offenders chance for further hurt or disturbance  letters which are posted often reach their destination  on wednesday morning pierson was sitting in his study at the hour devoted to the calls of his parishioners when the maid announced canon rushbourne sir and he saw before him an old college friend whom he had met but seldom in recent years his visitor was a short greyhaired man of rather portly figure whose round rosy goodhumoured face had a look of sober goodness and whose lightblue eyes shone a little he grasped piersons hand and said in a voice to whose natural heavy resonance professional duty had added a certain unction  my dear edward how many years it is since we met do you remember dear old blakeway i saw him only yesterday hes just the same im delighted to see you again and he laughed a little soft nervous laugh then for a few moments he talked of the war and old college days and pierson looked at him and thought what has he come for  youve something to say to me alec he said at last  canon rushbourne leaned forward in his chair and answered with evident effort yes i wanted to have a little talk with you edward i hope you wont mind i do hope you wont  why should i mind  canon rushbournes eyes shone more than ever there was real friendliness in his face  i know youve every right to say to me mind your own business but i made up my mind to come as a friend hoping to save you fromer he stammered and began again i think you ought to know of the feeling in your parish thaterthateryour position is very delicate without breach of confidence i may tell you that letters have been sent to headquarters you can imagine perhaps what i mean do believe my dear friend that im actuated by my old affection for you nothing else i do assure you  in the silence his breathing could be heard as of a man a little touched with asthma while he continually smoothed his thick black knees his whole face radiating an anxious kindliness the sun shone brightly on those two black figures so very different and drew out of their wellworn garments the faint latent green mossiness which underlies the clothes of clergymen  at last pierson said thank you alec i understand  the canon uttered a resounding sigh you didnt realise how very easily people misinterpret her being here with you it seems to them a kinda kind of challenge they were bound i think to feel that and im afraid in consequence he stopped moved by the fact that pierson had closed his eyes  i am to choose you mean between my daughter and my parish  the canon seemed with a stammer of words to try and blunt the edge of that clear question  my visit is quite informal my dear fellow i cant say at all but there is evidently much feeling that is what i wanted you to know you havent quite seen i think that  pierson raised his hand i cant talk of this  the canon rose believe me edward i sympathise deeply i felt i had to warn you he held out his hand goodbye my dear friend do forgive me and he went out in the hall an adventure befell him so plump and awkward that he could barely recite it to mrs rushbourne that night  coming out from my poor friend he said i ran into a babys perambulator and that young mother whom i remember as a little thinghe held his hand at the level of his thigharranging it for going out it startled me and i fear i asked quite foolishly is it a boy the poor young thing looked up at me she has very large eyes quite beautiful strange eyes have you been speaking to daddy about me my dear young lady i said im such an old friend you see you must forgive me and then she said are they going to ask him to resign that depends on you i said why do i say these things charlotte i ought simply to have held my tongue poor young thing so very young and the little baby she has brought it on herself alec mrs rushbourne replied     vii  1  the moment his visitor had vanished pierson paced up and down the study with anger rising in his heart his daughter or his parish the old saw an englishmans house is his castle was being attacked within him must he not then harbour his own daughter and help her by candid atonement to regain her inward strength and peace was he not thereby acting as a true christian in by far the hardest course he and she could pursue to go back on that decision and imperil his daughters spirit or else resign his parishthe alternatives were brutal this was the centre of his world the only spot where so lonely a man could hope to feel even the semblance of home a thousand little threads tethered him to his church his parishioners and this housefor to live on here if he gave up his church was out of the question but his chief feeling was a bewildered anger that for doing what seemed to him his duty he should be attacked by his parishioners  a passion of desire to know what they really thought and feltthese parishioners of his whom he had befriended and for whom he had worked so longbeset him now and he went out but the absurdity of his quest struck him before he had gone the length of the square one could not go to people and say stand and deliver me your inmost judgments and suddenly he was aware of how far away he really was from them through all his ministrations had he ever come to know their hearts and now in this dire necessity for knowledge there seemed no way of getting it he went at random into a stationers shop the shopman sang bass in his choir they had met sunday after sunday for the last seven years but when with this itch for intimate knowledge on him he saw the man behind the counter it was as if he were looking on him for the first time the russian proverb the heart of another is a dark forest gashed into his mind while he said  well hodson what news of your son  nothing more mr pierson thank you sir nothing more at present  and it seemed to pierson gazing at the mans face clothed in a short grizzling beard cut rather like his own that he must be thinking ah sir but what news of your daughter no one would ever tell him to his face what he was thinking and buying two pencils he went out on the other side of the road was a birdfanciers shop kept by a woman whose husband had been taken for the army she was not friendly towards him for it was known to her that he had expostulated with her husband for keeping larks and other wild birds and quite deliberately he crossed the road and stood looking in at the window with the morbid hope that from this unfriendly one he might hear truth she was in her shop and came to the door  have you any news of your husband mrs cherry  no mr pierson i ave not not this week  he hasnt gone out yet  no mr pierson e as not  there was no expression on her face perfectly blank it waspierson had a mad longing to say for gods sake woman speak out whats in your mind tell me what you think of me and my daughter never mind my cloth but he could no more say it than the woman could tell him what was in her mind and with a good morning he passed on no man or woman would tell him anything unless perhaps they were drunk he came to a public house and for a moment even hesitated before it but the thought of insult aimed at noel stopped him and he passed that too and then reality made itself known to him though he had come out to hear what they were thinking he did not really want to hear it could not endure it if he did he had been too long immune from criticism too long in the position of one who may tell others what he thinks of them and standing there in the crowded street he was attacked by that longing for the country which had always come on him when he was hard pressed he looked at his memoranda by stupendous luck it was almost a blank day an omnibus passed close by which would take him far out he climbed on to it and travelled as far as hendon then getting down set forth on foot it was bright and hot and the may blossom in full foam he walked fast along the perfectly straight road till he came to the top of elstree hill there for a few moments he stood gazing at the school chapel the cricketfield the wide land beyond all was very quiet for it was lunchtime a horse was tethered there and a strolling cat as though struck by the tall black incongruity of his figure paused in her progress then slithering under the wicket gate arched her back and rubbed herself against his leg crinkling and waving the tip of her tail pierson bent down and stroked the creatures head but uttering a faint miaou the cat stepped daintily across the road pierson too stepped on past the village and down over the stile into a field path at the edge of the young clover under a bank of hawthorn he lay down on his back with his hat beside him and his arms crossed over his chest like the effigy of some crusader one may see carved on an old tomb though he lay quiet as that old knight his eyes were not closed but fixed on the blue where a lark was singing its song refreshed his spirit its passionate lightheartedness stirred all the love of beauty in him awoke revolt against a world so murderous and uncharitable oh to pass up with that song into a land of bright spirits where was nothing ugly hard merciless and the gentle face of the saviour radiated everlasting love the scent of the mayflowers borne down by the sun shine drenched his senses he closed his eyes and at once as if resenting that momentary escape his mind resumed debate with startling intensity this matter went to the very wellsprings had a terrible and secret significance if to act as conscience bade him rendered him unfit to keep his parish all was built on sand had no deep reality was but rooted in convention charity and the forgiveness of sins honestly atoned forwhat became of them either he was wrong to have espoused straightforward confession and atonement for her or they were wrong in chasing him from that espousal there could be no making those extremes to meet but if he were wrong having done the hardest thing alreadywhere could he turn his church stood bankrupt of ideals he felt as if pushed over the edge of the world with feet on space and head in some blinding cloud i cannot have been wrong he thought any other course was so much easier i sacrificed my pride and my poor girls pride i would have loved to let her run away if for this we are to be stoned and cast forth what living force is there in the religion i have loved what does it all come to have i served a sham i cannot and will not believe it something is wrong with me something is wrongbut wherewhat he rolled over lay on his face and prayed he prayed for guidance and deliverance from the gusts of anger which kept sweeping over him even more for relief from the feeling of personal outrage and the unfairness of this thing he had striven to be loyal to what he thought the right had sacrificed all his sensitiveness all his secret fastidious pride in his child and himself for that he was to be thrown out whether through prayer or in the scent and feel of the clover he found presently a certain rest away in the distance he could see the spire of harrow church  the church no she was not could not be at fault the fault was in himself i am unpractical he thought it is so i know agnes used to say so bob and thirza think so they all think me unpractical and dreamy is it a sini wonder there were lambs in the next field he watched their gambollings and his heart relaxed brushing the clover dust off his black clothes he began to retrace his steps the boys were playing cricket now and he stood a few minutes watching them he had not seen cricket played since the war began it seemed almost otherworldly with the click of the bats and the shrill young voices under the distant drone of that skyhornet threshing along to hendon a boy made a good leg hit well played he called then suddenly conscious of his own incongruity and strangeness in that green spot he turned away on the road back to london to resign to await events to send noel awayof those three courses the last alone seemed impossible am i really so far from them he thought that they can wish me to go for this if so i had better go it will be just another failure but i wont believe it yet i cant believe it  the heat was sweltering and he became very tired before at last he reached his omnibus and could sit with the breeze cooling his hot face he did not reach home till six having eaten nothing since breakfast intending to have a bath and lie down till dinner he went upstairs  unwonted silence reigned he tapped on the nursery door it was deserted he passed through to noels room but that too was empty the wardrobe stood open as if it had been hastily ransacked and her dressingtable was bare in alarm he went to the bell and pulled it sharply the oldfashioned ring of it jingled out far below the parlourmaid came up  where are miss noel and nurse susan  i didnt know you were in sir miss noel left me this note to give you theyi  pierson stopped her with his hand thank you susan get me some tea please with the note unopened in his hand he waited till she was gone his head was going round and he sat down on the side of noels bed to read   darling daddy  the man who came this morning told me of what is going to happen i simply wont have it im sending nurse and baby down to kestrel at once and going to leilas for the night until ive made up my mind what to do i knew it was a mistake my coming back i dont care what happens to me but i wont have you hurt i think its hateful of people to try and injure you for my fault ive had to borrow money from susansix pounds oh daddy dear forgive me  your loving  nollie   he read it with unutterable relief at all events he knew where she waspoor wilful rushing lovinghearted child knew where she was and could get at her after his bath and some tea he would go to leilas and bring her back poor little nollie thinking that by just leaving his house she could settle this deep matter he did not hurry feeling decidedly exhausted and it was nearly eight before he set out leaving a message for gratian who did not as a rule come in from her hospital till past nine  the day was still glowing and now in the cool of evening his refreshed senses soaked up its beauty god has so made this world he thought that no matter what our struggles and sufferings its ever a joy to live when the sun shines or the moon is bright or the night starry even we cant spoil it in regents park the lilacs and laburnums were still in bloom though june had come and he gazed at them in passing as a lover might at his lady his conscience pricked him suddenly mrs mitchett and the darkeyed girl she had brought to him on new years eve the very night he had learned of his own daughters tragedyhad he ever thought of them since how had that poor girl fared he had been too impatient of her impenetrable mood what did he know of the hearts of others when he did not even know his own could not rule his feelings of anger and revolt had not guided his own daughter into the waters of safety and leila had he not been too censorious in thought how powerful how strange was this instinct of sex which hovered and swooped on lives seized them bore them away then dropped them exhausted and defenceless some munitionwagons painted a dull grey lumbered past driven by sunburned youths in drab lifeforce deathforcewas it all one the great unknowable momentum from which there was but the one escape in the arms of their heavenly father blakes little old stanzas came into his mind      and we are put on earth a little space      that we may learn to bear the beams of love      and these black bodies and this sunburnt face      are but a cloud and like a shady grove      for when our souls have learned the heat to bear      the cloud will vanish we shall hear his voice      saying come out from the grove my love and care      and round my golden tent like lambs rejoice  learned the heat to bear those lambs he had watched in a field that afternoon their sudden little leaps and rushes their funny quivering wriggling tails their tiny nuzzling black snoutswhat little miracles of careless joy among the meadow flowers lambs and flowers and sunlight famine lust and the great grey guns a maze a wilderness and but for faith what issue what path for man to take which did not keep him wandering hopeless in its thicket god preserve our faith in love in charity and the life to come he thought and a blind man with a dog to whose neck was tied a little deep dish for pennies ground a hurdygurdy as he passed pierson put a shilling in the dish the man stopped playing his whitish eyes looked up thank you kindly sir ill go home now come on dick he tapped his way round the corner with his dog straining in front a blackbird hidden among the blossoms of an acacia burst into evening song and another great grey munitionwagon rumbled out through the park gate 2  the churchclock was striking nine when he reached leilas flat went up and knocked sounds froma piano ceased the door was opened by noel she recoiled when she saw who it was and said  why did you come daddy it was much better not  are you alone here  yes leila gave me her key she has to be at the hospital till ten tonight  you must come home with me my dear  noel closed the piano and sat down on the divan her face had the same expression as when he had told her that she could not marry cyril morland  come nollie he said dont be unreasonable we must see this through together  no  my dear thats childish do you think the mere accident of your being or not being at home can affect my decision as to what my duty is  yes its my being there that matters those people dont care so long as it isnt an open scandal  nollie  but it is so daddy of course its so and you know it if im away theyll just pity you for having a bad daughter and quite right too i am a bad daughter  pierson smiled just like when you were a tiny  i wish i were a tiny again or ten years older its this half agebut im not coming back with you daddy so its no good  pierson sat down beside her  ive been thinking this over all day he said quietly perhaps in my pride i made a mistake when i first knew of your trouble perhaps i ought to have accepted the consequences of my failure then and have given up and taken you away at once after all if a man is not fit to have the care of souls he should have the grace to know it  but you are fit cried noel passionately daddy you are fit  im afraid not there is something wanting in me i dont know exactly what but something very wanting  there isnt its only that youre too goodthats why  pierson shook his head dont nollie  i will cried noel youre too gentle and youre too good youre charitable and youre simple and you believe in another world thats whats the matter with you daddy do you think they do those people who want to chase us out they dont even begin to believe whatever they say or think i hate them and sometimes i hate the church either its hard and narrow or else its worldly she stopped at the expression on her fathers face the most strange look of pain and horror as if an unspoken treachery of his own had been dragged forth for his inspection  youre talking wildly he said but his lips were trembling you mustnt say things like that theyre blasphemous and wicked  noel bit her lips sitting very stiff and still against a high blue cushion then she burst out again  youve slaved for those people years and years and youve had no pleasure and youve had no love and they wouldnt care that if you broke your heart they dont care for anything so long as it all seems proper daddy if you let them hurt you i wont forgive you  and what if you hurt me now nollie  noel pressed his hand against her warm cheek  oh no oh no i donti wont not again ive done that already  very well my dear then come home with me and well see whats best to be done it cant be settled by running away  noel dropped his hand no twice ive done what you wanted and its been a mistake if i hadnt gone to church on sunday to please you perhaps it would never have come to this you dont see things daddy i could tell though i was sitting right in front i knew what their faces were like and what they were thinking  one must do right nollie and not mind  yes but what is right its not right for me to hurt you and im not going to  pierson understood all at once that it was useless to try and move her  what are you going to do then  i suppose i shall go to kestrel tomorrow auntie will have me i know i shall talk to leila  whatever you do promise to let me know  noel nodded  daddy youlook awfully awfully tired im going to give you some medicine she went to a little threecornered cupboard and bent down medicine the medicine he wanted was not for the body knowledge of what his duty wasthat alone could heal him  the loud popping of a cork roused him what are you doing nollie  noel rose with a flushed face holding in one hand a glass of champagne in the other a biscuit  youre to take this and im going to have some myself  my dear said pierson bewildered its not yours  drink it daddy dont you know that leila would never forgive me if i let you go home looking like that besides she told me i was to eat drink it you can send her a nice present drink it and she stamped her foot  pierson took the glass and sat there nibbling and sipping it was nice very he had not quite realised how much he needed food and drink noel returned from the cupboard a second time she too had a glass and a biscuit  there you look better already now youre to go home at once in a cab if you can get one and tell gratian to make you feed up or you wont have a body at all you cant do your duty if you havent one you know  pierson smiled and finished the champagne  noel took the glass from him youre my child tonight and im going to send you to bed dont worry daddy itll all come right and taking his arm she went downstairs with him and blew him a kiss from the doorway  he walked away in a sort of dream daylight was not quite gone but the moon was up just past its full and the searchlights had begun their nightly wanderings it was a sky of ghosts and shadows fitting to the thought which came to him the finger of providence was in all this perhaps why should he not go out to france at last why not some better man who understood mens hearts who knew the world would take his place and he could go where death made all things simple and he could not fail he walked faster and faster full of an intoxicating relief thirza and gratian would take care of nollie far better than he yes surely it was ordained moonlight had the town now and all was steel blue the very air steelblue a dreamcity of marvellous beauty through which he passed exalted soon he would be where that poor boy and a million others had given their lives with the mud and the shells and the scarred grey ground and the jagged trees where christ was daily crucifiedthere where he had so often longed to be these three years past it was ordained  and two women whom he met looked at each other when he had gone by and those words the blighted crow which they had been about to speak died on their lips     viii  noel felt lighthearted too as if she had won a victory she found some potted meat spread it on another biscuit ate it greedily and finished the pint bottle of champagne then she hunted for the cigarettes and sat down at the piano she played old tunesthere is a tavern in the town once i loved a maiden fair mowing the barley clementine lowlands and sang to them such words as she remembered there was a delicious running in her veins and once she got up and danced she was kneeling at the window looking out when she heard the door open and without getting up cried out  isnt it a gorgeous night ive had daddy here i gave him some of your champagne and drank the rest then was conscious of a figure far too tall for leila and a mans voice saying  im awfully sorry its only i jimmy fort  noel scrambled up leila isnt in but she will be directlyits past ten  he was standing stockstill in the middle of the room  wont you sit down oh and wont you have a cigarette  thanks  by the flash of his briquette she saw his face clearly the look on it filled her with a sort of malicious glee  im going now she said would you mind telling leila that i found i couldnt stop she made towards the divan to get her hat when she had put it on she found him standing just in front of her  noelif you dont mind me calling you that  not a bit  dont go im going myself  oh no not for worlds she tried to slip past but he took hold of her wrist  please just one minute  noel stayed motionless looking at him while his hand still held her wrist he said quietly  do you mind telling me why you came here  oh just to see leila  things have come to a head at home havent they  noel shrugged her shoulders  you came for refuge didnt you  from whom  dont be angry from the need of hurting your father  she nodded  i knew it would come to that what are you going to do  enjoy myself she was saying something fatuous yet she meant it  thats absurd dont be angry youre quite right only you must begin at the right end mustnt you sit down  noel tried to free her wrist  no sit down please  noel sat down but as he loosed her wrist she laughed this was where he sat with leila where they would sit when she was gone its awfully funny isnt it she said  funny he muttered savagely most things are in this funny world  the sound of a taxi stopping not far off had come to her ears and she gathered her feet under her planting them firmly if she sprang up could she slip by him before he caught her arm again and get that taxi  if i go now he said will you promise me to stop till youve seen leila  no  thats foolish come promise  noel shook her head she felt a perverse pleasure at his embarrassment  leilas lucky isnt she no children no husband no father no anything lovely  she saw his arm go up as if to ward off a blow poor leila he said  why are you sorry for her she has freedom and she has you  she knew it would hurt but she wanted to hurt him  you neednt envy her for that  he had just spoken when noel saw a figure over by the door  she jumped up and said breathlessly  oh here you are leila fathers been here and weve had some of your champagne  capital you are in the dark  noel felt the blood rush into her cheeks the light leaped up and leila came forward she looked extremely pale calm and selfcontained in her nurses dress her full lips were tightly pressed together but noel could see her breast heaving violently a turmoil of shame and wounded pride began raging in the girl why had she not flown long ago why had she let herself be trapped like this leila would think she had been making up to him horrible disgusting why didnt hewhy didnt some one speak then leila said  i didnt expect you jimmy im glad you havent been dull noel is staying here tonight give me a cigarette sit down both of you im awfully tired  she sank into a chair leaning back with her knees crossed and at that moment noel admired her she had said it beautifully she looked so calm fort was lighting her cigarette his hand was shaking his face all sorry and mortified  give noel one too and draw the curtains jimmy quick not that it makes any difference its as light as day sit down dear  but noel remained standing  what have you been talking of love and chinese lanterns or only me  at those words fort who was drawing the last curtain turned round his tall figure was poised awkwardly against the wall his face unsuited to diplomacy had a look as of flesh being beaten if weals had started up across it noel would not have been surprised  he said with painful slowness  i dont exactly know we had hardly begun had we  the night is young said leila go on while i just take off my things  she rose with the cigarette between her lips and went into the inner room in passing she gave noel a look what there was in that look the girl could never make clear even to herself perhaps a creature shot would gaze like that with a sort of profound and distant questioning reproach and anger with a sort of pride and the quiver of death as the door closed fort came right across the room  go to her cried noel she wants you cant you see she wants you  and before he could move she was at the door she flew downstairs and out into the moonlight the taxi a little way off was just beginning to move away she ran towards it calling out  anywhere piccadilly and jumping in blotted herself against the cushions in the far corner  she did not come to herself as it were for several minutes and then feeling she could no longer bear the cab stopped it and got out where was she bond street she began idly wandering down its narrow length the fullest street by day the emptiest by night oh it had been horrible nothing said by any of themnothing and yet everything dragged outof him of leila of herself she seemed to have no pride or decency left as if she had been caught stealing all her happy exhilaration was gone leaving a miserable recklessness nothing she did was right nothing turned out well so what did it all matter the moonlight flooding down between the tall houses gave her a peculiar heady feeling fey her father had called her she laughed but im not going home she thought bored with the streets length she turned off and was suddenly in hanover square there was the church greywhite where she had been bridesmaid to a second cousin when she was fifteen she seemed to see it all againher frock the lilies in her hand the surplices of the choir the brides dress all moonlightcoloured and unreal i wonder whats become of her she thought hes dead i expect like cyril she saw her fathers face as he was marrying them heard his voice for better for worse for richer for poorer in sickness and in health till death do you part and the moonlight on the church seemed to shift and quiversome pigeons perhaps had been disturbed up there then instead of that wedding vision she saw monsieur barra sitting on his chair gazing at the floor and chica nursing her doll all mad mademoiselle a little mad millions of men with white souls but all a little tiny bit mad you know then leilas face came before her with that look in her eyes she felt again the hot clasp of forts fingers on her wrist and walked on rubbing it with the other hand she turned into regent street the wide curve of the quadrant swept into a sky of unreal blue and the orangeshaded lamps merely added to the unreality love and chinese lanterns i should like some coffee she thought suddenly she was quite close to the place where lavendie had taken her should she go in there why not she must go somewhere she turned into the revolving cage of glass but no sooner was she imprisoned there than in a flash lavendies face of disgust and the redlipped women the green stuff that smelled of peppermint came back filling her with a rush of dismay she made the full circle in the revolving cage and came out into the street again with a laugh a tall young man in khaki stood there hallo he said come in and dance she started recoiled from him and began to walk away as fast as ever she could she passed a woman whose eyes seemed to scorch her a woman like a swift vision of ruin with those eyes and thickly powdered cheeks and loose red mouth noel shuddered and fled along feeling that her only safety lay in speed but she could not walk about all night there would be no train for kestrel till the morningand did she really want to go there and eat her heart out suddenly she thought of george why should she not go down to him he would know what was best for her to do at the foot of the steps below the waterloo column she stood still all was quiet there and empty the great buildings whitened the trees blurred and blue and sweeter air was coming across their flowering tops the queer fey moony sensation was still with her so that she felt small and light as if she could have floated through a ring faint rims of light showed round the windows of the admiralty the war however lovely the night however sweet the lilac smeltthat never stopped she turned away and passed out under the arch making for the station the train of the wounded had just come in and she stood in the cheering crowd watching the ambulances run out tears of excited emotion filled her eyes and trickled down steady smooth grey one after the other they came gliding with a little burst of cheers greeting each one all were gone now and she could pass in she went to the buffet and got a large cup of coffee and a bun then having noted the time of her early morning train she sought the ladies waitingroom and sitting down in a corner took out her purse and counted her money two pounds fifteenenough to go to the hotel if she liked but without luggageit was so conspicuous and she could sleep in this corner all right if she wanted what did girls do who had no money and no friends to go to tucked away in the corner of that empty heavy varnished room she seemed to see the cruelty and hardness of life as she had never before seen it not even when facing her confinement how lucky she had been and was everyone was good to her she had no real want or dangers to face but for womenyes and men toowho had no one to fall back on nothing but their own hands and health and luck it must be awful that girl whose eyes had scorched herperhaps she had no onenothing and people who were born ill and the millions of poor women like those whom she had gone visiting with gratian sometimes in the poorer streets of her fathers parishfor the first time she seemed to really know and feel the sort of lives they led and then leilas face came back to her once moreleila whom she had robbed and the worst of it was that alongside her remorseful sympathy she felt a sort of satisfaction she could not help his not loving leila she could not help it if he loved herself and he didshe knew it to feel that anyone loved her was so comforting but it was all awful and shethe cause of it and yetshe had never done or said anything to attract him no she could not have helped it  she had begun to feel drowsy and closed her eyes and gradually there came on her a cosey sensation as if she were leaning up against someone with her head tucked in against his shoulder as she had so often leaned as a child against her father coming back from some long darkening drive in wales or scotland she seemed even to feel the wet soft westerly air on her face and eyelids and to sniff the scent of a frieze coat to hear the jog of hoofs and the rolling of the wheels to feel the closing in of the darkness then so dimly and drowsily she seemed to know that it was not her father but someonesomeonethen no more no more at all     ix  she was awakened by the scream of an engine and looked around her amazed her neck had fallen sideways while she slept and felt horridly stiff her head ached and she was shivering she saw by the clock that it was past five if only i could get some tea she thought anyway i wont stay here any longer when she had washed and rubbed some of the stiffness out of her neck the tea renewed her sense of adventure wonderfully her train did not start for an hour she had time for a walk to warm herself and went down to the river there was an early haze and all looked a little mysterious but people were already passing on their way to work she walked along looking at the water flowing up under the bright mist to which the gulls gave a sort of hovering life she went as far as blackfriars bridge and turning back sat down on a bench under a planetree just as the sun broke through a little pasty woman with a pinched yellowish face was already sitting there so still and seeming to see so little that noel wondered of what she could be thinking while she watched the womans face began puckering and tears rolled slowly down trickling from pucker to pucker till summoning up her courage noel sidled nearer and said  oh whats the matter  the tears seemed to stop from sheer surprise little grey eyes gazed round patient little eyes from above an almost bridgeless nose  iad a baby its dead its fathers dead in france i was goin in the water but i didnt like the look of it and now i never will  that now i never will moved noel terribly she slid her arm along the back of the bench and clasped the skinniest of shoulders  dont cry  it was my first im thirtyeight ill never ave another oh why didnt i go in the water  the face puckered again and the squeezedout tears ran down of course she must cry thought noel cry and cry till it feels better and she stroked the shoulder of the little woman whose emotion was disengaging the scent of old clothes  the father of my baby was killed in france too she said at last the little sad grey eyes looked curiously round  was e ave you got your baby still  yes oh yes  im glad of that it urts so bad it does id rather lose me usband than me baby any day the sun was shining now on a cheek of that terribly patient face its brightness seemed cruel perching there  can i do anything to help you noel murmured  no thank you miss im goin ome now i dont live far thank you kindly and raising her eyes for one more of those halfbewildered looks she moved away along the embankment wall when she was out of sight noel walked back to the station the train was in and she took her seat she had three fellow passengers all in khaki very silent and moody as men are when they have to get up early one was tall dark and perhaps thirtyfive the second small and about fifty with cropped scanty grey hair the third was of medium height and quite sixtyfive with a long row of little coloured patches on his tunic and a bald narrow wellshaped head grey hair brushed back at the sides and the thin collected features and drooping moustache of the old school it was at him that noel looked when he glanced out of the window or otherwise retired within himself she liked his face but when he turned to the ticketcollector or spoke to the others she did not like it half so much it was as if the old fellow had two selves one of which he used when alone the other in which he dressed every morning to meet the world they had begun to talk about some tribunal on which they had to sit noel did not listen but a word or two carried to her now and then  how many today she heard the old fellow ask and the little cropped man answering hundred and fourteen  fresh from the sight of the poor little shabby woman and her grief she could not help a sort of shrinking from that trim old soldier with his thin regular face who held the fate of a hundred and fourteen in his firm narrow grasp perhaps every day would he understand their troubles or wants of course he wouldnt then she saw him looking at her critically with his keen eyes if he had known her secret he would be thinking a lady and act like that oh no quitequite out of the question and she felt as if she could sink under the seat with shame but no doubt he was only thinking very young to be travelling by herself at this hour of the morning pretty too if he knew the real truth of herhow he would stare but why should this utter stranger this old disciplinarian by a casual glance by the mere form of his face make her feel more guilty and ashamed than she had yet felt that puzzled her he was must be a narrow conventional old man but he had this power to make her feel ashamed because she felt that he had faith in his gods and was true to them because she knew he would die sooner than depart from his creed of conduct she turned to the window biting her lipsangry and despairing she would nevernever get used to her position it was no good and again she had the longing of her dream to tuck her face away into that coat smell the scent of the frieze snuggle in be protected and forget if i had been that poor lonely little woman she thought and had lost everything i should have gone into the water i should have rushed and jumped its only luck that im alive i wont look at that old man again then i shant feel so bad  she had bought some chocolate at the station and nibbled it gazing steadily at the fields covered with daisies and the first of the buttercups and cowslips the three soldiers were talking now in carefully lowered voices the words women under control perfect plague came to her making her ears burn in the hypersensitive mood caused by the strain of yesterday her broken night and the emotional meeting with the little woman she felt as if they were including her among those women if we stop ill get out she thought but when the train did stop it was they who got out she felt the old generals keen veiled glance sum her up for the last time and looked full at him just for a moment he touched his cap and said will you have the window up or down and lingered to draw it halfway up his punctiliousness made her feel worse than ever when the train had started again she roamed up and down her empty carriage there was no more a way out of her position than out of this rolling cushioned carriage and then she seemed to hear forts voice saying sit down please and to feel his fingers clasp her wrist oh he was nice and comforting he would never reproach or remind her and now probably she would never see him again  the train drew up at last she did not know where george lodged and would have to go to his hospital she planned to get there at half past nine and having eaten a sort of breakfast at the station went forth into the town the seaside was still wrapped in the early glamour which haunts chalk of a bright morning but the streets were very much alive here was real business of the war she passed houses which had been wrecked trucks clanged and shunted great lorries rumbled smoothly by seaand airplanes were moving like great birds far up in the bright haze and khaki was everywhere but it was the sea noel wanted she made her way westward to a little beach and sitting down on a stone opened her arms to catch the sun on her face and chest the tide was nearly up with the wavelets of a blue bright sea the great fact the greatest fact in the world except the sun vast and free making everything human seem small and transitory it did her good like a tranquillising friend the sea might be cruel and terrible awful things it could do and awful things were being done on it but its wide level line its neverending song its sane savour were the best medicine she could possibly have taken she rubbed the shelly sand between her fingers in absurd ecstasy took off her shoes and stockings paddled and sat drying her legs in the sun  when she left the little beach she felt as if someone had said to her  your troubles are very little theres the sun the sea the air enjoy them they cant take those from you  at the hospital she had to wait half an hour in a little bare room before george came  nollie splendid ive got an hour lets get out of this cemetery well have time for a good stretch on the tops jolly of you to have come to me tell us all about it  when she had finished he squeezed her arm 348  i knew it wouldnt do your dad forgot that hes a public figure and must expect to be damned accordingly but though youve cut and run hell resign all the same nollie  oh no cried noel  george shook his head  yes hell resign youll see hes got no worldly sense not a grain  then i shall have spoiled his life just as ifoh no  lets sit down here i must be back at eleven  they sat down on a bench where the green cliff stretched out before them over a sea quite clear of haze far down and very blue  why should he resign cried noel again now that ive gone hell be lost without it all  george smiled  found my dear hell be where he ought to be nollie where the church is and the churchmen are notin the air  dont cried noel passionately  no no im not chaffing theres no room on earth for saints in authority theres use for a saintly symbol even if one doesnt hold with it but theres no mortal use for those who try to have things both waysto be saints and seers of visions and yet to come the practical and worldly and rule ordinary mens lives saintly example yes but not saintly governance youve been his deliverance nollie  but daddy loves his church  george frowned of course itll be a wrench a mans bound to have a cosey feeling about a place where hes been boss so long and there is something about a churchthe drone the scent the half darkness theres beauty in it its a pleasant drug but hes not being asked to give up the drug habit only to stop administering drugs to others dont worry nollie i dont believe thats ever suited him it wants a thicker skin than hes got  but all the people he helps  no reason he shouldnt go on helping people is there  but to go on living there withoutmother died there you know  george grunted dreams nollie all round him of the past and the future of what people are and what he can do with them i never see him without a skirmish as you know and yet im fond of him but i should be twice as fond and half as likely to skirmish if hed drop the habits of authority then i believe hed have some real influence over me theres something beautiful about him i know that quite well  yes murmured noel fervently  hes such a queer mixture mused george clean out of his age chalks above most of the parsons in a spiritual sense and chalks below most of them in the worldly and yet i believe hes in the right of it the church ought to be a forlorn hope nollie then we should believe in it instead of that its a sort of business that no one can take too seriously you see the church spiritual cant make good in this agehas no chance of making good and so in the main its given it up for vested interests and social influence your father is a symbol of what the church is not but what about you my dear theres a room at my boardinghouse and only one old lady besides myself who knits all the time if grace can get shifted well find a house and you can have the baby theyll send your luggage on from paddington if you write and in the meantime gracies got some things here that you can have  ill have to send a wire to daddy  ill do that you come to my diggings at half past one and ill settle you in until then youd better stay up here  when he had gone she roamed a little farther and lay down on the short grass where the chalk broke through in patches she could hear a distant rumbling very low travelling in that grass the long mutter of the flanders guns i wonder if its as beautiful a day there she thought how dreadful to see no green no butterflies no flowersnot even skyfor the dust of the shells oh wont it ever ever end and a sort of passion for the earth welled up in her the warm grassy earth along which she lay pressed so close that she could feel it with every inch of her body and the soft spikes of the grass against her nose and lips an aching sweetness tortured her she wanted the earth to close its arms about her she wanted the answer to her embrace of it she was alive and wanted love not deathnot lonelinessnot death and out there where the guns muttered millions of men would be thinking that same thought     x  pierson had passed nearly the whole night with the relics of his past the records of his stewardship the tokens of his short married life the idea which had possessed him walking home in the moonlight sustained him in that melancholy task of docketing and destruction there was not nearly so much to do as one would have supposed for with all his dreaminess he had been oddly neat and businesslike in all parish matters but a hundred times that night he stopped overcome by memories every corner drawer photograph paper was a thread in the longspun web of his life in this house some phase of his work some vision of his wife or daughters started forth from each bit of furniture picture doorway noiseless in his slippers he stole up and down between the study diningroom drawingroom and anyone seeing him at his work in the dim light which visited the staircase from above the front door and the upperpassage window would have thought a ghost a ghost gone into mourning for the condition of the world he had to make this reckoning tonight while the exaltation of his new idea was on him had to rummage out the very depths of old association so that once for all he might know whether he had strength to close the door on the past five oclock struck before he had finished and almost dropping from fatigue sat down at his little piano in bright daylight the last memory to beset him was the first of all his honeymoon before they came back to live in this house already chosen furnished and waiting for them they had spent it in germanythe first days in badenbaden and each morning had been awakened by a chorale played down in the gardens of the kurhaus a gentle beautiful tune to remind them that they were in heaven and softly so softly that the tunes seemed to be but dreams he began playing those old chorales one after another so that the stilly sounds floated out through the opened window puzzling the early birds and cats and those few humans who were abroad as yet  he received the telegram from noel in the afternoon of the same day just as he was about to set out for leilas to get news of her and close on the top of it came lavendie he found the painter standing disconsolate in front of his picture  mademoiselle has deserted me  im afraid we shall all desert you soon monsieur  you are going  yes i am leaving here i hope to go to france  and mademoiselle  she is at the sea with my soninlaw  the painter ran his hands through his hair but stopped them halfway as if aware that he was being guilty of illbreeding  mon dieu he said is this not a calamity for you monsieur le cure but his sense of the calamity was so patently limited to his unfinished picture that pierson could not help a smile  ah monsieur said the painter on whom nothing was lost comme je suis egoiste i show my feelings it is deplorable my disappointment must seem a bagatelle to you who will be so distressed at leaving your old home this must be a time of great trouble believe me i understand but to sympathise with a grief which is not shown would be an impertinence would it not you english gentlefolk do not let us share your griefs you keep them to yourselves  pierson stared true he said quite true  i am no judge of christianity monsieur but for us artists the doors of the human heart stand open our own and others i suppose we have no pridecest tresindelicat tell me monsieur you would not think it worthy of you to speak to me of your troubles would you as i have spoken of mine  pierson bowed his head abashed  you preach of universal charity and love went on lavendie but how can there be that when you teach also secretly the keeping of your troubles to yourselves man responds to example not to teaching you set the example of the stranger not the brother you expect from others what you do not give frankly monsieur do you not feel that with every revelation of your soul and feelings virtue goes out of you and i will tell you why if you will not think it an offence in opening your hearts you feel that you lose authority you are officers and must never forget that is it not so  pierson grew red i hope there is another feeling too i think we feel that to speak of our sufferings or deeper feelings is to obtrude oneself to make a fuss to be selfconcerned when we might be concerned with others  monsieur au fond we are all concerned with self to seem selfless is but your particular way of cultivating the perfection of self you admit that not to obtrude self is the way to perfect yourself eh bien what is that but a deeper concern with self to be free of this there is no way but to forget all about oneself in what one is doing as i forget everything when i am painting but he added with a sudden smile you would not wish to forget the perfecting of selfit would not be right in your profession so i must take away this picture must i not it is one of my best works i regret much not to have finished it  some day perhaps  some day the picture will stand still but mademoiselle will not she will rush at something and behold this face will be gone no i prefer to keep it as it is it has truth now and lifting down the canvas he stood it against the wall and folded up the easel bon soir monsieur you have been very good to me he wrung piersons hand and his face for a moment seemed all eyes and spirit adieu  goodbye pierson murmured god bless you  i dont know if i have great confidence in him replied lavendie but i shall ever remember that so good a man as you has wished it to mademoiselle my distinguished salutations if you please if you will permit me i will come back for my other things tomorrow and carrying easel and canvas he departed  pierson stayed in the old drawingroom waiting for gratian to come in and thinking over the painters words had his education and position really made it impossible for him to be brotherly was this the secret of the impotence which he sometimes felt the reason why charity and love were not more alive in the hearts of his congregation god knows ive no consciousness of having felt myself superior he thought and yet i would be truly ashamed to tell people of my troubles and of my struggles can it be that christ if he were on earth would count us pharisees believing ourselves not as other men but surely it is not as christians but rather as gentlemen that we keep ourselves to ourselves officers he called us i feari fear it is true ah well there would not be many more days now he would learn out there how to open the hearts of others and his own suffering and death levelled all barriers made all men brothers he was still sitting there when gratian came in and taking her hand he said  noel has gone down to george and i want you to get transferred and go to them gracie im giving up the parish and asking for a chaplaincy  giving up after all this time is it because of nollie  no i think not i think the time has come i feel my work here is barren  oh no and even if it is its only because  pierson smiled because of what gracie  dad its what ive felt in myself we want to think and decide things for ourselves we want to own our consciences we cant take things at secondhand any longer  piersons face darkened ah he said to have lost faith is a grievous thing  were gaining charity cried gratian  the two things are not opposed my dear  not in theory but in practice i think they often are oh dad you look so tired have you really made up your mind wont you feel lost  for a little i shall find myself out there  but the look on his face was too much for gratians composure and she turned away  pierson went down to his study to write his letter of resignation sitting before that blank sheet of paper he realised to the full how strongly he had resented the public condemnation passed on his own flesh and blood how much his action was the expression of a purely mundane championship of his daughter of a mundane mortification pride he thought ought i to stay and conquer it twice he set his pen down twice took it up again he could not conquer it to stay where he was not wanted on a sort of sufferancenever and while he sat before that empty sheet of paper he tried to do the hardest thing a man can doto see himself as others see him and met with such success as one might expectharking at once to the verdicts not of others at all but of his own conscience and coming soon to that perpetual gnawing sense which had possessed him ever since the war began that it was his duty to be dead this feeling that to be alive was unworthy of him when so many of his flock had made the last sacrifice was reinforced by his domestic tragedy and the bitter disillusionment it had brought a sense of having lost caste weighed on him while he sat there with his past receding from him dusty and unreal he had the queerest feeling of his old life falling from him dropping round his feet like the outworn scales of a serpent rung after rung of tasks and duties performed day after day year after year had they ever been quite real well he had shed them now and was to move out into life illumined by the great realitydeath and taking up his pen he wrote his resignation     xi  1  the last sunday sunny and bright though he did not ask her to go gratian went to every service that day and the sight of her after this long interval in their old pew where once he had been wont to see his wifes face and draw refreshment therefrom affected pierson more than anything else he had told no one of his coming departure shrinking from the falsity and suppression which must underlie every allusion and expression of regret in the last minute of his last sermon he would tell them he went through the day in a sort of dream truly proud and sensitive under this social blight he shrank from all alike made no attempt to single out supporters or adherents from those who had fallen away he knew there would be some perhaps many seriously grieved that he was going but to try and realise who they were to weigh them in the scales against the rest and so forth was quite against his nature it was all or nothing but when for the last time of all those hundreds he mounted the steps of his dark pulpit he showed no trace of finality did not perhaps even feel it yet for so beautiful a summer evening the congregation was large in spite of all reticence rumour was busy and curiosity still rife the writers of the letters anonymous and otherwise had spent a week not indeed in proclaiming what they had done but in justifying to themselves the secret fact that they had done it and this was best achieved by speaking to their neighbours of the serious and awkward situation of the poor vicar the result was visible in a better attendance than had been seen since summertime began  pierson had never been a great preacher his voice lacked resonance and pliancy his thought breadth and buoyancy and he was not free from the singsong which mars the utterance of many who have to speak professionally but he always made an impression of goodness and sincerity on this last sunday evening he preached again the first sermon he had ever preached from that pulpit fresh from the honeymoon with his young wife solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these it lacked now the happy fervour of that most happy of all his days yet gained poignancy coming from so worn a face and voice gratian who knew that he was going to end with his farewell was in a choke of emotion long before he came to it she sat winking away her tears and not till he paused for so long that she thought his strength had failed did she look up he was leaning a little forward seeming to see nothing but his hands grasping the pulpits edge were quivering there was deep silence in the church for the look of his face and figure was strange even to gratian when his lips parted again to speak a mist covered her eyes and she lost sight of him  friends i am leaving you these are the last words i shall ever speak in this place i go to other work you have been very good to me god has been very good to me i pray with my whole heart that he may bless you all amen amen  the mist cleared into tears and she could see him again gazing down at her was it at her he was surely seeing somethingsome vision sweeter than reality something he loved more dearly she fell on her knees and buried her face in her hand all through the hymn she knelt and through his clear slow benediction the peace of god which passeth all understanding keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge and love of god and of his son jesus christ our lord and the blessing of god almighty the father the son and the holy ghost be amongst you and remain with you always and still she knelt on till she was alone in the church then she rose and stole home he did not come in she did not expect him its over she kept thinking all over my beloved daddy now he has no home nollie and i have pulled him down and yet i couldnt help it and perhaps she couldnt poor nollie   2  pierson had stayed in the vestry talking with his choir and wardens there was no hitch for his resignation had been accepted and he had arranged with a friend to carry on till the new vicar was appointed when they were gone he went back into the empty church and mounted to the organloft a little window up there was open and he stood leaning against the stone looking out resting his whole being only now that it was over did he know what stress he had been through sparrows were chirping but sound of traffic had almost ceased in that quiet sunday hour of the evening meal finished incredible that he would never come up here again never see those rooflines that corner of square garden and hear this familiar chirping of the sparrows he sat down at the organ and began to play the last time the sound would roll out and echo round the emptied house of god for a long time he played while the building darkened slowly down there below him of all that he would leave he would miss this mostthe right to come and play here in the darkening church to release emotional sound in this dim empty space growing ever more beautiful from chord to chord he let himself go deeper and deeper into the surge and swell of those sound waves losing all sense of actuality till the music and the whole dark building were fused in one rapturous solemnity away down there the darkness crept over the church till the pews the altarall was invisible save the columns and the walls he began playing his favourite slow movement from beethovens seventh symphonykept to the end for the visions it ever brought him and a cat which had been stalking the sparrows crept in through the little window and crouched startled staring at him with her green eyes he closed the organ went quickly down and locked up his church for the last time it was warmer outside than in and lighter for daylight was not quite gone he moved away a few yards and stood looking up walls buttresses and spire were clothed in milky shadowy grey the top of the spire seemed to touch a star goodbye my church he thought goodbye goodbye he felt his face quiver clenched his teeth and turned away     xii  when noel fled fort had started forward to stop her then realising that with his lameness he could never catch her he went back and entered leilas bedroom  she had taken off her dress and was standing in front of her glass with the cigarette still in her mouth and the only movement was the curling of its blue smoke he could see her face reflected pale with a little spot of red in each cheek and burning red ears she had not seemed to hear him coming in but he saw her eyes change when they caught his reflection in the mirror from lost and blank they became alive and smouldering  noels gone he said  she answered as if to his reflection in the glass  and you havent gone too ah no of courseyour leg she fled i suppose it was rather a jar my coming in im afraid  no it was my coming in that was the jar  leila turned round jimmy i wonder you could discuss me the rest she shrugged her shouldersbut that  i was not discussing you i merely said you were not to be envied for having me are you  the moment he had spoken he was sorry the anger in her eyes changed instantly first to searching then to misery she cried out  i was to be envied oh jimmy i was and flung herself face down on the bed  through forts mind went the thought atrocious how could he soothemake her feel that he loved her when he didntthat he wanted her when he wanted noel he went up to the bedside and touched her timidly  leila what is it youre overtired whats the matter i couldnt help the childs being here why do you let it upset you shes gone its all right things are just as they were  yes came the strangled echo just  he knelt down and stroked her arm it shivered under the touch seemed to stop shivering and wait for the next touch as if hoping it might be warmer shivered again  look at me he said what is it you want im ready to do anything  she turned and drew herself up on the bed screwing herself back against the pillow as if for support with her knees drawn under her he was astonished at the strength of her face and figure thus entrenched  my dear jimmy she said i want you to do nothing but get me another cigarette at my age one expects no more than one gets she held out her thumb and finger do you mind  fort turned away to get the cigarette with what bitter restraint and curious little smile she had said that but no sooner was he out of the room and hunting blindly for the cigarettes than his mind was filled with an aching concern for noel fleeing like that reckless and hurt with nowhere to go he found the polished birchwood box which held the cigarettes and made a desperate effort to dismiss the image of the girl before he again reached leila she was still sitting there with her arms crossed in the stillness of one whose every nerve and fibre was stretched taut  have one yourself she said the pipe of peace  fort lit the cigarettes and sat down on the edge of the bed and his mind at once went back to noel  yes she said suddenly i wonder where shes gone can you see her she might do something reckless a second time poor jimmy it would be a pity and so that monks been here and drunk champagne good idea get me some jimmy  again fort went and with him the image of the girl when he came back the second time she had put on that dark silk garment in which she had appeared suddenly radiant the fatal night after the queens hall concert she took the wineglass and passed him going into the sittingroom  come and sit down she said is your leg hurting you  not more than usual and he sat down beside her  wont you have some in vino veritas my friend  he shook his head and said humbly i admire you leila  thats lucky i dont know anyone else who would and she drank her champagne at a draught  dont you wish she said suddenly that i had been one of those wonderful new women all brain and good works how i should have talked the universe up and down and the war and causes drinking tea and never boring you to try and love me what a pity  but to fort there had come noels words its awfully funny isnt it  leila he said suddenly somethings got to be done so long as you dont wish me to ill promise never to see that child again  my dear boy shes not a child shes ripe for love andim too ripe for love thats whats the matter and ive got to lump it she wrenched her hand out of his and dropping the empty glass covered her face the awful sensation which visits the true englishman when a scene stares him in the face spun in forts brain should he seize her hands drag them down and kiss her should he get up and leave her alone speak or keep silent try to console try to pretend and he did absolutely nothing so far as a man can understand that moment in a womans life when she accepts the defeat of youth and beauty he understood perhaps but it was only a glimmering he understood much better how she was recognising once for all that she loved where she was not loved  and i cant help that he thought dumbly simply cant help that nothing he could say or do would alter it no words can convince a woman when kisses have lost reality then to his infinite relief she took her hands from her face and said  this is very dull i think youd better go jimmy  he made an effort to speak but was too afraid of falsity in his voice  very nearly a scene said leila my god  how men hate them so do i ive had too many in my time nothing comes of them but a headache next morning ive spared you that jimmy give me a kiss for it  he bent down and put his lips to hers with all his heart he tried to answer the passion in her kiss she pushed him away suddenly and said faintly  thank you you did try  fort dashed his hand across his eyes the sight of her face just then moved him horribly what a brute he felt he took her limp hand put it to his lips and murmured  i shall come in tomorrow well go to the theatre shall we good night leila  but in opening the door he caught sight of her face staring at him evidently waiting for him to turn the eyes had a frightened look they went suddenly soft so soft as to give his heart a squeeze  she lifted her hand blew him a kiss and he saw her smiling without knowing what his own lips answered he went out he could not make up his mind to go away but crossing to the railings stood leaning against them looking up at her windows she had been very good to him he felt like a man who has won at cards and sneaked away without giving the loser his revenge if only she hadnt loved him and it had been a soulless companionship a quite sordid business anything rather than this english to the backbone he could not divest himself of a sense of guilt to see no way of making up to her of straightening it out made him feel intensely mean shall i go up again he thought the windowcurtain moved then the shreds of light up there vanished shes gone to bed he thought i should only upset her worse where is noel now i wonder i shall never see her again i suppose altogether a bad business my god yes a badbad business  and painfully for his leg was hurting him he walked away  leila was only too well aware of a truth that feelings are no less real poignant and important to those outside moralitys ring fence than to those within her feelings were indeed probably even more real and poignant just as a wild fruits flavour is sharper than that of the tame product opinionshe knewwould say that having wilfully chosen a position outside morality she had not half the case for brokenheartedness she would have had if fort had been her husband opinionshe knewwould say she had no claim on him and the sooner an illegal tie was broken the better but she felt fully as wretched as if she had been married she had not wanted to be outside morality never in her life wanted to be that she was like those who by confession shed their sins and start again with a clear conscience she never meant to sin only to love and when she was in love nothing else mattered for the moment but though a gambler she had always so far paid up only this time the stakes were the heaviest a woman can put down it was her last throw and she knew it so long as a woman believed in her attraction there was hope even when the curtain fell on a loveaffair but for leila the lamp of belief had suddenly gone out and when this next curtain dropped she felt that she must sit in the dark until old age made her indifferent and between fortyfour and real old age a gulf is fixed this was the first time a man had tired of her why he had been tired before he began or so she felt in one swift moment as of a drowning person she saw again all the passages of their companionship knew with certainty that it had never been a genuine flame shame ran consuming in her veins she buried her face in the cushions this girl had possessed his real heart all the time with a laugh she thought i put my money on the wrong horse i ought to have backed edward i could have turned that poor monks head if only i had never seen jimmy again if i had torn his letter up i could have made poor edward love me ifs what folly things happened as they must  and starting up she began to roam the little room without jimmy she would be wretched with him she would be wretched too i cant bear to see his face she thought and i cant live here without him its really funny the thought of her hospital filled her with loathing to go there day after day with this despair eating at her heartshe simply could not she went over her resources she had more money than she thought jimmy had given her a christmas present of five hundred pounds she had wanted to tear up the cheque or force him to take it back but the realities of the previous five years had prevailed with her and she had banked it she was glad now she had not to consider money her mind sought to escape in the past she thought of her first husband ronny fane of their mosquitocurtained rooms in that ghastly madras heat poor ronny what a pale cynical young ghost started up under that name she thought of lynch his horsey matteroffact solidity she had loved them bothfor a time she thought of the veldt of constantia and the loom of table mountain under the stars and the first sight of jimmy his straight look the curve of his crisp head the kind fightingschoolboy frankness of his face even now after all those months of their companionship that longago evening at grape harvest when she sang to him under the scented creepers was the memory of him most charged with real feeling that one evening at any rate he had longed for her eleven years ago when she was in her prime she could have held her own then noel would have come in vain to think that this girl had still fifteen years before she would be even in her prime fifteen years of witchery and then another ten before she was on the shelf why if noel married jimmy he would be an old man doting on her still by the time she had reached this fatal age of fortyfour she felt as if she must scream and stuffing her handkerchief into her mouth turned out the light darkness cooled her a little she pulled aside the curtains and let in the moon light jimmy and that girl were out in it some where seeking each other if not in body then in thought and soon somehow somewhere they would come togethercome together because fate meant them to fate which had given her young cousin a likeness to herself placed her too in just such a hopeless position as appealed to jimmy and gave him a chance against younger men she saw it with bitter surety good gamblers cut their losses yes and proud women did not keep unwilling lovers if she had even an outside chance she would trail her pride drag it through the mud through thorns but she had not and she clenched her fist and struck out at the night as though at the face of that fate which one could never reachimpalpable remorseless surrounding fate with its faint mocking smile devoid of all human warmth nothing could set back the clock and give her what this girl had time had done her in as it did in every woman one by one and she saw herself going down the years powdering a little more painting a little more touching up her hair till it was all artifice holding on by every little deviceand all to what end to see his face get colder and colder hear his voice more and more constrained to gentleness and know that underneath aversion was growing with the thought you are keeping me from life and love till one evening in sheer nervebreak she would say or do some fearful thing and he would come no more no jimmy she thought find her and stay with her youre not worth all that and puffing to the curtains as though with that gesture she could shut out her creeping fate she turned up the light and sat down at her writing table she stayed some minutes motionless her chin resting on her hands the dark silk fallen down from her arms a little mirror framed in curiously carved ivory picked up by her in an indian bazaar twentyfive years ago hung on a level with her face and gave that face back to her im not ugly she thought passionately im not i still have some looks left if only that girl hadnt come and it was all my doing oh what made me write to both of them edward and jimmy she turned the mirror aside and took up a pen   my dear jimmy she wrote it will be better for us both if you take a holiday from here dont come again till i write for you im sorry i made you so much disturbance tonight have a good time and a good rest and dont worry your   so far she had written when a tear dropped on the page and she had to tear it up and begin again this time she wrote to the endyour leila i must post it now she thought or he may not get it before tomorrow evening i couldnt go through with this again she hurried out with it and slipped it in a pillar box the night smelled of flowers and hastening back she lay down and stayed awake for hours tossing and staring at the dark     xiii  1  leila had pluck but little patience her one thought was to get away and she at once began settling up her affairs and getting a permit to return to south africa the excitements of purchase and preparation were as good an anodyne as she could have taken the perils of the sea were at full just then and the prospect of danger gave her a sort of pleasure if i go down she thought all the better brisk instead of long and dreary but when she had the permit and her cabin was booked the irrevocability of her step came to her with full force should she see him again or no her boat started in three days and she must decide if in compunction he were to be affectionate she knew she would never keep to her decision and then the horror would begin again till again she was forced to this same action she let the hours go and go till the very day before when the ache to see him and the dread of it had become so unbearable that she could not keep quiet late that afternooneverything to the last label readyshe went out still undecided an itch to turn the dagger in her wound to know what had become of noel took her to edwards house almost unconsciously she had put on her prettiest frock and spent an hour before the glass a feverishness of soul more than of body which had hung about her ever since that night gave her colour she looked her prettiest and she bought a gardenia at a shop in baker street and fastened it in her dress reaching the old square she was astonished to see a board up with the words to let though the house still looked inhabited she rang and was shown into the drawingroom she had only twice been in this house before and for some reason perhaps because of her own unhappiness the old rather shabby room struck her as pathetic as if inhabited by the past i wonder what his wife was like she thought and then she saw hanging against a strip of black velvet on the wall that faded colour sketch of the slender young woman leaning forward with her hands crossed in her lap the colouring was lavender and old ivory with faint touches of rose the eyes so living were a little like gratians the whole face delicate eager good yes she thought he must have loved you very much to say goodbye must have been hard she was still standing before it when pierson came in  thats a dear face edward ive come to say goodbye im leaving for south africa tomorrow and as her hand touched his she thought i must have been mad to think i could ever have made him love me  are youare you leaving him  leila nodded  thats very brave and wonderful  oh no needs must when the devil drivesthats all i dont give up happiness of my own accord thats not within a hundred miles of the truth what i shall become i dont know but nothing better you may be sure i give up because i cant keep and you know why where is noel  down at the sea with george and gratian  he was looking at her in wonder and the pained puzzled expression on his face angered her  i see the house is to let whod have thought a child like that could root up two fossils like us never mind edward theres the same blood in us well keep our ends up in our own ways where are you going  theyll give me a chaplaincy in the east i think  for a wild moment leila thought shall i offer to go with himthe two lost dogs together  what would have happened edward if you had proposed to me that may week when we werea little bit in love which would it have been worst for you or me  you wouldnt have taken me leila  oh one never knows but youd never have been a priest then and youd never have become a saint  dont use that silly word if you knew  i do i can see that youve been half burned alive half burned and half buried well you have your reward whatever it is and i mine goodbye edward she took his hand you might give me your blessing i want it  pierson put his other hand on her shoulder and bending forward kissed her forehead  the tears rushed up in leilas eyes ah me she said its a sad world and wiping the quivering off her lips with the back of her gloved hand she went quickly past him to the door she looked back from there he had not stirred but his lips were moving hes praying for me she thought how funny   2  the moment she was outside she forgot him the dreadful ache for fort seemed to have been whipped up within her as if that figure of lifelong repression had infuriated the love of life and pleasure in her she must and would see jimmy again if she had to wait and seek for him all night it was nearly seven he would surely have finished at the war office he might be at his club or at his rooms she made for the latter  the little street near buckingham gate where no wag had chalked peace on the doors for nearly a year now had an arid look after a hot days sun the hairdressers shop below his rooms was still open and the private door ajar i wont ring she thought ill go straight up while she was mounting the two flights of stairs she stopped twice breathless from a pain in her side she often had that pain now as if the longing in her heart strained it physically on the modest landing at the top outside his rooms she waited leaning against the wall which was covered with a red paper a window at the back was open and the confused sound of singing came ina chorus vivela vivela vivela ve vive la compagnie so it came to her o god she thought let him be in let him be nice to me its the last time and sick from anxiety she opened the door he was inlying on a wickercouch against the wall in the far corner with his arms crossed behind his head and a pipe in his mouth his eyes were closed and he neither moved nor opened them perhaps supposing her to be the servant noiseless as a cat leila crossed the room till she stood above him and waiting for him to come out of that defiant lethargy she took her fill of his thin bony face healthy and hollow at the same time with teeth clenched on the pipe it had a look of hard resistance as of a man with his head back his arms pinioned to his sides stiffened against some creature clinging and climbing and trying to drag him down the pipe was alive and dribbled smoke and his leg the injured one wriggled restlessly as if worrying him but the rest of him was as utterly and obstinately still as though he were asleep his hair grew thick and crisp not a thread of grey in it the teeth which held the pipe glinted white and strong his face was young so much younger than hers why did she love itthe face of a man who couldnt love her for a second she felt as if she could seize the cushion which had slipped down off the couch and smother him as he lay there refusing so it seemed to her to come to consciousness love despised humiliation she nearly turned and stole away then through the door left open behind her the sound of that chorus vivela vivela vivela ve came in and jolted her nerves unbearably tearing the gardenia from her breast she flung it on to his upturned face  jimmy  fort struggled up and stared at her his face was comic from bewilderment and she broke into a little nervous laugh  you werent dreaming of me dear jimmy thats certain in what garden were you wandering  leila you howhow jolly  howhow jolly i wanted to see you so i came and i have seen you as you are when you arent with me i shall remember it it was good for meawfully good for me  i didnt hear you  far far away my dear put my gardenia in your buttonhole stop ill pin it in have you had a good rest all this week do you like my dress its new you wouldnt have noticed it would you  i should have noticed i think its charming  jimmy i believe that nothingnothing will ever shake your chivalry  chivalry i have none  i am going to shut the door do you mind but he went to the door himself shut it and came back to her leila looked up at him  jimmy if ever you loved me a little bit be nice to me today and if i say thingsif im bitterdont mind dont notice it promise  i promise  she took off her hat and sat leaning against him on the couch so that she could not see his face and with his arm round her she let herself go deep into the waters of illusion downdown trying to forget there was a surface to which she must return like a little girl she played that game of makebelieve he loves mehe loves mehe loves me to lose herself like that for just an hour only an hour she felt that she would give the rest of the time vouchsafed to her give it all and willingly her hand clasped his against her heart she turned her face backward up to his closing her eyes so as still not to see his face the scent of the gardenia in his coat hurt her so sweet and strong it was   3  when with her hat on she stood ready to go it was getting dark she had come out of her dream now was playing at makebelieve no more and she stood with a stony smile in the halfdark looking between her lashes at the mortified expression on his unconscious face  poor jimmy she said im not going to keep you from dinner any longer no dont come with me im going alone and dont light up for heavens sake  she put her hand on the lapel of his coat that flowers gone brown at the edges throw it away i cant bear faded flowers nor can you get yourself a fresh one tomorrow  she pulled the flower from his buttonhole and crushing it in her hand held her face up  well kiss me once more it wont hurt you  for one moment her lips clung to his with all their might she wrenched them away felt for the handle blindly opened the door and shutting it in his face went slowly swaying a little down the stairs she trailed a gloved hand along the wall as if its solidity could help her at the last halflanding where a curtain hung dividing off back premises she stopped and listened there wasnt a sound if i stand here behind this curtain she thought i shall see him again she slipped behind the curtain close drawn but for a little chink it was so dark there that she could not see her own hand she heard the door open and his slow footsteps coming down the stairs his feet knees whole figure came into sight his face just a dim blur he passed smoking a cigarette she crammed her hand against her mouth to stop herself from speaking and the crushed gardenia filled her nostrils with its cold fragrant velvet he was gone the door below was shut a wild halfstupid longing came on her to go up again wait till he came in throw herself upon him tell him she was going beg him to keep her with him ah and he would he would look at her with that haggard pity she could not bear and say of course leila of course no by god no i am going quietly home she muttered just quietly home come along be brave dont be a fool come along and she went down into the street at the entrance to the park she saw him fifty yards in front dawdling along and as if she had been his shadow lengthened out to that far distance she moved behind him slowly always at that distance she followed him under the planetrees along the park railings past st jamess palace into pall mall he went up some steps and vanished into his club it was the end she looked up at the building a monstrous granite tomb all dark an emptied cab was just moving from the door she got in camelot mansions st johns wood and braced against the cushions panting and clenching her hands she thought well ive seen him again hard crusts better than no bread oh god all finishednot a crumb not a crumb vivela vivela vivela ve vivela compagnie     xiv  fort had been lying there about an hour sleeping and awake before that visit he had dreamed a curious and wonderfully emotionalising dream a long grey line in a dim light neither of night nor morning the whole length of the battlefront in france charging in short drives which carried the line a little forward with just a tiny pause and suckback then on again irresistibly on and on and at each rush every voice his own among them shouted hooray the english hooray the english the sensation of that advancing tide of dim figures in grey light the throb and roar the wonderful rhythmic steady drive of it no more to be stopped than the waves of an incoming tide was gloriously fascinating life was nothing death nothing hooray the english in that dream he was his country he was every one of that long charging line driving forward in those great heaving pulsations irresistible on and on out of the very centre of this intoxicating dream he had been dragged by some street noise and had closed his eyes again in the vain hope that he might dream it on to its end but it came no more and lighting his pipe he lay there wondering at its fervid fantastic realism death was nothing if his country lived and won in waking hours he never had quite that singlehearted knowledge of himself and what marvellously real touches got mixed into the fantastic stuff of dreams as if something were at work to convince the dreamer in spite of himselfhooray not hurrah just common hooray and the english not the literary british and then the soft flower had struck his forehead and leilas voice cried jimmy  when she left him his thought was just a tired well so its begun again what did it matter since common loyalty and compassion cut him off from what his heart desired and that desire was absurd as little likely of attainment as the moon what did it matter if it gave her any pleasure to love him let it go on yet all the time that he was walking across under the plane trees noel seemed to walk in front of him just out of reach so that he ached with the thought that he would never catch her up and walk beside her  two days later on reaching his rooms in the evening he found this letter on ships notepaper with the plymouth postmark      fare thee well and if for ever      then for ever fare thee well                          leila  he read it with a really horrible feeling for all the world as if he had been accused of a crime and did not know whether he had committed it or not and trying to collect his thoughts he took a cab and drove to her fiat it was closed but her address was given him a bank in cape town he had received his release in his remorse and relief so confusing and so poignant he heard the driver of the cab asking where he wanted to go now oh back again but before they had gone a mile he corrected the address in an impulse of which next moment he felt thoroughly ashamed what he was doing indeed was as indecent as if he were driving from the funeral of his wife to the boudoir of another woman when he reached the old square and the words to let stared him in the face he felt a curious relief though it meant that he would not see her whom to see for ten minutes he felt he would give a year of life dismissing his cab he stood debating whether to ring the bell the sight of a maids face at the window decided him mr pierson was out and the young ladies were away he asked for mrs lairds address and turned away almost into the arms of pierson himself the greeting was stiff and strange does he know that leilas gone he thought if so he must think me the most awful skunk and am i am i when he reached home he sat down to write to leila but having stared at the paper for an hour and written these three lines   my dear leila  i cannot express to you the feelings with which i received your letter   he tore it up nothing would be adequate nothing would be decent let the dead past bury its deadthe dead past which in his heart had never been alive why pretend he had done his best to keep his end up why pretend     part iv     i  in the boardinghouse whence the lairds had not yet removed the old lady who knitted sat by the fireplace and light from the setting sun threw her shadow on the wall moving spidery and grey over the yellowish distemper in time to the tune of her needles she was a very old ladythe oldest lady in the world noel thoughtand she knitted without stopping without breathing so that the girl felt inclined to scream in the evening when george and gratian were not in noel would often sit watching the needles brooding over her as yet undecided future and now and again the old lady would look up above her spectacles move the corners of her lips ever so slightly and drop her gaze again she had pitted herself against fate so long as she knitted the war could not stopsuch was the conclusion noel had come to this old lady knitted the epic of acquiescence to the tune of her needles it was she who kept the war going such a thin old lady if i were to hold her elbows from behind the girl used to think i believe shed die i expect i ought to then the war would stop and if the war stopped thered be love and life again then the little silvery tune would click itself once more into her brain and stop her thinking in her lap this evening lay a letter from her father   my dearest nollie  i am glad to say i have my chaplaincy and am to start for egypt very soon i should have wished to go to france but must take what i can get in view of my age for they really dont want us who are getting on i fear it is a great comfort to me to think that gratian is with you and no doubt you will all soon be in a house where my little grandson can join you i have excellent accounts of him in a letter from your aunt just received my child you must never again think that my resignation has been due to you it is not so you know or perhaps you dont that ever since the war broke out i have chafed over staying at home my heart has been with our boys out there and sooner or later it must have come to this apart from anything else monsieur lavendie has been round in the evening twice he is a nice man i like him very much in spite of our differences of view he wanted to give me the sketch he made of you in the park but what can i do with it now and to tell you the truth i like it no better than the oil painting it is not a likeness as i know you i hope i didnt hurt his feelings the feelings of an artist are so very easily wounded there is one thing i must tell you leila has gone back to south africa she came round one evening about ten days ago to say goodbye she was very brave for i fear it means a great wrench for her i hope and pray she may find comfort and tranquillity out there and now my dear i want you to promise me not to see captain fort i know that he admires you but apart from the question of his conduct in regard to leila he made the saddest impression on me by coming to our house the very day after her departure there is something about that which makes me feel he cannot be the sort of man in whom i could feel any confidence i dont suppose for a moment that he is in your thoughts and yet before going so far from you i feel i must warn you i should rejoice to see you married to a good man but though i dont wish to think hardly of anyone i cannot believe captain fort is that  i shall come down to you before i start which may be in quite a short time now my dear love to you and gracie and best wishes to george  your ever loving father  edward pierson   across this letter lying on her knees noel gazed at the spidery movement on the wall was it acquiescence that the old lady knitted or was it resistancea challenge to death itself a challenge dancing to the tune of the needles like the grey ghost of human resistance to fate she wouldnt give in this oldest lady in the world she meant to knit till she fell into the grave and so leila had gone it hurt her to know that and yet it pleased her acquiescenceresistance why did daddy always want to choose the way she should go so gentle he was yet he always wanted to and why did he always make her feel that she must go the other way the sunlight ceased to stream in the old ladys shadow faded off the wall but the needles still sang their little tune and the girl said  do you enjoy knitting mrs adam  the old lady looked at her above the spectacles  enjoy my dear it passes the time  but do you want the time to pass  there was no answer for a moment and noel thought how dreadful of me to have said that  eh said the old lady  i said isnt it very tiring  not when i dont think about it my dear  what do you think about  the old lady cackled gently  ohwell she said  and noel thought it must be dreadful to grow old and pass the time  she took up her fathers letter and bent it meditatively against her chin he wanted her to pass the timenot to live not to enjoy to pass the time what else had he been doing himself all these years ever since she could remember ever since her mother died but just passing the time passing the time because he did not believe in this life not living at all just preparing for the life he did believe in denying himself everything that was exciting and nice so that when he died he might pass pure and saintly to his other world he could not believe captain fort a good man because he had not passed the time and resisted leila and leila was gone and now it was a sin for him to love someone else he must pass the time again daddy doesnt believe in life she thought its monsieurs picture daddys a saint but i dont want to be a saint and pass the time he doesnt mind making people unhappy because the more theyre repressed the saintlier theyll be but i cant bear to be unhappy or to see others unhappy i wonder if i could bear to be unhappy to save someone elseas leila is i admire her oh i admire her shes not doing it because she thinks it good for her soul only because she cant bear making him unhappy she must love him very much poor leila and shes done it all by herself of her own accord it was like what george said of the soldiers they didnt know why they were heroes it was not because theyd been told to be or because they believed in a future life they just had to be from inside somewhere to save others and they love life as much as i do she thought what a beast it makes one feel those needles resistanceacquiescence both perhaps the oldest lady in the world with her lips moving at the corners keeping things in had lived her life and knew it how dreadful to live on when you were of no more interest to anyone but must just pass the time and die but how much more dreadful to pass the time when you were strong and life and love were yours for the taking i shant answer daddy she thought     ii  the maid who one saturday in july opened the door to jimmy fort had never heard the name of laird for she was but a unit in the ceaseless procession which pass through the boardinghouses of places subject to airraids placing him in a sittingroom she said she would find miss allow there he waited turning the leaves of an illustrated journal wherein society beauties starving servians actresses with pretty legs prize dogs sinking ships royalties shells bursting and padres reading funeral services testified to the catholicity of the public taste but did not assuage his nerves what if their address were not known here why in his fear of putting things to the test had he let this month go by an old lady was sitting by the hearth knitting the click of whose needles blended with the buzzing of a large bee on the windowpane she may know he thought she looks as if shed been here for ever and approaching her he said  i can assure you those socks are very much appreciated maam  the old lady bridled over her spectacles  it passes the time she said  oh more than that it helps to win the war maam  the old ladys lips moved at the corners she did not answer deaf he thought  may i ask if you knew my friends doctor and mrs laird and miss pierson  the old lady cackled gently  oh yes a pretty young girl as pretty as life she used to sit with me quite a pleasure to watch her such large eyes she had  where have they gone can you tell me  oh i dont know at all  it was a little cold douche on his heart he longed to say stop knitting a minute please its my life to know but the tune of the needles answered its my life to knit and he turned away to the window  she used to sit just there quite still quite still  fort looked down at the windowseat so she used to sit just here quite still  what a dreadful war this is said the old lady have you been at the front  yes  to think of the poor young girls wholl never have husbands im sure i think its dreadful  yes said fort its dreadful and then a voice from the doorway said  did you want doctor and mrs laird sir east bungalow their address is its a little way out on the north road anyone will tell you  with a sigh of relief fort looked gratefully at the old lady who had called noel as pretty as life good afternoon maam  good afternoon the needles clicked and little movements occurred at the corners of her mouth fort went out he could not find a vehicle and was a long time walking the bungalow was ugly of yellow brick pointed with red it lay about twothirds up between the main road and cliffs and had a rockgarden and a glaring brandnew look in the afternoon sunlight he opened the gate uttering one of those prayers which come so glibly from unbelievers when they want anything a babys crying answered it and he thought with ecstasy heaven she is here passing the rockgarden he could see a lawn at the back of the house and a perambulator out there under a holmoak tree and noelsurely noel herself hardening his heart he went forward in a lilac sunbonnet she was bending over the perambulator he trod softly on the grass and was quite close before she heard him he had prepared no words but just held out his hand the baby interested in the shadow failing across its pram ceased crying noel took his hand under the sunbonnet which hid her hair she seemed older and paler as if she felt the heat he had no feeling that she was glad to see him  how do you do have you seen gratian she ought to be in  i didnt come to see her i came to see you  noel turned to the baby  here he is  fort stood at the end of the perambulator and looked at that other fellows baby in the shade of the hood with the frilly clothes it seemed to him lying with its head downhill it had scratched its snub nose and bumpy forehead and it stared up at its mother with blue eyes which seemed to have no underlids so fat were its cheeks  i wonder what they think about he said  noel put her finger into the babys fist  they only think when they want some thing  thats a deep saying but his eyes are awfully interested in you  noel smiled and very slowly the babys curly mouth unclosed and discovered his toothlessness  hes a darling she said in a whisper  and so are you he thought if only i dared say it  daddy is here she said suddenly without looking up hes sailing for egypt the day after tomorrow he doesnt like you  forts heart gave a jump why did she tell him that unlessunless she was just a little on his side  i expected that he said im a sinner as you know  noel looked up at him sin she said and bent again over her baby the word the tone in which she said it crouching over her baby gave him the thought if it werent for that little creature i shouldnt have a dogs chance he said ill go and see your father is he in  i think so  may i come tomorrow  its sunday and daddys last day  ah of course he did not dare look back to see if her gaze was following him but he thought chance or no chance im going to fight for her tooth and nail  in a room darkened against the evening sun pierson was sitting on a sofa reading the sight of that figure in khaki disconcerted fort who had not realised that there would be this metamorphosis the narrow face cleanshaven now with its deepset eyes and compressed lips looked more priestly than ever in spite of this brown garb he felt his hope suddenly to be very forlorn indeed and rushing at the fence he began abruptly  ive come to ask you sir for your permission to marry noel if she will have me  he had thought piersons face gentle it was not gentle now did you know i was here then captain fort  i saw noel in the garden ive said nothing to her of course but she told me you were starting tomorrow for egypt so i shall have no other chance  i am sorry you have come it is not for me to judge but i dont think you will make noel happy  may i ask you why sir  captain fort the worlds judgment of these things is not mine but since you ask me i will tell you frankly my cousin leila has a claim on you it is her you should ask to marry you  i did ask her she refused  i know she would not refuse you again if you went out to her  i am not free to go out to her besides she would refuse she knows i dont love her and never have  never have  no  then why  because im a man i suppose and a fool  if it was simply because you are a man as you call it it is clear that no principle or faith governs you and yet you ask me to give you noel my poor noel who wants the love and protection not of a man but of a good man no captain fort no  fort bit his lips im clearly not a good man in your sense of the word but i love her terribly and i would protect her i dont in the least know whether shell have me i dont expect her to naturally but i warn you that i mean to ask her and to wait for her im so much in love that i can do nothing else  the man who is truly in love does what is best for the one he loves fort bent his head he felt as if he were at school again confronting his headmaster thats true he said and i shall never trade on her position if she cant feel anything for me now or in the future i shant trouble her you may be sure of that but if by some wonderful chance she should i know i can make her happy sir  she is a child  no shes not a child said fort stubbornly  pierson touched the lapel of his new tunic captain fort i am going far away from her and leaving her without protection i trust to your chivalry not to ask her till i come back  fort threw back his head no no i wont accept that position with or without your presence the facts will be the same either she can love me or she cant if she can shell be happier with me if she cant theres an end of it  pierson came slowly up to him in my view he said you are as bound to leila as if you were married to her  you cant expect me to take the priests view sir  piersons lips trembled  you call it a priests view i think it is only the view of a man of honour  fort reddened thats for my conscience he said stubbornly i cant tell you and im not going to how things began i was a fool but i did my best and i know that leila doesnt think im bound if she had she would never have gone when theres no feelingthere never was real feeling on my sideand when theres this terribly real feeling for noel which i never sought which i tried to keep down which i ran away from  did you  yes to go on with the other was foul i should have thought you might have seen that sir but i did go on with it it was leila who made an end  leila behaved nobly i think  she was splendid but that doesnt make me a brute  pierson turned away to the window whence he must see noel  it is repugnant to me he said is there never to be any purity in her life  is there never to be any life for her at your rate sir there will be none im no worse than other men and i love her more than they could  for fully a minute pierson stood silent before he said forgive me if ive spoken harshly i didnt mean to i love her intensely i wish for nothing but her good but all my life i have believed that for a man there is only one womanfor a woman only one man  then sir fort burst out you wish her  pierson had put his hand up as if to ward off a blow and angry though he was fort stopped  we are all made of flesh and blood he continued coldly and it seems to me that you think we arent  we have spirits too captain fort the voice was suddenly so gentle that forts anger evaporated  i have a great respect for you sir but a greater love for noel and nothing in this world will prevent me trying to give my life to her  a smile quivered over piersons face if you try then i can but pray that you will fail  fort did not answer and went out  he walked slowly away from the bungalow with his head down sore angry and yetrelieved he knew where he stood nor did he feel that he had been worstedthose strictures had not touched him convicted of immorality he remained conscious of private justifications in a way that human beings have only one little corner of memory unseen and uncriticised by his opponent troubled him he pardoned himself the rest the one thing he did not pardon was the fact that he had known noel before his liaison with leila commenced had even let leila sweep him away on an evening when he had been in noels company for that he felt a real disgust with himself and all the way back to the station he kept thinking how could i i deserve to lose her still i shall try but not nownot yet and wearily enough he took the train back to town     iii  both girls rose early that last day and went with their father to communion as gratian had said to george its nothing to me now but it will mean a lot to him out there as a memory of us so i must go and he had answered quite right my dear let him have all he can get of you both today ill keep out of the way and be back the last thing at night their fathers smile when he saw them waiting for him went straight to both their hearts it was a delicious day and the early freshness had not yet dried out of the air when they were walking home to breakfast each girl had slipped a hand under his arm its like moses or was it aaron noel thought absurdly memory had complete hold of her all the old days nursery hours on sundays after tea stories out of the huge bible bound in motheropearl with photogravures of the holy landpalms and hills and goats and little eastern figures and funny boats on the sea of galilee and camelsalways camels the book would be on his knee and they one on each arm of his chair waiting eagerly for the pages to be turned so that a new picture came and there would be the feel of his cheek prickly against theirs and the old names with the old glamourto gratian joshua daniel mordecai peter to noel absalom because of his hair and haman because she liked the sound and ruth because she was pretty and john because he leaned on jesus breast neither of them cared for job or david and elijah and elisha they detested because they hated the name eliza and later days by firelight in the drawingroom roasting chestnuts just before evening church and telling ghost stories and trying to make daddy eat his share and hours beside him at the piano each eager for her special hymnsfor gratian onward christian soldiers lead kindly light and o god our help for noel nearer my god to thee the one with the hosts of midian in it and for those in peril on the sea and carols ah and choristers noel had loved one deeplythe word chorister was so enchanting and because of his whiteness and hair which had no grease on it but stood up all bright she had never spoken to hima far worship like that for a star and always always daddy had been gentle sometimes angry but always gentle and they sometimes not at all and mixed up with it all the dogs they had had and the cats they had had and the cockatoo and the governesses and their red cloaks and the curates and the pantomimes and peter pan and alice in wonderlanddaddy sitting between them so that one could snuggle up and later the schooldays the hockey the prizes the holidays the rush into his arms and the great and wonderful yearly exodus to far places fishing and bathing walks and drives rides and climbs always with him and concerts and shakespeare plays in the christmas and easter holidays and the walk home through the streetsall lighted in those daysone on each side of him and this was the end they waited on him at breakfast they kept stealing glances at him photographing him in their minds gratian got her camera and did actually photograph him in the morning sunlight with noel without noel with the baby against all regulations for the defence of the realm it was noel who suggested daddy lets take lunch out and go for all day on the cliffs us three and forget theres a war  so easy to say so difficult to do with the boom of the guns travelling to their ears along the grass mingled with the buzz of insects yet that hum of summer the innumerable voices of tiny lives gossamer things all as alive as they and as important to their frail selves and the white clouds few and so slowmoving and the remote strange purity which clings to the chalky downs all this white and green and blue of land and sea had its peace which crept into the spirits of those three alone with nature this once more the last time forwho could say how long they talked by tacit agreement of nothing but what had happened before the war began while the flock of the blown dandelions drifted past pierson sat crosslegged on the grass without his cap suffering a little still from the stiffness of his unwonted garments and the girls lay one on each side of him half critical and half admiring noel could not bear his collar  if you had a soft collar youd be lovely daddy perhaps out there theyll let you take it off it must be fearfully hot in egypt oh i wish i were going i wish i were going everywhere in the world some day presently he read to them murrays hippolytus of euripides and now and then gratian and he discussed a passage but noel lay silent looking at the sky whenever his voice ceased there was the song of the larks and very faint the distant mutter of the guns  they stayed up there till past six and it was time to go and have tea before evening service those hours in the baking sun had drawn virtue out of them they were silent and melancholy all the evening noel was the first to go up to her bedroom she went without saying good nightshe knew her father would come to her room that last evening george had not yet come in and gratian was left alone with pierson in the drawingroom round whose single lamp in spite of closedrawn curtains moths were circling she moved over to him on the sofa  dad promise me not to worry about nollie well take care of her  she can only take care of herself gracie and will she did you know that captain fort was here yesterday  she told me  what is her feeling about him  i dont think she knows nollie dreams along and then suddenly rushes  i wish she were safe from that man  but dad why george likes him and so do i  a big grey moth was fluttering against the lamp pierson got up and caught it in the curve of his palm poor thing youre like my nollie so soft and dreamy so feckless so reckless and going to the curtains he thrust his hand through and released the moth  dad said gratian suddenly we can only find out for ourselves even if we do singe our wings in doing it weve been reading jamess pragmatism george says the only chapter thats important is missingthe one on ethics to show that what we do is not wrong till its proved wrong by the result i suppose he was afraid to deliver that lecture  piersons face wore the smile which always came on it when he had to deal with george the smile which said ah george thats very clever but i know  my dear he said that doctrine is the most dangerous in the world i am surprised at george  i dont think george is in danger dad  george is a man of wide experience and strong judgment and character but think how fatal it would be for nollie my poor nollie whom a little gust can blow into the candle  all the same said gratian stubbornly i dont think anyone can be good or worth anything unless they judge for themselves and take risks  pierson went close to her his face was quivering  dont let us differ on this last night i must go up to nollie for a minute and then to bed i shant see you tomorrow you mustnt get up i can bear parting better like this and my train goes at eight god bless you gracie give george my love i know i have always known that hes a good man though we do fight so goodbye my darling  he went out with his cheeks wet from gratians tears and stood in the porch a minute to recover his composure the shadow of the house stretched velvet and blunt over the rockgarden a nightjar was spinning the churring sound affected him oddly the last english nightbird he would hear england what a nightto say goodbye my country he thought my beautiful country the dew was lying thick and silvery already on the little patch of grassthe last dew the last scent of an english night the call of a bugle floated out england he prayed god be about you a little sound answered from across the grass like an old mans cough and the scrape and rattle of a chain a face emerged at the edge of the houses shadow bearded and horned like that of pan it seemed to stare at him and he saw the dim grey form of the garden goat heard it scuttle round the stake to which it was tethered as though alarmed at this visitor to its domain  he went up the halfflight of stairs to noels narrow little room next the nursery no voice answered his tap it was dark but he could see her at the window leaning far out with her chin on her hands  nollie  she answered without turning such a lovely night daddy come and look id like to set the goat free only hed eat the rock plants but it is his night isnt it he ought to be running and skipping in it its such a shame to tie things up did you never feel wild in your heart daddy  always i think nollie too wild its been hard to tame oneself  noel slipped her hand through his arm lets go and take the goat and skip together on the hills if only we had a penny whistle did you hear the bugle the bugle and the goat  pierson pressed the hand against him  nollie be good while im away you know what i dont want i told you in my letter he looked at her cheek and dared say no more her face had its fey look again  dont you feel she said suddenly on a night like this all the things all the thingsthe stars have lives daddy and the moon has a big life and the shadows have and the moths and the birds and the goats and the trees and the flowers and all of usescaped oh daddy why is there a war and why are people so bound and so unhappy dont tell me its goddont  pierson could not answer for there came into his mind the greek song he had been reading aloud that afternoon      o for a deep and dewy spring      with runlets cold to draw and drink      and a great meadow blossoming      longgrassed and poplars in a ring      to rest me by the brink      o take me to the mountain o      past the great pines and through the wood      up where the lean hounds softly go      awhine for wild things blood      and madly flies the dappled roe      o god to shout and speed them there      an arrow by my chestnut hair      drawn tight and one keen glimmering spear      ah if i could  all that in life had been to him unknown of venture and wild savour all the emotion he had stifled the swift pan he had denied the sharp fruits the burning suns the dark pools the unearthly moonlight which were not of godall came with the breath of that old song and the look on the girls face and he covered his eyes  noels hand tugged at his arm isnt beauty terribly alive she murmured like a lovely person it makes you ache to kiss it  his lips felt parched there is a beauty beyond all that he said stubbornly  where  holiness duty faith o nollie my love but noels hand tightened on his arm  shall i tell you what i should like she whispered to take gods hand and show him things im certain hes not seen everything  a shudder went through pierson one of those queer sudden shivers which come from a strange note in a voice or a new sharp scent or sight  my dear what things you say  but he hasnt and its time he did wed creep and peep and see it all for once as he cant in his churches daddy oh daddy i cant bear it any more to think of them being killed on a night like this killed and killed so that they never see it all againnever see itnever see it she sank down and covered her face with her arms  i cant i cant oh take it all away the cruelty why does it comewhy the stars and the flowers if god doesnt care any more than that  horribly affected he stood bending over her stroking her head then the habit of a hundred deathbeds helped him come nollie this life is but a minute we must all die  but not theynot so young she clung to his knees and looked up daddy i dont want you to go promise me to come back  the childishness of those words brought back his balance  my dear sweetheart of course come nollie get up the suns been too much for you  noel got up and put her hands on her fathers shoulders forgive me for all my badness and all my badness to come especially all my badness to come  pierson smiled i shall always forgive you nollie but there wont bethere mustnt be any badness to come i pray god to keep you and make you like your mother  mother never had a devil like you and me  he was silent from surprise how did this child know the devil of wild feeling he had fought against year after year until with the many years he had felt it weakening within him she whispered on i dont hate my devil  why should iits part of me every day when the sun sets ill think of you daddy and you might do the samethatll keep me good i shant come to the station tomorrow i should only cry and i shant say goodbye now its unlucky  she flung her arms round him and half smothered by that fervent embrace he kissed her cheeks and hair freed of each other at last he stood for a moment looking at her by the moonlight  there never was anyone more loving than you nollie he said quietly remember my letter and good night my love then afraid to stay another second he went quickly out of the dark little room  george laird returning half an hour later heard a voice saying softly george george  looking up he saw a little white blur at the window and noels face just visible  george let the goat loose just for tonight to please me  something in that voice and in the gesture of her stretchedout arm moved george in a queer way although as pierson had once said he had no music in his soul he loosed the goat     iv  1  in the weeks which succeeded piersons departure gratian and george often discussed noels conduct and position by the light of the pragmatic theory george held a suitably scientific view just as he would point out to his wifein the physical world creatures who diverged from the normal had to justify their divergence in competition with their environments or else go under so in the ethical world it was all a question of whether nollie could make good her vagary if she could and grew in strength of character thereby it was ipso facto all right her vagary would be proved an advantage and the world enriched if not the world by her failure to make good would be impoverished and her vagary proved wrong the orthodox and academieshe insistedwere always forgetting the adaptability of living organisms how every action which was out of the ordinary unconsciously modified all the other actions together with the outlook and philosophy of the doer of course nollie was crazy he said but when she did what she did she at once began to think differently about life and morals the deepest instinct we all have is the instinct that we must do what we must and think that what weve done is really all right in fact theinstinct of selfpreservation were all fighting animals and we feel in our bones that if we admit were beatenwe are beaten but that every fight we win especially against odds hardens those bones but personally i dont think she can make good on her own  gratian whose pragmatism was not yet fully baked responded doubtfully  no i dont think she can and if she could im not sure but isnt pragmatism a perfectly beastly word george it has no sense of humour in it at all  it is a bit thick and in the hands of the young deuced likely to become prigmatism but not with nollie  they watched the victim of their discussions with real anxiety the knowledge that she would never be more sheltered than she was with them at all events until she married gravely impeded the formation of any judgment as to whether or no she could make good now and again there would come to gratian who after all knew her sister better than georgethe disquieting thought that whatever conclusion noel led them to form she would almost certainly force them to abandon sooner or later  three days after her fathers departure noel had declared that she wanted to work on the land this george had promptly vetoed  you arent strong enough yet my dear wait till the harvest begins then you can go and help on the farm here if you can stand that without damage well think about it  but the weather was wet and harvest late and noel had nothing much to do but attend to her baby already well attended to by nurse and dream and brood and now and then cook an omelette or do some housework for the sake of a gnawing conscience since gratian and george were away in hospital all day she was very much alone several times in the evenings gratian tried to come at the core of her thoughts twice she flew the kite of leila the first time noel only answered yes shes a brick the second time she said i dont want to think about her  but hardening her heart gratian went on dont you think its queer weve never heard from captain fort since he came down  in her calmest voice noel answered why should we after being told that he wasnt liked  who told him that  i told him that daddy didnt but i expect daddy said much worse things she gave a little laugh then softly added daddys wonderful isnt he  how  the way he drives one to do the other thing if he hadnt opposed my marriage to cyril you know that wouldnt have happened it just made all the difference it stirred me up so fearfully gratian stared at her astonished that she could see herself so clearly towards the end of august she had a letter from fort   dear mrs laird  you know all about things of course except the one thing which to me is all important i cant go on without knowing whether i have a chance with your sister it is against your fathers expressed wish that she should have anything to do with me but i told him that i could not and would not promise not to ask her i get my holiday at the end of this month and am coming down to put it to the touch it means more to me than you can possibly imagine  i am dear mrs laird  your very faithful servant  james fort   she discussed the letter with george whose advice was answer it politely but say nothing and nothing to nollie i think it would be a very good thing of course its a bit of a makeshifttwice her age but hes a genuine man if not exactly brilliant  gratian answered almost sullenly ive always wanted the very best for nollie  george screwed up his steelcoloured eyes as he might have looked at one on whom he had to operate quite so he said but you must remember gracie that out of the swan she was nollie has made herself into a lame duck fifty per cent at least is off her value socially we must look at things as they are  father is dead against it  george smiled on the point of saying that makes me feel it must be a good thing but he subdued the impulse  i agree that were bound by his absence not to further it actively still nollie knows his wishes and its up to her and no one else after all shes no longer a child  his advice was followed but to write that polite letter which said nothing cost gratian a sleepless night and two or three hours penmanship she was very conscientious knowledge of this impending visit increased the anxiety with which she watched her sister but the only inkling she obtained of noels state of mind was when the girl showed her a letter she had received from thirza asking her to come back to kestrel a postscript in uncle bobs handwriting added these words  were getting quite fossilised down here eves gone and left us again we miss you and the youngster awfully come along down nollie theres a dear  theyre darlings noel said but i shant go im too restless ever since daddy went you dont know how restless this rain simply makes me want to die   2  the weather improved next day and at the end of that week harvest began by what seemed to noel a stroke of luck the farmers binder was broken he could not get it repaired and wanted all the human binders he could get that first day in the fields blistered her hands burnt her face and neck made every nerve and bone in her body ache but was the happiest day she had spent for weeks the happiest perhaps since cyril morland left her over a year ago she had a bath and went to bed the moment she got in  lying there nibbling chocolate and smoking a cigarette she luxuriated in the weariness which had stilled her dreadful restlessness watching the smoke of her cigarette curl up against the sunset glow which filled her window she mused if only she could be tired out like this every day she would be all right then would lose the feeling of not knowing what she wanted of being in a sort o of large box with the lid slammed down roaming round it like a dazed and homesick bee in an overturned tumbler the feeling of being only half alive of having a wing maimed so that she could only fly a little way and must then drop  she slept like a top that night but the next days work was real torture and the third not much better by the end of the week however she was no longer stiff  saturday was cloudless a perfect day the field she was working in lay on a slope it was the last field to be cut and the best wheat yet with a glorious burnt shade in its gold and the ears blunt and full she had got used now to the feel of the great sheaves in her arms and the binding wisps drawn through her hand till she held them level below the ears ready for the twist there was no new sensation in it now just steady rather dreamy work to keep her place in the row to the swishswish of the cutter and the call of the driver to his horses at the turns with continual little pauses to straighten and rest her back a moment and shake her head free from the flies or suck her finger sore from the constant pushing of the straw ends under so the hours went on rather hot and wearisome yet with a feeling of something good being done of a job getting surely to its end and gradually the centre patch narrowed and the sun slowly slanted down  when they stopped for tea instead of running home as usual she drank it cold out of a flask she had brought ate a bun and some chocolate and lay down on her back against the hedge she always avoided that group of her fellow workers round the teacans which the farmers wife brought out to avoid people if she could had become habitual to her now they must know about her or would soon if she gave them the chance she had never lost consciousness of her ringfinger expecting every eye to fall on it as a matter of course lying on her face she puffed her cigarette into the grass and watched a beetle till one of the sheepdogs scouting for scraps came up and she fed him with her second bun having finished the bun he tried to eat the beetle and when she rescued it convinced that she had nothing more to give him sneezed at her and went away pressing the end of her cigarette out against the bank she turned over already the driver was perched on his tiny seat and his companion whose business it was to free the falling corn was getting up alongside swishswish it had begun again she rose stretched herself and went back to her place in the row the field would be finished tonight she would have a lovely restall sunday i towards seven oclock a narrow strip not twenty yards broad alone was left this last half hour was what noel dreaded today it was worse for the farmer had no cartridges left and the rabbits were dealt with by hullabaloo and sticks and chasing dogs rabbits were vermin of course and ate the crops and must be killed besides they were good food and fetched two shillings apiece all this she knew but to see the poor frightened things stealing out pounced on turned shouted at chased rolled over by great swift dogs fallen on by the boys and killed and carried with their limp grey bodies upside down so dead and soft and helpless always made her feel quite sick she stood very still trying not to see or hear and in the corn opposite to her a rabbit stole along crouched and peeped oh she thought come out here bunny ill let you awaycant you see i will its your only chance come out but the rabbit crouched and gazed with its little cowed head poked forward and its ears laid flat it seemed trying to understand whether this still thing in front of it was the same as those others with the thought of course it wont while i look at it noel turned her head away out of the corner of her eye she could see a man standing a few yards off the rabbit bolted out now the man would shout and turn it but he did not and the rabbit scuttled past him and away to the hedge she heard a shout from the end of the row saw a dog galloping too late hurrah and clasping her hands she looked at the man it was fort with the queerest feelingamazement pleasure the thrill of conspiracy she saw him coming up to her  i did want that rabbit to get off she sighed out ive been watching it thank you  he looked at her my goodness was all he said  noels hands flew up to her cheeks yes i know is my nose very red  no youre as lovely as ruth if she was lovely  swishswish the cutter came by noel started forward to her place in the row but catching her arm he said no let me do this little bit i havent had a day in the fields since the war began talk to me while im binding  she stood watching him he made a different stronger twist from hers and took larger sheaves so that she felt a sort of jealousy  i didnt know you knew about this sort of thing  oh lord yes i had a farm once out west nothing like fieldwork to make you feel good ive been watching you you bind jolly well  noel gave a sigh of pleasure  where have you come from she asked  straight from the station im on my holiday he looked up at her and they both fell silent  swishswish the cutter was coming again noel went to the beginning of her portion of the falling corn he to the end of it they worked towards each other and met before the cutter was on them a third time  will you come in to supper  id love to  then lets go now please i dont want to see any more rabbits killed  they spoke very little on the way to the bungalow but she felt his eyes on her all the time she left him with george and gratian who had just come in and went up for her bath  supper had been laid out in the verandah and it was nearly dark before they had finished in rhyme with the failing of the light noel became more and more silent when they went in she ran up to her baby she did not go down again but as on the night before her father went away stood at her window leaning out a dark night no moon in the starlight she could only just see the dim garden where no goat was grazing now that her first excitement had worn off this sudden reappearance of fort filled her with nervous melancholy she knew perfectly well what he had come for she had always known she had no certain knowledge of her own mind but she knew that all these weeks she had been between his influence and her fathers listening to them as it were pleading with her and curiously the pleading of each instead of drawing her towards the pleader had seemed dragging her away from him driving her into the arms of the other to the protection of one or the other she felt she must go and it humiliated her to think that in all the world there was no other place for her the wildness of that one night in the old abbey seemed to have power to govern all her life to come why should that one night that one act have this uncanny power to drive her this way or that to those arms or these must she because of it always need protection standing there in the dark it was almost as if they had come up behind her with their pleadings and a shiver ran down her back she longed to turn on them and cry out go away oh go away i dont want either of you i just want to be left alone then something a moth perhaps touched her neck she gasped and shook herself how silly  she heard the back door round the corner of the house opening a mans low voice down in the dark said  whos the young lady that comes out in the fields  another voiceone of the maidsanswered  the mississ sister  they say shes got a baby  never you mind what shes got  noel heard the mans laugh it seemed to her the most odious laugh she had ever heard she thought swiftly and absurdly ill get away from all this the window was only a few feet up she got out on to the ledge let herself down and dropped there was a flowerbed below quite soft with a scent of geraniumleaves and earth she brushed herself and went tiptoeing across the gravel and the little front lawn to the gate the house was quite dark quite silent she walked on down the road jolly she thought night after night we sleep and never see the nights sleep until were called and never see anything if they want to catch me theyll have to run and she began running down the road in her evening frock and shoes with nothing on her head she stopped after going perhaps three hundred yards by the edge of the wood it was splendidly dark in there and she groped her way from trunk to trunk with a delicious halfscared sense of adventure and novelty she stopped at last by a thin trunk whose bark glimmered faintly she felt it with her cheek quite smootha birch tree and with her arms round it she stood perfectly still wonderfully magically silent fresh and sweetscented and dark the little tree trembled suddenly within her arms and she heard the low distant rumble to which she had grown so accustomedthe guns always at work killingkilling men and killing trees little trees perhaps like this within her arms little trembling trees out there in this dark night there would not be a single unscarred tree like this smooth quivering thing no fields of corn not even a bush or a blade of grass no leaves to rustle and smell sweet not a bird no little softfooted night beasts except the rats and she shuddered thinking of the belgian soldierpainter holding the tree tight she squeezed its smooth body against her a rush of the same helpless hopeless revolt and sorrow overtook her which had wrung from her that passionate little outburst to her father the night before he went away killed torn and bruised burned and killed like cyril all the young things like this little tree  rumble rumble quiver quiver and all else so still so sweet and still and starry up there through the leaves i cant bear it she thought she pressed her lips which the sun had warmed all day against the satiny smooth bark but the little tree stood within her arms insentient quivering only to the long rumbles with each of those dull mutterings life and love were going out like the flames of candles on a christmastree blown one by one to her eyes accustomed by now to the darkness in there the wood seemed slowly to be gathering a sort of life as though it were a great thing watching her a great thing with hundreds of limbs and eyes and the power of breathing the little tree which had seemed so individual and friendly ceased to be a comfort and became a part of the whole living wood absorbed in itself and coldly watching her this intruder of the mischievous breed the fatal breed which loosed those rumblings on the earth noel unlocked her arms and recoiled a bough scraped her neck some leaves flew against her eyes she stepped aside tripped over a root and fell a bough had hit her too and she lay a little dazed quivering at such dark unfriendliness she held her hands up to her face for the mere pleasure of seeing something a little less dark it was childish and absurd but she was frightened the wood seemed to have so many eyes so many arms and all unfriendly it seemed waiting to give her other blows other falls and to guard her within its darkness until she got up moved a few steps and stood still she had forgotten from where she had come in and afraid of moving deeper into the unfriendly wood she turned slowly round trying to tell which way to go it was all just one dark watching thing of limbs on the ground and in the air any way she thought any way of course will take me out and she groped forward keeping her hands up to guard her face it was silly but she could not help the sinking scattered feeling which comes to one bushed or lost in a fog if the wood had not been so dark soalive and for a second she had the senseless terrifying thought of a child what if i never get out then she laughed at it and stood still again listening there was no sound to guide her no sound at all except that faint dull rumble which seemed to come from every side now and the trees watched her ugh she thought i hate this wood she saw it now its snaky branches its darkness and great forms as an abode of giants and witches she groped and scrambled on again tripped once more and fell hitting her forehead against a trunk the blow dazed and sobered her its idiotic she thought im a baby ill just walk very slowly till i reach the edge i know it isnt a large wood she turned deliberately to face each direction solemnly selected that from which the muttering of the guns seemed to come and started again moving very slowly with her hands stretched out something rustled in the undergrowth quite close she saw a pair of green eyes shining her heart jumped into her mouth the thing sprangthere was a swish of ferns and twigs and silence noel clasped her breast a poaching cat and again she moved forward but she had lost direction im going round and round she thought they always do and the sinking scattered feeling of the bushed clutched at her again shall i call she thought i must be near the road but its so babyish she moved on again her foot struck something soft a voice muttered a thick oath a hand seized her ankle she leaped and dragged and wrenched it free and utterly unnerved she screamed and ran forward blindly     v  no one could have so convinced a feeling as jimmy fort that he would be a bit of a makeshift for noel he had spent the weeks after his interview with her father obsessed by her image often saying to himself it wont do its playing it too low down to try and get that child when i know that but for her trouble i shouldnt have a chance he had never had much opinion of his looks but now he seemed to himself absurdly old and driedup in this desert of a london he loathed the office job to which they had put him and the whole atmosphere of officialdom another year of it and he would shrivel like an old apple he began to look at himself anxiously taking stock of his physical assets now that he had this dream of young beauty he would be forty next month and she was nineteen but there would be times too when he would feel that with her he could be as much of a threeyearold as the youngster she had loved having little hope of winning her he took her past but lightly was it not that past which gave him what chance he had on two things he was determined he would not trade on her past and if by any chance she took him he would never show her that he remembered that she had one  after writing to gratian he had spent the week before his holiday began in an attempt to renew the youthfulness of his appearance which made him feel older leaner bonier and browner than ever he got up early rode in the rain took turkish baths and did all manner of exercises neither smoked nor drank and went to bed early exactly as if he had been going to ride a steeplechase on the afternoon when at last he left on that terrific pilgrimage he gazed at his face with a sort of despair it was so lean and leathercoloured and he counted almost a dozen grey hairs  when he reached the bungalow and was told that she was working in the cornfields he had for the first time a feeling that fate was on his side such a meeting would be easier than any other he had been watching her for several minutes before she saw him with his heart beating more violently than it had ever beaten in the trenches and that new feeling of hope stayed with himall through the greeting throughout supper and even after she had left them and gone upstairs then with the suddenness of a blind drawn down it vanished and he sat on trying to talk and slowly getting more and more silent and restless  nollie gets so tired working gratian said he knew she meant it kindly but that she should say it at all was ominous he got up at last having lost hope of seeing noel again conscious too that he had answered the last three questions at random  in the porch george said youll come in to lunch tomorrow wont you  oh thanks im afraid itll bore you all  not a bit nollie wont be so tired  againso well meant they were very kind he looked up from the gate trying to make out which her window might be but all was dark a little way down the road he stopped to light a cigarette and leaning against a gate drew the smoke of it deep into his lungs trying to assuage the ache in his heart so it was hopeless she had taken the first the very first chance to get away from him she knew that he loved her could not help knowing for he had never been able to keep it out of his eyes and voice if she had felt ever so little for him she would not have avoided him this first evening ill go back to that desert he thought im not going to whine and crawl ill go back and bite on it one must have some pride oh why the hell am i crockedup like this if only i could get out to france again and then noels figure bent over the falling corn formed before him ill have one more try he thought one moretomorrow somewhere ill get to know for certain and if i get what leilas got i shall deserve it i suppose poor leila where is she back at high constantia what was that a cryof terrorin that wood crossing to the edge he called cooee and stood peering into its darkness he heard the sound of bushes being brushed aside and whistled a figure came bursting out almost into his arms  hallo he said whats up  a voice gasped oh itsits nothing  he saw noel she had swayed back and stood about a yard away he could dimly see her covering her face with her arms feeling instinctively that she wanted to hide her fright he said quietly  what luck i was just passing its awfully dark  ii got lost and a mancaught my foot in there  moved beyond control by the little gulps and gasps of her breathing he stepped forward and put his hands on her shoulders he held her lightly without speaking terrified lest he should wound her pride  ii got in there she gasped and the treesand i stumbled over a roan asleep and he  yes yes i know he murmured as if to a child she had dropped her arms now and he could see her face with eyes unnaturally dilated and lips quivering then moved again beyond control he drew her so close that he could feel the throbbing of her heart and put his lips to her forehead all wet with heat she closed her eyes gave a little choke and buried her face against his coat  there there my darling he kept on saying there there my darling he could feel the snuggling of her cheek against his shoulder he had got herhad got her he was somehow certain that she would not draw back now and in the wonder and ecstasy of that thought all the world above her head the stars in their courses the wood which had frightened her seemed miracles of beauty and fitness by such fortune as had never come to man he had got her and he murmured over and over again  i love you she was resting perfectly quiet against him while her heart ceased gradually to beat so fast he could feel her cheek rubbing against his coat of harris tweed suddenly she sniffed at it and whispered  it smells good     vi  when summer sun has burned all egypt the white man looks eagerly each day for evening whose rosecoloured veil melts opalescent into the dun drift of the hills and iridescent above into the slowly deepening blue pierson stood gazing at the mystery of the desert from under the little group of palms and bougainvillea which formed the garden of the hospital evensong was in full voice from the far wing a gramophone was grinding out a musichall ditty two aeroplanes wheeling exactly like the buzzards of the desert were letting drip the faint whir of their flight metallic voices drifted from the arab village the wheels of the waterwells creaked and every now and then a dry rustle was stirred from the palmleaves by puffs of desert wind on either hand an old road ran out whose line could be marked by the little old watchtowers of another age for how many hundred years had human life passed along it to east and west the brown men and their camels threading that immemorial track over the desert which ever filled him with wonder so still it was so wide so desolate and every evening so beautiful he sometimes felt that he could sit for ever looking at it as though its cruel mysterious loveliness werehome and yet he never looked at it without a spasm of homesickness  so far his new work had brought him no nearer to the hearts of men or at least he did not feel it had both at the regimental base and now in this hospitalan intermediate stagewaiting for the draft with which he would be going into palestine all had been very nice to him friendly and as it were indulgent so might schoolboys have treated some wellintentioned dreamy master or business men a harmless idealistic inventor who came visiting their offices he had even the feeling that they were glad to have him about just as they were glad to have their mascots and their regimental colours but of hearttoheart simple comradeshipit seemed they neither wanted it of him nor expected him to give it so that he had a feeling that he would be forward and impertinent to offer it moreover he no longer knew how he was very lonely when i come face to face with death he would think it will be different death makes us all brothers i may be of real use to them then  they brought him a letter while he stood there listening to that evensong gazing at the old desert road   darling dad  i do hope this will reach you before you move on to palestine you said in your lastat the end of september so i hope youll just get it there is one great piece of news which im afraid will hurt and trouble you nollie is married to jimmy fort they were married down here this afternoon and have just gone up to town they have to find a house of course she has been very restless lonely and unhappy ever since you went and im sure it is really for the best she is quite another creature and simply devoted headlong its just like nollie she says she didnt know what she wanted up to the last minute but now she seems as if she could never want anything else  dad dear nollie could never have made good by herself it isnt her nature and its much better like this i feel sure and so does george of course it isnt idealand one wanted that for her but she did break her wing and he is so awfully good and devoted to her though you didnt believe it and perhaps wont even now the great thing is to feel her happy again and know shes safe nollie is capable of great devotion only she must be anchored she was drifting all about and one doesnt know what she might have done in one of her moods i do hope you wont grieve about it shes dreadfully anxious about how youll feel i know it will be wretched for you so far off but do try and believe its for the best shes out of danger and she was really in a horrible position its so good for the baby too and only fair to him i do think one must take things as they are dad dear it was impossible to mend nollies wing if she were a fighter and gloried in it or if she were the sort who would take the veilbut she isnt either so it is all right dad shes writing to you herself im sure leila didnt want jimmy fort to be unhappy because he couldnt love her or she would never have gone away george sends you his love we are both very well and nollie is looking splendid still after her harvest work all all my love dad dear is there anything we can get and send you do take care of your blessed self and dont grieve about nollie  gratian   a halfsheet of paper fluttered down he picked it up from among the parched fibre of dead palmleaves   daddy darling  ive done it forgive meim so happy  your nollie   the desert shimmered the palmleaves rustled and pierson stood trying to master the emotion roused in him by those two letters he felt no anger not even vexation he felt no sorrow but a loneliness so utter and complete that he did not know how to bear it it seemed as if some last link with life had snapped my girls are happy he thought if i am notwhat does it matter if my faith and my convictions mean nothing to themwhy should they follow i must and will not feel lonely i ought to have the sense of god present to feel his hand in mine if i cannot what use am iwhat use to the poor fellows in there what use in all the world  an old native on a donkey went by piping a soudanese melody on a little wooden arab flute pierson turned back into the hospital humming it a nurse met him there  the poor boy at the end of a ward is sinking fast sir i expect hed like to see you  he went into a ward and walked down between the beds to the west window end where two screens had been put to block off the cot another nurse who was sitting beside it rose at once  hes quite conscious she whispered he can still speak a little hes such a dear a tear rolled down her cheek and she passed out behind the screens pierson looked down at the boy perhaps he was twenty but the unshaven down on his cheeks was soft and almost colourless his eyes were closed he breathed regularly and did not seem in pain but there was about him that which told he was going something resigned already of the grave the window was wide open covered by mosquitonetting and a tiny line of sunlight slanting through across the foot of the cot crept slowly backwards over the sheets and the boys body shortening as it crept in the grey whiteness of the walls the bed the boys face just that pale yellow bar of sunlight and one splash of red and blue from a little flag on the wall glowed out at this cooler hour the ward behind the screens was almost empty and few sounds broke the stillness but from without came that intermittent rustle of dry palmleaves pierson waited in silence watching the sun sink if the boy might pass like this it would be gods mercy then he saw the boys eyes open wonderfully clear eyes of the lighted grey which has dark rims his lips moved and pierson bent down to hear  im goin west zurr the whisper had a little soft burr the lips quivered a pucker as of a child formed on his face and passed  through piersons mind there flashed the thought o god let me be some help to him  to god my dear son he said  a flicker of humour of ironic question passed over the boys lips  terribly moved pierson knelt down and began softly fervently praying his whispering mingled with the rustle of the palmleaves while the bar of sunlight crept up the body in the boys smile had been the whole of stoic doubt of stoic acquiescence it had met him with an unconscious challenge had seemed to know so much pierson took his hand which lay outside the sheet the boys lips moved as though in thanks he drew a long feeble breath as if to suck in the thread of sunlight and his eyes closed pierson bent over the hand when he looked up the boy was dead he kissed his forehead and went quietly out  the sun had set and he walked away from the hospital to a hillock beyond the track on the deserts edge and stood looking at the afterglow the sun and the boytogether they had gone west into that wide glowing nothingness  the muezzin call to sunset prayer in the arab village came to him clear and sharp while he sat there unutterably lonely why had that smile so moved him other death smiles had been like this evening smile on the desert hillsa glowing peace a promise of heaven but the boys smile had said waste no breath on meyou cannot help who knowswho knows i have no hope no faith but i am adventuring goodbye poor boy he had braved all things and moved out uncertain yet undaunted was that then the uttermost truth was faith a smaller thing but from that strange notion he recoiled with horror in faith i have lived in faith i will die he thought god helping me and the breeze ruffling the desert sand blew the grains against the palms of his hands outstretched above the warm earth
