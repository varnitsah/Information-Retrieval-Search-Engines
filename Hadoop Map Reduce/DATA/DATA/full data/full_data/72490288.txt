72490288	the defenders  by philip k dick  illustrated by emsh       no weapon has ever been frightful enough to put a stop to     warperhaps because we never before had any that thought for     themselves   illustration   taylor sat back in his chair reading the morning newspaper the warm kitchen and the smell of coffee blended with the comfort of not having to go to work this was his rest period the first for a long time and he was glad of it he folded the second section back sighing with contentment  what is it mary said from the stove  they pasted moscow again last night taylor nodded his head in approval gave it a real pounding one of those rh bombs its about time  he nodded again feeling the full comfort of the kitchen the presence of his plump attractive wife the breakfast dishes and coffee this was relaxation and the war news was good good and satisfying he could feel a justifiable glow at the news a sense of pride and personal accomplishment after all he was an integral part of the war program not just another factory worker lugging a cart of scrap but a technician one of those who designed and planned the nervetrunk of the war  it says they have the new subs almost perfected wait until they get those going he smacked his lips with anticipation when they start shelling from underwater the soviets are sure going to be surprised  theyre doing a wonderful job mary agreed vaguely do you know what we saw today our team is getting a leady to show to the school children i saw the leady but only for a moment its good for the children to see what their contributions are going for dont you think  she looked around at him  a leady taylor murmured he put the newspaper slowly down well make sure its decontaminated properly we dont want to take any chances  oh they always bathe them when theyre brought down from the surface mary said they wouldnt think of letting them down without the bath would they she hesitated thinking back don you know it makes me remember  he nodded i know                                       he knew what she was thinking once in the very first weeks of the war before everyone had been evacuated from the surface they had seen a hospital train discharging the wounded people who had been showered with sleet he remembered the way they had looked the expression on their faces or as much of their faces as was left it had not been a pleasant sight  there had been a lot of that at first in the early days before the transfer to undersurface was complete there had been a lot and it hadnt been very difficult to come across it  taylor looked up at his wife she was thinking too much about it the last few months they all were  forget it he said its all in the past there isnt anybody up there now but the leadys and they dont mind  but just the same i hope theyre careful when they let one of them down here if one were still hot  he laughed pushing himself away from the table forget it this is a wonderful moment ill be home for the next two shifts nothing to do but sit around and take things easy maybe we can take in a show okay  a show do we have to i dont like to look at all the destruction the ruins sometimes i see some place i remember like san francisco they showed a shot of san francisco the bridge broken and fallen in the water and i got upset i dont like to watch  but dont you want to know whats going on no human beings are getting hurt you know  but its so awful her face was set and strained please no don  don taylor picked up his newspaper sullenly all right but there isnt a hell of a lot else to do and dont forget their cities are getting it even worse  she nodded taylor turned the rough thin sheets of newspaper his good mood had soured on him why did she have to fret all the time they were pretty well off as things went you couldnt expect to have everything perfect living undersurface with an artificial sun and artificial food naturally it was a strain not seeing the sky or being able to go any place or see anything other than metal walls great roaring factories the plantyards barracks but it was better than being on surface and some day it would end and they could return nobody wanted to live this way but it was necessary  he turned the page angrily and the poor paper ripped damn it the paper was getting worse quality all the time bad print yellow tint  well they needed everything for the war program he ought to know that wasnt he one of the planners  he excused himself and went into the other room the bed was still unmade they had better get it in shape before the seventh hour inspection there was a one unit fine  the vidphone rang he halted who would it be he went over and clicked it on  taylor the face said forming into place it was an old face gray and grim this is moss im sorry to bother you during rest period but this thing has come up he rattled papers i want you to hurry over here  taylor stiffened what is it theres no chance it could wait the calm gray eyes were studying him expressionless unjudging if you want me to come down to the lab taylor grumbled i suppose i can ill get my uniform  no come as you are and not to the lab meet me at second stage as soon as possible itll take you about a half hour using the fast car up ill see you there  the picture broke and moss disappeared                                       what was it mary said at the door  moss he wants me for something  i knew this would happen  well you didnt want to do anything anyhow what does it matter his voice was bitter its all the same every day ill bring you back something im going up to second stage maybe ill be close enough to the surface to  dont dont bring me anything not from the surface  all right i wont but of all the irrational nonsense  she watched him put on his boots without answering                                       moss nodded and taylor fell in step with him as the older man strode along a series of loads were going up to the surface blind cars clanking like oretrucks up the ramp disappearing through the stage trap above them taylor watched the cars heavy with tubular machinery of some sort weapons new to him workers were everywhere in the dark gray uniforms of the labor corps loading lifting shouting back and forth the stage was deafening with noise  well go up a way moss said where we can talk this is no place to give you details  they took an escalator up the commercial lift fell behind them and with it most of the crashing and booming soon they emerged on an observation platform suspended on the side of the tube the vast tunnel leading to the surface not more than half a mile above them now  my god taylor said looking down the tube involuntarily its a long way down  moss laughed dont look  they opened a door and entered an office behind the desk an officer was sitting an officer of internal security he looked up  ill be right with you moss he gazed at taylor studying him youre a little ahead of time  this is commander franks moss said to taylor he was the first to make the discovery i was notified last night he tapped a parcel he carried i was let in because of this  franks frowned at him and stood up were going up to first stage we can discuss it there  first stage taylor repeated nervously the three of them went down a side passage to a small lift ive never been up there is it all right its not radioactive is it  youre like everyone else franks said old women afraid of burglars no radiation leaks down to first stage theres lead and rock and what comes down the tube is bathed  whats the nature of the problem taylor asked id like to know something about it  in a moment  they entered the lift and ascended when they stepped out they were in a hall of soldiers weapons and uniforms everywhere taylor blinked in surprise so this was first stage the closest undersurface level to the top after this stage there was only rock lead and rock and the great tubes leading up like the burrows of earthworms lead and rock and above that where the tubes opened the great expanse that no living being had seen for eight years the vast endless ruin that had once been mans home the place where he had lived eight years ago  now the surface was a lethal desert of slag and rolling clouds endless clouds drifted back and forth blotting out the red sun occasionally something metallic stirred moving through the remains of a city threading its way across the tortured terrain of the countryside a leady a surface robot immune to radiation constructed with feverish haste in the last months before the cold war became literally hot  leadys crawling along the ground moving over the oceans or through the skies in slender blackened craft creatures that could exist where no life could remain metal and plastic figures that waged a war man had conceived but which he could not fight himself human beings had invented war invented and manufactured the weapons even invented the players the fighters the actors of the war but they themselves could not venture forth could not wage it themselves in all the worldin russia in europe america africano living human being remained they were under the surface in the deep shelters that had been carefully planned and built even as the first bombs began to fall  it was a brilliant idea and the only idea that could have worked up above on the ruined blasted surface of what had once been a living planet the leady crawled and scurried and fought mans war and undersurface in the depths of the planet human beings toiled endlessly to produce the weapons to continue the fight month by month year by year                                       first stage taylor said a strange ache went through him almost to the surface  but not quite moss said  franks led them through the soldiers over to one side near the lip of the tube  in a few minutes a lift will bring something down to us from the surface he explained you see taylor every once in a while security examines and interrogates a surface leady one that has been above for a time to find out certain things a vidcall is sent up and contact is made with a field headquarters we need this direct interview we cant depend on vidscreen contact alone the leadys are doing a good job but we want to make certain that everything is going the way we want it  franks faced taylor and moss and continued the lift will bring down a leady from the surface one of the aclass leadys theres an examination chamber in the next room with a lead wall in the center so the interviewing officers wont be exposed to radiation we find this easier than bathing the leady it is going right back up it has a job to get back to  two days ago an aclass leady was brought down and interrogated i conducted the session myself we were interested in a new weapon the soviets have been using an automatic mine that pursues anything that moves military had sent instructions up that the mine be observed and reported in detail  this aclass leady was brought down with information we learned a few facts from it obtained the usual roll of film and reports and then sent it back up it was going out of the chamber back to the lift when a curious thing happened at the time i thought  franks broke off a red light was flashing  that down lift is coming he nodded to some soldiers lets enter the chamber the leady will be along in a moment  an aclass leady taylor said ive seen them on the showscreens making their reports  its quite an experience moss said theyre almost human                                       they entered the chamber and seated themselves behind the lead wall after a time a signal was flashed and franks made a motion with his hands  the door beyond the wall opened taylor peered through his view slot he saw something advancing slowly a slender metallic figure moving on a tread its arm grips at rest by its sides the figure halted and scanned the lead wall it stood waiting  we are interested in learning something franks said before i question you do you have anything to report on surface conditions  no the war continues the leadys voice was automatic and toneless we are a little short of fast pursuit craft the singleseat type we could use also some  that has all been noted what i want to ask you is this our contact with you has been through vidscreen only we must rely on indirect evidence since none of us goes above we can only infer what is going on we never see anything ourselves we have to take it all secondhand some top leaders are beginning to think theres too much room for error  error the leady asked in what way our reports are checked carefully before theyre sent down we maintain constant contact with you everything of value is reported any new weapons which the enemy is seen to employ  i realize that franks grunted behind his peep slot but perhaps we should see it all for ourselves is it possible that there might be a large enough radiationfree area for a human party to ascend to the surface if a few of us were to come up in leadlined suits would we be able to survive long enough to observe conditions and watch things  the machine hesitated before answering i doubt it you can check air samples of course and decide for yourselves but in the eight years since you left things have continually worsened you cannot have any real idea of conditions up there it has become difficult for any moving object to survive for long there are many kinds of projectiles sensitive to movement the new mine not only reacts to motion but continues to pursue the object indefinitely until it finally reaches it and the radiation is everywhere  i see franks turned to moss his eyes narrowed oddly well that was what i wanted to know you may go  the machine moved back toward its exit it paused each month the amount of lethal particles in the atmosphere increases the tempo of the war is gradually  i understand franks rose he held out his hand and moss passed him the package one thing before you leave i want you to examine a new type of metal shield material ill pass you a sample with the tong  franks put the package in the toothed grip and revolved the tong so that he held the other end the package swung down to the leady which took it they watched it unwrap the package and take the metal plate in its hands the leady turned the metal over and over  suddenly it became rigid  all right franks said  he put his shoulder against the wall and a section slid aside taylor gaspedfranks and moss were hurrying up to the leady  good god taylor said but its radioactive                                       the leady stood unmoving still holding the metal soldiers appeared in the chamber they surrounded the leady and ran a counter across it carefully  okay sir one of them said to franks its as cold as a long winter evening  good i was sure but i didnt want to take any chances  you see moss said to taylor this leady isnt hot at all yet it came directly from the surface without even being bathed  but what does it mean taylor asked blankly  it may be an accident franks said theres always the possibility that a given object might escape being exposed above but this is the second time its happened that we know of there may be others  the second time  the previous interview was when we noticed it the leady was not hot it was cold too like this one  moss took back the metal plate from the leadys hands he pressed the surface carefully and returned it to the stiff unprotesting fingers  we shorted it out with this so we could get close enough for a thorough check itll come back on in a second now we had better get behind the wall again  they walked back and the lead wall swung closed behind them the soldiers left the chamber  two periods from now franks said softly an initial investigating party will be ready to go surfaceside were going up the tube in suits up to the topthe first human party to leave undersurface in eight years  it may mean nothing moss said but i doubt it somethings going on something strange the leady told us no life could exist above without being roasted the story doesnt fit  taylor nodded he stared through the peep slot at the immobile metal figure already the leady was beginning to stir it was bent in several places dented and twisted and its finish was blackened and charred it was a leady that had been up there a long time it had seen war and destruction ruin so vast that no human being could imagine the extent it had crawled and slunk in a world of radiation and death a world where no life could exist  and taylor had touched it  youre going with us franks said suddenly i want you along i think the three of us will go                                       mary faced him with a sick and frightened expression i know it youre going to the surface arent you  she followed him into the kitchen taylor sat down looking away from her  its a classified project he evaded i cant tell you anything about it  you dont have to tell me i know i knew it the moment you came in there was something on your face something i havent seen there for a long long time it was an old look  she came toward him but how can they send you to the surface she took his face in her shaking hands making him look at her there was a strange hunger in her eyes nobody can live up there look look at this  she grabbed up a newspaper and held it in front of him  look at this photograph america europe asia africanothing but ruins weve seen it every day on the showscreens all destroyed poisoned and theyre sending you up why no living thing can get by up there not even a weed or grass theyve wrecked the surface havent they havent they  taylor stood up its an order i know nothing about it i was told to report to join a scout party thats all i know  he stood for a long time staring ahead slowly he reached for the newspaper and held it up to the light  it looks real he murmured ruins deadness slag its convincing all the reports photographs films even air samples yet we havent seen it for ourselves not after the first months   what are you talking about  nothing he put the paper down im leaving early after the next sleep period lets turn in  mary turned away her face hard and harsh do what you want we might just as well all go up and get killed at once instead of dying slowly down here like vermin in the ground  he had not realized how resentful she was were they all like that how about the workers toiling in the factories day and night endlessly the pale stooped men and women plodding back and forth to work blinking in the colorless light eating synthetics  you shouldnt be so bitter he said  mary smiled a little im bitter because i know youll never come back she turned away ill never see you again once you go up there  he was shocked what how can you say a thing like that  she did not answer                                       he awakened with the public newscaster screeching in his ears shouting outside the building  special news bulletin surface forces report enormous soviet attack with new weapons retreat of key groups all work units report to factories at once  taylor blinked rubbing his eyes he jumped out of bed and hurried to the vidphone a moment later he was put through to moss  listen he said what about this new attack is the project off he could see mosss desk covered with reports and papers  no moss said were going right ahead get over here at once  but  dont argue with me moss held up a handful of surface bulletins crumpling them savagely this is a fake come on he broke off  taylor dressed furiously his mind in a daze  half an hour later he leaped from a fast car and hurried up the stairs into the synthetics building the corridors were full of men and women rushing in every direction he entered mosss office  there you are moss said getting up immediately franks is waiting for us at the outgoing station  they went in a security car the siren screaming workers scattered out of their way  what about the attack taylor asked  moss braced his shoulders were certain that weve forced their hand weve brought the issue to a head  they pulled up at the station link of the tube and leaped out a moment later they were moving up at high speed toward the first stage  they emerged into a bewildering scene of activity soldiers were fastening on lead suits talking excitedly to each other shouting back and forth guns were being given out instructions passed  taylor studied one of the soldiers he was armed with the dreaded bender pistol the new snubnosed hand weapon that was just beginning to come from the assembly line some of the soldiers looked a little frightened  i hope were not making a mistake moss said noticing his gaze  franks came toward them heres the program the three of us are going up first alone the soldiers will follow in fifteen minutes  what are we going to tell the leadys taylor worriedly asked well have to tell them something  we want to observe the new soviet attack franks smiled ironically since it seems to be so serious we should be there in person to witness it  and then what taylor said  thatll be up to them lets go                                       in a small car they went swiftly up the tube carried by antigrav beams from below taylor glanced down from time to time it was a long way back and getting longer each moment he sweated nervously inside his suit gripping his bender pistol with inexpert fingers  why had they chosen him chance pure chance moss had asked him to come along as a department member then franks had picked him out on the spur of the moment and now they were rushing toward the surface faster and faster  a deep fear instilled in him for eight years throbbed in his mind radiation certain death a world blasted and lethal  up and up the car went taylor gripped the sides and closed his eyes each moment they were closer the first living creatures to go above the first stage up the tube past the lead and rock up to the surface the phobic horror shook him in waves it was death they all knew that hadnt they seen it in the films a thousand times the cities the sleet coming down the rolling clouds  it wont be much longer franks said were almost there the surface tower is not expecting us i gave orders that no signal was to be sent  the car shot up rushing furiously taylors head spun he hung on his eyes shut up and up  the car stopped he opened his eyes  they were in a vast room fluorescentlit a cavern filled with equipment and machinery endless mounds of material piled in row after row among the stacks leadys were working silently pushing trucks and handcarts  leadys moss said his face was pale then were really on the surface  the leadys were going back and forth with equipment moving the vast stores of guns and spare parts ammunition and supplies that had been brought to the surface and this was the receiving station for only one tube there were many others scattered throughout the continent  taylor looked nervously around him they were really there above ground on the surface this was where the war was  come on franks said a bclass guard is coming our way                                       they stepped out of the car a leady was approaching them rapidly it coasted up in front of them and stopped scanning them with its handweapon raised  this is security franks said have an aclass sent to me at once  the leady hesitated other bclass guards were coming scooting across the floor alert and alarmed moss peered around  obey franks said in a loud commanding voice youve been ordered  the leady moved uncertainly away from them at the end of the building a door slid back two aclass leadys appeared coming slowly toward them each had a green stripe across its front  from the surface council franks whispered tensely this is above ground all right get set  the two leadys approached warily without speaking they stopped close by the men looking them up and down  im franks of security we came from undersurface in order to  this in incredible one of the leadys interrupted him coldly you know you cant live up here the whole surface is lethal to you you cant possibly remain on the surface  these suits will protect us franks said in any case its not your responsibility what i want is an immediate council meeting so i can acquaint myself with conditions with the situation here can that be arranged  you human beings cant survive up here and the new soviet attack is directed at this area it is in considerable danger  we know that please assemble the council franks looked around him at the vast room lit by recessed lamps in the ceiling an uncertain quality came into his voice is it night or day right now  night one of the aclass leadys said after a pause dawn is coming in about two hours  franks nodded well remain at least two hours then as a concession to our sentimentality would you please show us some place where we can observe the sun as it comes up we would appreciate it  a stir went through the leadys  it is an unpleasant sight one of the leadys said youve seen the photographs you know what youll witness clouds of drifting particles blot out the light slag heaps are everywhere the whole land is destroyed for you it will be a staggering sight much worse than pictures and film can convey  however it may be well stay long enough to see it will you give the order to the council                                       come this way reluctantly the two leadys coasted toward the wall of the warehouse the three men trudged after them their heavy shoes ringing against the concrete at the wall the two leadys paused  this is the entrance to the council chamber there are windows in the chamber room but it is still dark outside of course youll see nothing right now but in two hours  open the door franks said  the door slid back they went slowly inside the room was small a neat room with a round table in the center chairs ringing it the three of them sat down silently and the two leadys followed after them taking their places  the other council members are on their way they have already been notified and are coming as quickly as they can again i urge you to go back down the leady surveyed the three human beings there is no way you can meet the conditions up here even we survive with some trouble ourselves how can you expect to do it  the leader approached franks  this astonishes and perplexes us it said of course we must do what you tell us but allow me to point out that if you remain here  we know franks said impatiently however we intend to remain at least until sunrise  if you insist  there was silence the leadys seemed to be conferring with each other although the three men heard no sound  for your own good the leader said at last you must go back down we have discussed this and it seems to us that you are doing the wrong thing for your own good  we are human beings franks said sharply dont you understand were men not machines  that is precisely why you must go back this room is radioactive all surface areas are we calculate that your suits will not protect you for over fifty more minutes therefore  the leadys moved abruptly toward the men wheeling in a circle forming a solid row the men stood up taylor reaching awkwardly for his weapon his fingers numb and stupid the men stood facing the silent metal figures  we must insist the leader said its voice without emotion we must take you back to the tube and send you down on the next car i am sorry but it is necessary  whatll we do moss said nervously to franks he touched his gun shall we blast them  franks shook his head all right he said to the leader well go back                                       he moved toward the door motioning taylor and moss to follow him they looked at him in surprise but they came with him the leadys followed them out into the great warehouse slowly they moved toward the tube entrance none of them speaking  illustration  at the lip franks turned we are going back because we have no choice there are three of us and about a dozen of you however if  here comes the car taylor said  there was a grating sound from the tube dclass leadys moved toward the edge to receive it  i am sorry the leader said but it is for your protection we are watching over you literally you must stay below and let us conduct the war in a sense it has come to be our war we must fight it as we see fit  the car rose to the surface  twelve soldiers armed with bender pistols stepped from it and surrounded the three men  moss breathed a sigh of relief well this does change things it came off just right  the leader moved back away from the soldiers it studied them intently glancing from one to the next apparently trying to make up its mind at last it made a sign to the other leadys they coasted aside and a corridor was opened up toward the warehouse  even now the leader said we could send you back by force but it is evident that this is not really an observation party at all these soldiers show that you have much more in mind this was all carefully prepared  very carefully franks said  they closed in  how much more we can only guess i must admit that we were taken unprepared we failed utterly to meet the situation now force would be absurd because neither side can afford to injure the other we because of the restrictions placed on us regarding human life you because the war demands  the soldiers fired quick and in fright moss dropped to one knee firing up the leader dissolved in a cloud of particles on all sides d and bclass leadys were rushing up some with weapons some with metal slats the room was in confusion off in the distance a siren was screaming franks and taylor were cut off from the others separated from the soldiers by a wall of metal bodies  they cant fire back franks said calmly this is another bluff theyve tried to bluff us all the way he fired into the face of a leady the leady dissolved they can only try to frighten us remember that                                       they went on firing and leady after leady vanished the room reeked with the smell of burning metal the stink of fused plastic and steel taylor had been knocked down he was struggling to find his gun reaching wildly among metal legs groping frantically to find it his fingers strained a handle swam in front of him suddenly something came down on his arm a metal foot he cried out  then it was over the leadys were moving away gathering together off to one side only four of the surface council remained the others were radioactive particles in the air dclass leadys were already restoring order gathering up partly destroyed metal figures and bits and removing them  franks breathed a shuddering sigh  all right he said you can take us back to the windows it wont be long now  the leadys separated and the human group moss and franks and taylor and the soldiers walked slowly across the room toward the door they entered the council chamber already a faint touch of gray mitigated the blackness of the windows  take us outside franks said impatiently well see it directly not in here  a door slid open a chill blast of cold morning air rushed in chilling them even through their lead suits the men glanced at each other uneasily  come on franks said outside  he walked out through the door the others following him  they were on a hill overlooking the vast bowl of a valley dimly against the graying sky the outline of mountains were forming becoming tangible  itll be bright enough to see in a few minutes moss said he shuddered as a chilling wind caught him and moved around him its worth it really worth it to see this again after eight years even if its the last thing we see  watch franks snapped  they obeyed silent and subdued the sky was clearing brightening each moment some place far off echoing across the valley a rooster crowed  a chicken taylor murmured did you hear  behind them the leadys had come out and were standing silently watching too the gray sky turned to white and the hills appeared more clearly light spread across the valley floor moving toward them  god in heaven franks exclaimed  trees trees and forests a valley of plants and trees with a few roads winding among them farmhouses a windmill a barn far down below them  look moss whispered  color came into the sky the sun was approaching birds began to sing not far from where they stood the leaves of a tree danced in the wind  franks turned to the row of leadys behind them  eight years we were tricked there was no war as soon as we left the surface  yes an aclass leady admitted as soon as you left the war ceased youre right it was a hoax you worked hard undersurface sending up guns and weapons and we destroyed them as fast as they came up  but why taylor asked dazed he stared down at the vast valley below why                                       you created us the leady said to pursue the war for you while you human beings went below the ground in order to survive but before we could continue the war it was necessary to analyze it to determine what its purpose was we did this and we found that it had no purpose except perhaps in terms of human needs even this was questionable  we investigated further we found that human cultures pass through phases each culture in its own time as the culture ages and begins to lose its objectives conflict arises within it between those who wish to cast it off and set up a new culturepattern and those who wish to retain the old with as little change as possible  at this point a great danger appears the conflict within threatens to engulf the society in selfwar group against group the vital traditions may be lostnot merely altered or reformed but completely destroyed in this period of chaos and anarchy we have found many such examples in the history of mankind  it is necessary for this hatred within the culture to be directed outward toward an external group so that the culture itself may survive its crisis war is the result war to a logical mind is absurd but in terms of human needs it plays a vital role and it will continue to until man has grown up enough so that no hatred lies within him  taylor was listening intently do you think this time will come  of course it has almost arrived now this is the last war man is almost united into one final culturea world culture at this point he stands continent against continent one half of the world against the other half only a single step remains the jump to a unified culture man has climbed slowly upward tending always toward unification of his culture it will not be long  but it has not come yet and so the war had to go on to satisfy the last violent surge of hatred that man felt eight years have passed since the war began in these eight years we have observed and noted important changes going on in the minds of men fatigue and disinterest we have seen are gradually taking the place of hatred and fear the hatred is being exhausted gradually over a period of time but for the present the hoax must go on at least for a while longer you are not ready to learn the truth you would want to continue the war  but how did you manage it moss asked all the photographs the samples the damaged equipment  come over here the leady directed them toward a long low building work goes on constantly whole staffs laboring to maintain a coherent and convincing picture of a global war                                       they entered the building leadys were working everywhere poring over tables and desks  examine this project here the aclass leady said two leadys were carefully photographing something an elaborate model on a table top it is a good example  the men grouped around trying to see it was a model of a ruined city  taylor studied it in silence for a long time at last he looked up  its san francisco he said in a low voice this is a model of san francisco destroyed i saw this on the vidscreen piped down to us the bridges were hit  yes notice the bridges the leady traced the ruined span with his metal finger a tiny spiderweb almost invisible you have no doubt seen photographs of this many times and of the other tables in this building  san francisco itself is completely intact we restored it soon after you left rebuilding the parts that had been damaged at the start of the war the work of manufacturing news goes on all the time in this particular building we are very careful to see that each part fits in with all the other parts much time and effort are devoted to it  franks touched one of the tiny model buildings lying half in ruins so this is what you spend your time doingmaking model cities and then blasting them  no we do much more we are caretakers watching over the whole world the owners have left for a time and we must see that the cities are kept clean that decay is prevented that everything is kept oiled and in running condition the gardens the streets the water mains everything must be maintained as it was eight years ago so that when the owners return they will not be displeased we want to be sure that they will be completely satisfied  franks tapped moss on the arm  come over here he said in a low voice i want to talk to you  he led moss and taylor out of the building away from the leadys outside on the hillside the soldiers followed them the sun was up and the sky was turning blue the air smelled sweet and good the smell of growing things  taylor removed his helmet and took a deep breath  i havent smelled that smell for a long time he said  listen franks said his voice low and hard we must get back down at once theres a lot to get started on all this can be turned to our advantage  what do you mean moss asked  its a certainty that the soviets have been tricked too the same as us but we have found out that gives us an edge over them  i see moss nodded we know but they dont their surface council has sold out the same as ours it works against them the same way but if we could  with a hundred toplevel men we could take over again restore things as they should be it would be easy                                       moss touched him on the arm an aclass leady was coming from the building toward them  weve seen enough franks said raising his voice all this is very serious it must be reported below and a study made to determine our policy  the leady said nothing  franks waved to the soldiers lets go he started toward the warehouse  most of the soldiers had removed their helmets some of them had taken their lead suits off too and were relaxing comfortably in their cotton uniforms they stared around them down the hillside at the trees and bushes the vast expanse of green the mountains and the sky  look at the sun one of them murmured  it sure is bright as hell another said  were going back down franks said fall in by twos and follow us  reluctantly the soldiers regrouped the leadys watched without emotion as the men marched slowly back toward the warehouse franks and moss and taylor led them across the ground glancing alertly at the leadys as they walked  they entered the warehouse dclass leadys were loading material and weapons on surface carts cranes and derricks were working busily everywhere the work was done with efficiency but without hurry or excitement  the men stopped watching leadys operating the little carts moved past them signaling silently to each other guns and parts were being hoisted by magnetic cranes and lowered gently onto waiting carts  come on franks said  he turned toward the lip of the tube a row of dclass leadys was standing in front of it immobile and silent franks stopped moving back he looked around an aclass leady was coming toward him  tell them to get out of the way franks said he touched his gun you had better move them  time passed an endless moment without measure the men stood nervous and alert watching the row of leadys in front of them  as you wish the aclass leady said  it signaled and the dclass leadys moved into life they stepped slowly aside  moss breathed a sigh of relief  im glad thats over he said to franks look at them all why dont they try to stop us they must know what were going to do  franks laughed stop us you saw what happened when they tried to stop us before they cant theyre only machines we built them so they cant lay hands on us and they know that  his voice trailed off  the men stared at the tube entrance around them the leadys watched silent and impassive their metal faces expressionless  for a long time the men stood without moving at last taylor turned away  good god he said he was numb without feeling of any kind  the tube was gone it was sealed shut fused over only a dull surface of cooling metal greeted them  the tube had been closed                                       franks turned his face pale and vacant  the aclass leady shifted as you can see the tube has been shut we were prepared for this as soon as all of you were on the surface the order was given if you had gone back when we asked you you would now be safely down below we had to work quickly because it was such an immense operation  but why moss demanded angrily  because it is unthinkable that you should be allowed to resume the war with all the tubes sealed it will be many months before forces from below can reach the surface let alone organize a military program by that time the cycle will have entered its last stages you will not be so perturbed to find your world intact  we had hoped that you would be undersurface when the sealing occurred your presence here is a nuisance when the soviets broke through we were able to accomplish their sealing without  the soviets they broke through  several months ago they came up unexpectedly to see why the war had not been won we were forced to act with speed at this moment they are desperately attempting to cut new tubes to the surface to resume the war we have however been able to seal each new one as it appears  the leady regarded the three men calmly  were cut off moss said trembling we cant get back whatll we do  how did you manage to seal the tube so quickly franks asked the leady weve been up here only two hours  bombs are placed just above the first stage of each tube for such emergencies they are heat bombs they fuse lead and rock  gripping the handle of his gun franks turned to moss and taylor  what do you say we cant go back but we can do a lot of damage the fifteen of us we have bender guns how about it  he looked around the soldiers had wandered away again back toward the exit of the building they were standing outside looking at the valley and the sky a few of them were carefully climbing down the slope  would you care to turn over your suits and guns the aclass leady asked politely the suits are uncomfortable and youll have no need for weapons the russians have given up theirs as you can see  fingers tensed on triggers four men in russian uniforms were coming toward them from an aircraft that they suddenly realized had landed silently some distance away  let them have it franks shouted  they are unarmed said the leady we brought them here so you could begin peace talks  we have no authority to speak for our country moss said stiffly  we do not mean diplomatic discussions the leady explained there will be no more the working out of daily problems of existence will teach you how to get along in the same world it will not be easy but it will be done  illustration                                       the russians halted and they faced each other with raw hostility  i am colonel borodoy and i regret giving up our guns the senior russian said you could have been the first americans to be killed in almost eight years  or the first americans to kill franks corrected  no one would know of it except yourselves the leady pointed out it would be useless heroism your real concern should be surviving on the surface we have no food for you you know  taylor put his gun in its holster theyve done a neat job of neutralizing us damn them i propose we move into a city start raising crops with the help of some leadys and generally make ourselves comfortable drawing his lips tight over his teeth he glared at the aclass leady until our families can come up from undersurface its going to be pretty lonesome but well have to manage  if i may make a suggestion said another russian uneasily we tried living in a city it is too empty it is also too hard to maintain for so few people we finally settled in the most modern village we could find  here in this country a third russian blurted we have much to learn from you  the americans abruptly found themselves laughing  you probably have a thing or two to teach us yourselves said taylor generously though i cant imagine what  the russian colonel grinned would you join us in our village it would make our work easier and give us company  your village snapped franks its american isnt it its ours  the leady stepped between them when our plans are completed the term will be interchangeable ours will eventually mean mankinds it pointed at the aircraft which was warming up the ship is waiting will you join each other in making a new home  the russians waited while the americans made up their minds  i see what the leadys mean about diplomacy becoming outmoded franks said at last people who work together dont need diplomats they solve their problems on the operational level instead of at a conference table  the leady led them toward the ship it is the goal of history unifying the world from family to tribe to citystate to nation to hemisphere the direction has been toward unification now the hemispheres will be joined and  taylor stopped listening and glanced back at the location of the tube mary was undersurface there he hated to leave her even though he couldnt see her again until the tube was unsealed but then he shrugged and followed the others  if this tiny amalgam of former enemies was a good example it wouldnt be too long before he and mary and the rest of humanity would be living on the surface like rational human beings instead of blindly hating moles  it has taken thousands of generations to achieve the aclass leady concluded hundreds of centuries of bloodshed and destruction but each war was a step toward uniting mankind and now the end is in sight a world without war but even that is only the beginning of a new stage of history  the conquest of space breathed colonel borodoy  the meaning of life moss added  eliminating hunger and poverty said taylor  the leady opened the door of the ship all that and more how much more we cannot foresee it any more than the first men who formed a tribe could foresee this day but it will be unimaginably great  the door closed and the ship took off toward their new home                                                        philip k dick
