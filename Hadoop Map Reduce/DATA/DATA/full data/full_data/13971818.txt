allegory describing the november 1710 election of the representative scottish peers the circumstances which surrounded this election were produced by the outcome of the previous months general electiona landslide for the toriesand to understand these circumstances the impact of that tory victory must be seen within the context of the political events of 1710  by early in 1710 it had become obvious that the whig ministry of sidney godolphin was unable or unwilling to negotiate an end to the long expensive and consequently unpopular war with france the quarrel between queen anne and her confidante the duchess of marlborough smouldered until on 6 april 1710 the breach between them became final the queens confidence in the duke of marlborough began to erode as early as may 1709 when he sought to be appointed captaingeneral for life godolphins decision to impeach the popular rev dr henry sacheverell for preaching a sermon which reasserted the doctrine of nonresistance to the will of the monarch was illadvised for not only did it give the highchurch tories a martyr it also gave the administration the appearance of being against the church in securing the impeachment of sacheverell on 20 march 1710 the whigs discovered that they had lost the support and the confidence of both the parliament and the country  dissention within and intrigue from without further hastened the fall of the administration godolphin a moderate had after the general election of 1708 found himself allied with the junto of five powerful whig lordswharton sommers halifax orford and sunderlandbut it was at best an uneasy alliance throughout 1709 and into the early months of 1710 personal jealousies drove the godolphinmarlborough interest farther and farther away from the junto robert harley and the dukes of somerset and shrewsbury in their determination to overthrow the administration exploited every chance to widen the rifts between anne and her ministers and between the two ministerial factions abigail hill masham who soon became an agent of harley replaced the duchess of marlborough as annes confidante  when the ministry fell it fell like a house of cards on 14 april 1710 shrewsbury was made lord chamberlain over the unavailing protests of godolphin two months later at the instigation of somerset the queen replaced sunderland with the tory lord dartmouth as secretary of state finally on 8 august godolphin was ordered to break the white staff of his office and harley was appointed treasurer one by one the remaining junto ministers were replaced by tories by september the work was complete the duke of marlborough alone remained in command of the army but this was only to be until the new ministry could negotiate a peace and his services would no longer be required  it had been harleys intention to govern by means of a moderate administration a queens ministery above party but he had not reckoned on the outcome of the general election called in october on the day godolphin fell harley expounded his moderate programme in a letter to the duke of newcastle the queen is assured you will approve her proceedings which are directed to the sole aim of making an honourable and safe peace securing her allies reserving the liberty and property of the subject and the indulgence to dissenters in particular and to perpetuate this by really securing the succession of the house of hanover1  alone either the antagonism to the war or the intensity of feeling for the highchurch cause which the sacheverell affair engendered would have been sufficient to sweep the whigs from power together and combined as they were with the prestige of the queens public support of harley and the newly appointed tory ministers these issues were irresistible harley found himself with an immoderate house of commons the tories held 320 seats the whigs only 150 and there were 40 seats whose votes were doubtful2 many of the new parliamentarians were highchurch zealots and most were anxious to turn the nation away from the policies of the whig administration of godolphin  the house of lords however remained a bastion of whig strength as an hereditary body the house of lords was simply not subject to the same opportunity for change as the elected house of commons consequently in 1710 as a result of the glorious revolution the long reign of william iii and the godolphin ministry the majority of the members of the house of lords were of whig or revolution settlement policies therein lay harleys problem in late october of 1710 to obtain a lords to match the commons he had been given  any early eighteenthcentury ministrywhig or torycould count on having the support of those peers whose poverty made them dependent on governmental subsidies but this number would not have given harley even a bare majority in the strongly whig house of lords and there harley needed at least enough strength to ensure success for some of the measures designed to satisfy the demands of the newly tory house of commons particularly if his ministry was to be able to negotiate a satisfactory treaty of peace with france  to obtain a tory majority in the house of lords commensurate with the one in commons harley could have seen to the creation of a sufficient number of new peerages but this would have alienated too many factions and the recently completed union with scotland 1707 offered what appeared to be a far simpler expedient the act of union provided for the election of sixteen scottish peers who would represent all of the scottish nobility in the house of lords3 if he could ensure that all sixteen of these peers were tory harley would be certain of a large block of loyal votes in the upper house or at worst he would have to arrange for the creation of only a few new peers to neutralize the whigs strength to john campbell the second duke of argyll harley assigned the task of orchestrating a tory sweep in this election  the duke of argyll sat in the house of lords as the earl of greenwich an english title not as one of the elected peers and as such he was not elegible to stand as a candidate or to vote in this election argyll had supported the whig junto and held the rank of lieutenant general under marlborough in france but in 1710 seeing the direction the political tide was taking he abandoned his support of godolphins ministry so that by the time the sacheverell trial was finished it was known that the great chief of the campbells and of the scottish whigs had gone into opposition to the government of godolphin in league with harley although he voted for the doctors condemnation4  argyll and the sixteen representative peers if they were all tories together with the votes of those peers who were dependant upon government subsidies would give the new ministry of harley enough votes in the upper house for almost any eventualityeven the impeachment of marlborough it is possible to speculate that this was the plumcommand of the british armies in europethat induced argylls change from whig to tory in 1710 argylls jealousy and resentment of his commander had been a well known bit of gossip for some time and it is very possible that argyll saw a new government as his chance to steal a march on marlborough although harleys ministry did give the order of the garter to argyll on 20 december 1710 he was never promoted over marlborough but that was not due to any lack of success in assuring a tory victory in the election of the peers argylls heavyhanded management of that election is the subject of defoes atalantis major  by birth and education daniel defoe was a member of the mercantile middle class he was a dissenter and his political and economic sympathies generally coincided with those of the moderate whigs a limited monarchy the destruction of frances commercial empire liberty of conscience for dissenters and nonconformists and a protestant that is hanover succession were the imperatives which lay behind much of his political and economic thinking and writing from as early as 1694 he had served william iii as a pamphleteerpropagandist for the vigorous prosecution of the war with france after his fivemonth imprisonment in 1703 for writing the shortest way with dissenters defoe was employed as an agent and pamphleteer of the government first in the service of robert harley godolphins secretary of state during the early moderate years of the godolphin administration 170408 and thereafter working for godolphin himself defoes review preached the gospel of national unity above party faction when harley replaced godolphin as treasurer in 1710 defoe returned to his service  although it may appear from this that defoes pen was for hire by whichever party was in power in point of fact defoes political views were remarkably congruent with those of both harley and godolphin all three were staunch supporters of englands commercial interests the hanoverian succession liberty of conscience for dissenters and nonconformists and the terms of the revolution settlement it must be remembered that godolphin and harley were both moderates each trying to chart his course between the extremes of the parties they like daniel defoe saw their loyalty being to england and to the queen not to a party like defoe they both discovered that politics often make strange bedfellows godolphin faced with a large whig majority in the house of commons after the general election of 1708 found that his fortunes were bound to those of the junto harley after the general election of 1710 discovered the necessity of courting the highchurch tories far more than he would have liked  argylls slate of scottish peers for the november election included men who were even more extreme in their toryism than the majority of highchurch english tories most of the sixteen were highchurch many had strong catholic leanings all of them were against increasing the religious liberties of the scottish presbyterians and thus those of the english dissenters and nonconformists several of these peers had been openly professed jacobites and all were in some degree sympathetic to france to have men with such beliefs in parliament meant to defoe the chance that marlboroughs victories in france would be negotiated away the loss of what the toleration act of 1689 had gained and finally the spector of the pretender on the throne in short such men could mean the loss of all that the revolution and the war with france had won yet in the late autumn of 1710 defoe found himself in edinburgh the agent and propagandist of the man on whose behalf argyll had engineered the election of men of such politics  defoes mission in edinburgh that autumn was to allay the fears of the presbyterian clergy and whig merchants about the new tory ministry his message to them was in professor sutherlands words that      what the country needed  was steady moderate men whether they     called themselves whig or tory men who would uphold the protestant     succession and avoid extreme measures and that on the whole was     what it had now got appearances to the contrary notwithstanding     the ministry was not going to give way to the clamours of the high     tory rank and file and the queen would certainly not countenance     any form of persecution5  in short defoe was charged with convincing his scottish friends and associates and by means of the review the nation at large the opposite of all that argylls actions and words bespoke of harleys intentions  defoe wrote harley from edinburgh on 18 november eight days after the election of the peers to voice his dismay at the tactics that had been used by argyll by them his own mission on harleys behalf had been impaired      i hint this sir to confirm my censure of the conduct aforesaid as     imprudent and as what has rendred sic the quieting these people     which was easy before very difficult now6  further he suggests that harleys heretofore moderate allies the squadrone have been pushed by argyll into league with the old court party that had supported the godolphin ministry this letter also contains a brief summary of the main events which were to form the plot of atalantis major but it does not attack argyll with the same bitterness that the longer work does defoe writes      in the late election the conduct of the d of 60 argyll the e of     163 islay and the earle of 194 mar is very perticular     they declared openly that the quallification of those to be     chosen  was their agreeing to impeach 140 godolphin and 193     marlborough nor did the impudence end there but on all     occasions to say in so many words they had her majties orders to     choose such and such and it must be don this was so abandonning     all reserves that it has disgusted the generallity and has put     them upon measures of uniteing which may shut the door upon all     future measures what ever the occasion may be      now they have returnd their number it were to be wished they could     have avoided a few who are declard profest jacobites such as 197     marischal kilsyth blantire hume c who are known to aim in     all they do at the pretender and whose being now chosen has many     ill effects here what ever may be as to overruleing them in     england i mean as to encreasing the insolence of jacobitisme in     the north where its strength is far from being contemptible7  what defoe hoped to obtain from harley by this and succeeding letters on this subject is not clear he may have been seeking harleys public repudiation of the jacobite peers or at least some private assurances that what argyll had told the peers did not represent the new ministrys policies whatever it was he sought by late december it was obviously not forthcoming from harley or his ministry and on 20 december argyll was made a knight of the garter it was during this december that the bulk of atalantis major was written most probably between 30 november and 26 december on 26 december 1710 defoe wrote harley of the existence of two vile ill naturd pamphlets  both of which have fallen into my hands in manuscript and i think i have prevented both their printing the first was advertised in the gazette here and called the scots atalantis8  the other pamphlet is called atalantis major the letter concludes with a short description of the work a disavowal of any knowledge of its authorship and the hope that he can suppress its publication      the other pamphlet is called atalantis major and is a bitter     invective against the d of argyle the e of mar and the election     of the peers it is certainly written by some english man and i     have some guess at the man but dare not be positive i have     hitherto kept this also from the press and believe it will be     impossible for them to get it printed here after the measures i     have taken the party i got it of pretends the coppy came from     england but i am of another opinion i shall trouble you no     farther about it because if possible i can get it coppyed i will     transmit the coppy by next post for i have the originall in my     hand they expect i shall encourage and assist them in the     mannageing it and till i can take a coppy i shall not undeciev     them9  there is no evidence to suggest that harley doubted defoes disclaimer or that defoe sent the copy to harley  since defoe was back in london on 13 february 1711 atalantis major must have been seen through the press sometime between 26 december and the end of january not as moore lists it before 26 december 171010 internal evidence suggests an even narrower range of probable dates of publication the last four pages of atalantis major deal with the duke of argyll being given command of the english forces in spain and the singular lack of grace with which he undertook this command since argyll was not given command of the peninsula campaign until 11 january 1711 it could not be until after this date that the manuscript could have been finished and printed  the work bears few signs of being hastily printed there are only nine typographical errors11 and four of these are catchwords there is no evidence to suggest that there was more than one printing of the pamphlet12 and the use of several scotticisms13 seems to offer support for the contention that the pamphlet was intended for a primarily scottish audience  william lee was the first to ascribe the work to defoe and this ascription has been accepted by both dottin and moore14 the evidence for assigning this work to defoe seems to rest on the two letters to harley quoted above another proof of defoes authorship of atalantis major is to be found in the remark it contains that the southern part of the island that is england was the most remarkable of any as to the policy of their government and the character of the people and excepting englishmen and polanders there is not such another nation in the world p 12 in 1704 defoe had written the dyet of poland a poem in which he had made a similar unflattering comparison between england and poland a far more substantial case for defoes authorship can be made from the existence of the anecdote of john white edinburghs hangman in both a letter to harley 18 november 1710 and the review for 30 november 1710 as well as in atalantis major pp 223     key to names and characters in atalantis major   in the thinly disguised allegory of atalantis major atalantis is of course britain olreeky or old reeky or simply reeky is still used as an affectionate local term for the city of edinburgh prone as it is to be enshrouded in mists and smoke in the early morning tartary is france and the french are referred to as either the tartarians or the barbarians jacobites are also indicated by the name tartarians since the pretenders cause was actively supported by louis xiv japan is spain and china stands for holland the characters who appear in atalantis major are in the order that they are mentioned      the duke de sanquarius p 14 is james douglas second duke of     queensberry and duke of dover

is james graham fourth marquis     and first duke of montrose d 1742  the fact that in several cases the names used by defoe are developed from family names and not the title seems to offer support for the contention that atalantis major was intended primarily for a scottish audience further defoes name for marlboroughheymuthiuscomes from his one scottish title baron aymouth now eyemouth a

there having been a large account given to the world of several remarkable adventures which happened lately in the famous atalantis an island which the ingenious authors found placed in the mediterranean sea the success of which accounts but especially the usefulness of the relation to the ends for which they were designed having been very remarkable i thought it could not be unacceptable to the world especially to those who have been already so delighted with news from that island to give a particular historical narration of some remarkable transactions which happened in the great island called atalantis major a famous well known island tho much farther north lying in the ducaledonian ocean which island it was my good fortune to winter at the last time i returned north about from china by the streights of nassau and wygates and the eastern coast of grand tartary  i have nothing to do to enquire whether our late authors mistook or not in placing the island atalantis in the mediterranean sea or whether they might find some small island of that name among the infinite crowd of islands of the egean sea but as the mighty transactions of which my history shall be the faithful relator are of too great consequence in the world to be brought forth on so mean a stage so the place and the mighty people and by whom this revolution of affairs have been mannaged are all suitable to the greatness and glory of the actions themselves  as geographers have no doubt given a full description of this famous island and allowed it due place in the globes where it stands noted for the biggest of the kind in the northern world i need spend none of your time in the description of the place excepting such as shall fall naturally in my way as i come to treat of the people and historically of their behaviour  the island is possest by a brave generous powerful and wealthy nation truly great in their natural gallantry of spirit terrible in the field rich in the product of their lands more in their general commerce most of all in their manufactures industry and application they have some few errors in their conduct which seems owing to the climate which is cold and moist or to their diet which is strong and luxurious and particularly to their way of living which in eating and drinking is high to an excess  this makes them cholerick envious and above all contentious so that the nation is ever divided into parties and factions they pursue their feuds with the most eagerness imaginable in their turns commit all kinds of errors even on both sides alternately as they get uppermost  this occasions much heat tho the country is cold little charity and above all which the climate has the blame off they are by their own confession of short memories partly as to injuries but especially as to kindnesses services and inherent merit hence gratitude is not the national virtue nor is encouraging virtue any branch of the manufacture of the place long services often meet here with unjust censures overgrown merit with necessary contempt he must be a bold man that dares oblige them he is sure to provoke them by it to use him very severely  if they are reducd to any extreme distress he must be weary of his life that attempts to rescue them from the danger he is as sure to die for it as they are sure to be unjust it is natural to the blood of the race if they are obliged beyond the power of payment they presently hate because they scorn to be in debt hence also benefactors are the most abhorrd people in the world they walk always alone for every man keeps at a distance from them  if a man happens to be bound apprentice to his own generous spirit and resolves to do them good he must do it to god to do it to them is to work to the devil he must be sure to run the gauntlet and bear the lashes of ten thousand tongues the reproach of all those he serves and will die unpitied  if ever they do relent if ever they acknowledge services tis always after the man is dead that he may not upbraid them with it an eminent great man among them and rich to a prodigy had been almost drowned but was taken up in the interval by a poor man when he came to himself he gave the poor man sixpence but could never abide the sight of him after the poor man afterwards had the dissaster of being drowned himself and then the rich man bewaild that he had not made him a better return wherefore in abundant gratitude he settled upon the widow and her six children a noble pension of 20 s per annum  it was a saying of one of their great and wise men of a poor servant that had saved his life he saved my life said he and therefore i hate to see him for it is an intolerable life to have always a creditor in my sight that i cannot ballance accounts with  but all this is by the by the inhabitants of this great island are those things excepted a noble gallant ancient wealthy people and a stranger may very well winter among them i could say more in their praise but the ensuing history calls me off from that subject  there happend in that famous island when i was last there an occasion upon some state affairs to assemble an extraordinary council of the nobility to consult together with the sovereign whole hereditary councellors they were by the constitution of the place these were not chosen by the inhabitants as in such cases among us our parliament men are chosen but were by birth and blood or by dignities highoffices c entitled to sit in the aforesaid council except one part of the island who had by some former constitution been a several distinct government and had a certain number of nobility of their own this part having by some ancient treaty been joind to the other their whole nobility were not intituled to the right of sitting in council as above but they usually met by themselves upon such occasions and chose a certain number to represent the whole body this number was as near as i can remember sixteen or thereabouts not reckoning some who were singled out by the sovereign to be advancd by new titles to be members of the great body of the hereditary nobility a favour which by the stipulations of the said agreement was reservd to the sovereign of that whole island  now there happening as i have noted an occasion to assemble this great council the nobility of that part of the island which were thus particularly constituted behoved to meet as said is to elect the number that were to represent them in the great assembly and the history of that meeting having so many strange circumstances in it and making so much noise in that country it cannot but be useful for us to be informd of it  the nobility of that island as i find it too much the fate of all the nobility in the world were unhappily divided into factions and separate interests and therefore before i proceed to the relation it will be necessary to give you a brief account of these several divisions and as to the characters of the persons it will necessarily fall into the course of the story  the divisions and animosities which as i say were among the nobility were very unhappily occasiond upon two several foundations and therefore consisted of two several kinds  this island it seems was governd by a very glorious queen who however she was of the ancient royal blood of that country was yet for reasons more especially respecting the safety of the country placd upon the throne by the suffrage of the nobility and people without regard to her father or his male children who for like reasons of safety they had deposd and renderd incapable there being it seems a power reservd by the constitution of that place to the said nobility and people so to do a thing so like what we call in england parliamentary limitation that it gives me great reason to think the power of parliaments limiting the crown is a natural principle and founded upon meer original light since it should be so exactly establishd in a country so remote and so entirely excluded from correspondence with europe as this of the island of atalantis  the queen of this island by the assistance of exquisite councellors punctual management and a mild merciful administration had obtaind the entire affection of her subjects at home and as long as she continued the administration in those hands she preservd that affection very entire to herself she had also by the conduct of eminent and most glorious commanders rendered her self victorious abroad in a long terrible and expensive war against the barbarous tartarian emperor whose growing greatness had forced her predecessor in conjunction with several neighbouring nations to have recourse to arms to keep up a ballance of power in that part of the world as long as those fortunate generals commanded her affairs were blest by sea and land till the barbarians began to stoop their pride to be humbled and they sought peace made great offers of restoring the kingdoms they had usurped and of establishing a lasting tranquillity in those parts of the world  how the face of affairs there altered how some factions prevailing at home made a breach in all this blessed harmony how the faithful councellors at home were dismissd and disgracd the victorious generals abroad ill used and ungratefully treated by which the publick credit sunk at home the great confederates of this glorious queen were discouraged and allarmed the barbarians encouraged to hold out carry on the war and reject the terms of peace they would before have complied with these are things perhaps my stay in that place not permitting me to get a full account of much less see the issue of i shall for the present omit perhaps my next voyage may more fully quallifie me to inform you  my present relation refers more especially to the affair of the election of those representing nobles which as before the northern part of the island by a late treaty of coalition were obliged to send up as often as the soveraign of the country thought fit to summon her hereditary council to meet which summons was generally once in three years  to let you into the nature of the unhappy strife which is the subject of my present relation it may be necessary to descend to a historical relation of some facts for a few years past and to give the characters of some persons who have the principal conduct in the present affairs  there had been a contention in the last election in the same place we shall go no further back of something of the like nature with this wherein the same heat was unhappily breaking out against the friends and favourites of the great queen of the island as had now come to a full height it is too true that the factions which then agitated the nobility being between the courtparty then so called and a flying squadron of noblemen who were of the same general denomination with themselves that breach tended so much to the dividing their interest that they could never effectually joyn it again they made that seperation of affection then which they could never unite let in those enemies then which they could never get removed again brought those charges and accusations against one another then which their enemies have since made use off and which they cannot now deny but are fatal to them  the parties are so naturally resembling our unhappy divisions in britain have been so exactly pursued by our methods are so properly adapted to persons as well as things so alike in temper manners management and design to our parties of tory whig high church low church old whig new whig high flyer dissenter jacobite court country revolution union and the like that to give the more lively representation of them to your minds and to avoid the barbarous words used in the country where the language is altogether unknown to us and unlike ours i shall even call them by the same names giving a brief description as i go on and always desiring you to add a subintelligitur for the word atalantick to them all as the atalantick whigs atalantick tories atalantick high church and so of all the rest and whenever you meet with the names or distinctions of whig tory high church low church c in this discourse the author provides against any other suggestion or meaning than that of the whigs tories high church low church old whig new whig high flyers dissenters jacobites c who are inhabitants of the famous island of atalantis major situate beyond the north cape between the degrees of 42 and 80 of northern latitude as you sail from china into europe by the streights of nassau the island of nova zembla if it be an island and the like being what we call the northeast passages and you cannot blame me for being thus particular in this early protestation if you consider how ready the men of this age are to censure condemn and reproach the meaning of authors whether they themseves have any meaning or no if any man shall presume to say there is no such place i may as readily answer their presumption by another less criminal viz that they never have past that way to china and consequently cannot demonstrate the truth of what they say  having thus premised what i think necessary to fence this work against the malice of the times i am next to tell you that i shall confine this part of my account to the transactions of the northern part of this great island and therein to what happened in this case of the election of their noble councellors only yet i must hint a little at what had been transacting in the southern parts of the island and this is absolutely necessary in order to make the other accounts intelligible  in order to this you are to understand that the southern part of the island was the most remarkable of any as to the policy of their government and the character of the people and excepting englishmen and polanders there is not such another nation in the world here they reckoned about fifty three several sects divisions and espoused opinions in religion upon most of the heads whereof the people actually seperated from one another such as 1 churchmen and among them high church low church non jurors prelatists socinians arians arminians deists atheists immoralists flyers soulsleepers prophets c 2 presbyterians and under that head all kind of dissenters cameronians independants anabaptists baptists seventhdaymen sabatarians donatists gnosticks antiprelatists muggletonians and various undistinguishable quakers both wet and dry sweet singers family of love christian jews jewish christians and the like in the state the divisions were no less fatal or the variety greater in proportion these we may as i said before call by the names which the like factions are distinguishd by here such as tory whig low church hot whig old whig modern whig high flyer high church high tory a gillicranky a tantivy tackers non jurors assassinators juntos squadroni court country revolutionists non resisters passive obedience men and the like  you may understand that the queen of the island had thought fit to change hands in the administration just before i came there and tho it was given out that the change would not be from what we call here a whig to a tory ministry in effect it past for no other especially for that the whigs were generally laid by in every publick matter and the tories or at least such as had appeard with them were all taken in  among the persons turnd out of employ or very much envyd in it we find two great personages men of the greatest eminency in their station that the age had producd in that island their country had no error to find in their conduct except it were that it was so much in debt to their services that they could not be capable of rewarding it therefore like the corrupted nature of the whole race of man they hate the men as a late author says because they hate to be in debt beyond the power of payment  one of these presided over the treasure the other over the army and except what may have happend since those days their very enemies had not been able to assign any reason from their own behaviour why they dismist them of these more in the process of the story  for the present it shall suffice to tell you without other preamble both these were by the artifice of their enemies dispossessd of the queen of the islands favour and that with them fell the junctos and squadrons of their friends in most part of the southern atalantis  in the north part of the island the divisions of the court had not extended so far at least they had not been pushd so vigorously the great officers kept their posts whether civil or military not the least alteration was made except of a few inferiour officers and those but casually all seemd to stand at a stay till the election of the noble councellors aforesaid and till the sitting of the great council as above  there were some of the nobility of these northern parts that had very much the favour of their prince and by whom she had always been directed in those things that related to that part of her dominions these were  1 the duke de sanquarius a northern prince of great reputation who had the principal trust in the management of the late coalition which as is noted already had formerly been made between this northern part of the island and the southern this prince was a person of great prudence and policy perfect master of the interest temper and constitution of the country and people great and as a master of his own passions that had an insight into persons as well as things and was without dispute the best qualifyd to manage that uneasy people of any man in that part of the island he had a leading interest among them and usd it with such temper and such clearness of judgment as seldom failed to bring to pass whatever he undertook he was viceroy in the great meeting of the states of that country several times in which he behavd to the satisfaction of his sovereign and the general good even to the confession of his enemies after the separate government of that part of the island ceasd he was receivd very graciously by the queen and made principal secretary of state  2 the earl of stairdale was another a nobleman of extraordinary merit distinguishd for a thousand good qualities affable generous exceeding curteous steddy in a sound principle wise above his age brave above his neighbours his family had been famous for the gown he was like to make it more so by the sword he had at this time a very honourable command in the armies of atalantis major and being the same thing as we call a lieutenant general was employed against the tartarians  3 the earl of crawlinfordsay a nobleman of a most ancient race being the first of his degree in the whole atalantis major an honest bold gallant person he had so much goodness in his temper courage in his heart and honesty in his face that made all men love him he was true to his sovereign and tho his fortunes too depended upon the court being captain of the queens guards yet so true to his honour that he scornd to sacrifice his principle to his interest had too much courage to be bullyd and too much honesty to be bribd too much wit to be wheedld and too much warmth to forbear telling it in the teeth of those that tryd all those ways to bring him into their party  4 the prince of greeniccio of the ancient blood of agyllius this was a young nobleman of great hopes and from whom great things were expected an account of the very race he was descended from had he inherited the principles of his family as he did the honour and estate he must have been the head of that very party he now acted against being the same for whose cause two of his greatest ancestors at least had both ventured and lost their lives but grace not going by generation nor vertue by inheritance any more in that country than in ours he neither ownd their cause or imitated their vertue but gave himself up first to all manner of vice and then with his morals abandoned his principles flew in the face of his grandfathers injured grave joind with his murtherers and the abhorrd betrayers of his country and placd himself at the head of that very party who had trampled on the blood of his family as well as nation he was in temper brave but rash had more courage than generosity more passion than prudence and more regard to his resentment than to his honour he was proud without merit ambitious without prospect revengeful without injury he would resent without affront and quarrel without cause would embroil himself without reason and come out of it without honour his courage was rather in his blood than in his head and as his actions run often before his thoughts so his thoughts often run before his reason yet he was pushing and that supplyd very much his want of policy but he discoverd the errors of his judgment by the warmth of his behaviour in every thing he did he sought no disguise every man knew him better than himself and he never could be in a plot because he conceald nothing  he was a general in the armys of atalantis major and excepting the chief command of an army was very well fitted for the field he had behavd himself very well on several occasions against the tartarians and unless his ill fate should place him above being commanded he might in time be a great man at present having all the fire of a general without the flegm his great misfortune and the only thing that can ruin him is that he thinks himself qualifyed to command and cannot bear the lustre of their merit that excel him  5 the e of marereskine this was a nobleman whose character is not so easy to describe he appeard in the service of the queen of the island but was suspected to lean to the tartars whose interest he was known formerly to espouse he was proud peevish subtle and diligent affected more the statesman than the soldier and therefore aimd at the place the duke de sanquharius enjoyd of secretary of state but had not yet had his ambition gratifyed  you are to note also that the queen of the island had for several years committed the administration of her affairs to two extraordinary persons natives of the south parts of the island the prince de heymuthius and the e of dolphinus their characters may be confind to this in short the first commanded all the armies of atalantis major and was captain general and commander in chief the other high keeper of the treasury of the island the greatest general and the greatest minister of state the island ever knew who had raised the glory of their mistress and the honour of their country to the greatest pitch the age has ever seen whose merit i can no more describe than the nation can requite  tho these characters seem to take up too much room in this tract yet it could not be avoided it being impossible to let you into a true notion of the farce that was acted afterwards if the actors had not been thus described  greeniccio was a peer of the whole island and therefore had no vote in the northern election being one of the hereditary council aforesaid but taking upon him the absolute direction of the affair tho he had really as above nothing to do with it he rendred himself at the city reeky the capital of that part of the kingdom a few days before the election  marereskine who had really a voice in the election was there before him and had busily embarkd bellcampo lord of the isles and brother to greeniccio to make parties and prepare parties sollicite votes get proxies and the like about the countries  this bellcampo lord of the isles was an insinuating selfinterested man had little fortune of his own but resolved to raise himself which side soever got upmost he run with every stream kept fair with every side spoke smoothly to all meant service to none his dear self excepted by this means he got up from one step to another to some good employments which his interest and diligence procured for him rather than his sincerity for he was first made a peer on the side he now acted against and now a judge acting against the side made him a peer and the like  these were the instruments of the fate of north atalantis marereskine acted one part greeniccio another and here it is as i said before that the differing parties appeared so like our whig and tory episcopal and presbyterian that i cannot better describe them to you than by the same names only with this difference that all the tories and episcopal people in north atalantis were tartarians profestly and boldly owned themselves for the tartarian emperor  and now the two last mentioned engines having acted covertly for some time which they had the better opportunity to do because they had both appeared among the other party which now ill call whigs before the first of these carried it stiff and forward when he talked with the great officers or such lords as had some dependance upon the court he told them of what the queen expected from them what was their duty to do that they would find it their interest to do so and so that they might consider in time what they had to do and the like when he talkd with any of the whig lords for there was a squadron of them left that had a great sway yet in the country then he would talk of him and party and queen as one knot in the plural number most haughtily thus we are resolved to do so and so and we must have none but such or such  the lord of the isles at the same time acted his usual flattery on both sides insinuating to the whigs that they were in no danger that there was not the least design against them or their liberties that the queen was resolved to change hands but would not change principles that their church should not be touched that their priviledges should not in the least be infringed and that they need not fear one time this politick peer as he would be thought was very handsomely met with the story is this whether designedly or no it matters not he was one day in company with some of the north atalantis ministers for there just as here they have one church established in the north and another in the south of the island he used all his art in persuading the ministers that they should be easie that they should fear nothing that there was no design to give them the least disturbance that this was a politick turn not a religious and that they should do well to be satisfied and to satisfie their people that they were in no danger and should fear nothing one of the ministers who had heard him very patiently but saw easily through all his cunning returns thus my lord shall i tell your lordship a story and then he goes on with it we had in former times one john  who had the honour to be his majestys hangman in this city this good man had a most gentle easie way of executing his office for when the poor people came into his hands and were to die by his operations as many honest men did in those cruel days this by the way was home to his lordship for that this very john cut off his lordships grandfathers head all the while he was a fitting things for the execution of his office he would smile upon them talk kindly to them bid them not be afraid come come fear nothing trust god and the like then bringing them to the foot of the ladder he would still say be not afraid come come fear nothing step up one step do not fear trust in god and so to another step and another and just thus he carried em on till at last with the very words in his mouth fear nothing he turnd them off  the honest minister made no application of the story much less took notice how his lordships own grandfather not only fell by the same hangman but by the same party that he then espoused but he had too much sense and was too closely touchd with the story not to make the application himself so he left the ministers giving no reply at all to the story  this story grew so popular especially being printed by the reviewer of that country that the lord of the isles could make nothing of his design whenever he talkd of the good design of the party he was only laughd at and bid remember his grandfathers hangman so he became useless  the prince greeniccio and the earl of marereskine then took upon them the manegement of the whole affair they took publick apartments in the town kept an affected state called themselves the queens managers and had a court as great as if they had been really so they received the visits of the nobility with an air of majesty and affected gravity and under this assumed authority they took upon them to closet the noblemen when they came to pay their respects to them not to ask who they would give their votes for or to sollicit them to vote for this or that but in a style haughty and insolent especially to the men of the greatest character and merit  greeniccio had several ruffles with some of the nobility of which it may not be amiss to give some account because it may be for the advantage of our nobility to know how persons of like quality in that country can submit to be treated  bradalbino a nobleman of great age and authority in that island expected to be one of the sixteen and was told he was in the list when he comes to discourse with the prince de greeniccio he tells him very plainly that he thought it would be much for the publick good to put in two or three lords such as leslynus and one of the family of boiilio being men he thought could not properly be left out and that if they were in he would come into all the rest the prince in a kind of passion swore by gd not of them and but for naming them laid aside bradalbino himself  another lord being an officer in the army having the court list proposed to him answered my lord you kno leslynus is my general and commander in chief and he could not as he commanded under him but vote for his general c greeniccio in a fury returns god dn your general what do you tell us of commander in chief if that be all we shall soon get you another commander in chief you shall vote for none such as he  another lord expostulated with him a little to admit such and such with the men he proposed he answers my lord i am no hypocrite i am aboveboard this is the list we will have the qn approves of it and i will have no other and swearing again bygd says he tis indifferent to me keep out but the men we are against but i will have no gophin men no mabro men no squadron men in short no whigs of any denomination as for the rest it is indifferent any but them how my lord says this nobleman what will you take tartarians that is as our jacobites rather than the honest gentlemen that have been so true to the atalantic interest i care not what they are says the prince so they be none of these  among the noblemen that he used with the most rudeness was the earl of crawlindford whether he thought to insult this faithful nobleman because he knew his fortunes were low and that he depended on the court or whether he took this advantage to use him ill on account of an old ruffle in which he having challenged the earl to fight and the earl appearing ready to defend his honour with his sword the prince ashamed of the needless quarrel had declind it again and came off but so so choosing to risk his honour rather than his life what was the reason authors do not agree about but the prince used him most scandalously the earl prest him hard and told him how he had on all occasions shewn himself faithful to the queen and to the atalantic interest that he had gone into all such measures as were for the service of both that he thought he had some claim to be trusted in the service of his country  the prince told him plainly he might set his heart at rest for he should not be one he askd him what reason was assigned what objections were against him the prince with much more plainness than prudence replies they knew he was under obligations to the president of the treasure and the great commander of the army and he did not know but they might come to bring a charge or impeachment against them in the great atalantic council and he would have no body chosen but such as would give their words they would come into such measures the earl told him if any thing could be offered to prove them guilty or any crimes were made appear he scorned to be so much obliged to any man as not to dare to do justice and that he would readily join in an impeachment if there was reason sufficient to charge them and to refuse him otherwise implied they wanted crime and just ground to form the impeachment upon and therefore must choose such a set of men as would impeach innocent men blindfold to please a party the prince told him that the resolution was to impeach them and he would have none chosen that would not agree to it what right or wrong my lord says the earl to which the prince not suddenly replying the earl went on let what will come of it and tho i should lose all nay tho i were to beg my bread ill never submit to such base terms and so defied him the prince told him it should be the worse for him and there they parted  there was a short dispute between the prince and the earl of stairdale but the earl had so much more honesty than the party and so much more sense and wit than the prince that indeed he cared not much to talk to him but left him to mareskine he was too hard for them both and having baffled them in discourse he was no more to be bullied by them than he was to be wheedled he told em plainly they were betraying their country selling and sacrificing the priviledges of the nobility making themselves tools to a party and giving themselves up in a base manner to the pleasure of a few men who when they had got their will would contemn them would love the folly but ps upon the fools and as to their list he scornd to come into it or into any of their menacing measures this put a short end to their attempts upon him and indeed had the other lords been advised by this gallant gentleman they had broke all their schemes but they were not all united in their resolutions or equally determined in their measures  thus they went on mareskine mannagd the most mildly yet he told the nobility of his acquaintance that the list was determined that the qn expected they should vote them all that they would have no mixtures that her majesty would have nothing to do with the whig lords but there was other work to do now than usual discoursing with some of the lords who were gals in the army he told them plainly they had resolved to impeach the great commander and that it could not be expected those who had commands under him and were awed by him should do justice in that case they had often the question put to them what it was the great commander or the keeper of the treasure had done that they were to be impeachd for but they could never be brought to offer the least tollerable reason except that the prince greeniccio let fall in his passion sometimes of which he had no manner of government that he had used him ill abroad  some who had more nicely enquired into the particulars of the ill usage which was the cause of this resentment have given the oddest contradicting accounts of it that any history can parallel as first that the great commander had restrained the rashness of this young hotspur general who being but a boy in experience compared to the commander was always for pushing into the heart of tartary with the army not considering that to run up a hundred mile into the country and leave the enemies towns untaken and their armies in a condition to recruit cut off their convoys and communication and make their subsistence impracticable was the ready way to destroy them as has been seen by a woful example in spain but the general was wiser and regarded more the safety of the army and the honour of his mistress and therefore by the unanimous approbation of all the allied generals for it was not his own single opinion and according to the just rules of war went on gradually to take their fortified towns and ruin their defences on the frontiers that at last he might have a sure and easie conquest of the rest this was one pretence the second was just the reverse of this for at a great battle with the tartarians the commander having resolved to attack the enemy in their advantageous camp and having drawn up in battalia his whole army he gives the post of honour to the prince appointing him with a select body of the best troops in the army to fall on upon the right and charge the enemy while other generals did the like and with equal hazard and more real danger on the left there was not a gentleman in the enemies army but would have taken this as the greatest testimony of his generals esteem and would have thought any man in the army his mortal enemy that should have gone about to have deprived him of it nor was there any man in the attalantick army who did not take it as an evidence of the great opinion the commander had of the princes courage and all the world talked of it as the greatest honour could possibly be done the prince  had not the commander taken all needful care to have him well backd had he not given him the best troops in the army to act under him had he not placd a great body of horse to support him had he not equally prest the enemy in other places to prevent their doubling their strength in that part had he done any thing but what a man of honour would have thought himself obliged by there might have been some reason to object but to call giving a general a post of honour sacrificing him because it was attended with danger is referrd to the determination of the soldierly part of mankind and as it would be laught at in tartary in france and in britain where such things are very seldom heard of so i can assure the reader it was sufficiently laughd at in attalantis major and the prince of greeniccio is become most intollerably ridiculous by the taking notice of it  hence all men in the island of atalantick major conclude he has rashness without courage fury without honour passion without judgment and less regard to his character than to his resentment  nor has the vanity of this prince appeared less in his not sticking openly to discover that he aims at the command in general that he thinks himself equally qualified for a post of so great trust and that regard is not had to his merit that he is so long suffered to serve under another at the same time not enquiring whether the allies of the queen would have equal confidence in him as in the great commander on whose judgment all the princes and states of the north have so much dependance to whom they have so chearfully committed their troops and under whose conduct they have had such wonderful success against the tartarian emperor but it never was this princes talent to think too much his heat was always too volatile and his head too light for his hands  we have brought him now to the conclusion of the affair having gone through his catechizing of the nobility in which indeed they of his own party appeared of a temper patient and debased below the true spirit of noblemen at least god be praised below the ancient temper and gallantry of the nobility of great britain having come now to the day for the choice which was the 10th day of their sixth month but as i suppose november there appeared at the place 33 noblemen besides the 16 which were chosen and who every one voted for themselves and for one another so that of about 130 noblemen which they say are in the north part of attalantis major only 49 appeared  there was a great meeting of the honest part of the nobility at another place to consult what was proper to be done in this newfashiond way of proceeding some proposed to go down in a body to the place where the rest were met and protest against the illegality of the choice that to impose a list upon the nobility was not agreeable to the nature of a free choice and that therefore they should protest that whoever were returned by virtue of that meeting were not legally chosen and had no right to sit in the great council of the nobility  this was sound advice but unhappily it was not resolved upon and some they say slipt out of the meeting for fear of resentment and went down and voted and came up again incognito  the rest resolved to send two of their number down to the meeting and offer their service to vote with them provided they would declare their measures and that those that might be chosen would declare themselves for the true atalantick succession against a pretending claimant who was then sheltred among the tartarians but they could receive no satisfaction even to this so reasonable request but the prince of greeniccio who had no right to vote himself yet run up and down as a broker or a partysollicitor whispering and prompting from one to another to influence and settle them for some began to waver this prince i say giving an answer insolent and haughty like himself the noble persons that went came away and contented themselves with telling them they would having nothing to do with them thus being but a rump of the nobility they gave up their liberties voted as they were commanded to do signed a roll of names and this they called a choice  the number of the dissenting nobility were about twenty six whereof five did at last comply with their list as they thought being in publick commands supposing it might give a handle to their enemies to misrepresent them to their soveraign but they nevertheless upon all occasions testified their dislike and abhorrence of the method and of the conduct of those concernd in it  among those said dissenters were two dukes one marquis sixteen earls and six lords besides many others who were absent  we might be large in describing and giving characters of these dissenting nobility among them we could not escape the prince de rosymonte a person for blood and birth eminent in that country more for his own excellent and inimitable virtues grave sober judicious even from his youth of whom one of the atalantick poets gave this bright character      grave without age without experience wise  he was president of the royal council of that country even while he was very young an honour the greatest of the nobility were well pleased to see him adorned with and made no scruple to sit below him his distinguishd modesty and humility in all his publick appearances recommends him to the affections of the whole country and tho the fortunes of his family have suffered by the disasters of the times yet he supports a handsome figure suitable to the dignity of his character rich without gaiety great without affectation plentiful without profusion letting the world see he knows how and when and to what pitch to appear that when he pleases to be at large he can do it like a wise man or retrench he can do it like a prince it might be said as a finishing stroke to his character he is just the reverse of greeniccio for he is fire without thunder brave without fury great without pride gay without vanity wise without affectation knows how to obey and how to command he knows great things enough to manage them and is so master of himself as not to let them manage him he knows how to be a courtier without ambition and to merit favour rather than to seek it he scorns to push his fortunes over the belly of his principles ever faithful to himself and by consequence to all that trust him he has too great a value for merit to envy it even in his enemy and too low thoughts of the pride and conceit of men without merit to approve of it even in his friends  this noble person appears at the head of the dissenting nobility nor does it lessen his zeal for the principles of liberty or the present establishment of religion in his country that some of his ancestors otherwise noble brave and great appeard on the other side since the liberties of his country are the center of his actions and the prosperity of all men the mark he aims at  it may be a character to the rest of the dissenting lords to say of them in general that they were such as took a particular pleasure in being patrons of virtue as well as patrons of liberty that they were men generally speaking distinguishd for their constant loyalty to their prince but ever with a view to the fundamental laws that they had always wisdom enough to know their countries rights and courage enough to defend them men of honour men of prudence men of resolution in short they were men admirably suited to the character of their leader as he on the other hand thought it his honour to be at the head of so illustrious a body of men equally valuable for their virtue capacities wisdom and integrity  it cannot be forgotten that as these noble persons were zealous for the liberties of their country so truly they were men that had the greatest interest in it having separately considered the best estates of the whole nobility of that country and joined together were able to buy twice their number in the whole assembly it is true that estate is not any just addition to the character of a person but it will for ever remain a truth and all nations will shew a regard to it viz that those may be supposed to be the most proper persons to be trusted with the conservation of the liberties of their country who have by their birth and inheritance the largest shares in the possession of it  this is illustrated by the practice of that happy country we live in where this story may perhaps be read and where very lately a law has been made to unquallifie all such to represent their country in the legislation and power of raising taxes who are not possessed of such or such a porportion in the lands of their country as may suppose them persons made naturally anxious for the welfare of the whole in regard to the preservation of their property unhappy atalantis had such a law passd for the qualification of those noblemen who should be elected to the great royal council of thy country and should the nobility so to be chosen have been limited to but one hundred perialos a gold coin in that country amounting by estimation to about 2000 l a year sterling of yearly estate in lands how few of the sixteen now chosen could have shewn themselves in that august meeting  on the contrary several of those now sent up were not able to put themselves into a posture to undertake the journey till they had sold the magazines of corn which they had laid up for the years subsistance of their families or mortgaged their small estates to borrow money for the expence  nor is it doubted in the least but when those poor noblemen come to find some of their tartarian expectations frustrated with which it is manifest they were very big when they went up they will sorely regret the misfortune of their election since they must be thereby so reduced as almost to want subsistance for their families and as for the debts contracted it is impossible some of them should ever pay them  it has been a too unhappy truth in other places as well as in atalantis major that in such popular elections whether of noblemen or others men are deluded with the notion that to be chosen by their country to these great councils of the nation must so recommend them or make them so necessary to the state to the government or the ministers of state that they cannot fail to make their fortunes and raise estates by their very appearance but this is so constantly found to fail and so many have been almost ruind by the expences they have been at to make a figure as they call it and to appear at court like themselves on such occasions that it seems wonderful that persons of quality who know their own circumstances and whose fortunes through the disasters of their families may not be equal to their dignity should on so vain a presumption push themselves upon the necessity of compleating their own ruin beggering their families and leaving their posterity an estate in titles and coronets things without the support of competent estates the most despicable in the world  it might be very useful to our readers and perhaps something instructing might be gathered from it with respect to the affairs of europe at this time to give some account here of the success of these strange proceedings what figure these people made when they came to court how they behavd themselves when they came into the great council how they were made tools there to the politicians of those times even to act against their interest their country their own designs  in doing this it would appear how some of the sixteen more particularly known to be in the tartarian interest and who had all along declared themselves for the person and title of the pretending prince who as is noted before put in a claim to the succession of the throne how these i say went up to the great council wheedled by the subtilties of greeniccio and his agents to believe seriously that they went up directly to declare his title that they should be the men that should have the honour to declare his right in the great council of the nobility and that he should for the future own his restoration his glory and his crown to their loyalty and steddy acting for him this they did not doubt should tend not to their honour only but to the raising their decayd fortunes for they were miserably poor since he could do no less than confer the greatest trusts upon persons who had with so much fidelity acted for his glory and interest  it would also to the eternal shame and disappointment of the atalantic jacobites if i may so call them necessarily follow that the history of their conduct should come in at the same time to be considered viz how just the contrary to all this and against the very nature of the thing they were obliged even among the very first of their transactings in their publick station as members of the great council aforesaid to appear in a publick address to the soveraign of the country in which they were brought in recognizing her just title to reign which they in their hearts abhorrd promising to stand by and defend that title with all their might which they had hoped to see overthrown engaging to assist her to the utmost against that very pretending claimant as above who they reverence as their lawful prince and to carry on the war with vigour against the tartarian emperor that very prince on whose power they depended for the carrying on their designs  had any britishman of sense that understands the language of the countenance but seen the astonishment the chagrin the vexation and anguish of soul that appeard on the faces of these atalantic noblemen at this surprizing event how they gnashed their teeth for anger and curst the hour that ever they were members of this grand council how they bannd an atalantis word used there for what we call swearing and damning in our country how they raged at greenwiccio and the lord of the isles who they said had betrayd them and how strangely they lookd upon the solemn occasion of presenting this address to their soveraign i say could their countenances but have been read by any in our country they would have taken them for furies rather than men or for men under some frenzy ridden with the nightmare or scared with some apparition  it was not less odd to see the conduct of greeniccio for tho he had not less mischief in his heart yet it was of another kind and tho he had not the same view of the succession nor perhaps was directly in the tartarian interest and therefore shewd no pity or sympathy with the mortifications of the other yet he met with disappointments equally perplexing and which made him heartily repent the length he had gone but as it was in his nature to be rash it was impossible to prevent his being disappointed almost in every thing he went about for it is in atalantis major just as it is in other parts of the world viz that rash headstrong unthinking tempers generally precipitate themselves into innumerable mischiefs which prudence and patience would evite and prevent and also that these furious rash people as they are hot and impatient under those mischiefs when they are surprised with them so they are not always the best able to extricate and deliver themselves                                                 this will necessarily lead us to a long history of the disappointments he met with  1 in his project of charging and impeaching his general and the great testador or  of the nations treasure which he could never either bring crime enough to justifie or friends enough to joyn in and make it terrible  2 how he was disappointed in his ambitious views of being made general against the tartarians whereas he had on the contrary the mortification to see the great commander continud with an addition of generallissimo to his titles of command and himself like what we used to call in england being kickd up stairs sent out of the way with a feather in his cap and the title of general to carry on a remote unfortunate and nevertobe successful war in japan and the lord knows where among barbarians and savages                                                 this was not all when upon his embracing this title which his temper naturally ambitious jumpt at and eagerly closed with he began to choose officers name regiments and draw out forces to form the army he was to command he found the new generalissimo had supplanted him there too for he had not only prevailed with the queen of the country not to draw away any of the old troops then establishd for the tartarian war of which this gewgawgeneral fancied to himself he should form his army but the generalissimo obtaind that the best troops which were remaining in atalantis major should be sent over to strengthen the army against the tartars so that this new general was likely to go away to japan without any army but such troops as her atalantic majesty and her allies had hired from the emperor of china and such other people and he had none but strangers barbarians and mercenaries to command  it is true that his design of drawing off the troops from the tartarian war to carry on a wildgoose war in the remotest parts of japan was like the rest of his schemes so inconsistent so destructive to the general design of the war and would in all its probable circumstances be so dangerous to the true interest of atalantis major that notwithstanding some had persuaded the government to a new scheme and that the war was to be pushed on especially in japan a thing which perhaps some encouraged at first on purpose to draw him in to accept of that command which many of inferiour rank to him had declind yet when they came to look nearer into the thing and to see the fatal prospect of weakning the forces on the tartarian side while the emperor of tartary at the same time was vigilant and forward in encreasing his preparations they soon found the representations of the generalissimo had such weight in them and were founded so much upon their general good that they thought fit to alter their measures  how greeniccio was thus disappointed how he resented it how to pacifie him an appearance of drawing some troops together was made how he was at last sent away with a whole ship load of fine promises as he on the contrary loaded the same ship back with a full freight of schemes projects and rhodomontadoes how he went what he did and what he did not how tinker like he mended the work of those that went before and left it for others to mend after him these are things i may give you a farther account of when i return from my next progress to that glorious country of atalantis major   finis
