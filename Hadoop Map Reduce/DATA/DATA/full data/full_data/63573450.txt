63573450	the woman who did   by  grant allen   1895       to my dear wife  to whom i have dedicated my twenty happiest years  i dedicate also  this brief memorial of a less fortunate love    written at perugia  spring 1893  for the first time in my life  wholly and solely to satisfy  my own taste  and my own conscience      preface   but surely no woman would ever dare to do so said my friend  i knew a woman who did said i and this is her story     i   mrs dewsburys lawn was held by those who knew it the loveliest in surrey  the smooth and springy sward that stretched in front of the house was all composed of a tiny yellow clover  it gave beneath the foot like the pile on velvet  ones gaze looked forth from it upon the endless middle distances of the oakclad weald with the uncertain blue line of the south downs in the background ridge behind ridge the long low hills of paludina limestone stood out in successive tiers each thrown up against its neighbor by the misty haze that broods eternally over the wooded valley till roaming across them all the eye rested at last on the rearing scarp of chanctonbury ring faintly pencilled on the furthest skyline shadowy phantoms of dim heights framed the verge to east and west  alan merrick drank it in with profound satisfaction  after those sharp and clearcut italian outlines hard as lapis lazuli the mysterious vagueness the pregnant suggestiveness of our english scenery strikes the imagination and alan was fresh home from an early summer tour among the peruginesque solidities of the umbrian apennines  how beautiful it all is after all he said turning to his entertainer  in italy tis the background the painter dwells upon in england we look rather at the middle distance  mrs dewsbury darted round her the restless eye of a hostess to see upon whom she could socially bestow him  oh come this way she said sweeping across the lawn towards a girl in a blue dress at the opposite corner  you must know our newcomer  i want to introduce you to miss barton from cambridge  shes such a nice girl toothe dean of dunwichs daughter  alan merrick drew back with a vague gesture of distaste  oh thank you he replied but do you know i dont think i like deans mrs dewsbury  mrs dewsburys smile was recondite and diplomatic  then youll exactly suit one another she answered with gay wisdom  for to tell you the truth i dont think she does either  the young man allowed himself to be led with a passive protest in the direction where mrs dewsbury so impulsively hurried him  he heard that cultivated voice murmuring in the usual inaudible tone of introduction miss barton mr alan merrick  then he raised his hat  as he did so he looked down at herminia bartons face with a sudden start of surprise  why this was a girl of most unusual beauty  she was tall and dark with abundant black hair richly waved above the ample forehead and she wore a curious orientallooking navyblue robe of some soft woollen stuff that fell in natural folds and set off to the utmost the lissome grace of her rounded figure it was a sort of sleeveless sack embroidered in front with arabesques in gold thread and fastened obliquely two inches below the waist with a belt of gilt braid and a clasp of moorish jewelwork beneath it a bodice of darker silk showed at the arms and neck with loose sleeves in keeping  the whole costume though quite simple in style a compromise either for afternoon or evening was charming in its novelty charming too in the way it permitted the utmost liberty and variety of movement to the lithe limbs of its wearer  but it was her face particularly that struck alan merrick at first sight  that face was above all things the face of a free woman  something so frank and fearless shone in herminias glance as her eye met his that alan who respected human freedom above all other qualities in man or woman was taken on the spot by its perfect air of untrammelled liberty  yet it was subtle and beautiful too undeniably beautiful  herminia bartons features i think were even more striking in their way in later life when sorrow had stamped her and the mark of her willing martyrdom for humanitys sake was deeply printed upon them  but their beauty then was the beauty of holiness which not all can appreciate  in her younger days as alan merrick first saw her she was beautiful still with the first flush of health and strength and womanhood in a free and vigorous english girls body  a certain lofty serenity not untouched with pathos seemed to strike the keynote  but that was not all  some hint of every element in the highest loveliness met in that face and formphysical intellectual emotional moral  youll like him herminia mrs dewsbury said nodding  hes one of your own kind as dreadful as you are very free and advanced a perfect firebrand  in fact my dear child i dont know which of you makes my hair stand on end most  and with that introductory hint she left the pair forthwith to their own devices  mrs dewsbury was right  it took those two but little time to feel quite at home with one another  built of similar mould each seemed instinctively to grasp what each was aiming at  two or three turns pacing up and down the lawn two or three steps along the boxcovered path at the side and they read one another perfectly  for he was true man and she was real woman  then you were at girton alan asked as he paused with one hand on the rustic seat that looks up towards leith hill and the heatherclad moorland  yes at girton herminia answered sinking easily upon the bench and letting one arm rest on the back in a graceful attitude of unstudied attention  but i didnt take my degree she went on hurriedly as one who is anxious to disclaim some too great honor thrust upon her  i didnt care for the life i thought it cramping  you see if we women are ever to be free in the world we must have in the end a freemans education  but the education at girton made only a pretence at freedom  at heart our girls were as enslaved to conventions as any girls elsewhere  the whole object of the training was to see just how far you could manage to push a womans education without the faintest danger of her emancipation  you are right alan answered briskly for the point was a pet one with him  i was an oxford man myself and i know that servitude when i go up to oxford now and see the girls who are being ground in the mill at somerville im heartily sorry for them  its worse for them than for us they miss the only part of university life that has educational value  when we men were undergraduates we lived our whole lives lived them all round developing equally every fibre of our natures  we read plato and aristotle and john stuart mill to be sureand im not quite certain we got much good from them but then our talk and thought were not all of books and of what we spelt out in them  we rowed on the river we played in the cricketfield we lounged in the billiardrooms we ran up to town for the day we had wine in one anothers rooms after hall in the evening and behaved like young fools and threw oranges wildly at one anothers heads and generally enjoyed ourselves  it was all very silly and irrational no doubt but it was life it was reality while the pretended earnestness of those pallid somerville girls is all an affectation of onesided culture  thats just it herminia answered leaning back on the rustic seat like davids madame recamier  you put your finger on the real blot when you said those words developing equally every fibre of your natures  thats what nobody yet wants us women to do theyre trying hard enough to develop us intellectually but morally and socially they want to mew us up just as close as ever and they wont succeed  the zenana must go  sooner or later im sure if you begin by educating women you must end by emancipating them  so i think too alan answered growing every moment more interested  and for my part its the emancipation not the mere education that most appeals to me  yes ive always felt that herminia went on letting herself out more freely for she felt she was face to face with a sympathetic listener  and for that reason its the question of social and moral emancipation that interests me far more than the mere political onewomans rights as they call it  of course im a member of all the womans franchise leagues and everything of that sortthey cant afford to do without a single friends name on their lists at present but the vote is a matter that troubles me little in itself what i want is to see women made fit to use it after all political life fills but a small and unimportant part in our total existence  its the perpetual pressure of social and ethical restrictions that most weighs down women  alan paused and looked hard at her  and they tell me he said in a slow voice youre the dean of dunwichs daughter  herminia laughed lightlya ringing girlish laugh  alan noticed it with pleasure  he felt at once that the iron of girton had not entered into her soul as into so many of our modern young womens there was vitality enough left in her for a genuine laugh of innocent amusement  oh yes she said merrily thats what i always answer to all possible objectors to my ways and ideas  i reply with dignity i was brought up in the family of a clergyman of the church of england  and what does the dean say to your views alan interposed doubtfully  herminia laughed again  if her eyes were profound two dimples saved her  i thought you were with us she answered with a twinkle now i begin to doubt it  you dont expect a man of twentytwo to be governed in all things especially in the formation of his abstract ideas by his fathers opinions  why then a woman  why indeed alan answered  there i quite agree with you  i was thinking not so much of what is right and reasonable as of what is practical and usual  for most women of course arewell more or less dependent upon their fathers  but i am not herminia answered with a faint suspicion of just pride in the undercurrent of her tone  thats in part why i went away so soon from girton  i felt that if women are ever to be free they must first of all be independent  it is the dependence of women that has allowed men to make laws for them socially and ethically  so i wouldnt stop at girton partly because i felt the life was onesidedour girls thought and talked of nothing else on earth except herodotus trigonometry and the higher culturebut partly also because i wouldnt be dependent on any man not even my own father  it left me freer to act and think as i would so i threw girton overboard and came up to live in london  i see alan replied  you wouldnt let your schooling interfere with your education  and now you support yourself he went on quite frankly  herminia nodded assent  yes i support myself she answered in part by teaching at a high school for girls and in part by doing a little hackwork for newspapers  then youre just down here for your holidays i suppose alan put in leaning forward  yes just down here for my holidays  ive lodgings on the holmwood in such a dear old thatched cottage roses peep in at the porch and birds sing on the bushes  after a term in london its a delicious change for one  but are you alone alan interposed again still half hesitating  herminia smiled once more his surprise amused her  yes quite alone she answered  but if you seem so astonished at that i shall believe you and mrs dewsbury have been trying to take me in and that youre not really with us  why shouldnt a woman come down alone to pretty lodgings in the country  why not indeed alan echoed in turn  its not at all that i disapprove miss barton on the contrary i admire it its only that ones surprised to find a woman or for the matter of that anybody acting up to his or her convictions  thats what ive always felt tis the nemesis of reason if people begin by thinking rationally the danger is that they may end by acting rationally also  herminia laughed  im afraid she answered ive already reached that pass  youll never find me hesitate to do anything on earth once im convinced its right merely because other people think differently on the subject  alan looked at her and mused  she was tall and stately but her figure was well developed and her form softly moulded  he admired her immensely  how incongruous an outcome from a clerical family its curious he said gazing hard at her that you should be a deans daughter  on the contrary herminia answered with perfect frankness i regard myself as a living proof of the doctrine of heredity  how so alan inquired  well my father was a senior wrangler herminia replied blushing faintly and i suppose that implies a certain moderate development of the logical faculties  in his generation people didnt apply the logical faculties to the grounds of belief they took those for granted but within his own limits my father is still an acute reasoner  and then he had always the ethical and social interests those two thingsa love of logic and a love of rightare the forces that tend to make us what we call religious  worldly people dont care for fundamental questions of the universe at all they accept passively whatever is told them they think they think and believe they believe it  but people with an interest in fundamental truth inquire for themselves into the constitution of the cosmos if they are convinced one way they become what we call theologians if they are convinced the other way they become what we call freethinkers  interest in the problem is common to both its the nature of the solution alone that differs in the two cases  thats quite true alan assented  and have you ever noticed this curious corollary that you and i can talk far more sympathetically with an earnest catholic for example or an earnest evangelical than we can talk with a mere ordinary worldly person  oh dear yes herminia answered with conviction  thought will always sympathize with thought  its the unthinking mass one can get no further with  alan changed the subject abruptly  this girl so interested him she was the girl he had imagined the girl he had dreamt of the girl he had thought possible but never yet met with  and youre in lodgings on the holmwood here he said musing  for how much longer  for six weeks im glad to say herminia answered rising  at what cottage  mrs burkesnot far from the station  may i come to see you there  herminias clear brown eyes gazed down at him all puzzlement why surely she answered i shall be delighted to see you she paused for a second  we agree about so many things she went on and its so rare to find a man who can sympathize with the higher longings in women  when are you likeliest to be at home alan asked  in the morning after breakfastthat is at eight oclock herminia answered smiling or later after lunch say two or thereabouts  six weeks alan repeated more to himself than to her  those six week were precious  not a moment of them must be lost  then i think he went on quietly i shall call tomorrow  a wave of conscious pleasure broke over herminias cheek blush rose on white lily but she answered nothing  she was glad this kindred soul should seem in such a hurry to renew her acquaintance     ii   next afternoon about two oclock alan called with a tremulous heart at the cottage  herminia had heard not a little of him meanwhile from her friend mrs dewsbury  hes a charming young man my dear the woman of the world observed with confidence i felt quite sure youd attract one another  hes so clever and advanced and everything thats dreadfuljust like yourself herminia  but then hes also very well connected  thats always something especially when ones an oddity  you wouldnt go down one bit yourself dear if you werent a deans daughter  the shadow of a cathedral steeple covers a multitude of sins  mr merricks the son of the famous london gout doctoryou must know his nameall the royal dukes flock to him  hes a barrister himself and in excellent practice  you might do worse do you know than to go in for alan merrick  herminias lip curled an almost imperceptible curl as she answered gravely i dont think you quite understand my plans in life mrs dewsbury  it isnt my present intention to go in for anybody  but mrs dewsbury shook her head  she knew the world she lived in ah ive heard a great many girls talk like that beforehand she answered at once with her society glibness but when the right man turned up they soon forgot their protestations  it makes a lot of difference dear when a man really asks you  herminia bent her head  you misunderstand me she replied  i dont mean to say i will never fall in love  i expect to do that i look forward to it franklyit is a womans place in life  i only mean to say i dont think anything will ever induce me to marrythat is to say legally  mrs dewsbury gave a start of surprise and horror  she really didnt know what girls were coming to nowadayswhich considering her first principles was certainly natural  but if only she had seen the conscious flush with which herminia received her visitor that afternoon she would have been confirmed in her belief that herminia after all in spite of her learning was much like other girls  in which conclusion mrs dewsbury would not in the end have been fully justified  when alan arrived herminia sat at the window by the quaintly clipped boxtree a volume of verse held half closed in her hand though she was a great deal too honest and transparent to pretend she was reading it  she expected alan to call in accordance with his promise for she had seen at mrs dewsburys how great an impression she produced upon him and having taught herself that it was every true womans duty to avoid the affectations and selfdeceptions which the rule of man has begotten in women she didnt try to conceal from herself the fact that she on her side was by no means without interest in the question how soon he would pay her his promised visit  as he appeared at the rustic gate in the privet hedge herminia looked out and changed color with pleasure when she saw him push it open  oh how nice of you to look me up so soon she cried jumping from her seat with just a glance at the glass and strolling out bareheaded into the cottage garden  isnt this a charming place only look at our hollyhocks  consider what an oasis after six months of london  she seemed even prettier than last night in her simple white morning dress a mere ordinary english gown without affectation of any sort yet touched with some faint reminiscence of a flowing greek chiton  its halfclassical drapery exactly suited the severe regularity of her pensive features and her graceful figure  alan thought as he looked at her he had never before seen anybody who appeared at all points so nearly to approach his ideal of womanhood  she was at once so high in type so serene so tranquil and yet so purely womanly  yes it is a lovely place he answered looking around at the clematis that drooped from the gableends  im staying myself with the watertons at the park but id rather have this pretty little rosebowered garden than all their balustrades and italian terraces  the cottagers have chosen the better part  what gillyflowers and what columbines  and here you look out so directly on the common  i love the gorse and the bracken i love the stagnant pond i love the very geese that tug hard at the silverweed they make it all seem so deliciously english  shall we walk to the ridge herminia asked with a sudden burst of suggestion  its too rare a day to waste a minute of it indoors i was waiting till you came  we can talk all the freer for the fresh air on the hilltop  nothing could have suited alan merrick better and he said so at once  herminia disappeared for a moment to get her hat  alan observed almost without observing it that she was gone but for a second  she asked none of that long interval that most women require for the simplest matter of toilet  she was back again almost instantly bright and fresh and smiling in the most modest of hats set so artlessly on her head that it became her better than all art could have made it  then they started for a long stroll across the breezy common yellow in places with upright spikes of small summer furze and pink with wild peablossom  bees buzzed broom crackled the chirp of the field cricket rang shrill from the sandbanks  herminias light foot tripped over the spongy turf  by the top of the furthest ridge looking down on north holmwood church they sat side by side for a while on the close short grass brocaded with daisies and gazed across at the cropped sward of denbies and the long line of the north downs stretching away towards reigate  tender grays and greens melted into one another on the larches hard by betchworth chalkpit gleamed dreamy white in the middle distance  they had been talking earnestly all the way like two old friends together for they were both of them young and they felt at once that nameless bond which often draws one closer to a new acquaintance at first sight than years of converse  how seriously you look at life alan cried at last in answer to one of herminias graver thoughts  i wonder what makes you take it so much more earnestly than all other women  it came to me all at once when i was about sixteen herminia answered with quiet composure like one who remarks upon some objective fact of external nature  it came to me in listening to a sermon of my fatherswhich i always look upon as one more instance of the force of heredity  he was preaching on the text the truth shall make you free and all that he said about it seemed to me strangely alive to be heard from a pulpit  he said we ought to seek the truth before all things and never to rest till we felt sure we had found it  we should not suffer our souls to be beguiled into believing a falsehood merely because we wouldnt take the trouble to find out the truth for ourselves by searching  we must dig for it we must grope after it  and as he spoke i made up my mind in a flash of resolution to find out the truth for myself about everything and never to be deterred from seeking it and embracing it and ensuing it when found by any convention or preconception  then he went on to say how the truth would make us free and i felt he was right  it would open our eyes and emancipate us from social and moral slaveries  so i made up my mind at the same time that whenever i found the truth i would not scruple to follow it to its logical conclusions but would practise it in my life and let it make me free with perfect freedom  then in search of truth i got my father to send me to girton and when i had lighted on it there half by accident and it had made me free indeed i went away from girton again because i saw if i stopped there i could never achieve and guard my freedom from that day forth i have aimed at nothing but to know the truth and to act upon it freely for as tennyson says    to live by law   acting the law we live by without fear   and because right is right to follow right   were wisdom in the scorn of consequence   she broke off suddenly and looking up let her eye rest for a second on the dark thread of clambering pines that crest the down just above brockham  this is dreadfully egotistical she cried with a sharp little start  i ought to apologize for talking so much to you about my own feelings  alan gazed at her and smiled  why apologize he asked for managing to be interesting  you are not egotistical at all  what you are telling me is historythe history of a soul which is always the one thing on earth worth hearing  i take it as a compliment that you should hold me worthy to hear it  it is a proof of confidence  besides he went on after a seconds pause i am a man you are a woman  under those circumstances what would otherwise be egotism becomes common and mutual  when two people sympathize with one another all they can say about themselves loses its personal tinge and merges into pure human and abstract interest  herminia brought back her eyes from infinity to his face  thats true she said frankly  the magic link of sex that severs and unites us makes all the difference  and indeed i confess i wouldnt so have spoken of my inmost feelings to another woman     iii   from that day forth alan and herminia met frequently  alan was given to sketching and he sketched a great deal in his idle times on the common  he translated the cottages from real estate into poetry  on such occasions herminias walks often led her in the same direction  for herminia was frank she liked the young man and the truth having made her free she knew no reason why she should avoid or pretend to avoid his company  she had no fear of that sordid impersonal goddess who rules philistia it mattered not to her what people said or whether or not they said anything about her  aiunt quid aiunt aiant was her motto  could she have known to a certainty that her meetings on the common with alan merrick had excited unfavorable comment among the old ladies of holmwood the point would have seemed to her unworthy of an emancipated souls consideration  she could estimate at its true worth the value of all human criticism upon human action  so day after day she met alan merrick half by accident half by design on the slopes of the holmwood  they talked much together for alan liked her and understood her  his heart went out to her compact of like clay he knew the meaning of her hopes and aspirations  often as he sketched he would look up and wait expecting to catch the faint sound of her light step or see her lithe figure poised breezy against the sky on the neighboring ridges  whenever she drew near his pulse thrilled at her cominga somewhat unusual experience with alan merrick  for alan though a pure soul in his way and mixed of the finer paste was not quite like those best of men who are so to speak born married  a man with an innate genius for loving and being loved cannot long remain single  he must marry young or at least if he does not marry he must find a companion a woman to his heart a help that is meet for him  what is commonly called prudence in such concerns is only another name for vice and cruelty  the purest and best of men necessarily mate themselves before they are twenty  as a rule it is the selfish the mean the calculating who wait as they say till they can afford to marry  that vile phrase scarcely veils hidden depths of depravity  a man who is really a man and who has a genius for loving must love from the very first and must feel himself surrounded by those who love him  tis the first necessity of life to him bread meat raiment a house an income rank far second to that prime want in the good mans economy  but alan merrick though an excellent fellow in his way and of noble fibre was not quite one of the first the picked souls of humanity  he did not count among the fingerposts who point the way that mankind will travel  though herminia always thought him so  that was her true womans gift of the highest idealizing power  indeed it adds to my mind to the tragedy of herminia bartons life that the man for whom she risked and lost everything was never quite worthy of her and that herminia to the end not once suspected it  alan was over thirty and was still looking about him  that alone you will admit is a sufficiently grave condemnation  that a man should have arrived at the ripe age of thirty and not yet have lighted upon the elect ladythe woman without whose companionship life would be to him unendurable is in itself a strong proof of much underlying selfishness or what comes to the same thing of a calculating disposition  the right sort of man doesnt argue with himself at all on these matters  he doesnt say with selfish coldness i cant afford a wife or if i marry now i shall ruin my prospects  he feels and acts  he mates like the birds because he cant help himself  a woman crosses his path who is to him indispensable a part of himself the needful complement of his own personality and without heed or hesitation he takes her to himself lawfully or unlawfully because he has need of her  that is how nature has made us that is how every man worthy of the name of man has always felt and thought and acted  the worst of all possible and conceivable checks upon population is the vile one which malthus glossed over as the prudential and which consists in substituting prostitution for marriage through the springtide of ones manhood  alan merrick however was over thirty and still unmarried  more than that he was heartfreea very evil record  and like most other unmarried men of thirty he was a trifle fastidious  he was looking about him  that means to say he was waiting to find some woman who suited him  no man does so at twenty  he sees and loves  but alan merrick having let slip the golden moment when nature prompts every growing youth to fling himself with pure devotion at the feet of the first good angel who happens to cross his path and attract his worship had now outlived the early flush of pure passion and was thinking only of comfortably settling himself  in one word when a man is young he asks himself with a thrill what he can do to make happy this sweet soul he loves when he has let that critical moment flow by him unseized he asks only in cold blood what woman will most agreeably make life run smooth for him  the first stage is pure love the second pure selfishness  still alan merrick was now getting on in his profession and as people said it was high time he should be settled  they said it as they might have said it was high time he should take a business partner  from that lowest depth of emotional disgrace herminia barton was to preserve him  it was her task in life though she knew it not to save alan merricks soul  and nobly she saved it  alan looking about him with some fine qualities of nature underlying in the background that mean social philosophy of the class from which he sprang fell frankly in love almost at first sight with herminia  he admired and respected her  more than that he understood her  she had power in her purity to raise his nature for a time to something approaching her own high level true woman has the real midas gift all that she touches turns to purest gold  seeing herminia much and talking with her alan could not fail to be impressed with the idea that here was a soul which could do a great deal more for him than make him comfortablewhich could raise him to moral heights he had hardly yet dreamt ofwhich could wake in him the best of which he was capable  and watching her thus he soon fell in love with her as few men of thirty are able to fall in love for the first timeas the young man falls in love with the unselfish energy of an unspoilt nature he asked no longer whether herminia was the sort of girl who could make him comfortable he asked only with that delicious tremor of selfdistrust which belongs to naive youth whether he dare offer himself to one so pure and good and beautiful  and his hesitation was justified for our sordid england has not brought forth many such serene and singleminded souls as herminia barton  at last one afternoon they had climbed together the steep red face of the sandy slope that rises abruptly from the holmwood towards leith hill by the robin gate entrance  near the top they had seated themselves on a carpet of sheepsorrel looking out across the imperturbable expanse of the weald and the broad pastures of sussex  a solemn blue haze brooded soft over the land  the sun was sinking low oblique afternoon lights flooded the distant south downs  their combes came out aslant in saucershaped shadows alan turned and gazed at herminia she was hot with climbing and her calm face was flushed  a townbred girl would have looked red and blowsy but the color and the exertion just suited herminia on that healthy brown cheek it seemed natural to discern the visible marks of effort  alan gazed at her with a sudden rush of untrammelled feeling  the elusive outline of her grave sweet face the wistful eyes the ripe red mouth enticed him  oh herminia he cried calling her for the first time by her christian name alone how glad i am i happened to go that afternoon to mrs dewsburys  for otherwise perhaps i might never have known you  herminias heart gave a delicious bound  she was a woman and therefore she was glad he should speak so  she was a woman and therefore she shrank from acknowledging it  but she looked him back in the face tranquilly none the less on that account and answered with sweet candor thank you so much mr merrick  i said herminia the young man corrected smiling yet aghast at his own audacity  and i thanked you for it herminia answered casting down those dark lashes and feeling the heart throb violently under her neat bodice  alan drew a deep breath  and it was that you thanked me for he ejaculated tingling  yes it was that i thanked you for herminia answered with a still deeper rose spreading down to her bare throat  i like you very much and it pleases me to hear you call me herminia  why should i shrink from admitting it  tis the truth you know and the truth shall make us free  im not afraid of my freedom  alan paused for a second irresolute  herminia he said at last leaning forward till his face was very close to hers and he could feel the warm breath that came and went so quickly thats very very kind of you  i neednt tell you ive been thinking a great deal about you these last three weeks or so  you have filled my mind filled it to the brim and i think you know it  philosopher as she was herminia plucked a blade of grass and drew it quivering through her tremulous fingers  it caught and hesitated  i guessed as much i think she answered low but frankly  the young mans heart gave a bound  and you herminia he asked in an eager ecstasy  herminia was true to the truth  ive thought a great deal about you too mr merrick she answered looking down but with a great gladness thrilling her  i said herminia the young man repeated with a marked stress on the christian name  herminia hesitated a second  then two crimson spots flared forth on her speaking face as she answered with an effort about you too alan  the young man drew back and gazed at her  she was very very beautiful  dare i ask you herminia he cried have i a right to ask you  am i worthy of you i mean  ought i to retire as not your peer and leave you to some man who could rise more easily to the height of your dignity  ive thought about that too herminia answered still firm to her principles  ive thought it all over  ive said to myself shall i do right in monopolizing him when he is so great and sweet and true and generous  not monopolizing of course for that would be wrong and selfish but making you my own more than any other womans  and i answered my own heart yes yes i shall do right to accept him if he asks me for i love him that is enough  the thrill within me tells me so  nature put that thrill in our souls to cry out to us with a clear voice when we had met the soul she then and there intended for us  alans face flushed like her own  then you love me he cried all on fire  and you deign to tell me so oh herminia how sweet you are  what have i done to deserve it  he folded her in his arms  her bosom throbbed on his  their lips met for a second  herminia took his kiss with sweet submission and made no faint pretence of fighting against it  her heart was full  she quickened to the fingertips  there was silence for a minute or twothe silence when soul speaks direct to soul through the vehicle of touch the mothertongue of the affections  then alan leaned back once more and hanging over her in a rapture murmured in soft low tones so herminia you will be mine  you say beforehand you will take me  not will be yours herminia corrected in that silvery voice of hers  am yours already alan  i somehow feel as if i had always been yours  i am yours this moment  you may do what you would with me  she said it so simply so purely so naturally with all the supreme faith of the good woman enamoured who can yield herself up without blame to the man who loves her that it hardly even occurred to alans mind to wonder at her selfsurrender  yet he drew back all the same in a sudden little crisis of doubt and uncertainty  he scarcely realized what she meant  then dearest he cried tentatively how soon may we be married  at sound of those unexpected words from such lips as his a flush of shame and horror overspread herminias cheek  never she cried firmly drawing away  oh alan what can you mean by it dont tell me after all ive tried to make you feel and understand you thought i could possibly consent to marry you  the man gazed at her in surprise  though he was prepared for much he was scarcely prepared for such devotion to principle  oh herminia he cried you cant mean it  you cant have thought of what it entails  surely surely you wont carry your ideas of freedom to such an extreme such a dangerous conclusion  herminia looked up at him half hurt  cant have thought of what it entails she repeated  her dimples deepened  why alan havent i had my whole lifetime to think of it  what else have i thought about in any serious way save this one great question of a womans duty to herself and her sex and her unborn children its been my sole study  how could you fancy i spoke hastily or without due consideration on such a subject  would you have me like the blind girls who go unknowing to the altar as sheep go to the shambles  could you suspect me of such carelessnesssuch culpable thoughtlessnessyou to whom i have spoken of all this so freely  alan stared at her disconcerted hardly knowing how to answer but what alternative do you propose then he asked in his amazement  propose herminia repeated taken aback in her turn  it all seemed to her so plain and transparent and natural  why simply that we should be friends like any others very dear dear friends with the only kind of friendship that nature makes possible between men and women  she said it so softly with some womanly gentleness yet with such lofty candor that alan couldnt help admiring her more than ever before for her translucent simplicity and directness of purpose yet her suggestion frightened him  it was so much more novel to him than to her  herminia had reasoned it all out with herself as she truly said for years and knew exactly how she felt and thought about it  to alan on the contrary it came with the shock of a sudden surprise and he could hardly tell on the spur of the moment how to deal with it  he paused and reflected  but do you mean to say herminia he asked still holding that soft brown hand unresisted in his youve made up your mind never to marry any one made up your mind to brave the whole mad world that cant possibly understand the motives of your conduct and live with some friend as you put it unmarried  yes ive made up my mind herminia answered with a faint tremor in her maidenly voice but with hardly a trace now of a traitorous blush where no blush was needed  ive made up my mind alan and from all we had said and talked over together i thought you at least would sympathize in my resolve  she spoke with a gentle tinge of regret nay almost of disillusion the bare suggestion of that regret stung alan to the quick  he felt it was shame to him that he could not rise at once to the height of her splendid selfrenunciation  you mistake me dearest he answered petting her hand in his own and she allowed him to pet it  it wasnt for myself or for the world i hesitated  my thought was for you  you are very young yet  you say you have counted the cost  i wonder if you have  i wonder if you realize it  only too well herminia replied in a very earnest mood  i have wrought it all out in my mind beforehandcovenanted with my soul that for womens sake i would be a free woman  alan whoever would be free must himself strike the blow  i know what you will saywhat every man would say to the woman he loved under similar circumstanceswhy should you be the victim  why should you be the martyr  bask in the sun yourself leave this doom to some other  but alan i cant  i feel i must face it  unless one woman begins there will be no beginning  she lifted his hand in her own and fondled it in her turn with caressing tenderness think how easy it would be for me dear friend she cried with a catch in her voice to do as other women do to accept the honorable marriage you offer me as other women would call it to be false to my sex a traitor to my convictions to sell my kind for a mess of pottage a name and a home or even for thirty pieces of silver to be some rich mans wife as other women have sold it but alan i cant  my conscience wont let me  i know what marriage is from what vile slavery it has sprung on what unseen horrors for my sister women it is reared and buttressed by what unholy sacrifices it is sustained and made possible  i know it has a history i know its past i know its present and i cant embrace it i cant be untrue to my most sacred beliefs  i cant pander to the malignant thing just because a man who loves me would be pleased by my giving way and would kiss me and fondle me for it  and i love you to fondle me  but i must keep my proper place the freedom which i have gained for myself by such arduous efforts  i have said to you already so far as my will goes i am yours take me and do as you choose with me  that much i can yield as every good woman should yield it to the man she loves to the man who loves her  but more than that no  it would be treason to my sex not my life not my future not my individuality not my freedom  i wouldnt ask you for those alan answered carried away by the torrent flood of her passionate speech  i would wish you to guard them  but herminia just as a matter of formto prevent the world from saying the cruel things the world is sure to sayand as an act of justice to you and your children  a mere ceremony of marriage what more does it mean nowadays than that we two agree to live together on the ordinary terms of civilized society  still herminia shook her head  no no she cried vehemently  i deny and decline those terms they are part and parcel of a system of slavery  i have learnt that the righteous soul should avoid all appearance of evil  i will not palter and parley with the unholy thing  even though you go to a registryoffice and get rid as far as you can of every relic of the sacerdotal and sacramental idea yet the marriage itself is still an assertion of mans supremacy over woman  it ties her to him for life it ignores her individuality it compels her to promise what no human heart can be sure of performing for you can contract to do or not to do easily enough but contract to feel or not to feelwhat transparent absurdity  it is full of all evils and i decline to consider it if i love a man at all i must love him on terms of perfect freedom  i cant bind myself down to live with him to my shame one day longer than i love him or to love him at all if i find him unworthy of my purest love or unable to retain it or if i discover some other more fit to be loved by me  you admitted the other day that all this was abstractly true why should you wish this morning to draw back from following it out to its end in practice  alan was only an englishman and shared of course the inability of his countrymen to carry any principle to its logical conclusion he was all for admitting that though things must really be so yet it were prudent in life to pretend they were otherwise  this is the wellknown english virtue of moderation and compromise it has made england what she is the shabbiest sordidest worstorganized of nations  so he paused for a second and temporized  its for your sake herminia he said again i cant bear to think of your making yourself a martyr  and i dont see how if you act as you propose you could escape martyrdom  herminia looked up at him with pleading eyes  tears just trembled on the edge of those glistening lashes  it never occurred to me to think she said gently but bravely my life could ever end in anything else but martyrdom  it must needs be so with all true lives and all good ones  for whoever sees the truth whoever strives earnestly with all his soul to be good must be raised many planes above the common mass of men around him he must be a moral pioneer and the moral pioneer is always a martyr  people wont allow others to be wiser and better than themselves unpunished they can forgive anything except moral superiority  we have each to choose between acquiescence in the wrong with a life of ease and struggle for the right crowned at last by inevitable failure to succeed is to fail and failure is the only success worth aiming at  every great and good life can but end in a calvary  and i want to save you from that alan cried leaning over her with real tenderness for she was already very dear to him  i want to save you from yourself i want to make you think twice before you rush headlong into such a danger  not to save me from myself but to save me from my own higher and better nature herminia answered with passionate seriousness alan i dont want any man to save me from that i want you rather to help me to strengthen me to sympathize with me  i want you to love me not for my face and form alone not for what i share with every other woman but for all that is holiest and deepest within me  if you cant love me for that i dont ask you to love me i want to be loved for what i am in myself for the yearnings i possess that are most of all peculiar to me  i know you are attracted to me by those yearnings above everything why wish me untrue to them  it was because i saw you could sympathize with me in these impulses that i said to myself here at last is the man who can go through life as an aid and a spur to me  dont tell me i was mistaken dont belie my belief  be what i thought you were what i know you are  work with me and help me  lift me raise me exalt me  take me on the sole terms on which i can give myself up to you  she stretched her arms out pleading she turned those subtle eyes to him appealingly  she was a beautiful woman  alan merrick was human  the man in him gave way he seized her in his clasp and pressed her close to his bosom  it heaved tumultuously  i could do anything for you herminia he cried and indeed i do sympathize with you  but give me at least till tomorrow to think this thing over  it is a momentous question dont let us be precipitate  herminia drew a long breath  his embrace thrilled through her as you will she answered with a womans meekness  but remember alan what i say i mean on these terms it shall be and upon none others  brave women before me have tried for awhile to act on their own responsibility for the good of their sex but never of their own free will from the very beginning  they have avoided marriage not because they thought it a shame and a surrender a treason to their sex a base yielding to the unjust pretensions of men but because there existed at the time some obstacle in their way in the shape of the vested interest of some other woman  when mary godwin chose to mate herself with shelley she took her good name in her hands but still there was harriet as soon as harriet was dead mary showed she had no deep principle of action involved by marrying shelley  when george eliot chose to pass her life with lewes on terms of equal freedom she defied the manmade law but still there was his wife to prevent the possibility of a legalized union  as soon as lewes was dead george eliot showed she had no principle involved by marrying another man  now i have the rare chance of acting otherwise i can show the world from the very first that i act from principle and from principle only  i can say to it in effect see here is the man of my choice the man i love truly and purely the man any one of you would willingly have seen offering himself in lawful marriage to your own daughters  if i would i might go the beaten way you prescribe and marry him legally  but of my own free will i disdain that degradation i choose rather to be free  no fear of your scorn no dread of your bigotry no shrinking at your cruelty shall prevent me from following the thorny path i know to be the right one  i seek no temporal end  i will not prove false to the future of my kind in order to protect myself from your hateful indignities  i know on what vile foundations your temple of wedlock is based and built what pitiable victims languish and die in its sickening vaults and i will not consent to enter it  here of my own free will i take my stand for the right and refuse your sanctions  no woman that i know of has ever yet done that  other women have fallen as men choose to put it in their odious dialect no other has voluntarily risen as i propose to do  she paused a moment for breath  now you know how i feel she continued looking straight into his eyes  say no more at present it is wisest so  but go home and think it out and talk it over with me tomorrow     iv   that night alan slept little  even at dinner his hostess mrs waterton noticed his preoccupation and on the pretext of a headache he retired early to his own bedroom  his mind was full of herminia and these strange ideas of hers how could he listen with a becoming show of interest to ethel watertons aspirations on the grand piano after a gipsy lifeoh a gipsy life for herwhen in point of fact she was a most insipid blonde from the cover of a chocolate box  so he went to bed betimes and there lay long awake deep wondering to himself how to act about herminia  he was really in love with her  that much he acknowledged frankly more profoundly in love than he had ever conceived it possible he could find himself with any one  hitherto he had considered this girl or that mostly on his mothers or sisters recommendation and after observing her critically for a day or two as he might have observed a horse or any other intended purchase he had come to the conclusion she wouldnt do and had ceased to entertain her but with herminia he was in love  the potent god had come upon him  that imperious inner monitor which cries aloud to a man you must have this girl because you cant do without her you must strive to make her happy because her happiness is more to you now ten thousand fold than your own that imperious inner monitor had spoken out at last in no uncertain tone to alan merrick  he knew for the first time what it is to be in love in love with a true and beautiful woman not with his own future convenience and comfort the keen fresh sense it quickened within him raised him for the moment some levels above himself  for herminias sake he felt he could do or dare anything  nay more as herminia herself had said to him it was her better her inner self he was in love with not the mere statuesque face the full and faultless figure  he saw how pure how pellucid how noble the woman was treading her own ideal world of high seraphic harmonies  he was in love with her stainless soul he could not have loved her so well could not have admired her so profoundly had she been other than she was had she shared the common prejudices and preconceptions of women  it was just because she was herminia that he felt so irresistibly attracted towards her she drew him like a magnet  what he loved and admired was not so much the fair frank face itself as the lofty cornelialike spirit behind it  and yethe hesitated  could he accept the sacrifice this white soul wished to make for him  could he aid and abet her in raising up for herself so much undeserved obloquy  could he help her to become anathema maranatha among her sister women  even if she felt brave enough to try the experiment herself for humanitys sake was it not his duty as a man to protect her from her own sublime and generous impulses  is it not for that in part that nature makes us virile  we must shield the weaker vessel  he was flattered not a little that this leader among women should have picked him out for herself among the ranks of men as her predestined companion in her chosen task of emancipating her sex  and he was thoroughly sympathetic as every good man must needs be with her aims and her method  yet still he hesitated  never before could he have conceived such a problem of the soul such a moral dilemma possible  it rent heart and brain at once asunder  instinctively he felt to himself he would be doing wrong should he try in any way to check these splendid and unselfish impulses which led herminia to offer herself willingly up as a living sacrifice on behalf of her enslaved sisters everywhere yet the innate feeling of the man that tis his place to protect and guard the woman even from her own higher and purer self intervened to distract him  he couldnt bear to feel he might be instrumental in bringing upon his pure herminia the tortures that must be in store for her he couldnt bear to think his name might be coupled with hers in shameful ways too base for any man to contemplate  and then intermixed with these higher motives came others that he hardly liked to confess to himself where herminia was concerned but which nevertheless would obtrude themselves will he nill he upon him  what would other people say about such an innocent union as herminia contemplated  not indeed what effect would it have upon his position and prospects  alan merricks place as a barrister was fairly well assured and the bar is luckily one of the few professions in lieloving england where a man need not grovel at the mercy of the moral judgment of the meanest and grossest among his fellowcreatures as is the case with the church with medicine with the politician and with the schoolmaster  but alan could not help thinking all the same how people would misinterpret and misunderstand his relations with the woman he loved if he modelled them strictly upon herminias wishes  it was hateful it was horrible to have to con the thing over where that faultless soul was concerned in the vile and vulgar terms other people would apply to it but for herminias sake con it over so he must and though he shrank from the effort with a deadly shrinking he nevertheless faced it  men at the clubs would say he had seduced herminia  men at the clubs would lay the whole blame of the episode upon him and he couldnt bear to be so blamed for the sake of a woman to save whom from the faintest shadow of disgrace or shame he would willingly have died a thousand times over  for since herminia had confessed her love to him yesterday he had begun to feel how much she was to him  his admiration and appreciation of her had risen inexpressibly  and was he now to be condemned for having dragged down to the dust that angel whose white wings he felt himself unworthy to touch with the hem of his garment  and yet once more when he respected her so much for the sacrifice she was willing to make for humanity would it be right for him to stand in her way to deter her from realizing her own highest nature  she was herminia just because she lived in that world of high hopes just because she had the courage and the nobility to dare this great thing  would it be right of him to bring her down from that pedestal whereon she stood so austere and urge upon her that she should debase herself to be as any other womaneven as ethel waterton  for the watertons had brought him there to propose to ethel  for hours he tossed and turned and revolved these problems  rain beat on the leaded panes of the waterton dormers  day dawned but no light came with it to his troubled spirit  the more he thought of this dilemma the more profoundly he shrank from the idea of allowing himself to be made into the instrument for what the world would call after its kind herminias shame and degradation  for even if the world could be made to admit that herminia had done what she did from chaste and noble motiveswhich considering what we all know of the world was improbableyet at any rate it could never allow that he himself had acted from any but the vilest and most unworthy reasons  base souls would see in the sacrifice he made to herminias ideals only the common story of a trustful woman cruelly betrayed by the man who pretended to love her and would proceed to treat him with the coldness and contempt with which such a man deserves to be treated  as the morning wore on this view of the matter obtruded itself more and more forcibly every moment on alan  over and over again he said to himself let come what come might he must never aid and abet that innocent soul in rushing blindfold over a cliff to her own destruction  it is so easy at twentytwo to ruin yourself for life so difficult at thirty to climb slowly back again  no no holy as herminias impulses were he must save her from herself he must save her from her own purity he must refuse to be led astray by her romantic aspirations  he must keep her to the beaten path trod by all petty souls and preserve her from the painful crown of martyrdom she herself designed as her eternal diadem  full of these manful resolutions he rose up early in the morning he would be his herminias guardian angel  he would use her love for himfor he knew she loved himas a lever to egg her aside from these slippery moral precipices  he mistook the solid rock of ethical resolution he was trying to disturb with so frail an engine  the fulcrum itself would yield far sooner to the pressure than the weight of herminias uncompromising rectitude  passionate as she wasand with that opulent form she could hardly be otherwiseprinciple was still deeper and more imperious with her than passion     v   he met her by appointment on the first ridge of bore hill  a sunny summer morning smiled fresh after the rain  bumblebees bustled busily about the closed lips of the redrattle and ripe gorse pods burst with little elastic explosions in the basking sunlight  when alan reached the trystingplace under a broadarmed oak in a glade of the woodland herminia was there before him a good woman always is tis the prerogative of her affection  she was simply dressed in her dainty print gown a single tearosebud peeped out from her bodice she looked more lilylike so alan thought in his heart than he had ever yet seen her  she held out her hand to him with parted lips and a conscious blush  alan took it but bent forward at the same time and with a hasty glance around just touched her rich mouth  herminia allowed him without a struggle she was too stately of mien ever to grant a favor without granting it of pure grace and with queenly munificence  alan led her to a grassy bank where thyme and basil grew matted and the hum of myriad wings stirred the sultry air herminia let him lead her  she was woman enough by nature to like being led only it must be the right man who led her and he must lead her along the path that her conscience approved of  alan seated himself by her side and took her hand in his herminia let him hold it  this lovemaking was pure honey  dappled spots of light and shade flecked the ground beneath the trees like a jaguars skin  woodpigeons crooned unseen from the leafy covert  she sat there long without uttering a word  once alan essayed to speak but herminia cut him short  oh no not yet she cried half petulantly this silence is so delicious  i love best just to sit and hold your hand like this  why spoil it with language  so they sat for some minutes herminia with her eyes halfclosed drinking in to the full the delight of first love  she could feel her heart beating  at last alan interposed and began to speak to her  the girl drew a long breath then she sighed for a second as she opened her eyes again  every curve of her bosom heaved and swayed mysteriously  it seemed such a pity to let articulate words disturb that reverie  still if alan wished it  for a woman is a woman let girton do its worst and herminia not less but rather more than the rest of them  then alan began  with her hand clasped in his and fondling it while he spoke he urged all he could urge to turn her from her purpose  he pointed out to her how unwise how irretrievable her position would be if she once assumed it  on such a road as that there is no turning back  the die once cast she must forever abide by it  he used all arts to persuade and dissuade all eloquence to save her from herself and her salvation  if he loved her less he said with truth he might have spoken less earnestly it was for her own sake he spoke because he so loved her  he waxed hot in his eager desire to prevent her from taking this fatal step  he drew his breath hard and paused  emotion and anxiety overcame him visibly  but as for herminia though she listened with affection and with a faint thrill of pleasure to much that he said seeing how deeply he loved her she leaned back from time to time half weary with his eagerness and his consequent iteration  dear alan she said at last soothing his hand with her own as a sister might have soothed it you talk about all this as though it were to me some new resolve some new idea of my making  you forget it is the outcome of my lifes philosophy  i have grown up to it slowly i have thought of all this and of hardly anything else ever since i was old enough to think for myself about anything  root and branch it is to me a foregone conclusion  i love you  you love me  so far as i am concerned there ends the question  one way there is and one way alone in which i can give myself up to you make me yours if you will but if not then leave me  only remember by leaving me you wont any the more turn me aside from my purpose  you wont save me from myself as you call it you will only hand me over to some one less fit for me by far than you are  a quiet moisture glistened in her eyes and she gazed at him pensively  how wonderful it is she went on musing  three weeks ago i didnt know there was such a man in the world at all as you and nowwhy alan i feel as if the world would be nothing to me without you  your name seems to sing in my ears all day long with the song of the birds and to thrill through and through me as i lie awake on my pillow with the cry of the nightjar  yet if you wont take me on my own terms i know well what will happen  i shall go away and grieve over you of course and feel bereaved for months as if i could never possibly again love any man  at present it seems to me i never could love him  but though my heart tells me that my reason tells me i should some day find some other soul i might perhaps fall back upon  but it would only be falling back  for the sake of my principles alone and of the example i wish to set the world could i ever fall back upon any other  yet fall back i would  and what good would you have done me then by refusing me  you would merely have cast me off from the man i love best the man who i know by immediate instinct which is the voice of nature and of god within us was intended from all time for me the moment i saw you my heart beat quicker my hearts evidence told me you were the one love meant for me  why force me to decline upon some other less meet for me  alan gazed at her irresolute  but if you love me so much he said surely surely it is a small thing to trust your future to me  the tenderness of woman let her hand glide over his cheek  she was not ashamed of her love  o alan she cried if it were only for myself i could trust you with my life i could trust you with anything  but i havent only myself to think of  i have to think of right and wrong i have to think of the world i have to think of the cause which almost wholly hangs upon me  not for nothing are these impulses implanted in my breast  they are the voice of the soul of all women within me  if i were to neglect them for the sake of gratifying your wishesif i were to turn traitor to my sex for the sake of the man i love as so many women have turned before me i should hate and despise myself  i couldnt love you alan quite so much loved i not honor more and the battle imposed upon me  alan wavered as she spoke  he felt what she said was true even if he refused to take her on the only terms she could accept he would not thereby save her  she would turn in time and bestow herself upon some man who would perhaps be less worthy of hernay even on some man who might forsake her in the sequel with unspeakable treachery  of conduct like that alan knew himself incapable  he knew that if he took herminia once to his heart he would treat her with such tenderness such constancy such devotion as never yet was shown to living woman  love always thinks so  but still he shrank from the idea of being himself the man to take advantage of her for so in his unregenerate mind he phrased to himself their union  and still he temporized  even so herminia he cried bending forward and gazing hard at her i couldnt endure to have it said it was i who misled you  herminia lifted her eyes to his with just a tinge of lofty scorn tempered only by the womanliness of those melting lashes  and you can think of that she murmured gazing across at him half in tears  o alan for my part i can think of nothing now but the truths of life and the magnitude of the issues  our hearts against the worldlove and duty against convention  then alan began again and talked all he knew  he urged he prayed he bent forward he spoke soft and low he played on her tenderest chords as a loving woman  herminia was moved for her heart went forth to him and she knew why he tried so hard to save her from her own higher and truer nature  but she never yielded an inch she stood firm to her colors  she shook her head to the last and murmured over and over again there is only one right way and no persuasion on earth will ever avail to turn me aside from it  the truth had made her free and she was very confident of it  at last all other means failing alan fell back on the final resort of delay  he saw much merit in procrastination  there was no hurry he said  they neednt make up their minds one way or the other immediately  they could take their time to think perhaps with a week or two to decide in herminia might persuade him or he might persuade her  why rush on fate so suddenly  but at that to his immense surprise herminia demurred  no no she said shaking her head thats not at all what i want  we must decide today one way or the other  now is the accepted time now is the day of salvation  i couldnt let you wait and slip by degrees into some vague arrangement we hardly contemplated definitely  to do that would be to sin against my ideas of decorum  whatever we do we must do as the apostle says decently and in order with a full sense of the obligations it imposes upon us  we must say to one another in so many words i am yours you are mine or we must part forever  i have told you my whole soul i have bared my heart before you  you may take it or leave it but for my dignitys sake i put it to you now choose one way or the other  alan looked at her hard  her face was crimson by this with maidenly shame but she made no effort to hide or avert it  for the good of humanity this question must be settled once for all and no womanish reserve should make her shrink from settling it happier maidens in ages to come when society had reconstructed itself on the broad basis of freedom would never have to go through what she was going through that moment  they would be spared the quivering shame the tingling regret the struggle with which she braced up her maiden modesty to that supreme effort  but she would go through with it all the same  for eternal womans sake she had long contemplated that day now it had come at last she would not weakly draw back from it  alans eyes were all admiration  he stood near enough to her level to understand her to the core  herminia he cried bending over her you drive me to bay  you press me very hard  i feel myself yielding  i am a man and when you speak to me like that i know it  you enlist on your side all that is virile within me  yet how can i accept the terms you offer  for the very love i bear you how do you this injustice  if i loved you less i might perhaps say yes because i love you so well i feel compelled to say no to you  herminia looked at him hard in return  her cheeks were glowing now with something like the shame of the woman who feels her love is lightly rejected  is that final she asked drawing herself up as she sat and facing him proudly  no no its not final alan answered feeling the womans influence course through body and blood to his quivering fingertips magical touches stirred him how can it be final herminia when you look at me like that how can it be final when youre so gracious so graceful so beautiful oh my child i am a man dont play too hard on those fiercest chords in my nature  herminia gazed at him fixedly the dimples disappeared  her voice was more serious now and had nothing in it of pleading  it isnt like that that i want to draw you alan she answered gravely it isnt those chords i want to play upon  i want to convince your brain your intellect your reason  you agree with me in principle  why then should you wish to draw back in practice  yes i agree with you in principle alan answered  it isnt there that i hesitate  even before i met you i had arrived at pretty much the same ideas myself as a matter of abstract reasoning  i saw that the one way of freedom for the woman is to cast off root and branch the evil growth of mans supremacy  i saw that the honorableness of marriage the disgrace of free union were just so many ignoble masculine devices to keep up mans lordship vile results of his determination to taboo to himself beforehand and monopolize for life some particular woman  i know all that i acknowledge all that  i see as plainly as you do that sooner or later there must come a revolution  but herminia the women who devote themselves to carrying out that revolution will take their souls in their hands and will march in line to the freeing of their sex through shame and calumny and hardships innumerable  i shrink from letting you the woman that i love bring that fate upon yourself i shrink still more from being the man to aid and abet you in doing it  herminia fixed her piercing eyes upon his face once more  tears stood in them now  the tenderness of woman was awakened within her  dear alan she said gently dont i tell you i have thought long since of all that  i am prepared to face it  it is only a question of with whom i shall do so  shall it be with the man i have instinctively loved from the first moment i saw him better than all others on earth or shall it be with some lesser if my heart is willing why should yours demur to it  because i love you too well alan answered doggedly  herminia rose and faced him  her hands dropped by her side  she was splendid when she stood so with her panting bosom  then you decide to say goodbye she cried with a lingering cadence  alan seized her by both wrists and drew her down to his side no no darling he answered low laying his lips against hers i can never say goodbye  you have confessed you love me  when a woman says that what can a man refuse her  from such a woman as you i am so proud so proud so proud of such a confession how could i ever cease to feel you were minemine mine wholly mine for a lifetime  then you consent herminia cried all aglow half nestling to his bosom  i consent alan answered with profound misgivings  what else do you leave open to me  herminia made no direct answer she only laid her head with perfect trust upon the mans broad shoulder  o alan she murmured low letting her heart have its way you are mine then you are mine you have made me so happy so supremely happy     vi   thus half against his will alan merrick was drawn into this irregular compact  next came that more difficult matter the discussion of ways and means the more practical details  alan hardly knew at first on what precise terms it was herminias wish that they two should pass their lives together  his ideas were all naturally framed on the old model of marriage in that matter herminia said he was still in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity  he took it for granted that of course they must dwell under one roof with one another  but that simple ancestral notion derived from mans lordship in his own house was wholly adverse to herminias views of the reasonable and natural  she had debated these problems at full in her own mind for years and had arrived at definite and consistent solutions for every knotty point in them  why should this friendship differ at all she asked in respect of time and place from any other friendship  the notion of necessarily keeping house together the cramping idea of the family tie belonged entirely to the regime of the manmade patriarchate where the woman and the children were the slaves and chattels of the lord and master  in a free society was it not obvious that each woman would live her own life apart would preserve her independence and would receive the visits of the man for whom she caredthe father of her children  then only could she be free  any other method meant the economic and social superiority of the man and was irreconcilable with the perfect individuality of the woman  so herminia reasoned  she rejected at once therefore the idea of any change in her existing mode of life  to her the friendship she proposed with alan merrick was no social revolution it was but the due fulfilment of her natural functions  to make of it an occasion for ostentatious change in her way of living seemed to her as unnatural as is the practice of the barbarians in our midst who use a weddingthat most sacred and private event in a young girls lifeas an opportunity for display of the coarsest and crudest character  to rivet the attention of friends on bride and bridegroom is to offend against the most delicate susceptibilities of modesty  from all such hateful practices herminias pure mind revolted by instinct  she felt that here at least was the one moment in a womans history when she would shrink with timid reserve from every eye save one manswhen publicity of any sort was most odious and horrible  only the blinding effect of custom indeed could ever have shut good womens eyes to the shameful indecorousness of wedding ceremonial  we drag a young girl before the prying gaze of all the world at the very crisis in her life when natural modesty would most lead her to conceal herself from her dearest acquaintance and our women themselves have grown so blunted by use to the hatefulness of the ordeal that many of them face it now with inhuman effrontery  familiarity with marriage has almost killed out in the maidens of our race the last lingering relics of native modesty  herminia however could dispense with all that show  she had a little cottage of her own she told alana tiny little cottage in a street near her schoolwork she rented it for a small sum in quite a poor quarter all inhabited by workpeople  there she lived by herself for she kept no servants  there she should continue to live why need this purely personal compact between them two make any difference in her daily habits  she would go on with her schoolwork for the present as usual  oh no she certainly didnt intend to notify the headmistress of the school or any one else of her altered position  it was no alteration of position at all so far as she was concerned merely the addition to life of a new and very dear and natural friendship  herminia took her own point of view so instinctively indeedlived so wrapped in an ideal world of her own and the futuresthat alan was often quite alarmed in his soul when he thought of the rude awakening that no doubt awaited her  yet whenever he hinted it to her with all possible delicacy she seemed so perfectly prepared for the worst the world could do so fixed and resolved in her intention of martyrdom that he had no argument left and could only sigh over her  it was not she explained to him further that she wished to conceal anything  the least tinge of concealment was wholly alien to that frank fresh nature  if her headmistress asked her a pointblank question she would not attempt to parry it but would reply at once with a point blank answer  still her very views on the subject made it impossible for her to volunteer information unasked to any one  here was a personal matter of the utmost privacy a matter which concerned nobody on earth save herself and alan a matter on which it was the grossest impertinence for any one else to make any inquiry or hold any opinion  they two chose to be friends and there so far as the rest of the world was concerned the whole thing ended  what else took place between them was wholly a subject for their own consideration  but if ever circumstances should arise which made it necessary for her to avow to the world that she must soon be a mother then it was for the world to take the first step if it would act upon its own hateful and cruel initiative  she would never deny but she would never go out of her way to confess  she stood upon her individuality as a human being  as to other practical matters about which alan ventured delicately to throw out a passing question or two herminia was perfectly frank with the perfect frankness of one who thinks and does nothing to be ashamed of  she had always been selfsupporting she said and she would be selfsupporting still  to her mind that was an essential step towards the emancipation of women  their friendship implied for her no change of existence merely an addition to the fulness of her living  he was the complement of her being  every woman should naturally wish to live her whole life to fulfil her whole functions and that she could do only by becoming a mother accepting the orbit for which nature designed her  in the end no doubt complete independence would be secured for each woman by the civilized state or in other words by the whole body of men who do the hard work of the world and who would collectively guarantee every necessary and luxury to every woman of the community equally  in that way alone could perfect liberty of choice and action be secured for women and she held it just that women should so be provided for because the mothers of the community fulfil in the state as important and necessary a function as the men themselves do  it would be well too that the mothers should be free to perform that function without preoccupation of any sort  so a free world would order things  but in our present barbaric state of industrial slavery capitalism monopolyin other words under the organized rule of selfishnesssuch a course was impossible  perhaps as an intermediate condition it might happen in time that the women of certain classes would for the most part be made independent at maturity each by her own father which would produce for them in the end pretty much the same general effect of freedom  she saw as a first step the endowment of the daughter  but meanwhile there was nothing for it save that as many women as could should aim for themselves at economic liberty in other words at selfsupport  that was an evil in itself because obviously the prospective mothers of a community should be relieved as far as possible front the stress and strain of earning a livelihood should be set free to build up their nervous systems to the highest attainable level against the calls of maternity  but above all things we must be practical and in the practical world here and now around us no other way existed for women to be free save the wasteful way of each earning her own livelihood therefore she would continue her schoolwork with her pupils as long as the school would allow her and when that became impossible would fall back upon literature  one other question alan ventured gently to raisethe question of children  fools always put that question and think it a crushing one  alan was no fool yet it puzzled him strangely  he did not see for himself how easy is the solution how absolutely herminias plan leaves the position unaltered  but herminia herself was as modestly frank on the subject as on every other  it was a moral and social point of the deepest importance and it would be wrong of them to rush into it without due consideration  she had duly considered it  she would give her children should any come the unique and glorious birthright of being the only human beings ever born into this world as the deliberate result of a free union contracted on philosophical and ethical principles  alan hinted certain doubts as to their upbringing and education  there too herminia was perfectly frank  they would be half hers half his the pleasant burden of their support the joy of their education would naturally fall upon both parents equally  but why discuss these matters like the squalid rich who make their marriages a question of settlements and dowries and business arrangements they two were friends and lovers in love such base doubts could never arise  not for worlds would she import into their mutual relations any sordid stain of money any vile tinge of bargaining they could trust one another that alone sufficed for them  so alan gave way bit by bit all along the line overborne by herminias more perfect and logical conception of her own principles  she knew exactly what she felt and wanted while he knew only in a vague and formless way that his reason agreed with her  a week later he knocked timidly one evening at the door of a modest little workmanlooking cottage down a small side street in the backwastes of chelsea  twas a most unpretending street bower lane by name full of brown brick houses all as like as peas and with nothing of any sort to redeem their plain fronts from the common blight of the london jerrybuilder  only a soft serge curtain and a pot of mignonette on the ledge of the window distinguished the cottage at which alan merrick knocked from the others beside it  externally that is to say for within it was as dainty as morris wallpapers and merino hangings and a delicate feminine taste in form and color could make it  keats and shelley lined the shelves rossettis wan maidens gazed unearthly from the overmantel  the door was opened for him by herminia in person for she kept no servantthat was one of her principles  she was dressed from head to foot in a simple white gown as pure and sweet as the soul it covered  a white rose nestled in her glossy hair three sprays of white lily decked a vase on the mantelpiece  some dim survival of ancestral ideas made herminia barton so array herself in the white garb of affiance for her bridal evening  her cheek was aglow with virginal shrinking as she opened the door and welcomed alan in  but she held out her hand just as frankly as ever to the man of her free choice as he advanced to greet her alan caught her in his arms and kissed her forehead tenderly  and thus was herminia bartons espousal consummated     vii   the next six months were the happiest time of her life for herminia  all day long she worked hard with her classes and often in the evenings alan merrick dropped in for sweet converse and companionship  too free from any taint of sin or shame herself ever to suspect that others could misinterpret her actions herminia was hardly aware how the gossip of bower lane made free in time with the name of the young lady who had taken a cottage in the row and whose relations with the tall gentleman that called so much in the evenings were beginning to attract the attention of the neighborhood  the poor slaves of washerwomen and working mens wives all around with whom contented slavery to a drunken husband was the only respectable conditioncouldnt understand for the life of them how the pretty young lady could make her name so cheap and her that pretends to be so charitable and that and goes about in the parish like a district visitor  though to be sure it had already struck the minds of bower lane that herminia never went to church nor chapel and when people cut themselves adrift from church and chapel why what sort of morality can you reasonably expect of them  nevertheless herminias manners were so sweet and engaging to rich and poor alike that bower lane seriously regretted what it took to be her lapse from grace  poor purblind bower lane  a lifetime would have failed it to discern for itself how infinitely higher than its slavish respectability was herminias freedom  in which respect indeed bower lane was no doubt on a dead level with belgravia or for the matter of that with lambeth palace  but herminia for her part never discovered she was talked about to the pure all things are pure and herminia was dowered with that perfect purity  and though bower lane lay but some few hundred yards off from the carlyle place girls school the social gulf between them yet yawned so wide that good old miss smithwaters from cambridge the headmistress of the school never caught a single echo of the washerwomens gossip  herminias life through those six months was one unclouded honeymoon  on sundays she and alan would go out of town together and stroll across the breezy summit of leith hill or among the brown heather and garrulous pinewoods that perfume the radiating spurs of hind head with their aromatic resins  her love for alan was profound and absorbing while as for alan the more he gazed into the calm depths of that crystal soul the more deeply did he admire it  gradually she was raising him to her own level  it is impossible to mix with a lofty nature and not acquire in time some tincture of its nobler and more generous sentiments  herminia was weaning alan by degrees from the world she was teaching him to see that moral purity and moral earnestness are worth more after all than to dwell with purple hangings in all the tents of iniquity  she was making him understand and sympathize with the motives which led her stoutly on to her final martyrdom which made her submit without a murmur of discontent to her great renunciation  as yet however there was no hint or forecast of actual martyrdom on the contrary her life flowed in all the halo of a honeymoon it was a honeymoon too undisturbed by the petty jars and discomforts of domestic life she saw alan too seldom for either ever to lose the keen sense of fresh delight in the others presence when she met him she thrilled to the delicate fingertips herminia had planned it so of set purpose in her reasoned philosophy of life she had early decided that tis the wear and tear of too close daily intercourse which turns unawares the lover into the husband and she had determined that in her own converse with the man she loved that cause of disillusion should never intrude itself they conserved their romance through all their plighted and united life herminia had afterwards no recollections of alan to look back upon save ideally happy ones  so six months wore away on the memory of those six months herminia was to subsist for half a lifetime at the end of that time alan began to fear that if she did not soon withdraw from the carlyle place school miss smithwaters might begin to ask inconvenient questions herminia ever true to her principles was for stopping on till the bitter end and compelling miss smithwaters to dismiss her from her situation but alan more worldly wise foresaw that such a course must inevitably result in needless annoyance and humiliation for herminia and herminia was now beginning to be so far influenced by alans personality that she yielded the point with reluctance to his masculine judgment it must be always so the man must needs retain for many years to come the personal hegemony he has usurped over the woman and the woman who once accepts him as lover or as husband must give way in the end even in matters of principle to his virile selfassertion she would be less a woman and he less a man were any other result possible deep down in the very roots of the idea of sex we come on that prime antithesisthe male active and aggressive the female sedentary passive and receptive  and even on the broader question experience shows one it is always so in the world we live in  no man or woman can go through life in consistent obedience to any high principlenot even the willing and deliberate martyrs  we must bow to circumstances  herminia had made up her mind beforehand for the crown of martyrdom the one possible guerdon this planet can bestow upon really noble and disinterested action  and she never shrank from any necessary pang incidental to the prophets and martyrs existence  yet even so in a society almost wholly composed of mean and petty souls incapable of comprehending or appreciating any exalted moral standpoint it is practically impossible to live from day to day in accordance with a higher or purer standard  the martyr who should try so to walk without deviation of any sort turning neither to the right nor to the left in the smallest particular must accomplish his martyrdom prematurely on the pettiest sideissues and would never live at all to assert at the stake the great truth which is the lodestar and goal of his existence  so herminia gave way sadly against her will she gave way one morning in early march she absented herself from her place in the classroom without even taking leave of her beloved schoolgirls whom she had tried so hard unobtrusively to train up towards a rational understanding of the universe around them and sat down to write a final letter of farewell to poor straightlaced kindhearted miss smithwaters she sat down to it with a sigh for miss smithwaters though her outlook upon the cosmos was through one narrow chink was a good soul up to her lights and had been really fond and proud of herminia she had rather shown her off indeed as a social trump card to the hesitating parentthis is our second mistress miss barton you know her father perhaps such an excellent man the dean of dunwich and now herminia sat down with a heavy heart thinking to herself what a stab of pain the avowal she had to make would send throbbing through that gentle old breast and how absolutely incapable dear miss smithwaters could be of ever appreciating the conscientious reasons which had led her iphigenialike to her selfimposed sacrifice  but for all that she wrote her letter through delicately sweetly with feminine tact and feminine reticence  she told miss smithwaters frankly enough all it was necessary miss smithwaters should know but she said it with such daintiness that even that conventionalized and hidebound old maid couldnt help feeling and recognizing the purity and nobility of her misguided action  poor child miss smithwaters thought she was mistaken of course sadly and grievously mistaken but then twas her heart that misled her no doubt and miss smithwaters having dim recollections of a faraway time when she herself too possessed some rudimentary fragment of such a central vascular organ fairly cried over the poor girls letter with sympathetic shame and remorse and vexation  miss smithwaters could hardly be expected to understand that if herminia had thought her conduct in the faintest degree wrong or indeed anything but the highest and best for humanity she could never conceivably have allowed even that loving heart of hers to hurry her into it  for herminias devotion to principle was not less but far greater than miss smithwaterss own only as it happened the principles themselves were diametrically opposite  herminia wrote her note with not a few tears for poor miss smithwaterss disappointment that is the worst of living a life morally ahead of your contemporaries what you do with profoundest conviction of its eternal rightness cannot fail to arouse hostile and painful feelings even in the souls of the most rightminded of your friends who still live in bondage to the conventional lies and the conventional injustices it is the good indeed who are most against you still herminia steeled her heart to tell the simple truthhow for the rights sake and humanitys she had made up her mind to eschew the accursed thing and to strike one bold blow for the freedom and unfettered individuality of women she knew in what obloquy her action would involve her she said but she knew too that to do right for rights sake was a duty imposed by nature upon every one of us and that the clearer we could see ahead and the farther in front we could look the more profoundly did that duty shine forth for us for her own part she had never shrunk from doing what she knew to be right for mankind in the end though she felt sure it must lead her to personal misery yet unless one woman were prepared to lead the way no freedom was possible she had found a man with whom she could spend her life in sympathy and united usefulness and with him she had elected to spend it in the way pointed out to us by nature acting on his advice though somewhat against her own judgment she meant to leave england for the present only returning again when she could return with the dear life they had both been instrumental in bringing into the world and to which henceforth her main attention must be directed she signed it your evergrateful and devoted herminia  poor miss smithwaters laid down that astonishing that incredible letter in a perfect whirl of amazement and stupefaction she didnt know what to make of it it seemed to run counter to all her preconceived ideas of moral action that a young girl should venture to think for herself at all about right and wrong was passing strange that she should arrive at original notions upon those abstruse subjects which were not the notions of constituted authority and of the universal slavedrivers and obscurantists generallynotions full of luminousness upon the real relations and duties of our racewas to poor cramped miss smithwaters wellnigh inconceivable that a young girl should prefer freedom to slavery should deem it more moral to retain her divinelyconferred individuality in spite of the world than to yield it up to a man for life in return for the price of her board and lodging should refuse to sell her own body for a comfortable home and the shelter of a namethese things seemed to miss smithwaters with her smallercatechism standards of right and wrong scarcely short of sheer madness yet herminia had so endeared herself to the old ladys soul that on receipt of her letter miss smithwaters went upstairs to her own room with a neuralgic headache and never again in her life referred to her late second mistress in any other terms than as my poor dear sweet misguided herminia  but when it became known next morning in bower lane that the queenlylooking schoolmistress who used to go round among our girls with tickets for concerts and lectures and that had disappeared suddenly with the nicelooking young man who used to come acourting her on sundays and evenings the amazement and surprise of respectable bower lane was simply unbounded  who would have thought the redfaced matrons of the cottages remarked over their quart of bitter the pore thing had it in her  but there its these demure ones as is always the slyest for bower lane could only judge that austere soul by its own vulgar standard as did also belgravia  most low minds indeed imagine absolute hypocrisy must be involved in any striving after goodness and abstract rightdoing on the part of any who happen to disbelieve in their own bloodthirsty deities or their own vile womandegrading and prostituting morality  in the topsyturvy philosophy of bower lane and of belgravia what is usual is right while any conscious striving to be better and nobler than the mass around one is regarded at once as either insane or criminal     viii   they were bound for italy so alan had decided  turning over in his mind the pros and cons of the situation he had wisely determined that herminias confinement had better take place somewhere else than in england  the difficulties and inconveniences which block the way in english lodgings would have been wellnigh insufferable in italy people would only know that an english signora and her husband had taken apartments for a month or two in some solemn old palazzo  to herminia indeed this expatriation at such a moment was in many ways to the last degree distasteful for her own part she hated the merest appearance of concealment and would rather have flaunted the open expression of her supreme moral faith before the eyes of all london  but alan pointed out to her the many practical difficulties amounting almost to impossibilities which beset such a course and herminia though it was hateful to her thus to yield to the immoral prejudices of a false social system gave way at last to alans repeated expression of the necessity for prudent and practical action  she would go with him to italy she said as a proof of her affection and her confidence in his judgment though she still thought the right thing was to stand by her guns fearlessly and fight it out to the bitter end undismayed in england  on the morning of their departure alan called to see his father and explain the situation  he felt some explanation was by this time necessary  as yet no one in london knew anything officially as to his relations with herminia and for herminias sake alan had hitherto kept them perfectly private  but now further reticence was both useless and undesirable he determined to make a clean breast of the whole story to his father  it was early for a barrister to be leaving town for the easter vacation and though alan had chambers of his own in lincolns inn where he lived by himself he was so often in and out of the house in harley street that his absence from london would at once have attracted the parental attention  dr merrick was a model of the closeshaven clearcut london consultant  his shirtfront was as impeccable as his moral character was spotlessin the way that belgravia and harley street still understood spotlessness  he was tall and straight and unbent by age the professional poker which he had swallowed in early life seemed to stand him in good stead after sixty years though his hair had whitened fast and his brow was furrowed with most deliberative wrinkles  so unapproachable he looked that not even his own sons dared speak frankly before him  his very smile was restrained he hardly permitted himself for a moment that weak human relaxation  alan called at harley street immediately after breakfast just a quarter of an hour before the time allotted to his fathers first patient  dr merrick received him in the consultingroom with an interrogative raising of those straight thin eyebrows  the mere look on his face disconcerted alan  with an effort the son began and explained his errand  his father settled himself down into his ample and dignified professional chairold oak roundbackedand with head half turned and hands folded in front of him seemed to diagnose with rapt attention this singular form of psychological malady  when alan paused for a second between his halting sentences and floundered about in search of a more delicate way of gliding over the thin ice his father eyed him closely with those keen gray orbs and after a moments hesitation put in a well continue without the faintest sign of any human emotion  alan thus driven to it admitted awkwardly bit by bit that he was leaving london before the end of term because he had managed to get himself into delicate relations with a lady  dr merrick twirled his thumbs and in a colorless voice enquired without relaxing a muscle of his set face  what sort of lady please  a lady of the ballet  oh no alan cried giving a little start of horror  quite different from that  a real lady  they always are real ladiesfor the most part brought down by untoward circumstances his father responded coldly  as a rule indeed i observe theyre clergymans daughters  this one is alan answered growing hot  in point of fact to prevent your saying anything you might afterwards regret i think id better mention the ladys name  its miss herminia barton the dean of dunwichs daughter  his father drew a long breath  the corners of the clearcut mouth dropped down for a second and the straight thin eyebrows were momentarily elevated  but he gave no other overt sign of dismay or astonishment  that makes a great difference of course he answered after a long pause  she is a lady i admit  and shes been to girton  she has the son replied scarcely knowing how to continue  dr merrick twirled his thumbs once more with outward calm for a minute or two  this was most inconvenient in a professional family  and i understand you to say he went on in a pitiless voice miss bartons state of health is such that you think it advisable to remove her at oncefor her confinement to italy  exactly so alan answered gulping down his discomfort  the father gazed at him long and steadily  well i always knew you were a fool he said at last with paternal candor but i never yet knew you were quite such a fool as this business shows you  youll have to marry the girl now in the end  why the devil couldnt you marry her outright at first instead of seducing her  i did not seduce her alan answered stoutly  no man on earth could ever succeed in seducing that stainless woman  dr merrick stared hard at him without changing his attitude on his old oak chair  was the boy going mad or what the dickens did he mean by it  you have seduced her he said slowly  and she is not stainless if she has allowed you to do so  it is the innocence which survives experience that i value not the innocence which dies with it alan answered gravely  i dont understand these delicate distinctions dr merrick interposed with a polite sneer  i gather from what you said just now that the lady is shortly expecting her confinement and as she isnt married you tell me i naturally infer that somebody must have seduced hereither you or some other man  it was alans turn now to draw himself up very stiffly  i beg your pardon he answered you have no right to speak in such a tone about a lady in miss bartons position  miss barton has conscientious scruples about the marriagetie which in theory i share with her she was unwilling to enter into any relations with me except in terms of perfect freedom  i see the old man went on with provoking calmness  she preferred in fact to be not your wife but your mistress  alan rose indignantly  father he said with just wrath if you insist upon discussing this matter with me in such a spirit i must refuse to stay here  i came to tell you the difficulty in which i find myself and to explain to you my position  if you wont let me tell you in my own way i must leave the house without having laid the facts before you  the father spread his two palms in front of him with demonstrative openness  as you will he answered  my time is much engaged i expect a patient at a quarter past ten  you must be brief please  alan made one more effort  in a very earnest voice he began to expound to his father herminias point of view  dr merrick listened for a second or two in calm impatience  then he consulted his watch  excuse me he said  i have just three minutes  let us get at once to the practical partthe therapeutics of the case omitting its aetiology  youre going to take the young lady to italy  when she gets there will she marry you  and do you expect me to help in providing for you both after this insane adventure  alans face was red as fire  she will not marry me when she gets to italy he answered decisively  and i dont want you to do anything to provide for either of us  the father looked at him with the face he was wont to assume in scanning the appearance of a confirmed monomaniac  she will not marry you he answered slowly and you intend to go on living with her in open concubinage  a lady of birth and position  is that your meaning  father alan cried despairingly herminia would not consent to live with me on any other terms  to her it would be disgraceful shameful a sin a reproach a dereliction of principle  she couldnt go back upon her whole past life  she lives for nothing else but the emancipation of women  and you will aid and abet her in her folly the father asked looking up sharply at him  you will persist in this evil course you will face the world and openly defy morality  i will not counsel the woman i most love and admire to purchase her own ease by proving false to her convictions alan answered stoutly  dr merrick gazed at the watch on his table once more  then he rose and rang the bell  patient here he asked curtly  show him in then at once  and napper if mr alan merrick ever calls again will you tell him im outand your mistress as well and all the young ladies  he turned coldly to alan  i must guard your mother and sisters at least he said in a chilly voice from the contamination of this womans opinions  alan bowed without a word and left the room  he never again saw the face of his father     ix   alan merrick strode from his fathers door that day stung with a burning sense of wrong and injustice  more than ever before in his life he realized to himself the abject hollowness of that conventional code which masquerades in our midst as a system of morals  if he had continued to live single as we hypocritically phrase it and so helped by one unit to spread the festering social canker of prostitution on which as basis like some mediaeval castle on its foul dungeon vaults the entire superstructure of our outwardly decent modern society is reared his father no doubt would have shrugged his shoulders and blinked his cold eyes and commended the wise young man for abstaining from marriage till his means could permit him to keep a wife of his own class in the way she was accustomed to  the wretched victims of that vile system might die unseen and unpitied in some hideous back slum without touching one chord of remorse or regret in dr merricks nature he was steeled against their suffering  or again if alan had sold his virility for gold to some rich heiress of his set like ethel watertonhad bartered his freedom to be her wedded paramour in a loveless marriage his father would not only have gladly acquiesced but would have congratulated his son on his luck and his prudence  yet because alan had chosen rather to form a blameless union of pure affection with a woman who was in every way his moral and mental superior but in despite of the conventional ban of society dr merrick had cast him off as an open reprobate and why  simply because that union was unsanctioned by the exponents of a law they despised and unblessed by the priests of a creed they rejected  alan saw at once it is not the intrinsic moral value of an act such people think about but the light in which it is regarded by a selfish society  unchastity it has been well said is union without love and alan would have none of it  he went back to herminia more than ever convinced of that spotless womans moral superiority to every one else he had ever met with she sat a lonely soul enthroned amid the halo of her own perfect purity  to alan she seemed like one of those early italian madonnas lost in a glory of light that surrounds and half hides them  he reverenced her far too much to tell her all that had happened  how could he wound those sweet ears with his fathers coarse epithets  they took the club train that afternoon to paris  there they slept the night in a fusty hotel near the gare du nord and went on in the morning by the daylight express to switzerland  at lucerne and milan they broke the journey once more  herminia had never yet gone further afield from england than paris and this first glimpse of a wider world was intensely interesting to her  who can help being pleased indeed with that wonderful st gothardthe crystal green reuss shattering itself in white spray into emerald pools by the side of the railway wasen church perched high upon its solitary hilltop the biaschina ravine the cleft rocks of faido the serpentine twists and turns of the ramping line as it mounts or descends its spiral zigzags  dewy alpine pasture tossed masses of landslip white narcissus on the banks snowy peaks in the backgroundall alike were fresh visions of delight to herminia and she drank it all in with the pure childish joy of a poetic nature  it was the switzerland of her dreams reinforced and complemented by unsuspected detail  one trouble alone disturbed her peace of mind upon that delightful journey  alan entered their names at all the hotels where they stopped as mr and mrs alan merrick of london  that deception as herminia held it cost her many qualms of conscience but alan with masculine commonsense was firm upon the point that no other description was practically possible and herminia yielded with a sign to his greater worldly wisdom  she had yet to learn the lesson which sooner or later comes home to all the small minority who care a pin about righteousness that in a world like our own it is impossible for the righteous always to act consistently up to their most sacred convictions  at milan they stopped long enough to snatch a glimpse of the cathedral and to take a hasty walk through the pictured glories of the brera a vague suspicion began to cross herminias mind as she gazed at the girlish madonna of the sposalizio that perhaps she wasnt quite as well adapted to love italy as switzerland nature she understood was art yet a closed book to her if so she would be sorry for alan in whom the artistic sense was largely developed loved his italy dearly and it would be a real cause of regret to her if she fell short in any way of alans expectations moreover at table dhote that evening a slight episode occurred which roused to the full once more poor herminias tender conscience talk had somehow turned on shelleys italian wanderings and a benevolentlooking clergyman opposite with that vacantly wellmeaning smile peculiar to a certain type of country rector was apologizing in what he took to be a broad and generous spirit of divine toleration for the great moral teachers supposed lapses from the normal rule of tight living much the benevolentlooking gentleman opined with beaming spectacles must be forgiven to men of genius their temptations no doubt are far keener than with most of us an eager imaginationa vivid sense of beautyquick readiness to be moved by the sight of physical or moral lovelinessthese were palliations the old clergyman held of much that seemed wrong and contradictory to our eyes in the lives of so many great men and women  at sound of such immoral and unworthy teaching herminias ardent soul rose up in revolt within her  oh no she cried eagerly leaning across the table as she spoke  i cant allow that plea its degrading to shelley and to all true appreciation of the duties of genius  not less but more than most of us is the genius bound to act up with all his might to the highest moral law to be the prophet and interpreter of the highest moral excellence  to whom much is given of him much shall be required  just because the man or woman of genius stands raised on a pedestal so far above the mass have we the right to expect that he or she should point us the way should go before us as pioneer should be more careful of the truth more disdainful of the wrong down to the smallest particular than the ordinary person  there are poor souls born into this world so petty and narrow and wanting in originality that one can only expect them to tread the beaten track be it ever so cruel and wicked and mistaken  but from a shelley or a george eliot we expect greater things and we have a right to expect them  thats why i can never quite forgive george eliotwho knew the truth and found freedom for herself and practised it in her lifefor upholding in her books the conventional lies the conventional prejudices and thats why i can never admire shelley enough who in an age of slavery refused to abjure or to deny his freedom but acted unto death to the full height of his principles  the benevolentlooking clergyman gazed aghast at herminia  then he turned slowly to alan  your wife he said in a mild and terrified voice is a very advanced lady  herminia longed to blurt out the whole simple truth  i am not his wife  i am not and could never be wife or slave to any man  this is a very dear friend and he and i are travelling as friends together  but a warning glance from alan made her hold her peace with difficulty and acquiesce as best she might in the virtual deception  still the incident went to her heart and made her more anxious than ever to declare her convictions and her practical obedience to them openly before the world  she remembered oh so well one of her fathers sermons that had vividly impressed her in the dear old days at dunwich cathedral  it was preached upon the text come ye out and be ye separate  from milan they went on direct to florence  alan had decided to take rooms for the summer at perugia and there to see herminia safely through her maternal troubles  he loved perugia he said it was cool and highperched and then too it was such a capital place for sketching  besides he was anxious to complete his studies of the early umbrian painters  but they must have just one week at florence together before they went up among the hills florence was the place for a beginner to find out what italian art was aiming at  you got it there in its full logical developmentevery phase step by step in organic unity while elsewhere you saw but stages and jumps and results interrupted here and there by disturbing lacunae  so at florence they stopped for a week en route and herminia first learnt what florentine art proposed to itself  ah that week in florence  what a dream of delight  twas pure gold to herminia  how could it well be otherwise  it seemed to her afterwards like the last flicker of joy in a doomed life before its light went out and left her forever in utter darkness to be sure a week is a terribly cramped and hurried time in which to view florence the beloved city whose ineffable glories need at least one whole winter adequately to grasp them  but failing a winter a week with the gods made herminia happy  she carried away but a confused phantasmagoria it is true of the soaring tower of the palazzo vecchio pointing straight with its slender shaft to heaven of the swelling dome and huge ribs of the cathedral seen vast from the terrace in front of san miniato of the endless madonnas and the deathless saints niched in golden tabernacles at the uffizi and the pitti of the tender grace of fra angelico at san marco of the infinite wealth and astounding variety of donatellos marble in the spacious courts of the cool bargello but her window at the hotel looked straight as it could look down the humming calzaioli to the pierced and encrusted front of giottos campanile with the cupola of san lorenzo in the middle distance and the facade of fiesole standing out deepblue against the dull red glare of evening in the background  if that were not enough to sate and enchant herminia she would indeed have been difficult  and with alan by her side every joy was doubled  she had never before known what it was to have her lover continuously with her  and his aid in those long corridors where bambinos smiled down at her with childish lips helped her wondrously to understand in so short a time what they sought to convey to her  alan was steeped in italy he knew and entered into the spirit of tuscan art and now for the first time herminia found herself face to face with a thoroughly new subject in which alan could be her teacher from the very beginning as most men are teachers to the women who depend upon them  this sense of support and restfulness and clinging was fresh and delightful to her  it is a womans ancestral part to look up to the man she is happiest in doing it and must long remain so and herminia was not sorry to find herself in this so much a woman  she thought it delicious to roam through the long halls of some great gallery with alan and let him point out to her the pictures he loved best explain their peculiar merits and show the subtle relation in which they stood to the pictures that went before them and the pictures that came after them as well as to the other work of the same master or his contemporaries  it was even no small joy to her to find that he knew so much more about art and its message than she did that she could look up to his judgment confide in his opinion see the truth of his criticism profit much by his instruction  so well did she use those seven short days indeed that she came to florence with fra angelico filippo lippi botticelli mere names and she went away from it feeling that she had made them real friends and possessions for a lifetime  so the hours whirled fast in those enchanted halls and herminias soul was enriched by new tastes and new interests  o towers of fretted stone  o jasper and porphyry  her very state of health made her more susceptible than usual to fresh impressions and drew alan at the same time every day into closer union with her  for was not the young life now quickening within her half his and half hers and did it not seem to make the father by reflex nearer and dearer to her  surely the child that was nurtured unborn on those marble colonnades and those placid saint catherines must draw in with each pulse of its antenatal nutriment some tincture of beauty of freedom of culture  so herminia thought to herself as she lay awake at night and looked out of the window from the curtains of her bed at the boundless dome and the tall campanile gleaming white in the moonlight  so we have each of us thoughtespecially the mothers in israel among usabout the unborn babe that hastens along to its birth with such a radiant halo of the possible future ever gilding and glorifying its unseen forehead     x   all happy times must end and the happier the sooner  at one short weeks close they hurried on to perugia  and how full alan had been of perugia beforehand  he loved every stone of the town every shadow of the hillsides he told herminia at florence and herminia started on her way accordingly well prepared to fall quite as madly in love with the umbrian capital as alan himself had done  the railway journey indeed seemed extremely pretty  what a march of sweet pictures  they mounted with creaking wheels the slow ascent up the picturesque glen where the arno runs deep to the white towers of arezzo then cortona throned in state on its lonely hilltop and girt by its gigantic etruscan walls next the low bank the lucid green water the oliveclad slopes of reedy thrasymene last of all the sere hills and citycapped heights of their goal perugia  for its names sake alone herminia was prepared to admire the antique umbrian capital  and alan loved it so much and was so determined she ought to love it too that she was ready to be pleased with everything in it  until she arrived thereand then oh poor heart what a grievous disappointment  it was late april weather when they reached the station at the foot of that high hill where augusta perusia sits lording it on her throne over the wedded valleys of the tiber and the clitumnus  tramontana was blowing no rain had fallen for weeks the slopes of the lower apennines ever dry and dusty shone still drier and dustier than alan had yet beheld them  herminia glanced up at the long white road thick in deep gray powder that led by endless zigzags along the dreary slope to the long white town on the shadeless hilltop  at first sight alone perugia was a startling disillusion to herminia  she didnt yet know how bitterly she was doomed hereafter to hate every dreary dirty street in it  but she knew at the first blush that the perugia she had imagined and pictured to herself didnt really exist and had never existed  she had figured in her own mind a beautiful breezy town high set on a peaked hill in fresh and mossy country  she had envisaged the mountains to her soul as clad with shady woods and strewn with huge boulders under whose umbrageous shelter bloomed waving masses of the pretty pale blue apennine anemones she saw sold in big bunches at the street corners in florence  she had imagined in short that umbria was a wilder italian wales as fresh as green as sweetscented as fountainfed  and she knew pretty well whence she had derived that strange and utterly false conception  she had fancied perugia as one of those mountain villages described by macaulay the sort of hilltop stronghold    that hid by beech and pine   like an eagles nest hangs on the crest   of purple apennine   instead of that what manner of land did she see actually before her  dry and shadeless hillsides tilled with obtrusive tilth to their topmost summit ploughed fields and hoary olivegroves silvering to the wind in interminable terraces long suburbs unlovely in their gaunt bare squalor stretching like huge arms of some colossal cuttlefish over the spurs and shoulders of that desecrated mountain  no woods no moss no coolness no greenery all nature toned down to one monotonous grayness  and this dreary desert was indeed the place where her baby must be born the baby predestined to regenerate humanity  oh why did they ever leave that enchanted florence  meanwhile alan had got together the luggage and engaged a ramshackle perugian cab for the public vehicles of perugia are perhaps as a class the most precarious and incoherent known to science  however the luggage was bundled on to the top by our ladys grace without dissolution of continuity the leanlimbed horses were induced by explosive volleys of sound tuscan oaths to make a feeble and spasmodic effort and bit by bit the sad little cavalcade began slowly to ascend the interminable hill that rises by long loops to the platform of the prefettura  that drive was the gloomiest herminia had ever yet taken  was it the natural fastidiousness of her condition she wondered or was it really the dirt and foul smells of the place that made her sicken at first sight of the windswept purlieus  perhaps a little of both for in dusty weather perugia is the most endless town to get out of in italy and its capacity for the production of unpleasant odors is unequalled no doubt from the alps to calabria as they reached the bare white platform at the entry to the upper town where pope pauls grim fortress once frowned to overawe the audacious souls of the libertyloving umbrians she turned mute eyes to alan for sympathy  and then for the first time the terrible truth broke over her that alan wasnt in the least disappointed or disgusted he knew it all before he was accustomed to it and liked it  as for alan he misinterpreted her glance indeed and answered with that sort of proprietary pride we all of us assume towards a place we love and are showing off to a newcomer  yes i thought youd like this view dearest isnt it wonderful wonderful  thats assisi over yonder that strange white town that clings by its eyelashes to the sloping hillside and those are the snowclad heights of the gran sasso beyond and thats montefalco to the extreme right where the sunset gleam just catches the hilltop  his words struck dumb horror into herminias soul  poor child how she shrank at it  it was clear then instead of being shocked and disgusted alan positively admired this human sahara  with an effort she gulped down her tears and her sighs and pretended to look with interest in the directions he pointed  she could see nothing in it all but dry hillsides crowned with still drier towns unimagined stretches of sultry suburb devouring wastes of rubbish and foul immemorial kitchenmiddens  and the very fact that for alans sake she couldnt bear to say soseeing how pleased and proud he was of perugia as if it had been built from his own designmade the bitterness of her disappointment more difficult to endure  she would have given anything at that moment for an ounce of human sympathy  she had to learn in time to do without it  they spent that night at the comfortable hotel perhaps the best in italy  next morning they were to go hunting for apartments in the town where alan knew of a suite that would exactly suit them after dinner in the twilight filled with his artistic joy at being back in perugia his beloved perugia he took herminia out for a stroll with a light wrap round her head on the terrace of the prefettura  the air blew fresh and cool now with a certain mountain sharpness for as alan assured her with pride they stood seventeen hundred feet above the level of the mediterranean  the moon had risen the sunset glow had not yet died off the slopes of the assisi hillsides  it streamed through the perforated belfry of san domenico it steeped in rosecolor the slender and turreted shaft of san pietro perugias pennon the arrowhead of umbria it gilded the gaunt houses that jut out upon the spine of the borgo hill into the valley of the tiber  beyond rose shadowy apennines on whose aerial flanks towns and villages shone out clear in the mellow moonlight  far away on their peaks faint specks of twinkling fire marked indistinguishable sites of high hilltop castles  alan turned to her proudly  well what do you think of that he asked with truly personal interest  herminia could only gasp out in a half reluctant way its a beautiful view alan  beautiful beautiful beautiful  but she felt conscious to herself it owed its beauty in the main to the fact that the twilight obscured so much of it  tomorrow morning the bare hills would stand out once more in all their pristine bareness the white roads would shine forth as white and dusty as ever the obtrusive rubbish heaps would press themselves at every turn upon eye and nostril  she hated the place to say the truth it was a terror to her to think she had to stop so long in it  most famous towns in fact need to be twice seen the first time briefly to face the inevitable disappointment to our expectations the second time at leisure to reconstruct and appraise the surviving reality  imagination so easily beggars performance rome cairo the nile are obvious examples the grand exceptions are venice and florencein a lesser degree bruges munich pisa as for umbria tis a poor thing our own devon snaps her fingers at it  moreover to say the truth herminia was too fresh to italy to appreciate the smaller or secondrate towns at their real value even northerners love florence and venice at first sight those take their hearts by storm but perugia siena orvieto are an acquired taste like olives and caviare and it takes time to acquire it  alan had not made due allowance for this psychological truth of the northern natures  a celt in essence thoroughly italianate himself and with a deep love for the picturesque which often makes men insensible to dirt and discomfort he expected to italianize herminia too rapidly  herminia on the other hand belonged more strictly to the intellectual and somewhat inartistic english type  the picturesque alone did not suffice for her cleanliness and fresh air were far dearer to her soul than the quaintest street corners the oddest old archways she pined in perugia for a green english hillside  the time too was unfortunate after no rain for weeks for rainlessness besides doubling the native stock of dust brings out to the full the ancestral etruscan odors of perugia  so when next morning herminia found herself installed in a dingy flat in a morose palazzo in the main street of the city she was glad that alan insisted on going out alone to make needful purchases of groceries and provisions because it gave her a chance of flinging herself on her bed in a perfect agony of distress and disappointment and having a good cry all alone at the aspect of the home where she was to pass so many eventful weeks of her existence  dusty gusty perugia  o baby to be born for the freeing of woman was it here was it here you must draw your first breath in an air polluted by the vices of centuries     xi   somewhat later in the day they went out for a stroll through the town together  to herminias great relief alan never even noticed she had been crying  manlike he was absorbed in his own delight she would have felt herself a traitor if alan had discovered it  which way shall we go she asked listlessly with a glance to right and left as they passed beneath the sombre tuscan gate of their palazzo  and alan answered smiling why what does it matter  which way you like  every way is a picture  and so it was herminia herself was fain to admit in a pure painters sense that didnt at all attract her  lines grouped themselves against the sky in infinite diversity  whichever way they turned quaint old walls met their eyes and tumbledown churches and mouldering towers and mediaeval palazzi with carved doorways or rich loggias  but whichever way they turned dusty roads too confronted them illimitable stretches of gloomy suburb unwholesome airs sickening sights and sounds and perfumes  narrow streets swept darkling under pointed archways that framed distant vistas of spire or campanile silhouetted against the solid blue sky of italy  the crystal hardness of that sapphire firmament repelled herminia  they passed beneath the triumphal arch of augustus with its etruscan masonwork its roman decorations and round the antique walls aglow with tufted gillyflowers to the bare piazza darmi  a cattle fair was going on there and alan pointed with pleasure to the curious fact that the oxen were all creamcoloredthe famous white steers of clitumnus  herminia knew her virgil as well as alan himself and murmured half aloud the sonorous hexameter romanos ad templa deum duxere triumphos but somehow the knowledge that these were indeed the milkwhite bullocks of clitumnus failed amid so much dust to arouse her enthusiasm  she would have been better pleased just then with a yellow english primrose  they clambered down the terraced ravines sometimes a day or two later to arid banks by a dry torrents bed where italian primroses really grew interspersed with tall grapehyacinths and scented violets and glossy cleft leaves of winter aconite  but even the primroses were not the same thing to herminia as those she used to gather on the dewy slopes of the redlands they were so dry and dustgrimed and the path by the torrents side was so distasteful and unsavory  bare white boughs of twisted figtrees depressed her  besides these hills were steep and herminia felt the climbing  nothing in city or suburbs attracted her soul  etruscan volumnii each lolling in white travertine on the sculptured lid of his own sarcophagus urn and all duly ranged in the twilight of their tomb at their spectral banquet stirred her heart but feebly st francis santa chiara fell flat on her english fancy  but as for alan he revelled all day long in his native element  he sketched every morning among the huddled strangled lanes sketched churches and monasteries and portals of palazzi sketched mountains clearcut in that pellucid air till herminia wondered how he could sit so long in the broiling sun or keen wind on those bare hillsides or on broken brick parapets in those noisome byways  but your born sketcher is oblivious of all on earth save his chosen art and alan was essentially a painter in fibre diverted by pure circumstance into a chancery practice  the very pictures in the gallery failed to interest herminia she knew not why  alan couldnt rouse her to enthusiasm over his beloved buonfigli  those naive flaxenhaired angels with sweetly parted lips and baskets of red roses in their delicate hands own sisters though they were to the girlish lippis she had so admired at florence moved her heart but faintly  try as she might to like them she responded to nothing perugian in any way  at the end of a week or two however alan began to complain of constant headache  he was looking very well but grew uneasy and restless  herminia advised him to give up sketching for a while those small streets were so close and he promised to yield to her wishes in the matter  yet he grew worse next day so that herminia much alarmed called in an italian doctor  perugia boasted no english one  the italian felt his pulse and listened to his symptoms  the signore came here from florence he asked  from florence herminia assented with a sudden sinking  the doctor protruded his lower lip  this is typhoid fever he said after a pause  a very bad type  it has been assuming such a form this winter at florence  he spoke the plain truth  twentyone days before in his bedroom at the hotel in florence alan had drunk a single glass of water from the polluted springs that supply in part the tuscan metropolis for twentyone days those victorious microbes had brooded in silence in his poisoned arteries  at the end of that time they swarmed and declared themselves  he was ill with an aggravated form of the most deadly disease that still stalks unchecked through unsanitated europe  herminias alarm was painful  alan grew rapidly worse  in two days he was so ill that she thought it her duty to telegraph at once to dr merrick in london  alans life in danger  serious attack of florentine typhoid  italian doctor despairs of his life may not last till tomorrowherminia barton  later on in the day came a telegram in reply it was addressed to alan  am on my way out by through train to attend you  but as a matter of duty marry the girl at once and legitimatize your child while the chance remains to you  it was kindly meant in its way  it was a message of love of forgiveness of generosity such as herminia would hardly have expected from so stern a man as alan had always represented his father to be to her  but at moments of unexpected danger angry feelings between father and son are often forgotten and blood unexpectedly proves itself thicker than water  yet even so herminia couldnt bear to show the telegram to alan  she feared lest in this extremity his mind weakened by disease he might wish to take his fathers advice and prove untrue to their common principles  in that case woman that she was she hardly knew how she could resist what might be only too probably his dying wishes still she nerved herself for this trial of faith and went through with it bravely  alan though sinking was still conscious at moments in one such interval with an effort to be calm she showed him his fathers telegram  tears rose into his eyes  i didnt expect him to come he said  this is all very good of him  then after a moment he added would you wish me in this extremity hermy to do as he advises  herminia bent over him with fierce tears on her eyelids  o alan darling she cried you mustnt die  you mustnt leave me  what could i do without you oh my darling my darling  but dont think of me now  dont think of the dear baby  i couldnt bear to disturb you even by showing you the telegram  for your sake alan ill be calmill be calm  but oh not for worldsnot for worldseven so would i turn my back on the principles we would both risk our lives for  alan smiled a faint smile  hermy he said slowly i love you all the more for it  youre as brave as a lion  oh how much i have learned from you  all that night and next day herminia watched by his bedside  now and again he was conscious  but for the most part he lay still in a comatose condition with eyes half closed the whites showing through the lids neither moving nor speaking  all the time he grew worse steadily  as she sat by his bedside herminia began to realize the utter loneliness of her position  that alan might die was the one element in the situation she had never even dreamt of no wife could love her husband with more perfect devotion than herminia loved alan  she hung upon every breath with unspeakable suspense and unutterable affection  but the italian doctor held out little hope of a rally  herminia sat there fixed to the spot a white marble statue  late next evening dr merrick reached perugia  he drove straight from the station to the dingy flat in the morose palazzo  at the door of his sons room herminia met him clad from head to foot in white as she had sat by the bedside  tears blinded her eyes her face was wan her mien terribly haggard  and my son the doctor asked with a hushed breath of terror  he died half an hour ago herminia gasped out with an effort  but he married you before he died the father cried in a tone of profound emotion  he did justice to his childhe repaired his evil  he did not herminia answered in a scarcely audible voice  he was stanch to the end to his lifelong principles  why not the father asked staggering  did he see my telegram  yes herminia answered numb with grief yet too proud to prevaricate  but i advised him to stand firm and he abode by my decision  the father waved her aside with his hands imperiously  then i have done with you he exclaimed  i am sorry to seem harsh to you at such a moment  but it is your own doing  you leave me no choice  you have no right any longer in my sons apartments     xii   no position in life is more terrible to face than that of the widowed mother left alone in the world with her unborn baby  when the child is her first onewhen besides the natural horror and agony of the situation she has also to confront the unknown dangers of that new and dreaded experienceher plight is still more pitiable  but when the widowed mother is one who has never been a wifewhen in addition to all these pangs of bereavement and fear she has further to face the contempt and hostility of a sneering world as herminia had to face itthen indeed her lot becomes wellnigh insupportable it is almost more than human nature can bear up against  so herminia found it  she might have died of grief and loneliness then and there had it not been for the sudden and unexpected rousing of her spirit of opposition by dr merricks words  that cruel speech gave her the will and the power to live  it saved her from madness  she drew herself up at once with an injured womans pride and facing her dead alans father with a quick access of energy  you are wrong she said stilling her heart with one hand these rooms are minemy own not dear alans  i engaged them myself for my own use and in my own name as herminia barton you can stay here if you wish  i will not imitate your cruelty by refusing you access to them but if you remain here you must treat me at least with the respect that belongs to my great sorrow and with the courtesy due to an english lady  her words half cowed him  he subsided at once  in silence he stepped over to his dead sons bedside  mechanically almost unconsciously herminia went on with the needful preparations for alans funeral  her grief was so intense that she bore up as if stunned she did what was expected of her without thinking or feeling it  dr merrick stopped on at perugia till his son was buried  he was frigidly polite meanwhile to herminia  deeply as he differed from her the dignity and pride with which she had answered his first insult impressed him with a certain sense of respect for her character and made him feel at least he could not be rude to her with impunity  he remained at the hotel and superintended the arrangements for his sons funeral  as soon as that was over and herminia had seen the coffin lowered into the grave of all her hopes save one she returned to her rooms alonemore utterly alone than she had ever imagined any human being could feel in a cityful of fellowcreatures  she must shape her path now for herself without alans aid without alans advice  and her bitterest enemies in life she felt sure would henceforth be those of alans household  yet lonely as she was she determined from the first moment no course was left open for her save to remain at perugia  she couldnt go away so soon from the spot where alan was laidfrom all that remained to her now of alan  except his unborn babythe baby that was half his half hersthe baby predestined to regenerate humanity  oh how she longed to fondle it  every arrangement had been made in perugia for the babys advent she would stand by those arrangements still in her shuttered room partly because she couldnt tear herself away from alans grave partly because she had no heart left to make the necessary arrangements elsewhere but partly also because she wished alans baby to be born near alans side where she could present it after birth at its fathers last restingplace  it was a fanciful wish she knew based upon ideas she had long since discarded but these ancestral sentiments echo long in our hearts they die hard with us all and most hard with women  she would stop on at perugia and die in giving birth to alans baby or else live to be father and mother in one to it  so she stopped and waited waited in tremulous fear half longing for death half eager not to leave that sacred baby an orphan  it would be alans baby and might grow in time to be the worlds true savior  for now that alan was dead no hope on earth seemed too great to cherish for alans child within her  and oh that it might be a girl to take up the task she herself had failed in  the day after the funeral dr merrick called in for the last time at her lodgings  he brought in his hand a legallooking paper which he had found in searching among alans effects for he had carried them off to his hotel leaving not even a memento of her illstarred love to herminia  this may interest you he said dryly  you will see at once it is in my sons handwriting  herminia glanced over it with a burning face  it was a will in her favor leaving absolutely everything of which he died possessed to my beloved friend herminia barton  herminia had hardly the means to keep herself alive till her baby was born but in those first fierce hours of ineffable bereavement what question of money could interest her in any way  she stared at it stupefied  it only pleased her to think alan had not forgotten her  the sordid moneyed class of england will haggle over bequests and settlements and dowries on their bridal eve or by the coffins of their dead  herminia had no such ignoble possibilities  how could he speak of it in her presence at a moment like this  how obtrude such themes on her august sorrow  this was drawn up dr merrick went on in his austere voice the very day before my late son left london  but of course you will have observed it was never executed  and in point of fact herminia now listlessly noted that it lacked alans signature  that makes it i need hardly say of no legal value the father went on with frigid calm  i bring it round merely to show you that my son intended to act honorably towards you  as things stand of course he has died intestate and his property such as it is will follow the ordinary law of succession  for your sake i am sorry it should be so i could have wished it otherwise however i need not remind youhe picked his phrases carefully with icy precisionthat under circumstances like these neither you nor your child have any claim whatsoever upon my sons estate  nor have i any right over it  stillhe paused for a second and that incisive mouth strove to grow gentle while herminia hot with shame confronted him helplesslyi sympathize with your position and do not forget it was alan who brought you here  therefore as an act of courtesy to a lady in whom he was personally interested    if a slight gift of fifty pounds would be of immediate service to you in your present situation why i think with the approbation of his brothers and sisters who of course inherit  herminia turned upon him like a wounded creature  she thanked the blind caprice which governs the universe that it gave her strength at that moment to bear up under his insult  with one angry hand she waved dead alans father inexorably to the door  go she said simply  how dare you how dare you  leave my rooms this instant  dr merrick still irresolute and anxious in his way to do what he thought was just drew a roll of italian bank notes from his waistcoat pocket and laid them on the table  you may find these useful he said as he retreated awkwardly  herminia turned upon him with the just wrath of a great nature outraged  take them up she cried fiercely  dont pollute my table  then as often happens to all of us in moments of deep emotion a scripture phrase long hallowed by childish familiarity rose spontaneous to her lips  take them up she cried again thy money perish with thee  dr merrick took them up and slank noiselessly from the room murmuring as he went some inarticulate words to the effect that he had only desired to serve her  as soon as he was gone herminias nerve gave way  she flung herself into a chair and sobbed long and violently  it was no time for her of course to think about money  sore pressed as she was she had just enough left to see her safely through her confinement  alan had given her a few pounds for housekeeping when they first got into the rooms and those she kept they were hers she had not the slightest impulse to restore them to his family  all he left was hers too by natural justice and she knew it  he had drawn up his will attestation clause and all with even the very date inserted in pencil the day before they quitted london together but finding no friends at the club to witness it he had put off executing it and so had left herminia entirely to her own resources  in the delirium of his fever the subject never occurred to him  but no doubt existed as to the nature of his last wishes and if herminia herself had been placed in a similar position to that of the merrick family she would have scorned to take so mean an advantage of the mere legal omission  by this time of course the story of her fate had got across to england and was being read and retold by each man or woman after his or her own fashion  the papers mentioned it as seen through the optic lens of the society journalist with what strange refraction  most of them descried in poor herminias tragedy nothing but material for a smile a sneer or an innuendo  the dean himself wrote to her a piteous paternal note which bowed her down more than ever in her abyss of sorrow  he wrote as a dean mustgray hairs brought down with sorrow to the grave infinite mercy of heaven still room for repentance but oh to keep away from her pure young sisters  herminia answered with dignity but with profound emotion  she knew her father too well not to sympathize greatly with his natural view of so fatal an episode  so she stopped on alone for her dark hour in perugia  she stopped on untended by any save unknown italians whose tongue she hardly spoke and uncheered by a friendly voice at the deepest moment of trouble in a womans history  often for hours together she sat alone in the cathedral gazing up at a certain mildfeatured madonna enshrined above an altar  the unwedded widow seemed to gain some comfort from the pitying face of the maiden mother every day while still she could she walked out along the shadeless suburban road to alans grave in the parched and crowded cemetery  women trudging along with crammed creels on their backs turned round to stare at her  when she could no longer walk she sat at her window towards san luca and gazed at it  there lay the only friend she possessed in perugia perhaps in the universe  the dreaded day arrived at last and her strong constitution enabled herminia to live through it  her baby was born a beautiful little girl soft delicate wonderful with alans blue eyes and its mothers complexion  those rosy feet saved herminia as she clasped them in her handstiny feet tender feetshe felt she had now something left to live forher baby alans baby the baby with a future the baby that was destined to regenerate humanity  so warm  so small  alans soul and her own mysteriously blended  still even so she couldnt find it in her heart to give any joyous name to dead alans child  dolores she called it at alans grave  in sorrow had she borne it its true name was dolores     xiii   it was a changed london to which herminia returned  she was homeless penniless friendless  above all she was declassee the world that had known her now knew her no more  women who had smothered her with their judas kisses passed her by in their victorias with a stony stare  even men pretended to be looking the other way or crossed the street to avoid the necessity for recognizing her  so awkward to be mixed up with such a scandal she hardly knew as yet herself how much her world was changed indeed for had she not come back to it the mother of an illegitimate daughter  but she began to suspect it the very first day when she arrived at charing cross clad in a plain black dress with her baby at her bosom  her first task was to find rooms her next to find a livelihood  even the first involved no small relapse from the purity of her principles  after long hours of vain hunting she found at last she could only get lodgings for herself and alans child by telling a virtual lie against which her soul revolted  she was forced to describe herself as mrs barton she must allow her landlady to suppose she was really a widow  woe unto you scribes and hypocrites in all christian london miss barton and her baby could never have found a respectable room in which to lay their heads  so she yielded to the inevitable and took two tiny attics in a small street off the edgware road at a moderate rental  to live alone in a cottage as of yore would have been impossible now she had a baby of her own to tend besides earning her livelihood she fell back regretfully on the lesser evil of lodgings  to earn her livelihood was a hard task though herminias indomitable energy rode down all obstacles  teaching of course was now quite out of the question no english parent could intrust the education of his daughters to the hands of a woman who has dared and suffered much for conscience sake in the cause of freedom for herself and her sisters  but even before herminia went away to perugia she had acquired some small journalistic connection and now in her hour of need she found not a few of the journalistic leaders by no means unwilling to sympathize and fraternize with her  to be sure they didnt ask the free woman to their homes nor invite her to meet their own womeneven an enlightened journalist must draw a line somewhere in the matter of society but they understood and appreciated the sincerity of her motives and did what they could to find employment and salary for her  herminia was an honest and conscientious worker she knew much about many things and nature had gifted her with the instinctive power of writing clearly and unaffectedly the english language  so she got on with editors  who could resist indeed the pathetic charm of that girlish figure simply clad in unobtrusive black and sanctified in every feature of the shrinking face by the beauty of sorrow  not the men who stand at the head of the one english profession which more than all others has escaped the leprous taint of that national moral blight that calls itself respectability  in a slow and tentative way then herminia crept back into unrecognized recognition  it was all she needed  companionship she liked she hated society  that mart was odious to her where women barter their bodies for a title a carriage a place at the head of some rich mans table  bohemia sufficed her  her terrible widowhood too was rendered less terrible to her by the care of her little one  babbling lips pattering feet made heaven in her attic  every good woman is by nature a mother and finds best in maternity her social and moral salvation  she shall be saved in childbearing  herminia was far removed indeed from that blatant and decadent sect of advanced women who talk as though motherhood were a disgrace and a burden instead of being as it is the full realization of womans faculties the natural outlet for womans wealth of emotion  she knew that to be a mother is the best privilege of her sex a privilege of which unholy manmade institutions now conspire to deprive half the finest and noblest women in our civilized communities  widowed as she was she still pitied the unhappy beings doomed to the cramped life and dwarfed heart of the old maid pitied them as sincerely as she despised those unhealthy souls who would make of celibacy wedded or unwedded a sort of antinatural religion for women  alans death however had left herminias ship rudderless  her mission had failed  that she acknowledged herself  she lived now for dolores the child to whom she had given the noble birthright of liberty was destined from her cradle to the apostolate of women  alone of her sex she would start in life emancipated  while others must say with a great sum obtained i this freedom dolores could answer with paul but i was free born  that was no mean heritage  gradually herminia got work to her mind work enough to support her in the modest way that sufficed her small wants for herself and her baby  in london given time enough you can live down anything perhaps even the unspeakable sin of having struck a righteous blow in the interest of women  and day by day as months and years went on herminia felt she was living down the disgrace of having obeyed an enlightened conscience  she even found friends  dear old miss smithwaters used to creep round by night like nicodemusrespectability would not have allowed her to perform that christian act in open daylightand sit for an hour or two with her dear misguided herminia  miss smithwaters prayed nightly for herminias conversion yet not without an uncomfortable suspicion after all that herminia had very little indeed to be converted from other people also got to know her by degrees an editors wife a kind literary hostess some socialistic ladies who liked to be advanced a friendly family or two of the bohemian literary or artistic pattern  among them herminia learned to be as happy in time as she could ever again be now she had lost her alan  she was mrs barton to them all that lie she found it practically impossible to fight against  even the bohemians refused to let their children ask after miss bartons baby  so wrapt in vile falsehoods and conventions are we  so far have we travelled from the pristine realities of truth and purity  we lie to our childrenin the interests of morality  after a time in the intervals between doing her journalistic work and nursing alans baby herminia found leisure to write a novel it was seriously meant of course but still it was a novel  that is every womans native idea of literature  it reflects the relatively larger part which the social life plays in the existence of women  if a man tells you he wants to write a book nine times out of ten he means a treatise or argument on some subject that interests him  even the men who take in the end to writing novels have generally begun with other aims and other aspirations and have only fallen back upon the art of fiction in the last resort as a means of livelihood  but when a woman tells you she wants to write a book nine times out of ten she means she wants to write a novel  for that task nature has most often endowed her richly her quicker intuitions her keener interest in social life her deeper insight into the passing play of emotions and of motives enable her to paint well the complex interrelations of everyday existence  so herminia like the rest wrote her own pet novel  by the time her baby was eighteen months old she had finished it it was blankly pessimistic of course  blank pessimism is the one creed possible for all save fools  to hold any other is to curl yourself up selfishly in your own easy chair and say to your soul o soul eat and drink o soul make merry  carouse thy fill ignore the maimed lives the stricken heads and seared hearts the reddened fangs and ravening claws of nature all round thee pessimism is sympathy  optimism is selfishness  the optimist folds his smug hands on his ample knees and murmurs contentedly the lord has willed it there must always be rich and poor nature has after all her great law of compensation  the pessimist knows well selfdeception like that is either a fraud or a blind and recognizing the seething mass of misery at his doors gives what he canhis pity or where possible his faint aid in redressing the crying inequalities and injustices of man or nature  all honest art is therefore of necessity pessimistic herminias romance was something more than that it was the despairing heartcry of a soul in revolt it embodied the experiences and beliefs and sentiments of a martyred woman it enclosed a lofty ethical purpose she wrote it with fiery energy for her babys sake on waste scraps of paper at stray moments snatched from endless other engagements and as soon as it was finished she sent it in fear and trembling to a publisher  she had chosen her man well  he was a thinker himself and he sympathized with thinkers  though doubtful as to the venture he took all the risk himself with that generosity one so often sees in the bestabused of professions  in three or four weeks time a womans world came out and herminia waited in breathless anxiety for the verdict of the reviewers  for nearly a month she waited in vain  then one friday as she was returning by underground railway from the strand to edgeware road with dolores in her arms her eye fell as she passed upon the displaybill of the spectator  sixpence was a great deal of money to herminia but bang it went recklessly when she saw among the contents an article headed a very advanced womans novel she felt sure it must be hers and she was not mistaken breathlessly she ran over that first estimate of her work it was with no little elation that she laid down the number  not that the critique was by any means at all favorable  how could herminia expect it in such a quarter  but the spectator is at least conspicuously fair though it remains in other ways an interesting and ivyclad mediaeval relic  let us begin by admitting said the spectatorial scribe that miss montagues book she had published it under a pseudonym is a work of genius  much as we dislike its whole tone and still more its conclusions the gleam of pure genius shines forth undeniable on every page of it  whoever takes it up must read on against his will till he has finished the last line of this terrible tragedy a hateful fascination seems to hold and compel him  its very purity makes it dangerous  the book is mistaken the book is poisonous the book is morbid the book is calculated to do irremediable mischief but in spite of all that the book is a book of undeniable and sadly misplaced genius  if he had said no more herminia would have been amply satisfied to be called morbid by the spectator is a sufficient proof that you have hit at least the right tack in morals  and to be accused of genius as well was indeed a triumph  no wonder herminia went home to her lonely attic that night justifiably elated  she fancied after this her book must make a hit  it might be blamed and reviled but at any rate it was now safe from the ignominy of oblivion  alas how little she knew of the mysteries of the bookmarket as little as all the rest of us day after day from that afternoon forth she watched in vain for succeeding notices not a single other paper in england reviewed her at the libraries her romance was never so much as asked for and the reason for these phenomena is not far to seek by those who know the ways of the british public for her novel was earnestly and sincerely written it breathed a moral air therefore it was voted dull therefore nobody cared for it the spectator had noticed it because of its manifest earnestness and sincerity for though the spectator is always on the side of the lie and the wrong it is earnest and sincere and has a genuine sympathy for earnestness and sincerity even on the side of truth and righteousness nobody else even looked at it people said to themselves this book seems to be a book with a teaching not thoroughly banal like the novelswithapurpose after which we flock so well give it a wide berth  and they shunned it accordingly  that was the end of herminia bartons literary aspirations  she had given the people of her best and the people rejected it  now she gave them of her most mediocre the nearest to their own level of thought and feeling to which her hand could reduce itself  and the people accepted it  the rest of her life was hackwork by that she could at least earn a living for dolores  her antigone for the use of ladies schools still holds its own at girton and somerville     xiv   i do not propose to dwell at any length upon the next ten or twelve years of herminia bartons life  an episode or two must suffice and those few told briefly  she saw nothing of her family  relations had long been strained between them now they were ruptured  to the rest of the bartons she was even as one dead the sister and daughters name was never pronounced among them  but once when little dolores was about five years old herminia happened to pass a church door in marylebone where a redlettered placard announced in bold type that the very reverend the dean of dunwich would preach there on sunday  it flashed across her mind that this was sunday morning an overpowering desire to look on her fathers face once moreshe had never seen her mothersimpelled herminia to enter those unwonted portals  the dean was in the pulpit  he looked stately and dignified in his long white hair a noticeable man tall and erect to the last like a stormbeaten pine in spite of his threescore years and ten his clearcut face shone thoughtful and striking and earnest as ever  he was preaching from the text i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling  and he preached as he always did eloquently  his river of speech flowed high between banks out of sight of the multitude  there was such perfect sincerity such moral elevation in all he said that herminia felt acutely as she had often felt before the close likeness of fibre which united her to him in spite of extreme superficial differences of belief and action  she felt it so much that when the sermon was over she waited at the vestry door for her father to emerge  she couldnt let him go away without making at least an effort to speak with him  when the dean came out a gentle smile still playing upon his intellectual facefor he was one of the few parsons who manage in their old age to look neither sordid nor inanehe saw standing by the vestry door a woman in a plain black dress like a widow of the people  she held by the hand a curlyhaired little girl of singularly calm and innocent expression  the womans dark hair waved gracefully on her high forehead and caught his attention her eyes were subtly sweet her mouth full of pathos  she pressed forward to speak to him the dean all benignity bent his head to listen  father herminia cried looking up at him  the dean started back  the woman who thus addressed him was barely twentyeight she might well have been forty grief and hard life had made her old before her time  her face was haggard  beautiful as she still was it was the beauty of a broken heart of a mater dolorosa not the roundfaced beauty of the fresh young girl who had gone forth rejoicing some ten years earlier from the deanery at dunwich to the lecturerooms at girton  for a moment the dean stared hard at her  then with a burst of recognition he uttered aghast the one word herminia  father herminia answered in a tremulous voice i have fought a good fight i have pressed toward the mark for the prize of a high calling  and when i heard you preach i felt just this once let come what come might i must step forth to tell you so  the dean gazed at her with melting eyes  love and pity beamed strong in them  have you come to repent my child he asked with solemn insistence  father herminia made answer lingering lovingly on the word i have nothing to repent of  i have striven hard to do well and have earned scant praise for it  but i come to ask today for one grasp of your hand one word of your blessing  father father kiss me  the old man drew himself up to his full height with his silvery hair round his face  tears started to his eyes his voice faltered  but he repressed himself sternly  no no my child he answered  my poor old heart bleeds for you  but not till you come with full proofs of penitence in your hands can i ever receive you  i have prayed for you without ceasing  god grant you may repent  till then i command you keep far away from me and from your untainted sisters  the child felt her mothers hand tremble quivering in her own as she led her from the church but never a word did herminia say lest her heart should break with it  as soon as she was outside little dolly looked up at her  it had dwindled from dolores to dolly in real life by this time years bring these mitigations of our first fierce outbursts  who was that grand old gentleman the child asked in an awestruck voice  and herminia clasping her daughter to her breast answered with a stifled sob that was your grandpa dolly that was my father my father  the child put no more questions just then as is the wont of children but she treasured up the incident for long in her heart wondering much to herself why if her grandpa was so grand an old gentleman she and her mamma should have to live by themselves in such scrubby little lodgings  also why her grandpa who looked so kind should refuse so severely to kiss her mammy  it was the beginning of many doubts and questionings to dolores a year later the dean died suddenly  people said he might have risen to be a bishop in his time if it hadnt been for that unfortunate episode about his daughter and young merrick  herminia was only once mentioned in his will and even then merely to implore the divine forgiveness for her  she wept over that sadly she didnt want the girls money she was better able to take care of herself than elsie and ermyntrude but it cut her to the quick that her father should have quitted the world at last without one word of reconciliation  however she went on working placidly at her hackwork and living for little dolly  her one wish now was to make dolly press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling she herself by mere accident had missed so narrowly  her own life was done alans death had made her task impossible but if dolly could fill her place for the sake of humanity she would not regret it  enough for her to have martyred herself she asked no mercenary palm and crown of martyrdom  and she was happy in her life as far as a certain tranquil sense of duty done could make her she was passively happy  her kind of journalism was so commonplace and so anonymous that she was spared that worst insult of seeing her hackwork publicly criticised as though it afforded some adequate reflection of the mind that produced it instead of being merely an index of taste in the minds of those for whose use it was intended  so she lived for years a machine for the production of articles and reviews and a devoted mother to little developing dolly  on dolly the hopes of half the world now centred     xv   not that herminia had not at times hard struggles and sore temptations  one of the hardest and sorest came when dolly was about six years old  and this was the manner of it  one day the child who was to reform the world was returning from some errand on which her mother had sent her when her attention was attracted by a very fine carriage stopping at a door not far from their lodgings now dolly had always a particular weakness for everything grand and so grand a turnout as this one was rare in their neighborhood she paused and stared hard at it whose is it mrs biggs she asked awestruck of the friendly charwoman who happened to pass at the momentthe charwoman who frequently came in to do a days cleaning at her mothers lodginghouse mrs biggs knew it well its sir anthony merricks she answered in that peculiarly hushed voice with which the english poor always utter the names of the titled classes and so in fact it was for the famous gout doctor had lately been knighted for his eminent services in saving a royal duke from the worst effects of his own selfindulgence dolly put one fat finger to her lip and elevated her eyebrows and looked grave at once sir anthony merrick what a very grand gentleman he must be indeed and how nice it must seem to be able to drive in so distinguished a vehicle with a liveried footman  as she paused and looked lost in enjoyment of that beatific vision sir anthony himself emerged from the porch  dolly took a good stare at him  he was handsome austere closeshaven implacable  his profile was clearcut like trajans on an aureus dolly thought that was just how so grand a gentleman ought to look and so thinking she glanced up at him and with a flash of her white teeth smiled her childish approval  the austere old gentleman unwontedly softened by that cherub facefor indeed she was as winsome as a baby angel of raphaelsstooped down and patted the bright curly head that turned up to him so trustfully whats your name little woman he asked with a sudden wave of gentleness  and dolly all agog at having arrested so grand an old gentlemans attention spoke up in her clear treble dolores barton  sir anthony started  was this a trap to entangle him  he was born suspicious and he feared that woman  but he looked into dollys blue eyes of wonder and all doubt fled from him  was it blood was it instinct was it unconscious nature  at any rate the child seemed to melt the grandfathers heart as if by magic  long years after when the due time came dolly remembered that melting to the profound amazement of the footman who stood with the carriagedoor ready open in his hand the old man bent down and kissed the childs red lips  god bless you my dear he murmured with unwonted tenderness to his sons daughter  then he took out his purse and drew from it a whole gold sovereign thats for you my child he said fondling the pretty golden curls  take it home and tell your mammy an old man in the street gave it to you  but the coachman observed to the footman as they drove on together to the next noble patients you may take your oath on it mr wells that little un there was mr alans lovechild  dolly had never held so much money in her hand before she ran home clutching it tight and burst in upon herminia with the startling news that sir anthony merrick a very grand gentleman in a very fine carriage had given a gold piece to her  gold pieces were rare in the calm little attic but herminia caught her child up with a cry of terror and that very same evening she changed the tainted sovereign with dolly for another one and sent sir anthonys back in an envelope without a word to harley street the child who was born to free half the human race from aeons of slavery must be kept from all contagion of mans gold and mans bribery  yet dolly never forgot the grand gentlemans name though she hadnt the least idea why he gave that yellow coin to her  out of this small episode however grew herminias great temptation  for sir anthony being a man tenacious of his purpose went home that day full of relenting thoughts about that girl dolores  her golden hair had sunk deep into his heart  she was alans own child after all she had alans blue eyes and in a world where your daughters go off and marry men you dont like while your sons turn out badly and dont marry at all to vex you its something to have some fresh young life of your blood to break in upon your chilly old age and cheer you  so the great doctor called a few days later at herminias lodgings and having first ascertained that herminia herself was out had five minutes conversation alone with her landlady  there were times no doubt when mrs barton was ill  the landlady with the caution of her class admitted that might be so  and times no doubt when mrs barton was for the moment in arrears with her rent  the landlady good loyal soul demurred to that suggestion she knit her brows and hesitated  sir anthony hastened to set her mind at rest  his intentions were most friendly  he wished to keep a watcha quiet wellmeaning unsuspected watchover mrs bartons necessities  he desired in point of fact if need were to relieve them  mrs barton was distantly connected with relations of his own and his notion was that without seeming to help her in obtrusive ways he would like to make sure mrs barton got into no serious difficulties  would the landlady be so gooda half sovereign glided into that subservient palmas to let sir anthony know if she ever had reason to suspect a very serious strain was being put on mrs bartons resources  the landlady dropping the modern apology for a courtesy promised with effusion under pressure of hard cash to accede to sir anthonys benevolent wishes  the more so as shed do anything to serve dear mrs barton who was always in everything a perfect lady most independent in fact one of the kind as wouldnt be beholden to anybody for a farthing  some months passed away before the landlady had cause to report to sir anthony  but during the worst depths of the next london winter when gray fog gathered thick in the purlieus of marylebone and shivering gusts groaned at the street corners poor little dolly caught whoopingcough badly  on top of the whoopingcough came an attack of bronchitis and on top of the bronchitis a serious throat trouble  herminia sat up night after night nursing her child and neglecting the work on which both depended for subsistence  week by week things grew worse and worse and sir anthony kept duly informed by the landlady waited and watched and bided his time in silence  at last the case became desperate herminia had no money left to pay her bill or buy food and one string to her bow after another broke down in journalism  her place as the weekly ladysletter writer to an illustrated paper passed on to a substitute blank poverty stared her in the face inevitable  when it came to pawning the typewriter as the landlady reported sir anthony smiled a grim smile to himself  the moment for action had now arrived  he would put on pressure to get away poor alans illegitimate child from that dreadful woman  next day he called  dolly was dangerously illso ill that herminia couldnt find it in her heart to dismiss the great doctor from her door without letting him see her  and sir anthony saw her  the child recognized him at once and rallied and smiled at him  she stretched her little arms  she must surely get well if a gentleman who drove in so fine a carriage and scattered sovereigns like hapennies came in to prescribe for her  sir anthony was flattered at her friendly reception  those thin small arms touched the grandfathers heart  she will recover he said but she needs good treatment delicacies refinements  then he slipped out of the room and spoke seriously to herminia  let her come to me he urged  ill adopt her and give her her fathers name it will be better for herself better for her future  she shall be treated as my granddaughter welltaught wellkept and you may see her every six months for a fortnights visit  if you consent i will allow you a hundred a year for yourself  let bygones be bygones  for the childs sake say yes  she needs so much that you can never give her  poor herminia was sore tried  as for the hundred a year she couldnt dream of accepting it but like a flash it went through her brain how many advantages dolly could enjoy in that wealthy household that the hardworking journalist could not possibly afford her  she thought of the unpaid bills the empty cupboard the wolf at the door the blank outlook for the future  for a second she half hesitated  come come sir anthony said for the childs own sake you wont be so selfish as to stand in her way will you  those words roused herminia to a true sense of her duty  sir anthony merrick she said holding her breath that child is my child and my dear dead alans  i owe it to alani owe it to herto bring her up in the way that alan would approve of  i brought her into the world and my duty is to do what i can to discharge the responsibilities i then undertook to her  i must train her up to be a useful citizen  not for thousands would i resign the delight and honor of teaching my child to those who would teach her what alan and i believed to be pernicious who would teach her to despise her mothers life and to reject the holy memory of her father  as i said to you before that day at perugia so i say to you now thy money perish with thee  you need never again come here to bribe me  is that final sir anthony asked  and herminia answered with a bow yes final quite final  sir anthony bent his head and left  herminia stood face to face with abject poverty  spurred by want by indignation by terror by a sense of the absolute necessity for action she carried her writing materials then and there into dollys sickroom and sitting by her childs cot she began to write she hardly knew what as the words themselves came to her  in a fever of excitement she wrote and wrote and wrote  she wrote as one writes in the silence of midnight  it was late before she finished  when her manuscript was complete she slipped out and posted it to a weekly paper  it appeared that same saturday and was the beginning of herminias most valuable connection  but even after she had posted it the distracted mother could not pause or rest  dolly tossed and turned in her sleep and herminia sat watching her  she pined for sympathy  vague ancestral yearnings gathering head within her made her long to prayif only there had been anybody or anything to pray to  she clasped her bloodless hands in an agony of solitude  oh for a friend to comfort  at last her overwrought feelings found vent in verse she seized a pencil from her desk and sitting by dollys side wrote down her heartfelt prayer as it came to her that moment    a crowned caprice is god of the world   on his stony breast are his white wings furled   no ear to hearken no eye to see   no heart to feel for a man hath he    but his pitiless hands are swift to smite   and his mute lips utter one word of might   in the clash of gentler souls and rougher   wrong must thou do or wrong must suffer    then grant o dumb blind god at least that we   rather the sufferers than the doers be     xvi   a change came at last when dolly was ten years old  among the men of whom herminia saw most in these later days were the little group of advanced london socialists who call themselves the fabians  and among her fabian friends one of the most active the most eager the most individual was harvey kynaston  he was a younger man by many years than poor alan had been about herminias own age a brilliant economist with a future before him he aimed at the cabinet  when first he met herminia he was charmed at one glance by her chastened beauty her breadth and depth of soul her transparent sincerity of purpose and action  those wistful eyes captured him  before many days passed he had fallen in love with her  but he knew her history and taking it for granted she must still be immersed in regret for alans loss he hardly even reckoned the chances of her caring for him  tis a common case  have you ever noticed that if you meet a woman famous for her connection with some absorbing grief some historic tragedy you are half appalled at first sight to find that at times she can laugh and make merry and look gay with the rest of us  her callous glee shocks you  you mentally expect her to be forever engaged in the tearful contemplation of her own tragic fate wrapt up in those she has lost like the mourners in a pieta whenever you have thought of her you have connected her in your mind with that one fact in her history which perhaps may have happened a great many years ago  but to you it is as yesterday you forget that since then many things have occurred to her  she has lived her life she has learned to smile human nature itself cannot feed for years on the continuous contemplation of its own deepest sorrows  it even jars you to find that the widow of a patriotic martyr a murdered missionary has her moments of enjoyment and must wither away without them  so just at first harvey kynaston was afraid to let herminia see how sincerely he admired her  he thought of her rather as one whose life is spent who can bring to the banquet but the cold dead ashes of a past existence  gradually however as he saw more and more of her it began to strike him that herminia was still in all essentials a woman  his own throbbing heart told him so as he sat and talked with her  he thrilled at her approach  bit by bit the idea rose up in his mind that this lonely soul might still be won he set to work in earnest to woo and win her  as for herminia many men had paid her attentions already in her unwedded widowhood  some of them after the fashion of men having heard garbled versions of her tragic story and seeking to gain some base advantage for themselves from their knowledge of her past strove to assail her crudely  them with unerring womanly instinct she early discerned and with unerring feminine tact undeceived and humbled  others genuinely attracted by her beauty and her patience paid real court to her heart but all these fell far short of her ideal standard  with harvey kynaston it was different  she admired him as a thinker she liked him as a man and she felt from the first moment that no friend since alan died had stirred her pulse so deeply as he did  for some months they met often at the fabian meetings and elsewhere till at last it became a habit with them to spend their sunday mornings on some breezy wold in the country together herminia was still as free as ever from any shrinking terror as to what people might say as of old she lived her life for herself and her conscience not for the opinion of a blind and superstitious majority  on one such august morning they had taken the train from london to haslemere with dolly of course by their side and then had strolled up hind head by the beautiful footpath which mounts at first through a chestnut copse and then between heatherclad hills to the summit  at the loneliest turn of the track where two purple glens divide harvey kynaston seated himself on the soft bed of ling herminia sank by his side and dolly after awhile not understanding their conversation wandered off by herself a little way afield in search of harebells and spotted orchises  dolly found her mothers friends were apt to bore her she preferred the society of the landladys daughters  it was a delicious day  hard by a slowworm sunned himself on the basking sand  blue dragonflies flashed on gauze wings in the hollows  harvey kynaston looked on herminias face and saw that she was fair  with an effort he made up his mind to speak at last in plain and simple words he asked her reverently the same question that alan had asked her so long ago on the holmwood  herminias throat flushed a rosy red and an unwonted sense of pleasure stole over that hardworked frame as she listened to his words for indeed she was fond of him  but she answered him at once without a moments hesitation  harvey im glad you ask me for i like and admire you  but i feel sure beforehand my answer must be no  for i think what you mean is to ask will i marry you  the man gazed at her hard  he spoke low and deferentially  yes herminia he replied  i do mean will you marry me  i know of course how you feel about this matter i know what you have sacrificed how deeply you have suffered for the sake of your principles  and thats just why i plead with you now to ignore them  you have given proof long ago of your devotion to the right you may surely fall back this second time upon the easier way of ordinary humanity  in theory herminia i accept your point of view i approve the equal liberty of men and women politically socially personally ethically  but in practice i dont want to bring unnecessary trouble on the head of a woman i love and to live together otherwise than as the law directs does bring unnecessary trouble as you know too profoundly  that is the only reason why i ask you to marry me  and herminia herminia he leant forward appealingly for the loves sake i bear you i hope you will consent to it  his voice was low and tender  herminia sick at heart with that long fierce struggle against overwhelming odds could almost have said yes to him  her own nature prompted her she was very very fond of him  but she paused for a second  then she answered him gravely  harvey she said looking deep into his honest brown eyes as we grow middleaged and find how impossible it must ever be to achieve any good in a world like this how sad a fate it is to be born a civilized being in a barbaric community im afraid moral impulse half dies down within us  the passionate aim grows cold the ardent glow fades and flickers into apathy  im ashamed to tell you the truth it seems such weakness yet as you ask me this i think i will tell you  once upon a time if you had made such a proposal to me if you had urged me to be false to my dearest principles to sin against the light to deny the truth i would have flashed forth a no upon you without one moments hesitation and now in my disillusioned middle age what do i feel  do you know i almost feel tempted to give way to this martinmas summer of love to stultify my past by unsaying and undoing everything  for i love you harvey  if i were to give way now as george eliot gave way as almost every woman who once tried to live a free life for her sisters sake has given way in the end i should counteract any little good my example has ever done or may ever do in the world and harvey strange as it sounds i feel more than half inclined to do it  but i will not i will not and ill tell you why  its not so much principle that prevents me now  i admit that freely  the torpor of middle age is creeping over my conscience  its simple regard for personal consistency and for dollys position  how can i go back upon the faith for which i have martyred myself  how can i say to dolly i wouldnt marry your father in my youth for honors sake but i have consented in middle life to sell my sisters cause for a man i love and for the consideration of society to rehabilitate myself too late with a world i despise by becoming one mans slave as i swore i never would be  no no dear harvey i cant do that  some sense of personal continuity restrains me still  it is the nemesis of our youth we cant go back in our later life on the holier and purer ideals of our girlhood  then you say no definitely harvey kynaston asked  herminias voice quivered  i say no definitely she answered unless you can consent to live with me on the terms on which i lived with dollys father  the man hesitated a moment  then he began to plead hard for reconsideration  but herminias mind was made up  she couldnt belie her past she couldnt be false to the principles for whose sake she had staked and lost everything  no no she said firmly over and over again  you must take me my own way or you must go without me  and harvey kynaston couldnt consent to take her her own way  his faith was too weak his ambitions were too earthly  herminia he said before they parted that afternoon we may still be friends still dear friends as ever  this episode need make no difference to a very close companionship  it need make no difference herminia answered with a light touch of her hand  harvey i have far too few friends in the world willingly to give up one of them  come again and go down with dolly and me to hind head as usual next sunday  thank you the man answered  herminia i wish it could have been otherwise  but since i must never have you i can promise you one thing i will never marry any other woman  herminia started at the words  oh no she cried quickly  how can you speak like that  how can you say anything so wrong so untrue so foolish  to be celibate is a very great misfortune even for a woman for a man it is impossible it is cruel it is wicked i endure it myself for my childs sake and because i find it hard to discover the help meet for me or because when discovered he refuses to accept me in the only way in which i can bestow myself but for a man to pretend to live celibate is to cloak hateful wrong under a guise of respectability  i should be unhappy if i thought any man was doing such a vicious thing out of desire to please me take some other woman on free terms if you can but if you cannot it is better you should marry than be a party to still deeper and more loathsome slavery  and from that day forth they were loyal friends no more one to the other     xvii   and yet our herminia was a woman after all  some three years later when harvey kynaston came to visit her one day and told her he was really going to be marriedwhat sudden thrill was this that passed through and through her  her heart stood still  she was aware that she regretted the comparative loss of a very near and dear acquaintance  she knew she was quite wrong  it was the leaven of slavery  but these monopolist instincts which have wrought more harm in the world we live in than fire or sword or pestilence or tempest hardly die at all as yet in a few good men and die fighting hard for life even in the noblest women  she reasoned with herself against so hateful a feeling  though she knew the truth she found it hard to follow  no man indeed is truly civilized till he can say in all sincerity to every woman of all the women he loves to every woman of all the women who love him give me what you can of your love and of yourself but never strive for my sake to deny any love to strangle any impulse that pants for breath within you  give me what you can while you can without grudging but the moment you feel you love me no more dont pollute your own body by yielding it up to a man you have ceased to desire dont do injustice to your own prospective children by giving them a father whom you no longer respect or admire or yearn for  guard your chastity well  be mine as much as you will as long as you will to such extent as you will but before all things be your own embrace and follow every instinct of pure love that nature our mother has imparted within you  no woman in turn is truly civilized till she can say to every man of all the men she loves of all the men who love her give me what you can of your love and of yourself but dont think i am so vile and so selfish and so poor as to desire to monopolize you respect me enough never to give me your body without giving me your heart never to make me the mother of children whom you desire not and love not  when men and women can say that alike the world will be civilized  until they can say it truly the world will be as now a jarring battlefield for the monopolist instincts  those jealous and odious instincts have been the bane of humanity they have given us the stiletto the morgue the bowieknife  our race must inevitably in the end outlive them  the test of mans plane in the scale of being is how far he has outlived them  they are surviving relics of the ape and tiger  but we must let the ape and tiger die  we must cease to be calibans  we must begin to be human  patriotism is the one of these lowest vices which most often masquerades in false garb as a virtue  but what after all is patriotism  my country right or wrong and just because it is my country  this is clearly nothing more than collective selfishness often enough indeed it is not even collective  it means merely my businessinterests against the businessinterests of other people and let the taxes of my fellowcitizens pay to support them  at other times it means pure pride of race and pure lust of conquest my country against other countries my army and navy against other fighters my right to annex unoccupied territory against the equal right of all other peoples my power to oppress all weaker nationalities all inferior races  it never means or can mean anything good or true  for if a cause be just like irelands or once italys then tis a good mans duty to espouse it with warmth be it his own or anothers  and if a cause be bad then tis a good mans duty to oppose it tooth and nail irrespective of your patriotism  true a good man will feel more sensitively anxious that strict justice should be done by the particular community of which chance has made him a component member than by any others but then people who feel acutely this joint responsibility of all the citizens to uphold the moral right are not praised as patriots but reviled as unpatriotic  to urge that our own country should strive with all its might to be better higher purer nobler more generous than other countriesthe only kind of patriotism worth a moments thought in a righteous mans eyes is accounted by most men both wicked and foolish  then comes the monopolist instinct of property  that on the face of it is a baser and more sordid one  for patriotism at least can lay claim to some sort of delusive expansiveness beyond mere individual interest whereas property stops short at the narrowest limits of personality  it is no longer us against the world but me against my fellowcitizens  it is the last word of the intercivic war in its most hideous avatar  look how it scars the fair face of our common country with its antisocial noticeboards trespassers will be prosecuted  it says in effect this is my land  as i believe god made it but i have acquired it and tabooed it to myself for my own enjoyment  the grass on the wold grows green but only for me  the mountains rise glorious in the morning sun no foot of man save mine and my gillies shall tread them  the waterfalls leap white from the ledge in the glen avaunt there nonpossessors your eye shall never see them  for you the muddy street for me miles of upland  all this is my own  and i choose to monopolize it  or is it the capitalist  i will add field to field he cries aloud despite his own scripture i will join railway to railway i will juggle into my own hands all the instruments for the production of wealth that my cunning can lay hold of and i will use them for my own purposes against producer and consumer alike with impartial egoism  corn and coal shall lie in the hollow of my hand  i will enrich myself by making dear by craft the necessaries of life the poor shall lack that i may roll down fair streets in needless luxury  let them starve and feed me  that temper too humanity must outlive  and those who are incapable of outliving it of themselves must be taught by stern lessons as in the splendid uprising of the spirit of man in france that their race has outstripped them  next comes the monopoly of human life the hideous wrong of slavery  that thank goodness is now gone  twas the vilest of them allthe nakedest assertion of the monopolist platformyou live not for yourself but wholly and solely for me  i disregard your claims to your own body and soul and use you as my chattel that worst form has died  it withered away before the moral indignation even of existing humanity  we have the satisfaction of seeing one dragon slain of knowing that one monopolist instinct at least is now fairly bred out of us  last and hardest of all to eradicate in our midst comes the monopoly of the human heart which is known as marriage based upon the primitive habit of felling the woman with a blow stunning her by repeated strokes of the club or spear and dragging her off by the hair of her head as a slave to her captors hut or rockshelter this ugly and barbaric form of serfdom has come in our own time by some strange caprice to be regarded as of positively divine origin the man says now to himself this woman is mine law and the church have bestowed her on me mine for better for worse mine drunk or sober if she ventures to have a heart or a will of her own woe betide her i have tabooed her for life let any other man touch her let her so much as cast eyes on any other man to admire or desire himand knife dagger or lawcourt they shall both of them answer for it there you have in all its native deformity another monopolist instinctthe deepestseated of all the grimmest the most vindictive she is not yours says the moral philosopher of the new dispensation she is her own release her the turk hales his offending slave sews her up in a sack and casts her quick into the eddying bosphorus the christian englishman with more lingering torture sets spies on her life drags what he thinks her shame before a prying court and divorces her with contumely all this is monopoly and essentially slavery mankind must outlive it on its way up to civilization  and then the woman thus taught by her lords has begun to retort in these latter days by endeavoring to enslave the man in return unable to conceive the bare idea of freedom for both sexes alike she seeks equality in an equal slavery  that she will never achieve  the future is to the free  we have transcended serfdom women shall henceforth be the equals of men not by levelling down but by levelling up not by fettering the man but by elevating emancipating unshackling the woman  all this herminia knew well  all these things she turned over in her mind by herself on the evening of the day when harvey kynaston came to tell her of his approaching marriage  why then did she feel it to some extent a disappointment  why so flat at his happiness  partly she said to herself because it is difficult to live down in a single generation the jealousies and distrusts engendered in our hearts by so many ages of harem life  but more still she honestly believed because it is hard to be a free soul in an enslaved community  no unit can wholly sever itself from the social organism of which it is a corpuscle  if all the world were like herself her lot would have been different  affection would have been free her yearnings for sympathy would have been filled to the full by harvey kynaston or some other  as it was she had but that one little fraction of a man friend to solace her to resign him altogether to another woman leaving herself bankrupt of love was indeed a bitter trial to her  yet for her principles sake and dollys she never let harvey kynaston or his wife suspect it as long as she lived she was a true and earnest friend at all times to both of them     xviii   meanwhile dolores was growing up to womans estate  and she was growing into a tall a graceful an exquisitely beautiful woman  yet in some ways herminia had reason to be dissatisfied with her daughters development  day by day she watched for signs of the expected apostolate  was dolores pressing forward to the mark for the prize of her high calling  her mother half doubted it  slowly and regretfully as the growing girl approached the years when she might be expected to think for herself herminia began to perceive that the child of so many hopes of so many aspirations the child predestined to regenerate humanity was thinking for herselfin a retrograde direction  incredible as it seemed to herminia in the daughter of such a father and such a mother dolores ideasnay worse her idealswere essentially commonplace  not that she had much opportunity of imbibing commonplace opinions from any outside source she redeveloped them from within by a pure effort of atavism  she had reverted to lower types  she had thrown back to the philistine  heredity of mental and moral qualities is a precarious matter these things lie as it were on the topmost plane of character they smack of the individual and are therefore far less likely to persist in offspring than the deeperseated and betterestablished peculiarities of the family the clan the race or the species they are idiosyncratic  indeed when we remember how greatly the mental and moral faculties differ from brother to brother the product of the same two parental factors can we wonder that they differ much more from father to son the product of one like factor alone diluted by the addition of a relatively unknown quality the maternal influence  however this may be at any rate dolores early began to strike out for herself all the most ordinary and stereotyped opinions of british respectability  it seemed as if they sprang up in her by unmitigated reversion  she had never heard in the society of her mothers lodgings any but the freest and most rational ideas yet she herself seemed to hark back of internal congruity to the lower and vulgarer moral plane of her remoter ancestry  she showed her individuality only by evolving for herself all the threadbare platitudes of ordinary convention  moreover it is not parents who have most to do with moulding the sentiments and opinions of their children  from the beginning dolly thought better of the landladys views and ideas than of her mothers  when she went to school she considered the moral standpoint of the other girls a great deal more sensible than the moral standpoint of herminias attic  she accepted the beliefs and opinions of her schoolfellows because they were natural and congenial to her character  in short she had what the world calls commonsense she revolted from the unpractical utopianism of her mother  from a very early age indeed this false note in dolly had begun to make itself heard  while she was yet quite a child herminia noticed with a certain tender but shrinking regret that dolly seemed to attach undue importance to the mere upholsteries and equipages of lifeto rank wealth title servants carriages jewelry  at first to be sure herminia hoped this might prove but the passing foolishness of childhood as dolly grew up however it became clearer each day that the defect was in the grainthat dollys whole mind was incurably and congenitally aristocratic or snobbish  she had that mean admiration for birth position adventitious advantages which is the mark of the beast in the essentially aristocratic or snobbish nature  she admired people because they were rich because they were highplaced because they were courted because they were respected not because they were good because they were wise because they were noblenatured because they were respectworthy  but even that was not all  in time herminia began to perceive with still profounder sorrow that dolly had no spontaneous care or regard for righteousness  right and wrong meant to her only what was usual and the opposite  she seemed incapable of considering the intrinsic nature of any act in itself apart from the praise or blame meted out to it by society  in short she was sunk in the same ineffable slough of moral darkness as the ordinary inhabitant of the morass of london  to herminia this slow discovery as it dawned bit by bit upon her put the final thorn in her crown of martyrdom  the child on whose education she had spent so much pains the child whose success in the deep things of life was to atone for her own failure the child who was born to be the apostle of freedom to her sisters in darkness had turned out in the most earnest essentials of character a complete disappointment and had ruined the last hope that bound her to existence  bitterer trials remained  herminia had acted through life to a great extent with the idea ever consciously present to her mind that she must answer to dolly for every act and every feeling  she had done all she did with a deep sense of responsibility  now it loomed by degrees upon her aching heart that dollys verdict would in almost every case be a hostile one  the daughter was growing old enough to question and criticise her mothers proceedings she was beginning to understand that some mysterious difference marked off her own uncertain position in life from the solid position of the children who surrounded herthe children born under those special circumstances which alone the manmade law chooses to stamp with the seal of its recognition  dollys curiosity was shyly aroused as to her dead fathers family  herminia had done her best to prepare betimes for this inevitable result by setting before her child as soon as she could understand it the true moral doctrine as to the duties of parenthood  but dollys own development rendered all such steps futile  there is no more silly and persistent error than the belief of parents that they can influence to any appreciable extent the moral ideas and impulses of their children  these things have their springs in the bases of character they are the flower of individuality and they cannot be altered or affected after birth by the foolishness of preaching train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old you will find soon enough he will choose his own course for himself and depart from it  already when dolly was a toddling little mite and met her mothers father in the church in marylebone it had struck her as odd that while they themselves were so poor and illclad her grandpapa should be such a grand old gentleman of such a dignified aspect as she grew older and older and began to understand a little more the world she lived in she wondered yet more profoundly how it could happen if her grandpapa was indeed the very reverend the dean of dunwich that her mamma should be an outcast from her fathers church and scarcely well seen in the best carriage company  she had learnt that deans are rather grand peoplealmost as much so as admirals that they wear shovelhats to distinguish them from the common ruck of rectors that they lived in fine houses in a cathedral close and that they drive in a victoria with a coachman in livery  so much essential knowledge of the church of christ she had gained for herself by personal observation for facts like these were what interested dolly  she couldnt understand then why she and her mother should live precariously in a very small attic should never be visited by her mothers brothers one of whom she knew to be a prebendary of old sarum while the other she saw gazetted as a colonel of artillery and should be totally ignored by her mothers sister ermyntrude who lolled in a landau down the sunny side of bond street  at first indeed it only occurred to dolly that her mothers extreme and advanced opinions had induced a social breach between herself and the orthodox members of her family  even that dolly resented why should mamma hold ideas of her own which shut her daughter out from the worldly advantages enjoyed to the full by the rest of her kindred  dolly had no particular religious ideas the subject didnt interest her and besides she thought the new testament talked about rich and poor in much the same unpractical nebulous way that mamma herself didin fact she regarded it with some veiled contempt as a rather sentimental radical publication but she considered for all that that it was probably true enough as far as the facts and the theology went and she couldnt understand why a person like mamma should cut herself off contumaciously from the rest of the world by presuming to disbelieve a body of doctrine which so many rich and wellgaitered bishops held worthy of credence  all stylish society accepted the tenets of the church of england  but in time it began to occur to her that there might be some deeper and as she herself would have said more disgraceful reason for her mothers alienation from so respectable a family  for to dolly that was disgraceful which the world held to be so  things in themselves apart from the worlds word had for her no existence  step by step as she grew up to blushing womanhood it began to strike her with surprise that her grandfathers name had been like her own barton  did you marry your cousin mamma she asked herminia one day quite suddenly  and herminia flushing scarlet at the unexpected question the first with which dolly had yet ventured to approach that dangerous quicksand replied with a deadly thrill no my darling  why do you ask me  because dolly answered abashed i just wanted to know why your name should be barton the same as poor grandpapas  herminia didnt dare to say too much just then  your dear father she answered low was not related to me in any way  dolly accepted the tone as closing the discussion for the present but the episode only strengthened her underlying sense of a mystery somewhere in the matter to unravel  in time herminia sent her child to a dayschool  though she had always taught dolly herself as well as she was able she felt it a matter of duty as her daughter grew up to give her something more than the stray ends of time in a busy journalists moments of leisure  at the school where dolly was received without question on miss smithwaters recommendation she found herself thrown much into the society of other girls drawn for the most part from the narrowly mammonworshipping ranks of london professional society here her native tendencies towards the real religion of england the united worship of success and respectability were encouraged to the utmost  but she noticed at times with a shy shrinking that some few of the girls had heard vague rumors about her mother as a most equivocal person who didnt accept all the current superstitions and were curious to ask her questions as to her family and antecedents  crimson with shame dolly parried such enquiries as best she could but she longed all the more herself to pierce this dim mystery  was it a runaway matchwith the groom perhaps or the footman  only the natural shamefacedness of a budding girl in prying into her mothers most domestic secrets prevented dolores from asking herminia some day pointblank all about it  but she was gradually becoming aware that some strange atmosphere of doubt surrounded her birth and her mothers history  it filled her with sensitive fears and selfconscious hesitations  and if the truth must be told dolly never really returned her mothers profound affection  it is often so  the love which parents lavish upon their children the children repay not to parents themselves but to the next generation  only when we become fathers or mothers in our turn do we learn what our fathers and mothers have done for us  thus it was with dolly  when once the first period of childish dependence was over she regarded herminia with a smouldering distrust and a secret dislike that concealed itself beneath a mask of unfelt caresses  in her heart of hearts she owed her mother a grudge for not having put her in a position in life where she could drive in a carriage with a snarling pug and a clipped french poodle like aunt ermyntrudes children  she grew up smarting under a sullen sense of injustice all the deeper because she was compelled to stifle it in the profoundest recesses of her own heart     xix   when dolly was seventeen a pink wild rose just unrolling its petals a very great event occurred in her history  she received an invitation to go and stop with some friends in the country  the poor childs life had been in a sense so uneventful that the bare prospect of this visit filled her soul beforehand with tremulous anticipation  to be sure dolly barton had always lived in the midmost centre of the movement in london she had known authors artists socialists the cream of our race she had been brought up in close intercourse with the men and women who are engaged in revolutionizing and remodelling humanity  but this very fact that she had always lived in the thick of things made a change to the thin of things only by so much the more delicious and enchanting  not that dolores had not seen a great deal too of the country  poor as they were her mother had taken her to cheap little seaside nooks for a week or two of each summer she had made pilgrimages almost every sunday in spring or autumn to leith hill or mapledurham she had even strained her scanty resources to the utmost to afford dolly an occasional outing in the ardennes or in normandy  but what gave supreme importance to this coming visit was the special fact that dolly was now for the first time in her life to find herself in society  among the friends she had picked up at her marylebone dayschool were two westcountry girls private boarders of the headmistresss who came from the neighborhood of combe neville in dorset their name was compson and their father was rector of their native village upcombe dolly liked them very much and was proud of their acquaintance because they were reckoned about the most distinguished pupils in the school their mother being the niece of a local viscount among girls in middleclass london sets even so remote a connection with the titlebearing classes is counted for a distinction so when winnie compson asked dolly to go and stop with her at her fathers rectory during three whole weeks of the summer holidays dolly felt that now at last by pure force of native worth she was rising to her natural position in society it flattered her that winnie should select her for such an honor  the preparations for that visit cost dolly some weeks of thought and effort  the occasion demanded it  she was afraid she had no frocks good enough for such a grand house as the compsons grand was indeed a favorite epithet of dollys she applied it impartially to everything which had to do as she conceived with the life of the propertied and privileged classes  it was a word at once of cherished and revered meaningthe shibboleth of her religion  it implied to her mind something remote and unapproachable yet to be earnestly striven after with all the forces at her disposal  even herminia herself stretched a point in favor of an occasion which she could plainly see dolly regarded as so important she managed to indulge her darling in a couple of dainty new afternoon dresses which touched for her soul the very utmost verge of allowable luxury  the materials were oriental the cut was the dressmakersnot homebuilt as usual  dolly looked so brave in them with her rich chestnut hair and her creamy complexiona touch herminia thought of her italian birthplacethat the mothers full heart leapt up to look at her  it almost made herminia wish she was richand antisocial like the rich peoplein order that she might be able to do ample justice to the exquisite grace of dollys unfolding figure  tall lissome supple clear of limb and light of footstep she was indeed a girl any mother might have been proud of  on the day she left london herminia thought to herself she had never seen her child look so absolutely lovely  the unwonted union of blue eyes with that olivegray skin gave a tinge of wayward shyness to her girlish beauty  the golden locks had ripened to nutbrown but still caught stray gleams of nestling sunlight twas with a foreboding regret that herminia kissed dolly on both peachbloom cheeks at parting  she almost fancied her child must be slipping from her motherly grasp when she went off so blithely to visit these unknown friends away down in dorsetshire  yet dolly had so few amusements of the sort young girls require that herminia was overjoyed this opportunity should have come to her she reproached herself not a little in her sensitive heart for even feeling sad at dollys joyous departure  yet to dolly it was a delight to escape from the atmosphere of herminias lodgings those calm heights chilled her  the compsons house was quite as grand in the reality as dolly had imagined it  there was a manservant in a white tie to wait at table and the family dressed every evening for dinner  yet much to her surprise dolly found from the first the grandeur did not in the least incommode her  on the contrary she enjoyed it  she felt forthwith she was to the manner born  this was clearly the life she was intended by nature to live and might actually have been livingshe the granddaughter of so grand a man as the late dean of dunwichhad it not been for poor mammas ridiculous fancies  mamma was so faddy  before dolly had spent three whole days at the rectory she talked just as the compsons did she picked up by pure instinct the territorial slang of the county families  one would have thought to hear her discourse she had dressed for dinner every night of her life and passed her days in the society of the beneficed clergy  but even that did not exhaust the charm of upcombe for dolly for the first time in her life she saw something of menreal men with horses and dogs and gunsmen who went out partridge shooting in the season and rode to hounds across country not the pale abstractions of cultured humanity who attended the fabian society meetings or wrote things called articles in the london papers her mothers friends wore soft felt hats and limp woollen collars these real men were richly clad in tweed suits and fine linen dolly was charmed with them all but especially with one handsome and manly young fellow named walter brydges the stepson and ward of a neighboring parson how you talked with him at tennis today winnie compson said to her friend as they sat on the edge of dollys bed one evening he seemed quite taken with you  a pink spot of pleasure glowed on dollys round cheek to think that a real young man in good society whom she met at so grand a house as the compsons should seem to be quite taken with her  who is he winnie she asked trying to look less selfconscious hes extremely goodlooking  oh hes mr hawkshaws stepson over at combe mary winnie answered with a nod  mr hawkshaws the vicar there till mammas nephew is ready to take the livingwhat they call a warmingpan but walter brydges is mrs hawkshaws son by her first husband old mr brydges was the squire of combe mary and walters his only child  hes very well off  you might do worse dear  hes considered quite a catch down in this part of the country  how old is he dolly asked innocently enough standing up by the bedside in her dainty white nightgown  but winnie caught at her meaning with the preternatural sharpness of the girl brought up in immediate contact with the landed interest  oh hes of age she answered quickly with a knowing nod  hes come into the property he has nobody on earth but himself to consult about his domestic arrangements  dolly was young dolly was pretty dollys smile won the world dolly was still at the sweetest and most susceptible of ages walter brydges was well off walter brydges was handsome walter brydges had all the glamour of a landed estate and an oxford education  he was a young greek god in a norfolk shootingjacket moreover he was a really good and pleasant young fellow  what wonder therefore if before a week was out dolly was very really and seriously in love with him  and what wonder if walter brydges in turn caught by that maiden glance was in love with dolly  he had every excuse for she was lithe and beautiful and a joyous companion besides being as the ladys maid justly remarked a perfect lady  one day after dolly had been a fortnight at upcombe the compsons gave a picnic in the wild combe undercliff tis a broken wall of chalk tumbled picturesquely about in huge shattered masses and deliciously overgrown with ferns and blackthorn and golden clusters of closecreeping rockrose mazy paths thread tangled labyrinths of fallen rock or wind round tall clumps of hollybush and bramble they lighted their fire under the lee of one such buttress of broken cliff whose summit was festooned with long sprays of clematis or old mans beard as the common westcountry name expressively phrases it thistledown hovered on the basking air there they sat and drank their tea couched on beds of fern or propped firm against the rock and when tea was over they wandered off two and two ostensibly for nothing but really for the true business of the picnicto afford the young men and maidens of the group some chance of enjoying unspied one anothers society  dolly and walter brydges strolled off by themselves toward the rocky shore  there walter showed her where a brook bubbled clear from the fountainhead by its brink blue veronicas grew and tall yellow loosestrife and tasselled purple heads of great english eupatory  bending down to the stream he picked a little bunch of forgetmenots and handed them to her  dolly pretended unconsciously to pull the dainty blossoms to pieces as she sat on the clay bank hard by and talked with him  is that how you treat my poor flowers walter asked looking askance at her  dolly glanced down and drew back suddenly  oh poor little things she cried with a quick droop of her long lashes  i wasnt thinking what i did  and she darted a shy glance at him if id remembered they were forgetmenots i dont think i could have done it  she looked so sweet and pure in her budding innocence like a halfblown waterlily that the young man already more than twothirds in love was instantly captivated because they were forgetmenots or because they were mine miss barton he asked softly all timorousness  perhaps a little of both the girl answered gazing down and blushing at each word a still deeper crimson  the blush showed sweet on that translucent skin  walter turned to her with a sudden impulse  and what are you going to do with them now he enquired holding his breath for joy and halfsuppressed eagerness  dolly hesitated a moment with genuine modesty  then her liking for the wellknit young man overcame her  with a frightened smile her hand stole to her bodice she fixed them in her bosom  will that do she asked timidly  yes that will do the young man answered bending forward and seizing her soft fingers in his own  that will do very well and miss bartondoloresi take it as a sign you dont wholly dislike me  i like you very much dolly answered in a low voice pulling a rockrose from a cleft and tearing it nervously to pieces  do you love me dolly the young man insisted  dolly turned her glance to him tenderly then withdrew it in haste i think i might in time she answered very slowly  then you will be mine mine mine walter cried in an ecstasy  dolly bent her pretty head in reluctant assent with a torrent of inner joy  the sun flashed in her chestnut hair  the triumph of that moment was to her inexpressible  but as for walter brydges he seized the blushing face boldly in his two brown hands and imprinted upon it at once three respectful kisses  then he drew back halfterrified at his own temerity     xx   from that day forth it was understood at upcombe that dolly barton was informally engaged to walter brydges  their betrothal would be announced in the morning postwe learn that a marriage has been arranged and so forthas soon as the chosen bride had returned to town and communicated the great news in person to her mother for reasons of her own dolly preferred this delay she didnt wish to write on the subject to herminia  would mamma go and spoil it all she wondered  it would be just like her  the remaining week of her stay at the rectory was a golden dream of delight to dolly  beyond even the natural ecstasy of first love the natural triumph of a brilliant engagement what visions of untold splendor danced hourly day and night before her dazzled eyes  what masques of magnificence county balls garden parties it was heaven to dolly  she was going to be grander than her grandest daydream  walter took her across one afternoon to combe mary and introduced her in due form to his mother and his stepfather who found the pinkandwhite girl so very young but saw no other grave fault in her  he even escorted her over the ancestral home of the masters of combe mary in which they were both to live and which the young squire had left vacant of set purpose till he found a wife to his mind to fill it  twas the ideal crystallized  rooks cawed from the high elms ivy clambered to the gables the tower of the village church closed the vista through the avenue  the cup of dollys happiness was full to the brim  she was to dwell in a manorhouse with livery servants of her own and to dress for dinner every night of her existence  on the very last evening of her stay in dorsetshire walter came round to see her  mrs compson and the girls managed to keep discreetly out of the young peoples way the rector was in his study preparing his sunday sermon which arduous intellectual effort was supposed to engage his close attention for five hours or so weekly  not a mouse interrupted  so dolly and her lover had the field to themselves from eight to ten in the rectory drawingroom  from the first moment of walters entry dolly was dimly aware womanlike of something amiss something altered in his manner not indeed that her lover was less affectionate or less tender than usualif anything he seemed rather more so but his talk was embarrassed preoccupied spasmodic  he spoke by fits and starts and seemed to hold back something  dolly taxed him with it at last  walter tried to put it off upon her approaching departure but he was an honest young man and so bad an actor that dolly with her keen feminine intuitions at once detected him  its more than that she said all regret leaning forward with a quickgathering moisture in her eye for she really loved him its more than that walter  youve heard something somewhere that you dont want to tell me  walters color changed at once  he was a man and therefore but a poor dissembler  well nothing very much he admitted awkwardly  dolly drew back like one stung her heart beat fast  what have you heard she cried trembling walter walter i love you  you must keep nothing back  tell me now what it is  i can bear to hear it  the young man hesitated  only something my stepfather heard from a friend last night he replied floundering deeper and deeper nothing at all about you darling  onlywellabout your family  dollys face was red as fire  a lump rose in her throat she started in horror  then he had found out the truth  he had probed the mystery  something that makes you sorry you promised to marry me she cried aloud in her despair  heaven faded before her eyes  what evil trick could mamma have played her  as she stood there that momentproud crimson breathlesswalter brydges would have married her if her father had been a tinker and her mother a gipsy girl  he drew her toward him tenderly  no darling he cried kissing her for he was a chivalrous young man as he understood chivalry and to him it was indeed a most cruel blow to learn that his future wife was born out of lawful wedlock im proud of you i love you  i worship the very ground your sweet feet tread on  nothing on earth could make me anything but grateful and thankful for the gift of your love youre gracious enough to bestow on me  but dolly drew back in alarm  not on such terms as those  she too had her pride she too had her chivalry  no no she cried shrinking  i dont know what it is  i dont know what it means  but till ive gone home to london and asked about it from motheroh walter we two are no longer engaged  you are free from your promise  she said it proudly she said it bravely  she said it with womanly grace and dignity  something of herminia shone out in her that moment  no man should ever take herto the grandest homeunless he took her at her full worth pleased and proud to win her  walter soothed and coaxed but dolores stood firm  like a rock in the sea no assault could move her  as things stood at present she cried they were no longer engaged  after she had seen her mother and talked it all over she would write to him once more and tell him what she thought of it  and crimson to the fingertips with shame and modesty she rushed from his presence up to her own dark bedroom     xxi   next morning early dolly left combe neville on her way to london when she reached the station walter was on the platform with a bunch of white roses  he handed them to her deferentially as she took her seat in the thirdclass carriage and so sobered was dolly by this great misfortune that she forgot even to feel a passing pang of shame that walter should see her travel in that humble fashion  remember he whispered in her ear as the train steamed out we are still engaged i hold you to your promise  and dolly blushing maidenly shame and distress shook her head decisively  not now she answered  i must wait till i know the truth  it has always been kept from me  and now i will know it  she had not slept that night  all the way up to london she kept turning her doubt over  the more she thought of it the deeper it galled her  her wrath waxed bitter against herminia for this evil turn she had wrought  the smouldering anger of years blazed forth at last  had she blighted her daughters life and spoiled so fair a future by obstinate adherence to those preposterous ideas of hers  never in her life had dolly loved her mother  at best she had felt towards her that contemptuous toleration which inferior minds often extend to higher ones  and nowwhy she hated her  in london as it happened that very morning herminia walking across regents park had fallen in with harvey kynaston and their talk had turned upon this selfsame problem  what will you do when she asks you about it as she must sooner or later the man inquired  and herminia smiling that serene sweet smile of hers made answer at once without a seconds hesitation i shall confess the whole truth to her  but it might be so bad for her harvey kynaston went on  and then he proceeded to bring up in detail casuistic objections on the score of a young girls modesty all of which fell flat on herminias more honest and consistent temperament  i believe in the truth she said simply and im never afraid of it  i dont think a lie or even a suppression can ever be good in the end for any one  the truth shall make you free  that one principle in life can guide one through everything  in the evening when dolly came home her mother ran out proudly and affectionately to kiss her  but dolly drew back her face with a gesture of displeasure nay almost of shrinking  not now mother she cried  i have something to ask you about  till i know the truth i can never kiss you  herminias face turned deadly white she knew it had come at last but still she never flinched  you shall hear the truth from me darling she said with a gentle touch  you have always heard it  they passed under the doorway and up the stairs in silence  as soon as they were in the sittingroom dolly fronted herminia fiercely  mother she cried with the air of a wild creature at bay were you married to my father  herminias cheek blanched and her pale lips quivered as she nerved herself to answer but she answered bravely no darling i was not  it has always been contrary to my principles to marry  your principles dolores echoed in a tone of ineffable scorn your principles  your principles  all my life has been sacrificed to you and your principles  then she turned on her madly once more  and who was my father she burst out in her agony  herminia never paused  she must tell her the truth  your fathers name was alan merrick she answered steadying herself with one hand on the table  he died at perugia before you were born there  he was a son of sir anthony merrick the great doctor in harley street  the worst was out  dolly stood still and gasped  hot horror flooded her burning cheeks  illegitimate illegitimate dishonored from her birth  a mark for every cruel tongue to aim at  born in shame and disgrace  and then to think what she might have been but for her mothers madness  the granddaughter of two such great men in their way as the dean of dunwich and sir anthony merrick  she drew back all aghast  shame and agony held her  something of maiden modesty burned bright in her cheek and down her very neck red waves coursed through her  how on earth after this could she face walter brydges  mother mother she broke out sobbing after a moments pause oh what have you done  what have you done  a cruel cruel mother you have been to me  how can i ever forgive you  herminia gazed at her appalled  it was a natural tragedy  there was no way out of it  she couldnt help seizing the thing at once in a lightning flash of sympathy from dollys point of view too quick womanly instinct made her heart bleed for her daughters manifest shame and horror  dolly dolly the agonized mother cried flinging herself upon her childs mercy as it were dont be hard on me dont be hard on me  my darling how could i ever guess you would look at it like this  how could i ever guess my daughter and his would see things for herself in so different a light from the light we saw them in  you had no right to bring me into the world at all dolly cried growing fiercer as her mother grew more unhappy  if you did you should have put me on an equality with other people  dolly herminia moaned wringing her hands in her despair my child my darling how i have loved you how i have watched over you  your life has been for years the one thing i had to live for i dreamed you would be just such another one as myself  equal with other people  why i thought i was giving you the noblest heritage living woman ever yet gave the child of her bosom  i thought you would be proud of it as i myself would have been proud  i thought you would accept it as a glorious birthright a supreme privilege how could i foresee you would turn aside from your mothers creed how could i anticipate you would be ashamed of being the first freeborn woman ever begotten in england  twas a blessing i meant to give you and you have made a curse of it  you have made a curse of it dolores answered rising and glaring at her  you have blighted my life for me  a good man and true was going to make me his wife  after this how can i dare to palm myself off upon him  she swept from the room though broken with sorrow her step was resolute herminia followed her to her bedroom there dolly sat long on the edge of the bed crying silently silently and rocking herself up and down like one mad with agony at last in one fierce burst she relieved her burdened soul by pouring out to her mother the whole tale of her meeting with walter brydges though she hated her she must tell her herminia listened with deep shame it brought the color back into her own pale cheek to think any man should deem he was performing an act of chivalrous selfdevotion in marrying herminia bartons unlawful daughter alan merricks child the child of so many hopes the baby that was born to regenerate humanity  at last in a dogged way dolly rose once more  she put on her hat and jacket  where are you going her mother asked terrified  i am going out dolores answered to the post to telegraph to him  she worded her telegram briefly but proudly   my mother has told me all  i understand your feeling  our arrangement is annulled  goodby  you have been kind to me   an hour or two later a return telegram came   our engagement remains exactly as it was  nothing is changed  i hold you to your promise  all tenderest messages  letter follows   that answer calmed dollys mind a little  she began to think after allif walter still wanted hershe loved him very much she could hardly dismiss him  when she rose to go to bed herminia very wistful held out her white face to be kissed as usual  she held it out tentatively worlds trembled in the balance but dolly drew herself back with a look of offended dignity  never she answered in a firm voice never again while i live  you are not fit to receive a pure girls kisses  and two women lay awake all that ensuing night sobbing low on their pillows in the marylebone lodginghouse     xxii   it was halfpast nine oclock next morning when the manservant at sir anthony merricks in harley street brought up to his masters room a plain handwritten card on which he read the name dolores barton  does the girl want to blackmail me sir anthony thought testily  the great doctors old age was a lonely and a sordid one  he was close on eighty now but still to this day he received his patients from ten to one and closed his shrivelled hand with a clutch on their guineas  for whom nobody knew  lady merrick was long dead his daughters were well married and he had quarrelled with their husbands  of his two younger sons one had gone into the fusiliers and been speared at suakim the other had broken his neck on a huntingfield in warwickshire  the old man lived alone and hugged his moneybags  they were the one thing left for which he seemed to retain any human affection  so when he read dollys card being by nature suspicious he felt sure the child had called to see what she could get out of him  but when he descended to the consultingroom with stern set face and saw a beautiful girl of seventeen awaiting hima tall sunnyhaired girl with alans own smile and alans own eyeshe grew suddenly aware of an unexpected interest the sun went back on the dial of his life for thirty years or thereabouts and alan himself seemed to stand before him alan as he used to burst in for his holidays from winchester after all this pink rosebud was his eldest sons only daughter  chestnut hair pearly teeth she was alan all over  sir anthony bowed his most respectful bow with oldfashioned courtesy  and what can i do for you young lady he asked in his best professional manner  grandfather the girl broke out blushing red to the ears but saying it out none the less grandfather im your granddaughter dolores barton  the old man bowed once more a most deferential bow  strange to say when he saw her this claim of blood pleased him  so i see my child he answered  and what do you want with me  i only knew it last night dolly went on casting down those blue eyes in her shamefaced embarrassment  and this morning    ive come to implore your protection  thats prompt the old man replied with a curious smile half suspicious half satisfied  from whom my little one  and his hand caressed her shoulder  from my mother dolly answered blushing still deeper crimson from the mother who put this injustice upon me  from the mother who by her own confession might have given me an honorable birthright like any one elses and who cruelly refused to  the old man eyed her with a searching glance  then she hasnt brought you up in her own wild ideas he said she hasnt dinged them into you  she has tried to dolly answered  but i will have nothing to do with them  i hate her ideas and her friends and her faction  sir anthony drew her forward and gave her a sudden kiss  her spirit pleased him  thats well my child he answered  thats wellfor a beginning  then dolly emboldened by his kindnessfor in a moment somehow she had taken her grandfathers heart by assaultbegan to tell him how it had all come about how she had received an offer from a most excellent young man at combe mary in dorsetshirevery well connected the squire of his parish how she had accepted him with joy how she loved him dearly how this shadow intervened how thereupon for the first time she had asked for and learned the horrid truth about her parentage how she was stunned and appalled by it how she could never again live under one roof with such a woman and how she came to him for advice for encouragement for assistance  she flung herself on his mercy  every word she spoke impressed sir anthony  this was no mere acting the girl really meant it  brought up in those hateful surroundings innate purity of mind had preserved her innocent heart from the contagion of example  she spoke like a sensible modest healthy english maiden  she was indeed a granddaughter any man might be proud of twas clear as the sun in the london sky to sir anthony that she recoiled with horror from her mothers position  he sympathized with her and pitied her  dolores all blushes lifted her eyelids and looked at him  her grandfather drew her towards him with a smile of real tenderness and unbending as none had seen him unbend before since alans death told her all the sad history as he himself envisaged it  dolores listened and shuddered  the old man was vanquished  he would have taken her once to himself he said if herminia had permitted it he would take her to himself now if dolores would come to him  as for dolly she lay sobbing and crying in sir anthonys arms as though she had always known him  after all he was her grandfather nearer to her in heart and soul than her mother  and the butler could hardly conceal his surprise and amazement when three minutes later sir anthony rang the bell and being discovered alone with a strange young lady in tears made the unprecedented announcement that he would see no patients at all that morning and was at home to nobody  but before dolly left her newfound relations house it was all arranged between them  she was to come there at once as his adopted daughter was to take and use the name of merrick was to see nothing more of that wicked woman her mother and was to be married in due time from sir anthonys house and under sir anthonys auspices to walter brydges  she wrote to walter then and there from her grandfathers consultingroom  numb with shame as she was she nerved her hand to write to him  in what most delicate language she could find she let him plainly know who sir anthony was and all else that had happened  but she added at the end one significant clause  while my mother lives dear walter i feel i can never marry you     xxiii   when she returned from sir anthonys to her mothers lodgings she found herminia very pale in the sittingroom waiting for her her eyes were fixed on a cherished autotype of a pinturicchia at perugiaalans favorite picture  out of her penury she had bought it  it represented the madonna bending in worship over her divine child and bore the inscription  quem genuit adoravit herminia loved that group  to her it was no mere emblem of a dying creed but a type of the eternal religion of maternity  the mother adoring the child  twas herself and dolly  well herminia said interrogatively as her daughter entered for she half feared the worst  well dolores answered in a defiant tone blurting it out in sudden jerks the rebellion of a lifetime finding vent at last ive been to my grandfather my fathers father and ive told him everything and its all arranged and im to take his name and im to go and live with him  dolly the mother cried and fell forward on the table with her face in her hands  my child my child are you going to leave me  its quite time dolly answered in a sullen stolid voice  i cant stop here of course now im almost grown up and engaged to be married associating any longer with such a woman as you have been  no rightminded girl who respected herself could do it  herminia rose and faced her  her white lips grew livid  she had counted on every element of her martyrdomsave one and this the blackest and fiercest of all had never even occurred to her dolly she cried oh my daughter you dont know what you do you dont know how ive loved you  ive given up my life for you i thought when you came to womans estate and learned what was right and what wrong you would indeed rise up and call me blessed and nowoh dolly this last blow is too terrible  it will kill me my darling  i cant go on outliving it  you will dolly answered  youre strong enough and wiry enough to outlive anything     but i wrote to walter from sir anthonys this morning and told him i would wait for him if i waited forever  for of course while you live i couldnt think of marrying him  i couldnt think of burdening an honest man with such a motherinlaw as you are  herminia could only utter the one word dolly it was a heartbroken cry the last despairing cry of a wounded and stricken creature     xxiv   that night herminia barton went up sadly to her own bedroom  it was the very last night that dolores was to sleep under the same roof with her mother  on the morrow she meant to remove to sir anthony merricks  as soon as herminia had closed the door she sat down to her writingtable and began to write  her pen moved of itself  and this was her letter   my darling daughterby the time you read these words i shall be no longer in the way to interfere with your perfect freedom of action  i had but one task left in lifeto make you happy  now i find i only stand in the way of that object no reason remains why i should endure any longer the misfortune of living  my child my child you must see when you come to think it over at leisure that all i ever did was done up to my lights to serve and bless you  i thought by giving you the father and the birth i did i was giving you the best any mother on earth had ever yet given her dearest daughter  i believe it still but i see i should never succeed in making you feel it  accept this reparation  for all the wrong i may have done all the mistakes i may have made i sincerely and earnestly implore your forgiveness  i could not have had it while i lived i beseech and pray you to grant me dead what you would never have been able to grant me living  my darling i thought you would grow up to feel as i did i thought you would thank me for leading you to see such things as the blind world is incapable of seeing  there i made a mistake and sorely am i punished for it  dont visit it upon my head in your recollections when i can no longer defend myself  i set out in life with the earnest determination to be a martyr to the cause of truth and righteousness as i myself understood them but i didnt foresee this last pang of martyrdom  no soul can tell beforehand to what particular cross the blind chances of the universe will finally nail it  but i am ready to be offered and the time of my departure is close at hand  i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith i started in life with  nothing now remains for me but the crown of martyrdom  my darling it is indeed a very bitter cup to me that you should wish me dead but tis a small thing to die above all for the sake of those we love  i die for you gladly knowing that by doing so i can easily relieve my own dear little girl of one trouble in life and make her course lie henceforth through smoother waters  be happy be happy  goodby my dolly  your mothers love go forever through life with you  burn this blurred note the moment you have read it  i inclose a more formal one giving reasons for my act on other grounds to be put in if need be at the coroners inquest  goodnight my hearts darling  your truly devoted and affectionate  mother  oh dolly my dolly you never will know with what love i loved you   when she had finished that note and folded it reverently with kisses and tears she wrote the second one in a firm hand for the formal evidence then she put on a fresh white dress as pure as her own soul like the one she had worn on the night of her selfmade bridal with alan merrick in her bosom she fastened two innocent white roses from walter brydgess bouquet arranging them with studious care very daintily before her mirror she was always a woman perhaps she thought to herself for her lovers sake my dolly will kiss them when she finds them lying on her dead mothers breast my dolly may kiss them then she cried a few minutes very softly to herself for no one can die without some little regret some consciousness of the unique solemnity of the occasion  at last she rose and moved over to her desk  out of it she took a small glassstoppered phial that a scientific friend had given her long ago for use in case of extreme emergency  it contained prussic acid  she poured the contents into a glass and drank it off  then she lay upon her bed and waited for the only friend she had left in the world with hands folded on her breast like some saint of the middle ages  not for nothing does blind fate vouchsafe such martyrs to humanity from their graves shall spring glorious the church of the future  when dolores came in next morning to say goodby she found her mothers body cold and stiff upon the bed in a pure white dress with two crushed white roses just peeping from her bodice  herminia bartons stainless soul had ceased to exist forever     the end
