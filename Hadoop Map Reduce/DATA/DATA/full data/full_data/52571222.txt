 one evening she went to bed very tired and cross and hot and in the morning when she looked at her arms and legs they were all covered with red spots rather pretty to look at only they were dry and prickly  nurse was frightened when she looked at them  she turned all the little sisters out of the night nursery covered lucy up close and ordered her not to stir certainly not to go into her bath  then there was a whispering and a running about and lucy was half alarmed but more pleased at being so important for she did not feel at all ill and quite enjoyed the tea and toast that nurse brought up to her  just as she was beginning to think it rather tiresome to lie there with nothing to do except to watch the flies buzzing about there was a step on the stairs and up came the doctor  he was an old friend very goodnatured and he made fun with lucy about having turned into a spotted leopard just like the cowry shell on mrs bunkers mantelpiece  indeed he said he thought she was such a curiosity that mrs bunker would come for her and set her up in the museum and then he went away suppose oh suppose she did  mrs bunker or mother bunch as lucy and her brothers and sisters called her was housekeeper to their uncle joseph  he was really their great uncle and they thought him any age you can imagine they would not have been much surprised to hear that he sailed with christopher columbus though he was a strong hale active man much less easily tired than their own papa  he had been a ships surgeon in his younger days and had sailed all over the world and collected all sorts of curious things besides which he was a very wise and learned man and had made some great discovery  it was not america  lucy knew that her elderly brother understood what it was but it was not worth troubling her head about only somehow it made ships go safer and so he had had a pension given him as a reward  he had come home and bought a house about a mile out of town and built up a high room from which to look at the stars with his telescope and to try his experiments in and a long one besides for his museum yet after all he was not much there for whenever there was anything wonderful to be seen he always went off to look at it and whenever there was a meeting of learned menscientific men was the right wordthey always wanted him to help them make speeches and show wonders  he was away now  he had gone away to wear a red cross on his arm and help to take care of the wounded in the sad war between the french and the germans  but he had left mother bunch behind him  nobody knew exactly what was mrs bunkers nation indeed she could hardly be said to have any for she had been born at sea and had been a sailors wife but whether she was mostly english dutch or spanish nobody knew and nobody cared  her husband had been lost at sea and uncle joseph had taken her to look after his house and always said she was the only woman who had sense and discretion enough ever to go into his laboratory or dust his museum  she was very kind and good natured and there was nothing that the children liked better than a walk to uncle josephs and after a play in the garden tea with her  and such quantities of sugar there were in her room such curious cakes made in the fashion of different countries such funny preserves from all parts of the world  and still more delightful such cupboards and drawers full of wonderful things and such stories about them  the younger ones liked mrs bunkers room better than uncle josephs museum where there were some big stuffed beasts with glaring eyes that frightened them and they had to walk round with hands behind that they might not touch anything or else their uncles voice was sure to call out gruffly paws off  mrs bunker was not a bit like the smart housekeepers at other houses  to be sure on sundays she came out in a black silk gown with a little flounce at the bottom a scarlet crape shawl with a blue dragon on ithis wings over her back and a claw over each shoulder so that whoever sat behind her in church was terribly distracted by trying to see the rest of himand a very big yellow tuscan bonnet trimmed with sailors blue ribbon  but during the week and about the house she wore a green gown with a brown holland apron and bib over it quite straight all the way down for she had no particular waist and her hair which was of a funny kind of flaxen grey she bundled up and tied round without any cap or anything else on her head  one of the little boys had once called her mother bunch because of her stories and the name fitted her so well that the whole family and even uncle joseph took it up  lucy was very fond of her but when about an hour after the doctors visit she was waked by a rustling and a lumbering on the stairs and presently the door opened and the second best big bonnetthe gotomarket bonnet with the turned ribbonscame into the room with mother bunchs face under it and the goodnatured voice told her she was to be carried to uncle josephs and have oranges and tamarinds she did begin to feel like the spotted cowryshell to think about being set on the chimneypiece to cry and say she wanted mamma  the nurse and mother bunch began to comfort her and explain that the doctor thought she had the scarlatina not at all badly but that if any of the others caught it nobody could guess how bad they would be especially mamma who had just been ill and so she was to be rolled up in her blankets and put into a carriage and taken to her uncles and there she would stay till she was not only well but could safely come home without carrying infection about with her  lucy was a good little girl and knew that she must bear it so though she could not help crying a little when she found she must not kiss any one nay not even see them and that nobody might go with her but lonicera her own china doll she made up her mind bravely and she was a good deal cheered when clare the biggest and best of all the dolls was sent into her with all her clothes by maude her eldest sister to be her companionit was such an honor and so very kind of maude that it quite warmed the sad little heart  so lucy had her little scarlet flannel dressing gown on and her shoes and stockings and a wonderful old knitted hood with a tippet to it and then she was rolled round and round in all her bedclothes and mrs bunker took her up like a very big baby not letting any one else touch her  how mrs bunker got safe down all the stairs no one can tell but she did and into the carriage and there poor lucy looked back and saw at the windows mammas face and papas and maudes and all the rest all nodding and smiling to her but maude was crying all the time and perhaps mamma was too  the journey seemed very long and lucy was really tired when she was put down at last in a big bed nicely warmed for her and with a bright fire in the room  as soon as she had had some beeftea she went off soundly to sleep and only woke to drink tea give the dolls their supper and put them to sleep  the next evening she was sitting up by the fire and the fourth day she was running about the house as if nothing had ever been the matter with her but she was not to go home for a fortnight and being wet cold dull weather it was not always easy to amuse herself  she had her dolls to be sure and the little dog don to play with and sometimes mr bunker would let her make funny things with the dough or stone the raisins or even help make a pudding but still there was a good deal of time on her hands she had only two books with her and the rash had made her eyes weak so that she did not much like reading them  the notes that every one wrote from home were quite enough for her  what she liked bestthat is when mrs bunker could not attend to herwas to wander about the museum explaining the things to the dolls that is a crocodile lonicera it eats people up and has a little bird to pick its teeth  look clare that bony thing is a skeletonthe skeleton of a lizard  paws off my dear mustnt touch thats amber just like barley sugar only not so nice people make necklaces of it  theres a poor little dead fly inside those are the dear delightful hummingbirds look at their crests just like mammas jewels  see the shells arent they beauties people get pearls out of those great flat ones and dive all down to the bottom of the sea after them mustnt touch my dear only look paws off  one would think that loniceras curved fingers all in one piece and clares blue leather hands had been very moveable and mischievous judging by the number of times this warning came but of course it was lucy herself who wanted it most for her own little plump pinky hands did almost tingle to handle and turn round those pretty shells she wanted to know whether the amber tasted like barleysugar as it looked and there was a little musk deer no bigger than don whom she longed to stroke or still better to let lonicera ride but she was a good little girl and had real sense of honor which never betrays a trust so she never laid a finger on anything but what uncle joe had once given them leave to move  this was a very big pair of globesbigger than globes commonly are now and with more frames round themone great flat one with odd names painted on it and another brass one nearly upright going halfway round from top to bottom and with the globe hung upon it by two pins which lucys elder sisters called the poles or the ends of the axis  the huge round balls went very easily with a slight touch and there was something very charming in making them go whisk whisk whisk now faster now slower now spinning so quickly that nothing on them could be seen now turning slowly and gradually over and showing all that was on them  the mere twirling was quite enough for lucy at first but soon she liked to look at what was on them  one she thought more entertaining than the other  it was covered with wonderful creatures one bear was fastened by his long tail to the pole another bigger one was trotting round a snake was coiling about anywhere a lady stood disconsolate against a rock another sat in a chair a giant sprawled with a club in one hand and a lions skin in the other a big dog and a little dog stood on their hind legs a lion seemed just about to spring on a young maidens head and all were thickly spotted over just as if they had lucys rash with stars big and little and still more strange her brothers declared these were the stars in the sky and this was the way people found their road at sea but if lucy asked how they always said she was not big enough to understand and it had occurred to lucy to ask whether the truth was not that they were not big enough to explain  the other globe was all in pale green with pink and yellow outlines on it and quantities of names  lucy had had to learn some of these names for her geography and she rather kept out of the way of looking at it first till she had really grown tired of all the odd men and women and creatures upon the celestial sphere but by and by she began to roll the other by way of variety     chapter ii  visitors from the south seas   miss lucy youre as quiet as a mouse  not in any mischief said mrs bunker looking into the museum why what are you doing there  im looking at the great big globe that uncle joe said i might touch said lucy  here are all the names just like my lessonbook at home europe africa and america  why bless the child where else should they be  there are all them oceans and seas besides that ive crossed over manys the time with poor ben bunker who was last seen off cape hatteras  what all these great green places with atlantic and pacific on them you dont really mean that youve sailed over them  i should like to make an ant do it on a sunflower seed  how could you mother bunch  you are not small enough  ho ho said the housekeeper laughing does the child think i sailed on that very globe there  i know one learns names said lucy but is it real  real  why missie dont you see its a sort of a picture  theres your photograph now its not as big as you but it shows you and so a chart or a map or a globe is just a picture of the shapes of the coastline of the land and the sea and the rivers in them and mountains and the like  look here  and she made lucy stand on a chair and look at a map of her own town that was hanging against the wall showing her all the chief buildings the churches streets the town hall and at last helping her find her own papas house  when lucy had traced all the corners she had to turn in going from home to uncle joes and had even found little frizzles for the five maple trees before the parsonage she understood that the map was a small picture of the situation of the buildings in the town and thought she could find her way to some new place if she studied it well  then mrs bunker showed her a big map of the whole country and there lucy found the river and the roads and the names of the villages near as she had seen or heard of them and she began to understand that a map or globe really brought distant places into an exceedingly small picture and that where she saw a name and a spot she was to think of houses and churches that a branching black line was a flowing river full of water a curve in a pretty bay shut in with rocks and hills a point jutting out generally a steep rock with a lighthouse on it  and all these places are countries bunchey are they with fields and houses like ours  houses yes and fields but not always like ours miss lucy  and are there little children boys and girls in them all  to be sure there are else how would the world go on  why ive seen them by swarms white or brown or black running down to the shore as soon as the vessel cast anchor and whatever color they were you might be sure of two things miss lucy in which they were all alike  oh what mrs bunker  why in making plenty of noise and in wanting all they could get to eat  but they were little darlings some of them if i only could have got at them to make them a bit cleaner  some of them looked for all the world like the little bronze images your uncle has got in the museum which he brought from italy and they hadnt a rag more clothing on either  they were in india  dear dear to see them tumble about in the surf  oh what fun what fun  i wish i could see them  you would be right glad missie i can tell you if you had been three or four months aboard a vessel with nothing but dry biscuits and salt junk and may be a tin of preserved vegetables just to keep it wholesome to see the black fellows come grinning alongside with their boats and canoes all full of oranges and limes and grapefruit and cocoanuts  doesnt ones mouth fairly water for them  do please sit down theres a good mother bunch and tell me all about them  come please do  suppose i did miss lucy where would your poor uncles preserved ginger be that no one knows from real west indian ginger  oh let me come into your room and you can tell me all the time you are doing the ginger  it is very hot there missie  that will be more like some of the places  ill suppose im there look mrs bunker heres a whole green sea the tiniest little dots all over it  dots  youd hardly see all over one of those dots if you were in one  thats the south sea miss lucy and those are the loveliest isles except may be the west indies that ever i saw  tell me about them please entreated lucy  heres one its name isis isabelsuch a little wee one  i cant tell you much of those south sea isles missie as i made only one voyage among them when bunker chartered the penguin for the sandalwood trade and we did not touch at many for the natives were fierce and savage and thought nothing of coming down with arrows and spears at a boats crew  so we only went to such islands as the missionaries had been to and had made the people more gentle and civil  tell me all about it said lucy following the old woman hither and thither as she bustled about talking all the time and stirring her pan of ginger over the hot plate  how it happened it is not easy to say  the room was very warm and mother bunch went on talking as she stirred and a steam rose up and by and by it seemed to lucy that she had a great sneezing fit and when she looked again into the smoke what did she see but two little black figures faces heads and feet all black but with an odd sort of white garment round their waists and some fine red and green feathers sticking out of their wooly heads  mrs bunker mrs bunker she cried whats this  who are these ugly figures  ugly said the foremost and though it must have been some strange language it sounded like english to lucy  is that the way little white girl speaks to boy and girl that have come all the way from isabel to see her  oh indeed little isabel boy i beg your pardon  i didnt know you were real nor that you could understand me  i am so glad to see you  hush don dont bark so  pig pig i never heard a pig squeak like that said the black stranger  pig  it is a little dog  have you no dogs in your country  pigs go on four legs  that must be pig  what you have nothing that goes on four legs but a pig  what do you eat then besides pig  yams cocoanut fishoh so good and put pig into hole among hot stones make a fire over bake so nice  you shall have some of my tea and see if that is as nice said lucy  what a funny dress you have what is it made of  tapa cloth said the little girl  we get the bark off the tree and then we go hammer hammer thump thump till all the hard thick stuff comes off and lucy looking near saw that the substance was really all a lacework of fibre about as close as the net of nurses caps  is that all your clothes she asked  yes till i am a warrior said the boy then they will tattoo my forehead and arms and breast and legs  tattoo whats that  make little holes and lines all over the skin with a sharp shell and rub in juice that turns it all to blue and purple lines  but doesnt it hurt dreadfully asked lucy  hurt to be sure it does but that will show that i am brave  when father comes home from the war he paints himself white  white  with lime made by burning coral and he jumps and dances and shouts i shall go to the war one of these days  oh no dont said lucy it is horrid  the boy laughed but the little girl whispered good white men say so  some day lavo will go and learn and leave off fighting  lavo shook his head  no not yet i will be brave chief and warrior firstbring home many heads of enemies  ii think it nice to be quiet said lucy andandwont you have some dinner  have you baked a pig asked lavo  i think this is mutton said lucy when the dish came upit is sheeps flesh  lavo and his sister had no notion what sheep were  they wanted to sit crosslegged on the floor but lucy made each of them sit in a chair properly but then they shocked her by picking up the muttonchops and stuffing them into their mouths with their fingers  look here and she showed the knives and forks  oh cried lavo what good spikes to catch fish with and knifeknifeill kill foes much better than shell knife  and ill dig yams said the sister  oh no entreated lucy we have spades to dig with soldiers have swords to fight with these are to eat with  i can eat much better without said lavo but to please lucy his sister did try slashing hard away with her knife and digging her fork straight into a bit of meat  then she very nearly ran it into her eye and lucy who knew it was not good manners to laugh was very near choking herself  and at last saying the knife and fork were great goodgreat good but none for eating they stuck them through the great tortoise shell rings they had in their ears and noses  lucy was distressed about uncle josephs knives and forks which she knew she ought not to give away but while she was looking about for mrs bunker to interfere don seemed to think it his business and began to growl and fly at the little black legs  a tree a tree cried the isabelites wheres a tree  and while they spoke lavo had climbed up the side of the door and was sitting astride on the top of it grinning down at the dog and his sister had her feet on the lock going up after him  tree houses they cried there we are safe from our enemies  and lucy found rising before her instead of her own nursery a huge tree on the top of a mound  basketwork had been woven between the branches to make floors and on these were huts of bamboo cane there were ladders hanging down made of strong creepers twisted together and above and around the cries of cockatoos and parrots and the chirp of grasshoppers rang in her ears  she laid hold of the ladder of creeping plants and began to climb but soon her head swam she grew giddy and called out to lavo to help her  then suddenly she found herself curled up in mrs bunkers big beehive chair and she wondered whether she had been asleep     chapter iii  italy   if i could have such another funny dream said lucy  mother bunch have you ever been to italy and she put her finger on the long leg and foot kicking at threecornered sicily  yes missie that i have come out of this cold room and ill tell you  lucy was soon curled in her chair but no she wasnt  she was under a blue blue sky as she had never dreamt of clear sharp purple hills rose up against it  there was a rippling little fountain bursting out of a rock carved with old old carvings broken now and defaced but shadowed over by lovely maidenhair fern and trailing bindweed and in a niche above a little roof a figure of the blessed virgin  some way off stood a long low house propped up against the rich yellow stone walls and pillars of another old old building and with a great chestnuttree shadowing it  it had a balcony and the gable end was open and full of big yellow pumpkins and clusters of grapes hung up to dry and some goats were feeding round  then came a merry merry voice singing something about la vendemmia and though lucy had never learnt italian her wonderful dream knowledge made her sure that this meant the vintage the grapegathering presently there came along a youth playing a violin and a little girl singing  and a whole party of other children all loaded with as many grapes as they could carry came leaping and singing after them their black hair loose or sometimes twisted with vineleaves their big black eyes dancing with merriment and their bare brown legs with glee  ah cecco cecco cried the little girl pausing as she beat her tambourine heres a stranger who has no grapes bring them here  but said lucy arent they your mammas grapes may you give them away  ah ah tis the vendemmia all may eat grapes as much as they will  see theres the vineyard  lucy saw on the slope of the hill above the cottage long poles such as hops grow upon and clusters hanging down  men in shady battered hats bright sashes and braces and white shirt sleeves and women with handkerchiefs folded square over their heads were cutting the grapes down and piling them up in baskets and a low cart drawn by two mousecolored oxen with enormous wide horns and gentlelooking eyes was waiting to be loaded with baskets  to the winepress to the press shouted the children who were politeness itself and wanted to show her everything  the winepress was a great marble trough with pipes leading off into other vessels around  into it went the grapes and in the midst were men and boys and little children all with bare feet and legs up to the knees dancing and leaping and bounding and skipping upon the grapes while the red juice covered their brown skins  come in come in you dont know how charming it is cried cecco it is the best time of all the year the dear vintage come in and tread the grapes  but you must take off your shoes and stockings said his sister nunziata we never wear them but on sundays and holidays  lucy was not sure that she might but the children looked so joyous and it seemed to be such fun that she began fumbling with the buttons of her boots and while she was doing it she opened her eyes and found that her beautiful bunch of grapes was only the cushion in the bottom of mother bunchs chair     chapter iv  greenland   now suppose i tried what the very cold countries are like  and lucy bent over the globe till she was nearly ready to cut her head off with the brass meridian as she looked at the long jagged tongue with no particular top to it hanging down on the east side of america  perhaps it was the making herself so cold that did it but she found herself in the midst of snow snow snow  all was snow except the sea and that was a deep green and in it were monstrous floating white things pinnacled all over like a cathedral and as big and with hollows in them of glorious deep blue and green like jewels lucy knew they were icebergs  a sort of fringe of these cliffs of ice hemmed in the shore  and on one of them stood what she thought at first was a little brown bear for the light was odd the sun was so very low down and there was so much glare from the snow that it seemed unnatural  however before she had time to be afraid of the bear she saw that it was really a little boy with a hood and coat and leggings of thick thick fur and a spear in his hand with which he every now and then made a dash at a fishgreat cod fish such as mamma had often on a friday  into them went his spear up came the poor fish which was strung with some others on a string the boy carried  lucy crept up as well as she could on the slippery ice and the little esquimaux stared at her with a kind of stupid surprise  is that the way you get fish she asked  yes and seals father gets them he said  oh whats that swimming out there  thats a white bear he said coolly we had better get home  lucy thought so indeed only where was homethat puzzled her however she trotted along by the side of her companion and presently came to what might have been an enormous snowball but there was a hole in it  yes it was hollow and as her companion made for the opening she saw more little stout figures rolled up in furs inside  then she perceived that it was a house built up of blocks of snow arranged so as to make the shape of a beehive all frozen together and with a window of ice  it made her shiver to think of going in but she thought the white bear might come after her and in she went  even her little head had to bend under the low doorway and behold it was the very closest stuffiest if not the hottest place she had ever been in  there was a kind of lamp burning in the hut that is a wick was floating in some oil but there was no glass such as lucy had been apt to think the chief part of a lamp and all round it squatted upon skins these queer little stumpy figures dressed so much alike that there was no knowing the men from the women except that the women had much bigger boots and used them instead of pockets and they had their babies in bags of skin upon their backs  they seemed to be kind people for they made room near their lamp for the little girl and asked her where she had been wrecked then one of the women cut off a great lump of raw somethingwas it a walrus with that round head and big tusksand held it up to her and when lucy shook her head and said no thank you as civilly as she could the woman tore it in two and handed a lump over her shoulder to her baby who began to gnaw it  then her first friend the little boy hoping to please her better offered her some drink  ah it was oil just like the oil that was burning in the lamphorrid oil from the whales  she could not help shaking her head and so much that she woke herself up     chapter v  tyrol   suppose i could see where that dear little black chamois horn came from  but mother bunch cant tell me about that im afraid for she always went by sea and heres the tyrol without one bit of sea near it  its just one of the strings to the great knot of mountains that tie europe up in the middle  oh what is a mountain like  then suddenly came on lucys ears a loud blast like a trumpet another answered it farther off another fainter still and as she started up she found she was standing on a little shelf of green grass with steep slopes of stones and rock above below and around her and rising up all round were huge tall hills their smooth slopes green and grassy but in the steep places all terrible cliff and precipice and as they were seen further away they looked a beautiful purple like a thundercloud  close to lucy grew blue gentians like those in mammas garden and alpine roses and black orchids but she did not know how to come down and was getting rather frightened when a clear little voice said little lady have you lost your way  wait till the evening hymn is over and ill come and help you and then lucy stood and listened while from all the peaks whence the horns had been blown there came the strong sweet sound of an evening hymn all joining together while there arose distant echoes of others farther away when it was over one shout of jodel echoed from each point and then all was still except for the tinkling of a cowbell  thats the way we wish each other good night said the little girl as the shadows mounted high on the tops of the mountains leaving them only peaks of rosy light  now come to the chalet and sister rose will give you some milk  help me  im afraid said lucy  that is nothing said the mountain maiden springing up to her like a kid in spite of her great heavy shoes you should see the places father and seppel climb when they hunt the chamois  what is your name asked lucy who much liked the looks of her little companion in her broad straw hat with a bunch of alpine roses in it her thick striped frock and white body and sleeves braced with black ribbon it was such a pleasant fresh open face with such rosy cheeks and kindly blue eyes that lucy felt quite at home  i am little katherl  this is the first time i have come up with rose to the chalet but i am big enough to milk the cows now  ah do you see daisy the black one with a white tuft  she is our leading cow and she knows it the darling  she never lets the others get into dangerous places she leads them home at the sound of a horn and when we go back to the village she will lead the herd with a flower on the point of each horn and a wreath round her neck  the men will come up for us seppel and all and may be seppel will bring the prize medal for shooting with the rifle  but what do you do up here  we girls go up for the summer with the cows to the pastures the grass is so rich and good on the mountains and we make butter and cheese  wait and you shall taste  sit down on the stone  lucy was glad to hear that promise for the fresh mountain air had made her hungry  katherl skipped away towards a house with a projecting wooden balcony and deep eaves beautifully carved and came back with a slice of bread and delicious butter and a good piece of cheese all on a wooden platter and a little bowl of new milk  lucy thought she had never tasted anything so nice  and now the gracious little lady will rest a little while said katherl whilst i go and help rose to strain the milk  so lucy waited but she felt so tired with her scramble that she could not help nodding off to sleep though she would have liked very much to have stayed longer with the dear little tyrolese but we know by this time where she always found herself when she awoke     chapter vi  africa   oh oh here is a little dried crocodile come alive and opening a horrid great mouth lined with terrible teeth at her  no he is no longer in the museum he is in a broad river yellow heavy and thick with mud the borders are crowded with enormous reeds and rushes there is no getting through no breaking away from him here he comes horrid horrid beast  oh how could lucy have been so foolish as to want to travel in africa up to the higher parts of the nile  how will she ever get back again  he will gobble her up her and clare who was trusted to her and what will mamma and sister do  hark  theres a cry a great shout and out jumps a little black figure with a stout club in his hand  crash it goes down on the head of master crocodile  the ugly beast is turning over on its back and dying  then lucy has time to look at the little negro and he has time to look at her  what a droll figure he is with his wooly head and thick lips the whites of his eyes and his teeth gleaming so brightly and his fat little black person shining all over as well it may for he is rubbed from head to foot with castoroil  there it grows on the bush with broad beautiful folded leaves and red stems and the pretty grey and black nuts  lucy only wishes the negroes would keep it all to polish themselves with and not send any home  she wants to give the little black fellow some reward for saving her from the crocodile and luckily clare has on her long necklace of blue glass beads  she puts it into his hand and he twists it round his black wool and cuts such dances and capers for joy that lucy can hardly stand for laughing but the sun shines scorching hot upon her and she gets under the shade of a tall date palm with big leaves all shooting out together at the top and fine bunches of dates below all fresh and green not like those papa sometimes gives her at dessert  the little negro tojo asks if she would like some  he takes her by the hand and leads her into a whole cluster of little round mud huts telling her that he is tojo the kings son she is his little sister and these are all his mothers  which is his real mother lucy cannot quite make out for she sees an immense party of black women all shiny and polished with a great many beads wound round their heads necks ankles and wrists and nothing besides the tiniest short petticoats and all the fattest are the smartest indeed they have gourds of milk beside them and are drinking it all day long to keep themselves fat  no sooner however is lucy led in among them than they all close round some singing and dancing and others laughing for joy and crying welcome little daughter from the land of spirits  and then she finds out that they think she is really tojos little sister who died ten moons ago come back again from the grave as a white spirit  tojos own mother a very fat woman indeed holds out her arms as big as bedposts and terribly greasy gives her a dose of sour milk out of a gourd makes her lie down with her head in her lap and begins to sing to her till lucy goes to sleep and wakes very glad to see the crocodile as brown and hard and immovable as ever and that odd round gourd with a little hole in it hanging up near the ceiling     chapter vii  laplanders   it shall not be a hot country next time said lucy though after all the whale oil was not much worse than the castor oilmother bunch did your whaler always go to greenland and never to any nicer place  well missie once we were driven between foul winds and icebergs up into a fiord near north cape right at midsummer and ill never forget what we saw there  lucy was not likely to forget either for she found herself standing by a narrow inlet of sea as blue and smooth as a lake and closely shut in except where the bare rock was too steep or where on a somewhat smoother shelf stood a timbered house with a farmyard and barns all round it  but the odd thing was that the sun was where she had never seen him beforequite in the north making all the shadows come the wrong way  but how came the sun to be visible at all so very late  ah she knew it now this was norway and at this time of the year there was no night at all  and here beside her was a little fellow with a bow and arrows such as she had never seen before except in the hands of the little cupids in the pictures in the drawingroom  mother bunch had said that the little brown boys in india looked like the bronze cupid who was on the mantleshelf but this little boy was white or rather sallowfaced and well dressed too in a tight round leather cap and a dark blue kind of shaggy gown with hairy leggings and what he was shooting at was some kind of wildduck or goose that came tumbling down heavily with the arrow right through its neck  there said the boy ill take that and sell it to the norse farmers wife up in the house above there  who are you then said lucy  im a lapp  we live on the hills where the norseman has not driven us away and where the reindeer find their grass in summer and moss in winter  oh have you got reindeer  i should so like to see them and to drive in a sledge  the boy whose name was peder laughed and said you cant go in a sledge except when it is winter with snow and ice to go upon but ill soon show you a reindeer  then he led the way past the deliciously smelling whispering pine woods that sheltered the norwegian homestead past a seater or mountain meadow where the girls were pasturing their cows much like lucys friends in the tyrol then out upon the gray moorland where there was an odd little cluster of tents covered with skins and droll little short stumpy people running about them  peder gave a curious long cry put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a lump of salt  presently a pair of long horns appeared then another then a whole herd of the deer with big heads and horns growing a good deal forward  the salt was held to them and a rope was fastened to all their horns that they might stand still in a line while the little lapp women milked them  peder went up to one of the women and brought back a little cupful of milk for his visitor it was all that one deer gave but it was so rich as to be almost like drinking cream  he led her into one of the tents but it was very smoky and not much cleaner than the tent of the esquimaux  it is a wonder how lucy could go to sleep there but she did heartily wishing herself somewhere else     chapter viii  china   was it the scent of the perfumed tea a present from an old sailor friend which mrs bunker was putting away or was it the sight of the red jar ornamented with blackandgold men with round caps long petticoats and pigtails that caused lucy next to open her eyes upon a cane sofa with cushions ornamented with figures in colored silks  the floor of the room was of shining inlaid wood there were beautifully woven mats all round stands made of red lacquer work and seats of cane and bamboo and there was a round window through which could be seen a beautiful garden full of flowering shrubs and trees a clear pond lined with colored tiles in the middle and over the wall the gilded roof of a pagoda like an umbrella only all in ridge and furrow and with a little bell at every spoke  beyond were beautifully and fantastically shaped hills and a lake below with pleasure boats on it  it was all wonderfully like a pretty china bowl come to life and lucy knew she was in china even before there came into the room toddling upon her poor little tiny feet a young lady with a small yellow face little slips of eyes sloping upwards from her flat nose and black hair combed up very tight from her face and twisted with flowers and ornaments  she had ever so many robes on the edge of one peeping out below the other and at the top a sort of blue chinacrape tunic with very wide loose sleeves dropping an immense way from her hands  there was no gathering in at the waist and it reached to her knees where a still more splendid white silk embroidered trailed along  she had a big fan in her hand but when she saw the visitor she went up to a beautiful little low table with an ivory frill round it where stood some dainty delicate teacups and saucers  into one of these she put a little ball about as big as an oakapple of tealeaves a maid dressed like herself poured hot water on it and handed it on a lacquerwork tray  lucy took it said thank you and then waited  is it not good said the little hostess  it must be  you are the real tea people said lucy but i was waiting for sugar and milk  that would spoil it said the chinese damsel only outer barbarians would think of such a thing  and ah i see you are one  see kihi what monstrous feet  they are not bigger than your maids said lucy rather disgusted why are yours so small  because my mother and nurse took care of me when i was a baby and bound them up that they might not grow big and ugly like those of the poor creatures who have to run about for their husbands feed silk worms and tend ducks  but shouldnt you like to walk without almost tumbling down said lucy  no indeed  me a daughter of a mandarin of the blue button  you are a mere barbarian to think a lady ought to want to walk  do you not see that i never do anything  look at my lovely nails  i think they are claws said lucy do you never break them  no when they are a little longer i shall wear silver shields for them as my mother does  and do you really never work  i should think not said the young lady scornfully fanning herself i leave that to the common folk who are obliged to  come with me and let me lean on you and i will give you a peep through the lattice that you may see that my father is far above making his daughter work  see there he sits with his moustachios hanging down to his chin and his pigtail to his heels and the blue dragon embroidered on his breast watching while they prepare the hall for a grand dinner  there will be a stew of puppy dog and another of kittens and birdsnest soup and then the players will come and act part of the ninenight tragedy and we will look through the lattice  ah father is smoking opium that he may be serene and in good spirits  does it make your head ache  ah that is because your are a mere outer barbarian  she is asleep kihi lay her on the sofa and let her sleep  how ugly her pale hair is almost as bad as her big feet     chapter ix  kamschatka   lucy had been disappointed at not having a drive with the reindeer and she had been telling don how useful his relations were in other places  behold she awoke in a wide plain where as far as her eye could reach there was nothing but snow  the few firtrees that stood in the distance were heavily laden and lucy herselfwhere was she  going very fast  yes whisking over the snow with all her might and main and muffled up in cloaks and furs as indeed was necessary for her breath froze upon the big muffler round her throat so that it seemed to become as hard as a stone wall and by her side was a little boy muffled up quite as close with a cap or rather hood casing his whole head his hands gloved in fur up to the elbows and long fur boots  he had an immense long whip in his hand and was flourishing it and striking with itat what  they were an enormous way off from him but they really were very big dogs rushing along like the wind and bearing along with themwhat lucys ambitiona sledge a thing without wheels but gliding along most rapidly on the hard snow flying flying almost fast enough to take away her breath and leaving birds foxes and any creature she saw for one instant far behind  andwhat was very oddthe young driver had no reins he shouted at the dogs and now and then threw a stick at them and they quite seemed to understand and turned when he wanted them to turn  lucy wondered how he or they knew the way it all seemed such a waste of snow they went so fast that at first she was unable to speak then she ventured on gasping out well ive been in an express train but this beats it  where are you going  to petropawlowsky to change these skins for coffee and rice and rice answered the boy  what skins are they asked lucy  bearsbig brown bears that father killed in a caveand wolves and those of the little ermine and sable that we trap  we get much much for the white ermine and his black tail  fathers coming in another sledge with oh such a big pile  dont you hear his dogs yelp  well win the race yet  ugh hoo hoo hooooon on lazy ones on i say dont let the old dogs catch the young ones  crack crack went the whip the dogs yelped with eagernessthey dont bark those northern dogs the little kamschatkadale bawled louder and louder and never saw when lucy rolled off behind and was left in the middle of a huge snowdrift while he flew on with his load  here were his fathers dogs overtaking her and then some one was picking her up  no it was don and here was mrs bunker exclaiming well if here is not miss lucy asleep on masters old bearskin     chapter x  the turk   what a beautiful long necklace mrs bunker  may i have it for lonicera  you may play with it while you are here missie if youll take care not to break the string but it is too curious for you to take home and lose  it is what they call a turkish rosary they say it is made of roseleaves reduced to a paste and squeezed ever so hard together and that the poor ladies that are shut up in the harems have little or nothing to do but to run them through their fingers  it has a very nice smell said lucy examining the dark brown beads which hung loosely on their string and letting them fall one by one through her hands till of course that happened which she was hoping for she woke on a long low sofa in the midst of a room all carpet and cushions in bright colors and gorgeous patterns curling about with no particular meaning and with a window of rich brass latticework  and by her side there was an odd bubbling that put her in mind of blowing the soapsuds into a froth when preparing them for bubble blowing but when she looked round she saw something very unlike the long pipes her big brother used or the basin of soapsuds there was a beautifully shaped glass bottle and into it went a very long twisting tube like a snake coiled on the floor and the other end of the serpent instead of a head had an amber mouthpiece which went between a pair of lips  lucy knew it for a hubblebubble or turkish pipe and saw that the lips were in a brown face with big black eyes round which dark bluish circles were drawn the jetblack hair was carefully braided with jewels and over it was thrown a purple satin sort of pelisse over a white silk embroidered vest tied in with a sash striped with all manner of colors also immense wide white trousers out of which peeped a pair of brown bare feet on which however were a splendid pair of slippers curled up at the toes  the owner seemed to be very little older than lucy and sat gravely looking at her for a little while then clapped her hands  a black woman came and the young turkish maiden said bring coffee for the little frank lady  so a tiny table of motherofpearl was brought and on it some exquisite little striped porcelain cups standing not in saucers but in silver filigree cups into which they exactly fitted  lucy remembered her chinese experience and did not venture to ask for milk or sugar but she found that the real turkish coffee was so pure and delicate that she could drink it without  where are your jewels then asked the little hostess  im not old enough to have any  how old are you  nine  nine  im only ten and i shall be married next week  married  oh no you are joking  yes i shall  selim bey has paid my father the dowry for me and i shall be taken to his house next week  and i suppose you like him very much  he looks big and tall said the child with exultation  i saw him riding when i went with my mother to the sweet waters  amina she said there is your lord in the frankish coatwith the white horse  have you not talked to him asked lucy  what should i do that for said amina  aunt bessie used to like to talk to nobody but uncle frank before they were married replied lucy  i shall talk enough when i am married replied the little turk i shall make him give me plenty of sweetmeats and a carriage with two handsome bullocks and the biggest nubian black slave in the market to drive me to sweet waters in a thin blue veil with all my jewels on  father says that selim bey will give me everything and a frank governess  what is a governess  is it anything like the little gold case you have round your neck  my locket with mammas hair  oh no no said lucy laughing a governess is a lady to teach you  i dont want to learn any more said amina much disgusted i shall tell him i can make sweetmeats and roll roseleaves  what should i learn for  should you not like to read and write  teaching is only meant for men replied amina  they have got to read the koran but it is all ugly letters i wont learn to read  you dont know how nice it is to read stories all about different countries said lucy  ah i wish i was in the schoolroom at home and i would show you how pleasant it is  and lucy seemed to have her wish all at once for she and amina stood in her own schoolroom but with no one else there  the first thing amina did was to scream oh what shocking windows even men can see in shut them up  she rolled herself up in her veil and lucy could only satisfy her by pulling down all the blinds after which she ventured to look about a little  what have you to sit on she asked with great disgust  chairs and stools said lucy laughing and showing them  these little tables with four legs  how can you sit on them  lucy sat down and showed her  that is not sitting she said and she tried to curl herself up crosslegged  our teacher always makes us write a long grammar lesson if she sees us sitting with our legs crossed said lucy laughing with much amusement at aminas attempts to wriggle herself up on the stool from which she nearly fell  ah i will never have a governess cried amina  i will cry and cry and give selim bey no rest till he promises to let me alone  what a dreadful place this is  where can you sleep  in bed to be sure said lucy  i see no cushions to lie on  no we have bedrooms and beds there  we should not think of taking off our clothes here  what should you undress for  to sleep of course  how horrible  we sleep in all our clothes wherever we like to lie down  we never undress but for the bath  do you go to the bath  i have a bath every morning when i get up in my own room  bathe at home  then you never see your friends  we meet at the bath and talk and play and laugh  meet bathing  no indeed  we meet at home and out of doors said lucy my friend annie and i walk together  walk together what in the street  shocking  you cannot be a lady  indeed i am said lucy coloring up  my papa is a gentleman  and see how many books we have and how much we have to learn  french and music and sums and grammar and history and geography  i will not be a frank  no no  i will not learn said the alarmed amina on hearing this catalogue poured forth  geography is very nice said lucy here are our maps  i will show you where you live  this is constantinople  i live at stamboul said amina scornfully  there is stamboul in little letters belowlook  that stamboul  the frank girl is false stamboul is a large large beautiful place not a little black speck  i can see it from my lattice  white houses and mosques in the sun and the blue golden horn with the little vessels gliding along  before lucy could explain the door opened and one of her brothers put in his head  at once amina began to scream and roll herself in the window curtain  a man in the harem  oh oh oh  were there no slippers at the door  and her screaming awoke lucy who found herself at her uncle joes again     chapter xi  switzerland   i liked the mountain girl best of all thought lucy  i wonder whether i shall ever get among the mountains again  theres a great stick in the corner that uncle joe calls his alpenstock ill go and read the names upon it  they are the names of all the mountains where he has used it  she read mount blanc mount cenis the wengern and so on and of course as she read and sung them over to herself they lulled her off into her wonderful dreams and brought her this time into a meadow steep and sloping but full of flowers the loveliest flowers of all kinds growing among the long grass that waved over them  the fresh clear air was so delicious that she almost hoped she was back in her dear tyrol but the hills were not the same  she saw upon the slope quantities of cows goats and sheep feeding just as on the tyrolese alps but beyond was a dark row of pines and above in the sky as it were rose all round great sharp pointslike clouds for their whiteness but not in their straight jagged outlines  and here and there the deep gray clefts between seemed to spread into white rivers or over the ruddy purple of the halfdistance came sharp white lines darting downwards  as she sat up in the grass and looked about her a bark startled her  a dog began to growl bark and dance round her so that she would have been much frightened if the next moment a voice had not called him offfie brilliant down let the little girl alone he is good madamoiselle never fear  he helps me keep the cows  who are you then  i am maurice the little herdboy  i live with my grandmother and work for her  what in keeping cows  yes and look here  oh the delicious little cottage  it has eaves and windows and balconies and a door and little cows and sheep and men and women all in pretty white wood  you did not make it maurice  yes truly i did i cut it out with my knife all myself  how clever you must be  and what shall you do with it  i shall watch for a carriage with ladies winding up that long road and then i shall stand and take off my hat and hold out my cottage perhaps they will buy it and then i shall have enough to get grandmother a warm gown for the winter  when i grow bigger i will be a guide like my father  a guide  yes to lead travellers up to the mountaintops  there is nowhere you english will not go  the harder a mountain is to climb the more bent you are on going up  and oh i shall love it too  there are the great glaciers the broad streams of ice that fill up the furrows of the mountains with the crevasses so blue and beautiful and cruel  it was in one of them my father was swallowed up  ah then how can you love them said lucy  because they are so grand and so beautiful said maurice  no other place has the like and they make ones heart swell with wonder and joy in the god who made them  and maurices eyes sparkled and lucy looked at the clear stern glory of the mountain points and felt as if she understood him     chapter xii  the cossack   caper caper dance dance  what a wonderful dance it was just as if the little fellow had been made of cork so high did he bound the moment he touched the ground while he jerked out his arms and legs as if they were pulled by strings like the marionettes that had once performed in front of the window  only his face was all fun and life and he did look so proud and delighted to show what he could do and it was all in clear fresh open air the whole extent covered with short green grass upon which were grazing herds of small lean horses and flocks of sheep without tails but with their wool puffed out behind into a sort of bustle or panier there was a cluster of clean whitelooking houses in the distance and lucy knew that she was in the great plains called the steppes that lie between the rivers volga and don  do you live there she asked by way of beginning the conversation  yes my father is the hetman of the stantitza and these are my holidays  i go to school at tcherkask the greater part of the year  tcherkask  oh what a funny name  and you would think it a funny town if you were there  it is built on a great bog by the side of the river volga all the houses stand on piles of timber and in the spring the streets are full of water and one has to sail about in boats  oh that must be delicious  i dont like it as much as coming home and riding  see and as he whistled one of the horses came whinnying up and put his nose over the boys shoulder  good fellow  but your horses are thin they look little  little cried the young cossack  why do you know what our little horses can do  there are not many armies in europe that they have not ridden down at one time or another  why the church at tcherkask is hung all round with colors we have taken from our enemies  theres the swededidnt charles xii get the worst of it when he came in his big boots after the cossackay and the turk and the austrian and the french  ah doesnt my grandfather tell how he rode his good little horse all the way from the volga to the seine and the good czar alexander himself gave him the medal with not unto us but unto thy name be the praise  our father the czar does not think so little of us and our horses as you do young lady  i beg your pardon said lucy i did not know what your horses could do  oh you did not  that is some excuse for you  ill show you  and in one moment he was on the back of his little horse leaning down on its neck and galloping off over the green plain like the wind but it seemed to lucy as if she had only just watched him out of sight on one side before he was close to her on the other having whirled round and cantered close up to her while she was looking the other way  come up with me he said and in one moment she had been swept up before him on the little horses neck and was flying so wildly over the steppes that her breath and sense failed her and she knew no more till she was safe by mrs bunkers fireside again     chapter xiii  spain   suppose now i go to sleep again what should i like to see next a sunny place i think where there is sea to look at  shall it be spain and shall it be among the poor people  well i think i should be where there is a little lady girl  i hope they are not all as lazy and conceited as the chinese and the turk  so lucy awoke in a large cool room with a marble floor and heavy curtains but with little furniture except one table and a row of chairs ranged along the wall  it had two windows one looking out into a gardensuch a gardenorangetrees with shining leaves and green and golden fruit and white flowers and jasmines and great lilies standing round about a marble court  in the midst of this court was a basin of red marble where a fountain was playing making a delicious splashing and out beyond these sparkled in the sun the loveliest and most delicious of blue seasthe same blue sea indeed that lucy had seen in her italian visit  that window was empty but the other which looked out into the street had cushions laid on the sill an openwork stone ledge beyond and little lookingglasses on either side  leaning over this sill there was seated a little maiden in a white frock but with a black lace veil fastened by a rose into her jetblack hair and the daintiest prettiestshaped little feet imaginable in white satin shoes which could be plainly seen as she knelt on the windowseat  what are you looking at asked lucy coming to her side  im watching for the procession  then i shall go to church with mamma  look  that way we shall see it come these two mirrors reflect everything up and down the street  are you dressed for church asked lucy  you have no hat on  where does your grace come from not to know that a mantilla is what is for church  mamma is being dressed in her black silk and her black mantilla  and your shoes  i could not wear great coarse hard shoes said the little dona ines it would spoil my feet  ah i shall have time to show the senorita what i can do  can your grace dance  i danced with uncle joe at our last christmas party said lucy with great dignity  see now cried the spaniard stand there  ah have you no castanets  and she quickly took out two very small ivory shells or bowls each pair fastened together by a loop through which she passed her thumb so that the little spoons hung on her palm and she could snap them together with her fingers  then she began to dance round lucy in the most graceful swimming way now rising now falling and cracking her castanets together at intervals  lucy tried to do the same but her limbs seemed like a wooden dolls compared with the suppleness and ease of ines  she made sharp corners and angles where the spaniard floated so like a seabird that it was like seeing her fly or float rather than merely dance till at last the very watching her rendered lucy drowsy and dizzy and as the church bells began to ring and the chant of the procession to sound she lost all sense of being in sunny malaga the home of grapes     chapter xiv  germany   there was a great murmur and buzz of learning lessons rows upon rows of little boys were sitting before desks studying very few heads looked up as lucy found herself walking round the rooma large clean room with maps hanging on the walls but hot and wearyfeeling because there were no windows open and so little fresh air  what are you about little boy she asked  i am learning my verb he said moneo mones monet  lucy waited no longer but moved off to another desk  and what are you doing  i am writing my analysis  lucy did not know what an analysis was so she went a little further what are you doing here she said timidly for these were somewhat bigger boys  we are writing an essay on the individuality of self  that was enough to frighten any one away and lucy betook herself to some quite little boys with fat rosy faces and light hair  are you busy too  oh yes we are learning the chief cities of the fatherland  lucy felt like the little boy in the fable who could not get either the dog or the bird or the bee to play with him  when do you play she asked  we have an hours interval after dinner and another at suppertime but then we prepare our work for the morrow said one of the boys looking up well satisfied  work work  are you always at work exclaimed lucy i only study from nine to twelve and half an hour to get my lessons in the afternoon  you are a maiden said the little boy with civil superiority your brothers study more hours  more yes but not so many as you do  they play from twelve till two and have a holiday on saturday  so you are not industrious  we are  that is the reason why we can all act together and think together so much better than any others and we all stand as one irresistible power the united germany  lucy have a little gasp it was all so very wise  may i see your sisters she said  the little sisters gretchens and katchens were learning away almost as hard as the hermanns and fritzes but the bigger sisters had what lucy thought a better time of it  one of them was helping in the kitchen and another in the ironing but then they had their books and their music and in the evening all the families came out into the pleasure gardens and had little tables with coffee before them and the mamma knitted and the papas smoked and the young ladies listened to the band  on the whole lucy thought she should not mind living in germany if they would not have so many lessons to learn     chapter xv  paris in the siege   and uncle joe is in france where the fathers and brothers of those little prussian boys have been fighting  i wish i could see it  there was a thunder and a whizzing in the air and a sharp rattling noise besides a strange damp unwholesome smell too mixed with that of gunpowder and when lucy looked up she found herself down some steps in a dark dull vaultedlooking place lined with stone however and open to the street above  a little lamp was burning in a corner piles of straw and bits of furniture were lying about and upon one of the bundles of straw sat a little roughhaired girl  ah madamoiselle good morning she said  are you come here to take shelter from the shells  the battery is firing now i do not think mamma will come home till it slackens a little  she is gone to my brother who is weak after his wounds  i wish i could offer you something but we have nothing but water and it is not even sugared  do you live down her asked lucy looking round at the dreary place with wonder  not always  we used to have a pretty little house over this but the cruel shells came crashing in and flew into pieces tearing everything to splinters and we are only safe from them down here ah if i could only have shown you mammas pretty room  but there is a great hole in the floor now and the ceiling is all tumbling down and the table broken  but why do you stay here  mamma and emily say it is all the same  we are as safe in our cellar as we could be anywhere and we should have to pay elsewhere  then you cannot get out of paris  oh no while the prussians are all around us and shut us in  my brothers are all in the garde mobile and you see so is my doll every one must be a soldier now  my dear adolphe hold yourself straight  and there the doll certainly showed himself perfectly drilled and disciplined  marchright foot forwardleft foot forward  but in this movement as may be well supposed little coralie had to help her recruit a good deal  lucy was surprised  so you can play even in this dreadful place she said  oh yes  whats the use of crying and wearying ones self  i do not mind as long as they leave me my kitten my dear little minette  oh what a pretty longhaired kitten  but how small and thin  yes truly the poor minette  the cruel people ate her mother and there is no milkno milk and my poor minette is almost starved though i give her bits of my bread and soup but the bread is only bran and sawdust and she likes it no more than i  ate up her mother  yes  she was a superb cyprus cat all gray but alas one day she took a walk in the street and they caught her and then indeed it was all over with her  i only hope minette will not get out but she is so lean that they would find little but bones and fur  ah how i wish i could take you and her home to uncle joe and give you both good bread and milk  take my hand and shut your eyes and we will wish and wish very hard and perhaps you will come there with me  paris is not very far off     chapter xvi  the american guest   no wishing very hard did not bring poor little french coralie home with lucy but something almost as wonderful happened  just at the time in the afternoon when lucy used to ride off on her dream to visit some wonderful place there came a ring at the front door a quite real substantial ring that did not sound at all like any of the strange noises of the strange worlds that she had lately been hearing but had the real tinkle of uncle joes own bell  well said mrs bunker what can that be coming at this time of day  it can never be the doctor coming home without sending orders dont you be running out miss lucy therell be a draught of cold air right in  lucy stood still very anxious and wondering whether she should see anything alive or one of her visitors from various countries  there is a letter from mr seaman said a brisk young voice that would have been very pleasant if it had not gone a little through the nose and past mrs bunker there walked into the full light a little boy a year or two older than lucy holding out one hand as he saw her and taking off his hat with the other  good morning he said quite at ease is this where you live  good morning returned lucy though it was not morning at all where do you come from  well im from paris last but when im at home im at boston  i am leonidas saunders of the great american republic  oh then you are not real after all  real  i should hope i was a genuine article  well i was in hopes that you were real only you say you come from a strange country like the rest of them and yet you look just like an english boy  of course i do my grandfather came from england said leonidas we all speak english as well or better than you do in the old country  i cant understand it  said lucy did you come like other people by the train not like the children in my dreams  and then leonidas explained all about it to her how his father had brought him last year to europe and had put him to school at paris but when the war broke out and most of the stranger scholars were taken away no orders came about him because his father was a merchant and was away from home so that no one ever knew whether the letters had reached him  so leonidas had gone on at school without many tasks to learn to be sure but not very comfortable it was so cold and there was no wood to burn and he disliked eating horses and cats and rats quite as much as coralie did though he was not in a part of the town where so many shells from the cannons came in  at last when lucys uncle and some other good gentlemen with the red cross on their sleeves obtained leave to enter paris and take some relief to the poor sick people in the hospitals the people leonidas was with told the gentleman that there was a little american left behind in their house  mr seaman which was uncle joes name went to see about him and found that he had once known his father  so after a great deal of trouble it had been managed that the boy should be allowed to leave the city  he had been driven in a coach he told lucy with some more americans and english and with flags with stars and stripes or else union jacks all over it and whenever they came to a french sentry or afterwards to a prussian they were stopped till he called an officer who looked at their papers and let them go on  mr seaman had taken charge of leonidas and given him the best dinner he had eaten for a long time but as he was going to another city to other hospitals he could not keep the boy with him so he had put him in charge of a friend who was going to london to send him down to mrs bunker  fear of lucys rash was pretty well over now and she was to go home in a day or two so the children were allowed to be together and enjoyed it very much  lucy told about her dreams and leonidas had a good deal to tell of what he had really seen on his travels  they wished very much that they could both see one of these wonderful dreams together onlywhat should it be     chapter xvii  the dream of all nations   what should it be  she thought of arabs with their tents and horses and leonidas told her of red indians with their warpaint and little negroes dancing round the sugarboiling till her head began quite to swim and her ears to buzz and all the children she had seen seemed to come round her and join hands and dance  oh such a din  a little highlander in his tartans stood on a barrel in the middle making his bagpipes squeal away a chinese with a bald head and long pigtail beat a gong and capered with a solemn face a norwegian herdboy blew a monstrous bark cowhorn an indian juggler twisted snakes round his neck to the sound of the tomtom and lucy found herself and leonidas whirling round with a young dutch planter between them and an indian with a crown of feathers upon the other side of her  oh she seemed to herself to cry what are you doing  how do you all come here  we are from all the nations who are friends brethren said the voices we all bring our stores the sugar rice cotton of the west the silk and coffee and spices of the east the tea of china the furs of the north it is all exchanged from one to the other and should teach us to be all brethren since we cannot thrive one without the other  it all comes to our country because we are clever to work it up and send it out to be used in its own homes said the highlander it is english and scotch machines that weave your cottons ay and make your tools  no it is america that beats you all cried leonidas what had you to do but to sit down and starve when we sent you no cotton  if you send cotton tis we that weave it cried the scot  lucy was almost afraid they would come to blows over which was the greatest and most skilful country  it cannot be buying and selling that make nations love one another and be peaceful she thought is it being learned and wise  but the prussian boys are studious and wise and the french are clever and skilful and yet they have had that dreadful war i wonder what it is that would make and keep all these countries friends  and then there came an echo back to little lucy for out of zion shall go forth the law and the word of the lord from jerusalem and he shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke many people and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruninghooks nations shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they war any more  yes the more they learn and keep the law of the lord the less there will be of those wars  to heed the true law of the lord will do more for peace and oneness than all the cleverness in booklearning or all the skilful manufactures in the world
