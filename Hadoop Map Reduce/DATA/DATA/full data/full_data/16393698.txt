flowers on plants of the same species   introduction  the subject of the present volume namely the differently formed flowers normally produced by certain kinds of plants either on the same stock or on distinct stocks ought to have been treated by a professed botanist to which distinction i can lay no claim as far as the sexual relations of flowers are concerned linnaeus long ago divided them into hermaphrodite monoecious dioecious and polygamous species this fundamental distinction with the aid of several subdivisions in each of the four classes will serve my purpose but the classification is artificial and the groups often pass into one another  the hermaphrodite class contains two interesting subgroups namely heterostyled and cleistogamic plants but there are several other less important subdivisions presently to be given in which flowers differing in various ways from one another are produced by the same species  some plants were described by me several years ago in a series of papers read before the linnean society the individuals of which exist under two or three forms differing in the length of their pistils and stamens and in other respects introduction1

in the genus verbascum ibid volume 10 1868 page 437 they were called by me dimorphic and trimorphic but have since been better named by hildebrand heterostyled introduction2 the term heterostyled does not express all the differences between the forms but this is a failure common in many cases as the term has been adopted by writers in various countries i am unwilling to change it for that of heterogone or heterogonous though this has been proposed by so high an authority as professor asa gray see the american naturalist january 1877 page 42 as i have many still unpublished observations with respect to these plants it has seemed to me advisable to republish my former papers in a connected and corrected form together with the new matter it will be shown that these heterostyled plants are adapted for reciprocal fertilisation so that the two or three forms though all are hermaphrodites are related to one another almost like the males and females of ordinary unisexual animals i will also give a full abstract of such observations as have been published since the appearance of my papers but only those cases will be noticed with respect to which the evidence seems fairly satisfactory some plants have been supposed to be heterostyled merely from their pistils and stamens varying greatly in length and i have been myself more than once thus deceived with some species the pistil continues growing for a long time so that if old and young flowers are compared they might be thought to be heterostyled again a species tending to become dioecious with the stamens reduced in some individuals and with the pistils in others often presents a deceptive appearance unless it be proved that one form is fully fertile only when it is fertilised with pollen from another form we have not complete evidence that the species is heterostyled but when the pistils and stamens differ in length in two or three sets of individuals and this is accompanied by a difference in the size of the pollengrains or in the state of the stigma we may infer with much safety that the species is heterostyled i have however occasionally trusted to a difference between the two forms in the length of the pistil alone or in the length of the stigma together with its more or less papillose condition and in one instance differences of this kind have been proved by trials made on the fertility of the two forms to be sufficient evidence  the second subgroup above referred to consists of hermaphrodite plants which bear two kinds of flowersthe one perfect and fully expandedthe other minute completely closed with the petals rudimentary often with some of the anthers aborted and the remaining ones together with the stigmas much reduced in size yet these flowers are perfectly fertile they have been called by dr kuhn cleistogamic and they will be described in the last chapter of this volume introduction3 botanische zeitung 1867 page 65 several plants are known occasionally to produce flowers destitute of a corolla but they belong to a different class of cases from cleistogamic flowers this deficiency seems to result from the conditions to which the plants have been subjected and partakes of the nature of a monstrosity all the flowers on the same plant are commonly affected in the same manner such cases though they have sometimes been ranked as cleistogamic do not come within our present scope see dr maxwell masters vegetable teratology 1869 page 403 they are manifestly adapted for self fertilisation which is effected at the cost of a wonderfully small expenditure of pollen whilst the perfect flowers produced by the same plant are capable of crossfertilisation certain aquatic species when they flower beneath the water keep their corollas closed apparently to protect their pollen they might therefore be called cleistogamic but for reasons assigned in the proper place are not included in the present subgroup several cleistogamic species as we shall hereafter see bury their ovaries or young capsules in the ground but some few other plants behave in the same manner and as they do not bury all their flowers they might have formed a small separate subdivision  another interesting subdivision consists of certain plants discovered by h muller some individuals of which bear conspicuous flowers adapted for cross fertilisation by the aid of insects and others much smaller and less conspicuous flowers which have often been slightly modified so as to ensure selffertilisation lysimachia vulgaris euphrasia officinalis rhinanthus cristagalli and viola tricolor come under this head introduction4 h muller nature september 25 1873 volume 8 page 433 and november 20 1873 volume 9 page 44 also die befruchtung der blumen etc 1873 page 294 the smaller and less conspicuous flowers are not closed but as far as the purpose which they serve is concerned namely the assured propagation of the species they approach in nature cleistogamic flowers but they differ from them by the two kinds being produced on distinct plants  with many plants the flowers towards the outside of the inflorescence are much larger and more conspicuous than the central ones as i shall not have occasion to refer to plants of this kind in the following chapters i will here give a few details respecting them it is familiar to every one that the rayflorets of the compositae often differ remarkably from the others and so it is with the outer flowers of many umbelliferae some cruciferae and a few other families several species of hydrangea and viburnum offer striking instances of the same fact the rubiaceous genus mussaenda presents a very curious appearance from some of the flowers having the tip of one of the sepals developed into a large petallike expansion coloured either white or purple the outer flowers in several acanthaceous genera are large and conspicuous but sterile the next in order are smaller open moderately fertile and capable of crossfertilisation whilst the central ones are cleistogamic being still smaller closed and highly fertile so that here the inflorescence consists of three kinds of flowers introduction5 j scott journal of botany london new series volume 1 1872 pages 161164 from what we know in other cases of the use of the corolla coloured bracteae etc and from what h muller has observed on the frequency of the visits of insects to the flowerheads of the umbelliferae and compositae being largely determined by their conspicuousness there can be no doubt that the increased size of the corolla of the outer flowers the inner ones being in all the above cases small serves to attract insects introduction6 die befruchtung der blumen pages 108 412 the result is that crossfertilisation is thus favoured most flowers wither soon after being fertilised but hildebrand states that the rayflorets of the compositae last for a long time until all those on the disc are impregnated and this clearly shows the use of the former introduction7 see his interesting memoir ueber die geschlechtsverhaltniss bei den compositen 1869 page 92 the rayflorets however are of service in another and very different manner namely by folding inwards at night and during cold rainy weather so as to protect the florets of the disc introduction8 kerner clearly shows that this is the case die schutzmittel des pollens 1873 page 28 moreover they often contain matter which is excessively poisonous to insects as may be seen in the use of flea powder and in the case of pyrethrum m belhomme has shown that the rayflorets are more poisonous than the discflorets in the ratio of about three to two we may therefore believe that the rayflorets are useful in protecting the flowers from being gnawed by insects introduction9 gardeners chronicle 1861 page 1067 lindley vegetable kingdom on chrysanthemum 1853 page 706 kerner in his interesting essay die schutzmittel der bluthen gegen unberufene gaste 1875 page 19 insists that the petals of most plants contain matter which is offensive to insects so that they are seldom gnawed and thus the organs of fructification are protected my grandfather in 1790 loves of the plants canto 3 note to lines 184 188 remarks that the flowers or petals of plants are perhaps in general more acrid than their leaves hence they are much seldomer eaten by insects  it is a wellknown yet remarkable fact that the circumferential flowers of many of the foregoing plants have both their male and female reproductive organs aborted as with the hydrangea viburnum and certain compositae or the male organs alone are aborted as in many compositae between the sexless female and hermaphrodite states of these latter flowers the finest gradations may be traced as hildebrand has shown introduction10 ueber die geschlechtsverhaltnisse bei den compositen 1869 pages 7891 he also shows that there is a close relation between the size of the corolla in the ray florets and the degree of abortion in their reproductive organs as we have good reason to believe that these florets are highly serviceable to the plants which possess them more especially by rendering the flowerheads conspicuous to insects it is a natural inference that their corollas have been increased in size for this special purpose and that their development has subsequently led through the principle of compensation or balancement to the more or less complete reduction of the reproductive organs but an opposite view may be maintained namely that the reproductive organs first began to fail as often happens under cultivation and as a consequence the corolla became through compensation more highly developed introduction11 i have discussed this subject in my variation of animals and plants under domestication chapter 18 2nd edition volume 2 pages 152 156 this view however is not probable for when hermaphrodite plants become dioecious or gynodioeciousthat is are converted into hermaphrodites and femalesthe corolla of the female seems to be almost invariably reduced in size in consequence of the abortion of the male organs the difference in the result in these two classes of cases may perhaps be accounted for by the matter saved through the abortion of the male organs in the females of gynodioecious and dioecious plants being directed as we shall see in a future chapter to the formation of an increased supply of seeds whilst in the case of the exterior florets and flowers of the plants which we are here considering such matter is expended in the development of a conspicuous corolla whether in the present class of cases the corolla was first affected as seems to me the more probable view or the reproductive organs first failed their states of development are now firmly correlated we see this wellillustrated in hydrangea and viburnum for when these plants are cultivated the corollas of both the interior and exterior flowers become largely developed and their reproductive organs are aborted  there is a closely analogous subdivision of plants including the genus muscari or feather hyacinth and the allied bellevalia which bear both perfect flowers and closed budlike bodies that never expand the latter resemble in this respect cleistogamic flowers but differ widely from them in being sterile and conspicuous not only the aborted flowerbuds and their peduncles which are elongated apparently through the principle of compensation are brightly coloured but so is the upper part of the spikeall no doubt for the sake of guiding insects to the inconspicuous perfect flowers from such cases as these we may pass on to certain labiatae for instance salvia horminum in which as i hear from mr thiselton dyer the upper bracts are enlarged and brightly coloured no doubt for the same purpose as before with the flowers suppressed  in the carrot and some allied umbelliferae the central flower has its petals somewhat enlarged and these are of a dark purplishred tint but it cannot be supposed that this one small flower makes the large white umbel at all more conspicuous to insects the central flowers are said to be neuter or sterile but i obtained by artificial fertilisation a seed fruit apparently perfect from one such flower introduction12 the english flora by sir je smith 1824 volume 2 page 39 occasionally two or three of the flowers next to the central one are similarly characterised and according to vaucher cette singuliere degeneration setend quelquefois a lombelle entiere introduction13 hist phys des plantes deurope 1841 tome 2 page 614 on the echinophora page 627 that the modified central flower is of no functional importance to the plant is almost certain it may perhaps be a remnant of a former and ancient condition of the species when one flower alone the central one was female and yielded seeds as in the umbelliferous genus echinophora there is nothing surprising in the central flower tending to retain its former condition longer than the others for when irregular flowers become regular or peloric they are apt to be central and such peloric flowers apparently owe their origin either to arrested developmentthat is to the preservation of an early stage of developmentor to reversion central and perfectly developed flowers in not a few plants in their normal condition for instance the common rue and adoxa differ slightly in structure as in the number of the parts from the other flowers on the same plant all such cases seem connected with the fact of the bud which stands at the end of the shoot being better nourished than the others as it receives the most sap introduction14 this whole subject including pelorism has been discussed and references given in my variation of animals and plants under domestication chapter 26 2nd edition volume 2 page 338  the cases hitherto mentioned relate to hermaphrodite species which bear differently constructed flowers but there are some plants that produce differently formed seeds of which dr kuhn has given a list introduction15 botanische zeitung 1867 page 67 with the umbelliferae and compositae the flowers that produce these seeds likewise differ and the differences in the structure of the seeds are of a very important nature the causes which have led to differences in the seeds on the same plant are not known and it is very doubtful whether they subserve any special end  we now come to our second class that of monoecious species or those which have their sexes separated but borne on the same plant the flowers necessarily differ but when those of one sex include rudiments of the other sex the difference between the two kinds is usually not great when the difference is great as we see in catkinbearing plants this depends largely on many of the species in this as well as in the next or dioecious class being fertilised by the aid of the wind for the male flowers have in this case to produce a surprising amount of incoherent pollen introduction16 delpino studi sopra uno lignaggio anemofilo firenze 1871 some few monoecious plants consist of two bodies of individuals with their flowers differing in function though not in structure for certain individuals mature their pollen before the female flowers on the same plant are ready for fertilisation and are called proterandrous whilst conversely other individuals called proterogynous have their stigmas mature before their pollen is ready the purpose of this curious functional difference obviously is to favour the crossfertilisation of distinct plants a case of this kind was first observed by delpino in the walnut juglans regia and has since been observed with the common nut corylus avellana i may add that according to h muller the individuals of some few hermaphrodite plants differ in a like manner some being proterandrous and others proterogynous introduction17 delpino ult osservazioni sulla dicogamia part 2 fasc 2 page 337 mr wetterhan and h muller on corylus nature volume 11 page 507 and 1875 page 26 on proterandrous and proterogynous hermaphrodite individuals of the same species see h muller die befruchtung etc pages 285 339 on cultivated trees of the walnut and mulberry the male flowers have been observed to abort on certain individuals which have thus been converted into females but whether there are any species in a state of nature which coexist as monoecious and female individuals i do not know introduction18 gardeners chronicle 1847 pages 541 558  the third class consists of dioecious species and the remarks made under the last class with respect to the amount of difference between the male and female flowers are here applicable it is at present an inexplicable fact that with some dioecious plants of which the restiaceae of australia and the cape of good hope offer the most striking instance the differentiation of the sexes has affected the whole plant to such an extent as i hear from mr thiselton dyer that mr bentham and professor oliver have often found it impossible to match the male and female specimens of the same species in my seventh chapter some observations will be given on the gradual conversion of heterostyled and of ordinary hermaphrodite plants into dioecious or subdioecious species  the fourth and last class consists of the plants which were called polygamous by linnaeus but it appears to me that it would be convenient to confine this term to the species which coexist as hermaphrodites males and females and to give new names to several other combinations of the sexesa plan which i shall here follow polygamous plants in this confined sense of the term may be divided into two subgroups according as the three sexual forms are found on the same individual or on distinct individuals of this latter or trioicous subgroup the common ash fraxinus excelsior offers a good instance thus i examined during the spring and autumn fifteen trees growing in the same field and of these eight produced male flowers alone and in the autumn not a single seed four produced only female flowers which set an abundance of seeds three were hermaphrodites which had a different aspect from the other trees whilst in flower and two of them produced nearly as many seeds as the female trees whilst the third produced none so that it was in function a male the separation of the sexes however is not complete in the ash for the female flowers include stamens which drop off at an early period and their anthers which never open or dehisce generally contain pulpy matter instead of pollen on some female trees however i found a few anthers containing pollen grains apparently sound on the male trees most of the flowers include pistils but these likewise drop off at an early period and the ovules which ultimately abort are very small compared with those in female flowers of the same age  of the other or monoicous subgroup of polygamous plants or those which bear hermaphrodite male and female flowers on the same individual the common maple acer campestre offers a good instance but lecoq states that some trees are truly dioecious and this shows how easily one state passes into another introduction19 geographie botanique tome 5 page 367  a considerable number of plants generally ranked as polygamous exist under only two forms namely as hermaphrodites and females and these may be called gyno dioecious of which the common thyme offers a good example in my seventh chapter i shall give some observations on plants of this nature other species for instance several kinds of atriplex bear on the same plant hermaphrodite and female flowers and these might be called gynomonoecious if a name were desirable for them  again there are plants which produce hermaphrodite and male flowers on the same individual for instance some species of galium veratrum etc and these might be called andromonoecious if there exist plants the individuals of which consist of hermaphrodites and males these might be distinguished as androdioecious but after making inquiries from several botanists i can hear of no such cases lecoq however states but without entering into full details that some plants of caltha palustris produce only male flowers and that these live mingled with the hermaphrodites introduction20 geographie botanique tome 4 page 488 the rarity of such cases as this last one is remarkable as the presence of hermaphrodite and male flowers on the same individual is not an unusual occurrence it would appear as if nature did not think it worth while to devote a distinct individual to the production of pollen excepting when this was indispensably necessary as in the case of dioecious species  i have now finished my brief sketch of the several cases as far as known to me in which flowers differing in structure or in function are produced by the same species of plant full details will be given in the following chapters with respect to many of these plants i will begin with the heterostyled then pass on to certain dioecious subdioecious and polygamous species and end with the cleistogamic for the convenience of the reader and to save space the less important cases and details have been printed in smaller type   i cannot close this introduction without expressing my warm thanks to dr hooker for supplying me with specimens and for other aid and to mr thiselton dyer and professor oliver for giving me much information and other assistance professor asa gray also has uniformly aided me in many ways to fritz muller of st catharina in brazil i am indebted for many dried flowers of heterostyled plants often accompanied with valuable notes   chapter i  heterostyled dimorphic plants primulaceae  primula veris or the cowslip differences in structure between the two forms their degrees of fertility when legitimately and illegitimately united p elatior vulgaris sinensis auricula etc summary on the fertility of the heterostyled species of primula homostyled species of primula hottonia palustris androsace vitalliana  figure 11 primula veris left longstyled form right shortstyled form  it has long been known to botanists that the common cowslip primula veris brit flora var officinalis lin exists under two forms about equally numerous which obviously differ from each other in the length of their pistils and stamens 11 this fact according to von mohl botanische zeitung 1863 page 326 was first observed by persoon in the year 1794 this difference has hitherto been looked at as a case of mere variability but this view as we shall presently see is far from the true one florists who cultivate the polyanthus and auricula have long been aware of the two kinds of flowers and they call the plants which display the globular stigma at the mouth of the corolla pinheaded or pineyed and those which display the anthers thrumeyed 12 in johnsons dictionary thrum is said to be the ends of weavers threads and i suppose that some weaver who cultivated the polyanthus invented this name from being struck with some degree of resemblance between the cluster of anthers in the mouth of the corolla and the ends of his threads i will designate the two forms as the longstyled and shortstyled  the pistil in the longstyled form is almost exactly twice as long as that of the shortstyled the stigma stands in the mouth of the corolla or projects just above it and is thus externally visible it stands high above the anthers which are situated halfway down the tube and cannot be easily seen in the shortstyled form the anthers are attached near the mouth of the tube and therefore stand above the stigma which is seated in about the middle of the tubular corolla the corolla itself is of a different shape in the two forms the throat or expanded portion above the attachment of the anthers being much longer in the longstyled than in the shortstyled form village children notice this difference as they can best make necklaces by threading and slipping the corollas of the longstyled flowers into one another but there are much more important differences the stigma in the longstyled form is globular in the shortstyled it is depressed on the summit so that the longitudinal axis of the former is sometimes nearly double that of the latter although somewhat variable in shape one difference is persistent namely in roughness in some specimens carefully compared the papillae which render the stigma rough were in the long styled form from twice to thrice as long as in the shortstyled the anthers do not differ in size in the two forms which i mention because this is the case with some heterostyled plants the most remarkable difference is in the pollen grains i measured with the micrometer many specimens both dry and wet taken from plants growing in different situations and always found a palpable difference the grains distended with water from the shortstyled flowers were about 038 millimetres 10 to 117000 of an inch in diameter whilst those from the longstyled were about 0254 millimetres 77000 of an inch which is in the ratio of 100 to 67 the pollengrains therefore from the longer stamens of the shortstyled form are plainly larger than those from the shorter stamens of the longstyled when examined dry the smaller grains are seen under a low power to be more transparent than the larger grains and apparently in a greater degree than can be accounted for by their less diameter there is also a difference in shape the grains from the shortstyled plants being nearly spherical those from the longstyled being oblong with the angles rounded this difference disappears when the grains are distended with water the longstyled plants generally tend to flower a little before the shortstyled for instance i had twelve plants of each form growing in separate pots and treated in every respect alike and at the time when only a single shortstyled plant was in flower seven of the longstyled had expanded their flowers  we shall also presently see that the shortstyled plants produce more seed than the longstyled it is remarkable according to professor oliver that the ovules in the unexpanded and unimpregnated flowers of the latter are considerably larger than those of the shortstyled flowers 13 natural history review july 1862 page 237 and this i suppose is connected with the longstyled flowers producing fewer seeds so that the ovules have more space and nourishment for rapid development  to sum up the differencesthe longstyled plants have a much longer pistil with a globular and much rougher stigma standing high above the anthers the stamens are short the grains of pollen smaller and oblong in shape the upper half of the tube of the corolla is more expanded the number of seeds produced is smaller and the ovules larger the plants tend to flower first  the shortstyled plants have a short pistil half the length of the tube of the corolla with a smooth depressed stigma standing beneath the anthers the stamens are long the grains of pollen are spherical and larger the tube of the corolla is of uniform diameter except close to the upper end the number of seeds produced is larger  i have examined a large number of flowers and though the shape of the stigma and the length of the pistil both vary especially in the shortstyled form i have never met with any transitional states between the two forms in plants growing in a state of nature there is never the slightest doubt under which form a plant ought to be classed the two kinds of flowers are never found on the same individual plant i marked many cowslips and primroses and on the following year all retained the same character as did some in my garden which flowered out of their proper season in the autumn mr w wooler of darlington however informs us that he has seen early blossoms on the polyanthus which were not longstyled but became so later in the season 14 i have proved by numerous experiments hereafter to be given that the polyanthus is a variety of primula veris possibly in this case the pistils may not have been fully developed during the early spring an excellent proof of the permanence of the two forms may be seen in nurserygardens where choice varieties of the polyanthus are propagated by division and i found whole beds of several varieties each consisting exclusively of the one or the other form the two forms exist in the wild state in about equal numbers i collected 522 umbels from plants growing in several stations taking a single umbel from each plant and 241 were longstyled and 281 shortstyled no difference in tint or size could be perceived in the two great masses of flowers  we shall presently see that most of the species of primula exist under two analogous forms and it may be asked what is the meaning of the abovedescribed important differences in their structure the question seems well worthy of careful investigation and i will give my observations on the cowslip in detail the first idea which naturally occurred to me was that this species was tending towards a dioecious condition that the longstyled plants with their longer pistils rougher stigmas and smaller pollengrains were more feminine in nature and would produce more seedthat the shortstyled plants with their shorter pistils longer stamens and larger pollengrains were more masculine in nature accordingly in 1860 i marked a few cowslips of both forms growing in my garden and others growing in an open field and others in a shady wood and gathered and weighed the seed in all the lots the shortstyled plants yielded contrary to my expectation most seed taking the lots together the following is the result  table 11  column 1 plant column 2 number of plants column 3 number of umbels produced column 4 number of capsules produced column 5 weight of seed in grains  shortstyled cowslips   9  33  199  83 longstyled cowslips   13  51  261  91  if we compare the weight from an equal number of plants and from an equal number of umbels and from an equal number of capsules of the two forms we get the following results  table 12  column 1 plant column 2 number of plants column 3 weight of seed in grains  column 4 number of umbels column 5 weight of seed  column 6 number of capsules column 7 weight of seed in grains  shortstyled cowslips  10  92  100  251  100  41 longstyled cowslips  10  70  100  178  100  34  so that by all these standards of comparison the shortstyled form is the more fertile if we take the number of umbels which is the fairest standard for large and small plants are thus equalised the shortstyled plants produce more seed than the longstyled in the proportion of nearly four to three  in 1861 the trial was made in a fuller and fairer manner a number of wild plants had been transplanted during the previous autumn into a large bed in my garden and all were treated alike the result was  table 13  column 1 plant column 2 number of plants column 3 number of umbels column 4

more favourable this year than the last the plants also now grew in good soil instead of in a shady wood or struggling with other plants in the open field consequently the actual produce of seed was considerably larger nevertheless we have the same relative result for the shortstyled plants produced more seed than the longstyled in nearly the proportion of three to two but if we take the fairest standard of comparison namely the product of seeds from an equal number of umbels the excess is as in the former case nearly as four to three  looking to these trials made during two successive years on a large number of plants we may safely conclude that the shortstyled form is more productive than the longstyled form and the same result holds good with some other species of primula consequently my anticipation that the plants with longer pistils rougher stigmas shorter stamens and smaller pollengrains would prove to be more feminine in nature is exactly the reverse of the truth  in 1860 a few umbels on some plants of both the longstyled and shortstyled form which had been covered by a net did not produce any seed though other umbels on the same plants artificially fertilised produced an abundance of seed and this fact shows that the mere covering in itself was not injurious accordingly in 1861 several plants were similarly covered just before they expanded their flowers these turned out as follows  table 15  column 1 plant column 2 number of plants column 3 number of umbels produced column 4 product of seed  shortstyled   6  24  13 grain weight of seed or about 50 in number longstyled   18  74  not one seed  judging from the exposed plants which grew all round in the same bed and had been treated in the same manner excepting that they had been exposed to the visits of insects the above six shortstyled plants ought to have produced 92 grains weight of seed instead of only 13 and the eighteen longstyled plants which produced not one seed ought to have produced above 200 grains weight the production of a few seeds by the shortstyled plants was probably due to the action of thrips or of some other minute insect it is scarcely necessary to give any additional evidence but i may add that ten pots of polyanthuses and cowslips of both forms protected from insects in my greenhouse did not set one pod though artificially fertilised flowers in other pots produced an abundance we thus see that the visits of insects are absolutely necessary for the fertilisation of primula veris if the corolla of the longstyled form had dropped off instead of remaining attached in a withered state to the ovarium the anthers attached to the lower part of the tube with some pollen still adhering to them would have been dragged over the stigma and the flowers would have been partially selffertilised as is the case with primula sinensis through this means it is a rather curious fact that so trifling a difference as the fallingoff of the withered corolla should make a very great difference in the number of seeds produced by a plant if its flowers are not visited by insects  the flowers of the cowslip and of the other species of the genus secrete plenty of nectar and i have often seen humble bees especially b hortorum and muscorum sucking the former in a proper manner though they sometimes bite holes through the corolla 15 h muller has also seen anthophora pilipes and a bombylius sucking the flowers nature december 10 1874 page 111 no doubt moths likewise visit the flowers as one of my sons caught cucullia verbasci in the act the pollen readily adheres to any thin object which is inserted into a flower the anthers in the one form stand nearly but not exactly on a level with the stigma of the other for the distance between the anthers and stigma in the shortstyled form is greater than that in the longstyled in the ratio of 100 to 90 this difference is the result of the anthers in the longstyled form standing rather higher in the tube than does the stigma in the shortstyled and this favours their pollen being deposited on it it follows from the position of the organs that if the proboscis of a dead humblebee or a thick bristle or rough needle be pushed down the corolla first of one form and then of the other as an insect would do in visiting the two forms growing mingled together pollen from the longstamened form adheres round the base of the object and is left with certainty on the stigma of the longstyled form whilst pollen from the short stamens of the longstyled form adheres a little way above the extremity of the object and some is generally left on the stigma of the other form in accordance with this observation i found that the two kinds of pollen which could easily be recognised under the microscope adhered in this manner to the proboscides of the two species of humblebees and of the moth which were caught visiting the flowers but some small grains were mingled with the larger grains round the base of the proboscis and conversely some large grains with the small grains near the extremity of the proboscis thus pollen will be regularly carried from the one form to the other and they will reciprocally fertilise one another nevertheless an insect in withdrawing its proboscis from the corolla of the longstyled form cannot fail occasionally to leave pollen from the same flower on the stigma and in this case there might be self fertilisation but this will be much more likely to occur with the shortstyled form for when i inserted a bristle or other such object into the corolla of this form and had therefore to pass it down between the anthers seated round the mouth of the corolla some pollen was almost invariably carried down and left on the stigma minute insects such as thrips which sometimes haunt the flowers would likewise be apt to cause the selffertilisation of both forms  the several foregoing facts led me to try the effects of the two kinds of pollen on the stigmas of the two forms four essentially different unions are possible namely the fertilisation of the stigma of the longstyled form by its ownform pollen and by that of the shortstyled and the stigma of the shortstyled form by its ownform pollen and by that of the longstyled the fertilisation of either form with pollen from the other form may be conveniently called a legitimate union from reasons hereafter to be made clear and that of either form with its ownform pollen an illegitimate union i formerly applied the term heteromorphic to the legitimate unions and homomorphic to the illegitimate unions but after discovering the existence of trimorphic plants in which many more unions are possible these two terms ceased to be applicable the illegitimate unions of both forms might have been tried in three ways for a flower of either form may be fertilised with pollen from the same flower or with that from a another flower on the same plant or with that from a distinct plant of the same form but to make my experiments perfectly fair and to avoid any evil result from selffertilisation or too close interbreeding i have invariably employed pollen from a distinct plant of the same form for the illegitimate unions of all the species and therefore it may be observed that i have used the term ownform pollen in speaking of such unions the several plants in all my experiments were treated in exactly the same manner and were carefully protected by fine nets from the access of insects excepting thrips which it is impossible to exclude i performed all the manipulations myself and weighed the seeds in a chemical balance but during many subsequent trials i followed the more accurate plan of counting the seeds some of the capsules contained no seeds or only two or three and these are excluded in the column headed good capsules in several of the following tables  table 16 primula veris  column 1 nature of the union column 2 number of flowers fertilised column 3 number of capsules produced column 4 number of good capsules column 5 weight of seed in grains column 6 calculated weight of seed from 100 good capsules  longstyled by pollen of shortstyled legitimate union  22

comparing first the number of capsules whether good or bad or of the good alone produced by 100 flowers of both forms when legitimately and illegitimately fertilised secondly by comparing the weight of seed in 100 of these capsules whether good or bad or thirdly in 100 of the good capsules  table 17 primula veris  column 1 nature of the union column 2 number of flowers fertilised column 3 number

from the short styled yield more capsules especially good ones ie containing more than one or two seeds and that these capsules contain a greater proportional weight of seeds than do the flowers of the longstyled when fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant of the same form so it is with the shortstyled flowers if treated in an analogous manner therefore i have called the former method of fertilisation a legitimate union and the latter as it fails to yield the full complement of capsules and seeds an illegitimate union these two kinds of union are graphically represented in figure 12  figure 12 primula veris graphic representation of two kinds of union between left longstyled form right shortstyled form  if we consider the results of the two legitimate unions taken together and the two illegitimate ones as shown in table 17 we see that the former compared with the latter yielded capsules whether containing many seeds or only a few in the proportion of 77 to 45 or as 100 to 58 but the inferiority of the illegitimate unions is here perhaps too great for on a subsequent occasion 100 longstyled and shortstyled flowers were illegitimately fertilised and they together yielded 53 capsules therefore the rate of 77 to 53 or as 100 to 69 is a fairer one than that of 100 to 58 returning to table 17 if we consider only the good capsules those from the two legitimate unions were to those from the two illegitimate in number as 71 to 31 or as 100 to 44 again if we take an equal number of capsules whether good or bad from the legitimately and illegitimately fertilised flowers we find that the former contained seeds by weight compared with the latter as 50 to 24 or as 100 to 48 but if all the poor capsules are rejected of which many were produced by the illegitimately fertilised flowers the proportion is 54 to 35 or as 100 to 65 in this and all other cases the relative fertility of the two kinds of union can i think be judged of more truly by the average number of seeds per capsule than by the proportion of flowers which yield capsules the two methods might have been combined by giving the average number of seeds produced by all the flowers which were fertilised whether they yielded capsules or not but i have thought that it would be more instructive always to show separately the proportion of flowers which produced capsules and the average number of apparently good seeds which the capsules contained  flowers legitimately fertilised set seeds under conditions which cause the almost complete failure of illegitimately fertilised flowers thus in the spring of 1862 forty flowers were fertilised at the same time in both ways the plants were accidentally exposed in the greenhouse to too hot a sun and a large number of umbels perished some however remained in moderately good health and on these there were twelve flowers which had been fertilised legitimately and eleven which had been fertilised illegitimately the twelve legitimate unions yielded seven fine capsules containing on an average each 573 good seeds whilst the eleven illegitimate unions yielded only two capsules of which one contained 39 seeds but so poor that i do not suppose one would have germinated and the other contained 17 fairly good seeds  from the facts now given the superiority of a legitimate over an illegitimate union admits of not the least doubt and we have here a case to which no parallel exists in the vegetable or indeed in the animal kingdom the individual plants of the present species and as we shall see of several other species of primula are divided into two sets or bodies which cannot be called distinct sexes for both are hermaphrodites yet they are to a certain extent sexually distinct for they require reciprocal union for perfect fertility as quadrupeds are divided into two nearly equal bodies of different sexes so here we have two bodies approximately equal in number differing in their sexual powers and related to each other like males and females there are many hermaphrodite animals which cannot fertilise themselves but most unite with another hermaphrodite so it is with numerous plants for the pollen is often mature and shed or is mechanically protruded before the flowers own stigma is ready and such flowers absolutely require the presence of another hermaphrodite for sexual union but with the cowslip and various other species of primula there is this wide difference that one individual though it can fertilise itself imperfectly must unite with another individual for full fertility it cannot however unite with any other individual in the same manner as an hermaphrodite plant can unite with any other one of the same species or as one snail or earthworm can unite with any other hermaphrodite individual on the contrary an individual belonging to one form of the cowslip in order to be perfectly fertile must unite with one of the other form just as a male quadruped must and can unite only with the female  i have spoken of the legitimate unions as being fully fertile and i am fully justified in doing so for flowers artificially fertilised in this manner yielded rather more seeds than plants naturally fertilised in a state of nature the excess may be attributed to the plants having been grown separately in good soil with respect to the illegitimate unions we shall best appreciate their degree of lessened fertility by the following facts gartner estimated the sterility of the unions between distinct species in a manner which allows of a strict comparison with the results of the legitimate and illegitimate unions of primula 16 versuche uber die bastarderzeugung 1849 page 216 with p veris for every 100 seeds yielded by the two legitimate unions only 64 were yielded by an equal number of good capsules from the two illegitimate unions with p sinensis as we shall hereafter see the proportion was nearly the same namely as 100 to 62 now gartner has shown that on the calculation of verbascum lychnitis yielding with its own pollen 100 seeds it yielded when fertilised by the pollen of verbascum phoeniceum 90 seeds by the pollen of verbascum nigrum 63 seeds by that of verbascum blattaria 62 seeds so again dianthus barbatus fertilised by the pollen of d superbus yielded 81 seeds and by the pollen of d japonicus 66 seeds relatively to the 100 seeds produced by its own pollen we thus seeand the fact is highly remarkablethat with primula the illegitimate unions relatively to the legitimate are more sterile than crosses between distinct species of other genera relatively to their pure unions mr scott has given a still more striking illustration of the same fact he crossed primula auricula with pollen of four other species p palinuri viscosa hirsuta and verticillata and these hybrid unions yielded a larger average number of seeds than did p auricula when fertilised illegitimately with its ownform pollen 17 journal of the linnean society botany volume 8 1864 page 93  the benefit which heterostyled dimorphic plants derive from the existence of the two forms is sufficiently obvious namely the intercrossing of distinct plants being thus ensured 18 i have shown in my work on the effects of cross and selffertilisation how greatly the offspring from intercrossed plants profit in height vigour and fertility nothing can be better adapted for this end than the relative positions of the anthers and stigmas in the two forms as shown in figure 12 but to this whole subject i shall recur no doubt pollen will occasionally be placed by insects or fall on the stigma of the same flower and if crossfertilisation fails such selffertilisation will be advantageous to the plant as it will thus be saved from complete barrenness but the advantage is not so great as might at first be thought for the seedlings from illegitimate unions do not generally consist of both forms but all belong to the parent form they are moreover in some degree weakly in constitution as will be shown in a future chapter if however a flowers own pollen should first be placed by insects or fall on the stigma it by no means follows that crossfertilisation will be thus prevented it is well known that if pollen from a distinct species be placed on the stigma of a plant and some hours afterwards its own pollen be placed on it the latter will be prepotent and will quite obliterate any effect from the foreign pollen and there can hardly be a doubt that with heterostyled dimorphic plants pollen from the other form will obliterate the effects of pollen from the same form even when this has been placed on the stigma a considerable time before to test this belief i placed on several stigmas of a longstyled cowslip plenty of pollen from the same plant and after twentyfour hours added some from a shortstyled darkred polyanthus which is a variety of the cowslip from the flowers thus treated 30 seedlings were raised and all these without exception bore reddish flowers so that the effect of pollen from the same form though placed on the stigmas twentyfour hours previously was quite destroyed by that of pollen from a plant belonging to the other form  finally i may remark that of the four kinds of unions that of the shortstyled illegitimately fertilised with its ownform pollen seems to be the most sterile of all as judged by the average number of seeds which the capsules contained a smaller proportion also of these seeds than of the others germinated and they germinated more slowly the sterility of this union is the more remarkable as it has already been shown that the shortstyled plants yield a larger number of seeds than the longstyled when both forms are fertilised either naturally or artificially in a legitimate manner  in a future chapter when i treat of the offspring from heterostyled dimorphic and trimorphic plants illegitimately fertilised with their ownform pollen i shall have occasion to show that with the present species and several others equalstyled varieties sometimes appear  primula elatior jacq bardfield oxlip of english authors  this plant as well as the last or cowslip p veris vel officinalis and the primrose p vulgaris vel acaulis have been considered by some botanists as varieties of the same species but they are all three undoubtedly distinct as will be shown in the next chapter the present species resembles to a certain extent in general appearance the common oxlip which is a hybrid between the cowslip and primrose primula elatior is found in england only in two or three of the eastern counties and i was supplied with living plants by mr doubleday who as i believe first called attention to its existence in england it is common in some parts of the continent and h muller has seen several kinds of

standard the present species is much more sterile than p veris when both species are illegitimately fertilised if we judge of the relative fertility of the two kinds of unions by the average number of seeds per capsule the ratio is as 100 to 75 but this latter number is probably much too high as many of the seeds produced by the illegitimately fertilised longstyled flowers were so small that they probably would not have germinated and ought not to have been counted several longstyled and short styled plants were protected from the access of insects and must have been spontaneously selffertilised they yielded altogether only six capsules containing any seeds and their average number was only 78 per capsule some moreover of these seeds were so small that they could hardly have germinated  herr w breitenbach informs me that he examined in two sites near the lippe a tributary of the rhine 894 flowers produced by 198 plants of this species and he found 467 of these flowers to be longstyled 411 shortstyled and 16 equal styled i have heard of no other instance with heterostyled plants of equal styled flowers appearing in a state of nature though far from rare with plants which have been long cultivated it is still more remarkable that in eighteen cases the same plant produced both longstyled and shortstyled or longstyled and equalstyled flowers and in two out of the eighteen cases longstyled shortstyled and equalstyled flowers the longstyled flowers greatly preponderated on these eighteen plants61 consisting of this form 15 of equalstyled and 9 of the shortstyled

shortstyled and i took by chance 79 plants in kent of which 39 were longstyled and 40 shortstyled so that the two lots together consisted of 83 longstyled and 96 shortstyled plants in the longstyled form the pistil is to that of the shortstyled in length from an average of five measurements as 100 to 51 the stigma in the longstyled form is conspicuously more globose and much more papillose than in the shortstyled in which latter it is depressed on the summit it is equally broad in the two forms in both it stands nearly but not exactly on a level with the anthers of the opposite form for it was found from an average of 15 measurements that the distance between the middle of the stigma and the middle of the anthers in the short styled form is to that in the longstyled as 100 to 93 the anthers do not differ in size in the two forms the pollengrains from the shortstyled flowers before they were soaked in water were decidedly broader in proportion to their length than those from the longstyled after being soaked they were relatively to those from the longstyled as 100 to 71 in diameter and more transparent a large number of flowers from the two forms were compared and 12 of the finest flowers from each lot were measured but there was no sensible difference between them in size nine longstyled and eight shortstyled plants growing together in a state of nature were marked and their capsules collected after they had been naturally fertilised and the seeds from the shortstyled weighed exactly twice as much as those from an equal number of longstyled plants so that the primrose resembles the cowslip in the shortstyled plants being the more productive of the two forms the results of my trials on the fertility of the two forms when legitimately and illegitimately

rather too low  we may infer from this table that the fertility of the two legitimate unions taken together is to that of the two illegitimate unions together as judged by the proportional number of flowers which when fertilised in the two methods yielded capsules as 100 to 60 if we judge by the average number of seeds per capsule produced by the two kinds of unions the ratio is as 100 to 54 but this latter figure is perhaps rather too low it is surprising how rarely insects can be seen during the day visiting the flowers but i have occasionally observed small kinds of bees at work i suppose therefore that they are commonly fertilised by nocturnal lepidoptera the longstyled plants when protected from insects yield a considerable number of capsules and they thus differ remarkably from the same form of the cowslip which is quite sterile under the same circumstances twentythree spontaneously selffertilised capsules from this form contained on an average 192 seeds the shortstyled plants produced fewer spontaneously selffertilised capsules and fourteen of them contained only 62 seeds per capsule the selffertilisation of both forms was probably aided by thrips which abounded within the flowers but these minute insects could not have placed nearly sufficient pollen on the stigmas as the spontaneously selffertilised capsules contained much fewer seeds on an average than those as may be seen in table 19 which were artificially fertilised with their ownform pollen but this difference may perhaps be attributed in part to the flowers in the table having been fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant belonging to the same form whilst those which were spontaneously selffertilised no doubt generally received their own pollen in a future part of this volume some observations will be given on the fertility of a redcoloured variety of the primrose  primula sinensis  in the longstyled form the pistil is about twice as long as that of the short styled and the stamens differ in a corresponding but reversed manner the stigma is considerably more elongated and rougher than that of the shortstyled which is smooth and almost spherical being somewhat depressed on the summit but the stigma varies much in all its characters the result probably of cultivation the pollengrains of the shortstyled form according to hildebrand are 7 divisions of the micrometer in length and 5 in breadth whereas those of the longstyled are only 4 in length and 3 in breadth 110 after the appearance of my paper this author published some excellent observations on the present species botanische zeitung january 1 1864 and he shows that i erred greatly about the size of the pollengrains in the two forms i suppose that by mistake i measured twice over pollengrains from the same form the grains therefore of the shortstyled are to those of the long styled in length as 100 to 57 hildebrand also remarked as i had done in the case of p veris that the smaller grains from the longstyled are much more transparent than the larger ones from the shortstyled form we shall hereafter see that this cultivated plant varies much in its dimorphic condition and is often equalstyled some individuals may be said to be subheterostyled thus in two whiteflowered plants the pistil projected above the stamens but in one of them it was longer and had a more elongated and rougher stigma than in the other and the pollengrains from the latter were to those from the plant with a more elongated pistil only as 100 to 88 in diameter instead of as 100 to 57 the corolla of the longstyled and shortstyled form differs in shape in the same manner as in p veris the longstyled plants tend to flower before the shortstyled when both forms were legitimately fertilised the capsules from the shortstyled plants contained on an average more seeds than those from the longstyled in the ratio of 122 to 93 by weight that is as 100 to 78 in table 110 we have the results of two sets of

condensed form in table 111 besides using for the illegitimate unions pollen from a distinct plant of the same form as was always done by me he tried in addition the effects of the plants own pollen he counted the seeds  it is remarkable that here all the flowers which were fertilised legitimately as well as those fertilised illegitimately with pollen from a distinct plant belonging to the same form yielded capsules and from this fact it might be inferred that the two forms were reciprocally much more fertile in his case than in mine but his illegitimately fertilised capsules from both forms contained fewer seeds relatively to the legitimately fertilised capsules than in my experiments for the ratio in his case is as 42 to 100 instead of as in mine as 53 to 100 fertility is a very variable element with most plants being determined by the conditions to which they are subjected of which fact i have observed striking instances with the present species and this may account for the difference between my results and those of hildebrand his plants were kept in a room and perhaps were grown in too small pots or under some other unfavourable conditions for his capsules in almost every case contained a smaller number of seeds than mine as may be seen by comparing the right hand columns in tables 110 and 111  the most interesting point in hildebrands experiments is the difference in the effects of illegitimate fertilisation with a flowers own pollen and with that from a distinct plant of the same form in the latter case all the flowers produced capsules whilst only 67 out of 100 of those fertilised with their own pollen produced capsules the selffertilised capsules also contained seeds as compared with capsules from flowers fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant of the same form in the ratio of 72 to 100  in order to ascertain how far the present species was spontaneously self fertile five longstyled plants were protected by me from insects and they bore up to a given period 147 flowers which set 62 capsules but many of these soon fell off showing that they had not been properly fertilised at the same time five shortstyled plants were similarly treated and they bore 116 flowers which ultimately produced only seven capsules on another occasion 13 protected longstyled plants yielded by weight 259 grains of spontaneously self fertilised seeds at the same time seven protected shortstyled plants yielded only halfagrain weight of seeds therefore the longstyled plants yielded nearly 24 times as many spontaneously selffertilised seeds as did the same number of shortstyled plants the chief cause of this great difference appears to be that when the corolla of a longstyled plant falls off the anthers from being situated near the bottom of the tube are necessarily dragged over the stigma and leave pollen on it as i saw when i hastened the fall of nearly withered flowers whereas in the shortstyled flowers the stamens are seated at the mouth of the corolla and in falling off do not brush over the lowlyseated stigmas hildebrand likewise protected some longstyled and shortstyled plants but neither ever yielded a single capsule he thinks that the difference in our results may be accounted for by his plants having been kept in a room and never having been shaken but this explanation seems to me doubtful his plants were in a less fertile condition than mine as shown by the difference in the number of seeds produced and it is highly probable that their lessened fertility would have interfered with especial force with their capacity for producing self fertilised seeds  primula auricula 111 according to kerner our garden auriculas are descended from p pubescens jacq which is a hybrid between the true p auricula and hirsuta this hybrid has now been propagated for about 300 years and produces when legitimately fertilised a large number of seeds the longstyled forms yielding an average number of 73 and the shortstyled 98 seeds per capsule see his geschichte der aurikel zeitschr des deutschen und oest alpenvereins band 6 page 52 also die primulaceenbastarten oest botanische zeitschrift 1835 numbers 3 4 and 5  this species is heterostyled like the preceding ones but amongst the varieties distributed by florists the longstyled form is rare as it is not valued there is a much greater relative inequality in the length of the pistil and stamens in the two forms of the auricula than in the cowslip the pistil in the longstyled being nearly four times as long as that in the shortstyled in which it is barely longer than the ovarium the stigma is nearly of the same shape in both forms but is rougher in the longstyled though the difference is not so great as between the two forms of the cowslip in the longstyled plants the stamens are very short rising but little above the ovarium the pollengrains of these short stamens when distended with water were barely 56000 of an inch in diameter whereas those from the long stamens of the shortstyled plants were barely 76000 showing a relative difference of about 71 to 100 the smaller grains of the longstyled plant are also much more transparent and before distention with water more triangular in outline than those of the other form mr scott compared ten plants of both forms growing under similar conditions and found that although the longstyled plant produced more umbels and more capsules than the shortstyled yet they yielded fewer seeds in the ratio of 66 to 100 112 journal of the linnean society botany volume 8 1864 page 86 three shortstyled plants were protected by me from the access of insects and they did not produce a single seed mr scott protected six plants of both forms and found them excessively sterile the pistil of the longstyled form stands so high above the anthers that it is scarcely possible that pollen should reach the stigma without some aid and one of mr scotts longstyled plants which yielded a few seeds only 18 in number was infested by aphides and he does not doubt that these had imperfectly fertilised it  i tried a few experiments by reciprocally fertilising the two forms in the same manner as before but my plants were unhealthy so i will give in a condensed form the results of mr scotts experiments for fuller particulars with respect to this and the five following species the paper lately referred to may be consulted in each case the fertility of the two legitimate unions taken together is compared with that of the two illegitimate unions together by the same two standards as before namely by the proportional number of flowers which produced good capsules and by the average number of seeds per capsule the fertility of the legitimate unions is always taken at 100  by the first standard the fertility of the two legitimate unions of the auricula is to that of the two illegitimate unions as 100 to 80 and by the second standard as 100 to 15  primula sikkimensis  according to mr scott the pistil of the longstyled form is fully four times as long as that of the shortstyled but their stigmas are nearly alike in shape and roughness the stamens do not differ so much in relative length as the pistils the pollengrains differ in a marked manner in the two forms those of the longstyled plants are sharply triquetrous smaller and more transparent than those of the shortstyled which are of a bluntly triangular form the fertility of the two legitimate unions to that of the two illegitimate unions is by the first standard as 100 to 95 and by the second standard as 100 to 31  primula cortusoides  the pistil of the longstyled form is about thrice as long as that of the short styled the stigma being double as long and covered with much longer papillae the pollengrains of the shortstyled form are as usual larger less transparent and more bluntly triangular than those from the longstyled plants the fertility of the two legitimate unions to that of the two illegitimate unions is by the first standard as 100 to 74 and by the second standard as 100 to 66  primula involucrata  the pistil of the longstyled form is about thrice as long as that of the short styled the stigma of the former is globular and closely beset with papillae whilst that of the shortstyled is smooth and depressed on the apex the pollen grains of the two forms differ in size and transparency as before but not in shape the fertility of the two legitimate to that of the two illegitimate unions is by the first standard as 100 to 72 and by the second standard as 100 to 47  primula farinosa  according to mr scott the pistil of the longstyled form is only about twice as long as that of the shortstyled the stigmas of the two forms differ but little in shape the pollengrains differ in the usual manner in size but not in form the fertility of the two legitimate to that of the two illegitimate unions is by the first standard as 100 to 71 and by the second standard as 100 to 44  summary on the foregoing heterostyled species of primula  table 112 summary on the fertility of the two legitimate unions compared with that of the two illegitimate unions in

forms are fertilised legitimately and illegitimately with pollen of the same form taken from a distinct plant has now been given the results are seen in table 112 the fertility being judged by two standards namely by that of the proportional number of flowers which yielded capsules and by that of the average number of seeds per capsule but for full accuracy many more observations under varied conditions would be requisite  with plants of all kinds some flowers generally fail to produce capsules from various accidental causes but this source of error has been eliminated as far as possible in all the previous cases by the manner in which the calculations have been made supposing for instance that 20 flowers were fertilised legitimately and yielded 18 capsules and that 30 flowers were fertilised illegitimately and yielded 15 capsules we may assume that on an average an equal proportion of the flowers in both lots would fail to produce capsules from various accidental causes and the ratio of 1820 to 1530 or as 100 to 56 in whole numbers would show the proportional number of capsules due to the two methods of fertilisation and the number 56 would appear in the lefthand column of table 112 and in my other tables with respect to the average number of seeds per capsule hardly anything need be said supposing that the legitimately fertilised capsules contained on an average 50 seeds and the illegitimately fertilised capsules 25 seeds then as 50 is to 25 so is 100 to 50 and the latter number would appear in the right hand column  it is impossible to look at the above table and doubt that the legitimate unions between the two forms of the above nine species of primula are much more fertile than the illegitimate unions although in the latter case pollen was always taken from a distinct plant of the same form there is however no close correspondence in the two rows of figures which give according to the two standards the difference of fertility between the legitimate and illegitimate unions thus all the flowers of p sinensis which were illegitimately fertilised by hildebrand produced capsules but these contained only 42 per cent of the number of seeds yielded by the legitimately fertilised capsules so again 95 per cent of the illegitimately fertilised flowers of p sikkimensis produced capsules but these contained only 31 per cent of the number of seeds in the legitimate capsules on the other hand with p elatior only 27 per cent of the illegitimately fertilised flowers yielded capsules but these contained nearly 75 per cent of the legitimate number of seeds it appears that the setting of the flowers that is the production of capsules whether good or bad is not so much influenced by legitimate and illegitimate fertilisation as is the number of seeds which the capsules contain for as may be seen at the bottom of table 112 884 per cent of the illegitimately fertilised flowers yielded capsules but these contained only 618 per cent of seeds in comparison in each case with the legitimately fertilised flowers and capsules of the same species there is another point which deserves notice namely the relative degree of infertility in the several species of the longstyled and shortstyled flowers when both are illegitimately fertilised the data may be found in the earlier tables and in those given by mr scott in the paper already referred to if we call the number of seeds per capsule produced by the illegitimately fertilised longstyled flowers 100 the seeds from the illegitimately fertilised short styled flowers will be represented by the following numbers table 1a  table 1a  primula veris  71  primula elatior  44 probably too low  primula vulgaris  36 perhaps too low  primula sinensis  71  primula auricula  119  primula sikkimensis  57  primula cortusoides  93  primula involucrata  74  primula farinosa  63  we thus see that with the exception of p auricula the longstyled flowers of all nine species are more fertile than the shortstyled flowers when both forms are illegitimately fertilised whether p auricula really differs from the other species in this respect i can form no opinion as the result may have been accidental the degree of selffertility of a plant depends on two elements namely on the stigma receiving its own pollen and on its more or less efficient action when placed there now as the anthers of the shortstyled flowers of several species of primula stand directly above the stigma their pollen is more likely to fall on it or to be carried down to it by insects than in the case of the longstyled form it appears probable therefore at first sight that the lessened capacity of the shortstyled flowers to be fertilised with their own pollen is a special adaptation for counteracting their greater liability to receive their own pollen and thus for checking selffertilisation but from facts with respect to other species hereafter to be given this view can hardly be admitted in accordance with the above liability when some of the species of primula were allowed to fertilise themselves spontaneously under a net all insects being excluded except such minute ones as thrips the shortstyled flowers notwithstanding their greater innate selfsterility yielded more seed than did the longstyled none of the species however when insects were excluded made a near approach to full fertility but the longstyled form of p sinensis gave under these circumstances a considerable number of seeds as the corolla in falling off drags the anthers which are seated low down in the tube over the stigma and thus leaves plenty of pollen on it  homostyled species of primula  it has now been shown that nine of the species in this genus exist under two forms which differ not only in structure but in function besides these mr scott enumerates 27 other species which are heterostyled 113 h muller has given in nature december 10 1874 page 110 a drawing of one of these species viz the alpine p villosa and shows that it is fertilised exclusively by lepidoptera and to these probably others will be hereafter added nevertheless some species are homostyled that is they exist only under a single form but much caution is necessary on this head as several species when cultivated are apt to become equalstyled mr scott believes that p scotica verticillata a variety of sibirica elata mollis and longiflora are truly homostyled and to these may be added according to axell p stricta 114 koch was aware that this species was homostyled see treviranus uber dichogamie nach sprengel und darwin botanische zeitung january 2 1863 page 4 mr scott experimented on p scotica mollis and verticillata and found that their flowers yielded an abundance of seeds when fertilised with their own pollen this shows that they are not heterostyled in function p scotica is however only moderately fertile when insects are excluded but this depends merely on the coherent pollen not readily falling on the stigma without their aid mr scott also found that the capsules of p verticillata contained rather more seed when the flowers were fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant than when with their own pollen and from this fact he infers that they are sub heterostyled in function though not in structure but there is no evidence that two sets of individuals exist which differ slightly in function and are adapted for reciprocal fertilisation and this is the essence of heterostylism the mere fact of a plant being more fertile with pollen from a distinct individual than with its own pollen is common to very many species as i have shown in my work on the effects of cross and selffertilisation  hottonia palustris  this aquatic member of the primulaceae is conspicuously heterostyled as the pistil of the longstyled form projects far out of the flower the stamens being enclosed within the tube whilst the stamens of the shortstyled flower project far outwards the pistil being enclosed this difference between the two forms has attracted the attention of various botanists and that of sprengel in 1793 who with his usual sagacity adds that he does not believe the existence of the two forms to be accidental though he cannot explain their purpose 115 das entdeckte geheimniss der nature page 103 the pistil of the longstyled form is more than twice as long as that of the shortstyled with the stigma rather smaller though rougher h muller gives figures of the stigmatic papillae of the two forms and those of the longstyled are seen to be more than double the length and much thicker than the papillae of the shortstyled form 116 die befruchtung etc page 350 the anthers in the one form do not stand exactly on a level with the stigma in the other form for the distance between the organs is greater in the shortstyled than in the longstyled flowers in the proportion of 100 to 71 in dried specimens soaked in water the anthers of the shortstyled form are larger than those of the longstyled in the ratio of 100 to 83 the pollengrains also from the shortstyled flowers are conspicuously larger than those from the longstyled the ratio between the diameters of the moistened grains being as 100 to 64 according to my measurements but according to the measurements of h muller as 100 to 61 and his are probably the more accurate of the two the contents of the larger pollengrains appear more coarsely granular and of a browner tint than those in the smaller grains the two forms of hottonia thus agree closely in most respects with those of the heterostyled species of primula the flowers of hottonia are crossfertilised according to muller chiefly by diptera  mr scott made a few trials on a shortstyled plant and found that the legitimate unions were in all ways more fertile than the illegitimate 117 journal of the linnean society botany volume 8 1864 page 79 but since the publication of his paper h muller has made much fuller experiments and i give his results in table 113 drawn up in accordance with my usual plan  table 113 hottonia palustris from h muller  column 1 nature of the union column 2 number of capsules examined column 3 average number of seeds per capsule  longstyled by pollen of shortstyled legitimate union 34  914  longstyled by ownform pollen from a distinct plant illegitimate union 18  775  shortstyled by pollen of longstyled legitimate union 30  662  shortstyled by ownform pollen from a distinct plant illegitimate union 19  187  summary  the two legitimate unions together 64  788  the two illegitimate unions together 37  481  the most remarkable point in this table is the small average number of seeds from the shortstyled flowers when illegitimately fertilised and the unusually large average number of seeds yielded by the illegitimately fertilised long styled flowers relatively in both cases to the product of the legitimately fertilised flowers 118 h muller says die befruchtung etc page 352 that the longstyled flowers when illegitimately fertilised yield as many seeds as when legitimately fertilised but by adding up the number of seeds from all the capsules produced by the two methods of fertilisation as given by him i arrive at the results shown in table 113 the average number in the longstyled capsules when legitimately fertilised is 914 and when illegitimately fertilised 775 or as 100 to 85 h muller agrees with me that this is the proper manner of viewing the case the two legitimate unions compared with the two illegitimate together yield seeds in the ratio of 100 to 61  h muller also tried the effects of illegitimately fertilising the longstyled and shortstyled flowers with their own pollen instead of with that from another plant of the same form and the results are very striking for the capsules from the longstyled flowers thus treated contained on an average only 157 seeds instead of 775 and those from the shortstyled 65 instead of 187 seeds per capsule the number 65 agrees closely with mr scotts result from the same form similarly fertilised  from some observations by dr torrey hottonia inflata an inhabitant of the united states does not appear to be heterostyled but is remarkable from producing cleistogamic flowers as will be seen in the last chapter of this volume  besides the genera primula and hottonia androsace vel gregoria vel aretia vitalliana is heterostyled mr scott fertilised with their own pollen 21 flowers on three shortstyled plants in the edinburgh botanic gardens and not one yielded a single seed but eight of them which were fertilised with pollen from one of the other plants of the same form set two empty capsules 119 see also treviranus in botanische zeitung 1863 page 6 on this plant being dimorphic he was able to examine only dried specimens of the longstyled forms but the evidence seems sufficient to leave hardly a doubt that androsace is heterostyled fritz muller sent me from south brazil dried flowers of a statice which he believed to be heterostyled in the one form the pistil was considerably longer and the stamens slightly shorter than the corresponding organs in the other form but as in the shorterstyled form the stigmas reached up to the anthers of the same flower and as i could not detect in the dried specimens of the two forms any difference in their stigmas or in the size of their pollengrains i dare not rank this plant as heterostyled from statements made by vaucher i was led to think that soldanella alpina was heterostyled but it is impossible that kerner who has closely studied this plant could have overlooked the fact so again from other statements it appeared probable that pyrola might be heterostyled but h muller examined for me two species in north germany and found this not to be the case   chapter ii  hybrid primulas  the oxlip a hybrid naturally produced between primula veris and vulgaris the differences in structure and function between the two parentspecies effects of crossing longstyled and shortstyled oxlips with one another and with the two forms of both parentspecies character of the offspring from oxlips artificially selffertilised and cross fertilised in a state of nature primula elatior shown to be a distinct species hybrids between other heterostyled species of primula supplementary note on spontaneously produced hybrids in the genus verbascum  the various species of primula have produced in a state of nature throughout europe an extraordinary number of hybrid forms for instance professor kerner has found no less than twentyfive such forms in the alps 21 die primulaceenbastarten oesterr botanische zeitschrift jahr 1875 numbers 3 4 and 5 see also godron on hybrid primulas in bull soc bot de france tome 10 1853 page 178 also in revue des sciences nat 1875 page 331 the frequent occurrence of hybrids in this genus no doubt has been favoured by most of the species being heterostyled and consequently requiring crossfertilisation by insects yet in some other genera species which are not heterostyled and which in some respects appear not well adapted for hybridfertilisation have likewise been largely hybridised in certain districts of england the common oxlipa hybrid between the cowslip p veris vel officinalis and the primrose p vulgaris vel acaulisis frequently found and it occurs occasionally almost everywhere owing to the frequency of this intermediate hybrid form and to the existence of the bardfield oxlip p elatior which resembles to a certain extent the common oxlip the claim of the three forms to rank as distinct species has been discussed oftener and at greater length than that of almost any other plant linnaeus considered p veris vulgaris and elatior to be varieties of the same species as do some distinguished botanists at the present day whilst others who have carefully studied these plants do not doubt that they are distinct species the following observations prove i think that the latter view is correct and they further show that the common oxlip is a hybrid between p veris and vulgaris  the cowslip differs so conspicuously in general appearance from the primrose that nothing need here be said with respect to their external characters 22 the reverend wa leighton has pointed out certain differences in the form of the capsules and seed in annals and magazine of natural history 2nd series volume 2 1848 page 164 but some less obvious differences deserve notice as both species are heterostyled their complete fertilisation depends on insects the cowslip is habitually visited during the day by the larger humblebees namely bombus muscorum and hortorum and at night by moths as i have seen in the case of cucullia the primrose is never visited and i speak after many years observation by the larger humblebees and only rarely by the smaller kinds hence its fertilisation must depend almost exclusively on moths there is nothing in the structure of the flowers of the two plants which can determine the visits of such widely different insects but they emit a different odour and perhaps their nectar may have a different taste both the longstyled and shortstyled forms of the primrose when legitimately and naturally fertilised yield on an average many more seeds per capsule than the cowslip namely in the proportion of 100 to 55 when illegitimately fertilised they are likewise more fertile than the two forms of the cowslip as shown by the larger proportion of their flowers which set capsules and by the larger average number of seeds which the capsules contain the difference also between the number of seeds produced by the longstyled and shortstyled flowers of the primrose when both are illegitimately fertilised is greater than that between the number produced under similar circumstances by the two forms of the cowslip the longstyled flowers of the primrose when protected from the access of all insects except such minute ones as thrips yield a considerable number of capsules containing on an average 192 seeds per capsule whereas 18 plants of the longstyled cowslip similarly treated did not yield a single seed  the primrose as every one knows flowers a little earlier in the spring than the cowslip and inhabits slightly different stations and districts the primrose generally grows on banks or in woods whilst the cowslip is found in more open places the geographical range of the two forms is different dr bromfield remarks that the primrose is absent from all the interior region of northern europe where the cowslip is indigenous 23 phytologist volume 3 page 694 in norway however both plants range to the same degree of north latitude 24 h lecoq geograph bot de leurope tome 8 1858 pages 141 144 see also annals and magazine of natural history 9 1842 pages 156 515 also boreau flore du centre de la france 1840 tome 2 page 376 with respect to the rarity of p veris in western scotland see hc watson cybele britannica 2 page 293  the cowslip and primrose when intercrossed behave like distinct species for they are far from being mutually fertile gartner crossed 27 flowers of p vulgaris with pollen of p veris and obtained 16 capsules but these did not contain any good seed 25 bastarderzeugung 1849 page 721 he also crossed 21 flowers of p veris with pollen of p vulgaris and now he got only five capsules containing seed in a still less perfect condition gartner knew nothing about heterostylism and his complete failure may perhaps be accounted for by his having crossed together the same forms of the cowslip and primrose for such crosses would have been of an illegitimate as well as of a hybrid nature and this would have increased their sterility my trials were rather more fortunate twentyone flowers consisting of both forms of the cowslip and primrose were intercrossed legitimately and yielded seven capsules ie 33 per cent containing on an average 42 seeds some of these seeds however were so poor that they probably would not have germinated twentyone flowers on the same cowslip and primrose plants were also intercrossed illegitimately and they likewise yielded seven capsules or 33 per cent but these contained on an average only 13 good and bad seeds i should however state that some of the above flowers of the primrose were fertilised with pollen from the polyanthus which is certainly a variety of the cowslip as may be inferred from the perfect fertility inter se of the crossed offspring from these two plants 26 mr scott has discussed the nature of the polyanthus proceedings of the linnean society 8 botany 1864 page 103 and arrives at a different conclusion but i do not think that his experiments were sufficiently numerous the degree of infertility of a cross is liable to much fluctuation pollen from the cowslip at first appears rather more efficient on the primrose than that of the polyanthus for 12 flowers of both forms of the primrose fertilised legitimately and illegitimately with pollen of the cowslip gave five capsules containing on an average 324 seeds whilst 18 flowers similarly fertilised by polyanthuspollen yielded only five capsules containing only 226 seeds on the other hand the seeds produced by the polyanthuspollen were much the finest of the whole lot and were the only ones which germinated to show how sterile these hybrid unions were i may remind the reader that 90 per cent of the flowers of the primrose fertilised legitimately with primrosepollen yielded capsules containing on an average 66 seeds and that 54 per cent of the flowers fertilised illegitimately yielded capsules containing on an average 355 seeds per capsule the primrose especially the shortstyled form when fertilised by the cowslip is less sterile as gartner likewise observed than is the cowslip when fertilised by the primrose the above experiments also show that a cross between the same forms of the primrose and cowslip is much more sterile than that between different forms of these two species  the seeds from the several foregoing crosses were sown but none germinated except those from the shortstyled primrose fertilised with pollen of the polyanthus and these seeds were the finest of the whole lot i thus raised six plants and compared them with a group of wild oxlips which i had transplanted into my garden one of these wild oxlips produced slightly larger flowers than the others and this one was identical in every character in foliage flower peduncle and flowers with my six plants excepting that the flowers of the latter were tinged of a dingy red colour from being descended from the polyanthus  we thus see that the cowslip and primrose cannot be crossed either way except with considerable difficulty that they differ conspicuously in external appearance that they differ in various physiological characters that they inhabit slightly different stations and range differently hence those botanists who rank these plants as varieties ought to be able to prove that they are not as well fixed in character as are most species and the evidence in favour of such instability of character appears at first sight very strong it rests first on statements made by several competent observers that they have raised cowslips primroses and oxlips from seeds of the same plant and secondly on the frequent occurrence in a state of nature of plants presenting every intermediate gradation between the cowslip and primrose  the first statement however is of little value for heterostylism not being formerly understood the seedbearing plants were in no instance protected from the visits of insects 27 one author states in the phytologist volume 3 page 703 that he covered with bellglasses some cowslips primroses etc on which he experimented he specifies all the details of his experiment but does not say that he artificially fertilised his plants yet he obtained an abundance of seed which is simply impossible hence there must have been some strange error in these experiments which may be passed over as valueless and there would be almost as much risk of an isolated cowslip or of several cowslips if consisting of the same form being crossed by a neighbouring primrose and producing oxlips as of one sex of a dioecious plant under similar circumstances being crossed by the opposite sex of an allied and neighbouring species mr hc watson a critical and most careful observer made many experiments by sowing the seeds of cowslips and of various kinds of oxlips and arrived at the following conclusion namely that seeds of a cowslip can produce cowslips and oxlips and that seeds of an oxlip can produce cowslips oxlips and primroses 28 phytologist 2 pages 217 852 3 page 43 this conclusion harmonises perfectly with the view that in all cases when such results have been obtained the unprotected cowslips have been crossed by primroses and the unprotected oxlips by either cowslips or primroses for in this latter case we might expect by the aid of reversion which notoriously comes into powerful action with hybrids that the two parentforms in appearance pure as well as many intermediate gradations would be occasionally produced nevertheless the two following statements offer considerable difficulty the reverend professor henslow raised from seeds of a cowslip growing in his garden various kinds of oxlips and one perfect primrose but a statement in the same paper perhaps throws light on this anomalous result 29 loudons magazine of natural history 3 1830 page 409 professor henslow had previously transplanted into his garden a cowslip which completely changed its appearance during the following year and now resembled an oxlip next year again it changed its character and produced in addition to the ordinary umbels a few single flowered scapes bearing flowers somewhat smaller and more deeply coloured than those of the common primrose from what i have myself observed with oxlips i cannot doubt that this plant was an oxlip in a highly variable condition almost like that of the famous cytisus adami this presumed oxlip was propagated by offsets which were planted in different parts of the garden and if professor henslow took by mistake seeds from one of these plants especially if it had been crossed by a primrose the result would be quite intelligible another case is still more difficult to understand dr herbert raised from the seeds of a highly cultivated red cowslip cowslips oxlips of various kinds and a primrose 210 transactions of the horticultural society 4 page 19 this case if accurately recorded which i much doubt is explicable only on the improbable assumption that the red cowslip was not of pure parentage with species and varieties of many kinds when intercrossed one is sometimes strongly prepotent over the other and instances are known of a variety crossed by another producing offspring which in certain characters as in colour hairiness etc have proved identical with the pollenbearing parent and quite dissimilar to the motherplant 211 i have given instances in my work on the variation of animals and plants under domestication chapter 15 2nd edition volume 2 page 69 but i do not know of any instance of the offspring of a cross perfectly resembling in a considerable number of important characters the father alone it is therefore very improbable that a pure cowslip crossed by a primrose should ever produce a primrose in appearance pure although the facts given by dr herbert and professor henslow are difficult to explain yet until it can be shown that a cowslip or a primrose carefully protected from insects will give birth to at least oxlips the cases hitherto recorded have little weight in leading us to admit that the cowslip and primrose are varieties of one and the same species  negative evidence is of little value but the following facts may be worth givingsome cowslips which had been transplanted from the fields into a shrubbery were again transplanted into highly manured land in the following year they were protected from insects artificially fertilised and the seed thus procured was sown in a hotbed the young plants were afterwards planted out some in very rich soil some in stiff poor clay some in old peat and some in pots in the greenhouse so that these plants 765 in number as well as their parents were subjected to diversified and unnatural treatment but not one of them presented the least variation except in sizethose in the peat attaining almost gigantic dimensions and those in the clay being much dwarfed  i do not of course doubt that cowslips exposed during several successive generations to changed conditions would vary and that this might occasionally occur in a state of nature moreover from the law of analogical variation the varieties of any one species of primula would probably in some cases resemble other species of the genus for instance i raised a red primrose from seed from a protected plant and the flowers though still resembling those of the primrose were borne during one season in umbels on a long footstalk like that of a cowslip  with regard to the second class of facts in support of the cowslip and primrose being ranked as mere varieties namely the wellascertained existence in a state of nature of numerous linking forms 212 see an excellent article on this subject by mr hc watson in the phytologist volume 3 page 43if it can be shown that the common wild oxlip which is intermediate in character between the cowslip and primrose resembles in sterility and other essential respects a hybrid plant and if it can further be shown that the oxlip though in a high degree sterile can be fertilised by either parentspecies thus giving rise to still finer gradational links then the presence of such linking forms in a state of nature ceases to be an argument of any weight in favour of the cowslip and primrose being varieties and becomes in fact an argument on the other side the hybrid origin of a plant in a state of nature can be recognised by four tests first by its occurrence only where both presumed parentspecies exist or have recently existed and this holds good as far as i can discover with the oxlip but the p elatior of jacq which as we shall presently see constitutes a distinct species must not be confounded with the common oxlip secondly by the supposed hybrid plant being nearly intermediate in character between the two parentspecies and especially by its resembling hybrids artificially made between the same two species now the oxlip is intermediate in character and resembles in every respect except in the colour of the corolla hybrids artificially produced between the primrose and the polyanthus which latter is a variety of the cowslip thirdly by the supposed hybrids being more or less sterile when crossed inter se but to try this fairly two distinct plants of the same parentage and not two flowers on the same plant should be crossed for many pure species are more or less sterile with pollen from the same individual plant and in the case of hybrids from heterostyled species the opposite forms should be crossed fourthly and lastly by the supposed hybrids being much more fertile when crossed with either pure parentspecies than when crossed inter se but still not as fully fertile as the parentspecies  for the sake of ascertaining the two latter points i transplanted a group of wild oxlips into my garden they consisted of one longstyled and three short styled plants which except in the corolla of one being slightly larger resembled each other closely the trials which were made and the results obtained are shown in tables 214 215 216 217 and 218 no less than twenty different crosses are necessary in order to ascertain fully the fertility of hybrid heterostyled plants both inter se and with their two parentspecies in this instance 256 flowers were crossed in the course of four seasons i may mention as a mere curiosity that if any one were to raise hybrids between two trimorphic heterostyled species he would have to make 90 distinct unions in order to ascertain their fertility in all ways and as he would have to try at least 10 flowers in each case he would be compelled to fertilise 900 flowers and count their seeds this would probably exhaust the patience of the most patient man  table 214  crosses inter se between

of capsules and of seeds produced by crossing both forms of the oxlip in a legitimate and illegitimate manner with one another and with the two forms of the primrose and cowslip i may premise that the pollen of two of the shortstyled oxlips consisted of nothing but minute aborted whitish cells but in the third shortstyled plant about one fifth of the grains appeared in a sound condition hence it is not surprising that neither the shortstyled nor the longstyled oxlip produced a single seed when fertilised with this pollen nor did the pure cowslips or primroses when illegitimately fertilised with it but when thus legitimately fertilised they yielded a few good seeds the female organs of the shortstyled oxlips though greatly deteriorated in power were in a rather better condition than the male organs for though the shortstyled oxlips yielded no seed when fertilised by the longstyled oxlips and hardly any when illegitimately fertilised by pure cowslips or primroses yet when legitimately fertilised by these latter species especially by the longstyled primrose they yielded a moderate supply of good seed  the longstyled oxlip was more fertile than the three shortstyled oxlips and about half its pollengrains appeared sound it bore no seed when legitimately fertilised by the shortstyled oxlips but this no doubt was due to the badness of the pollen of the latter for when illegitimately fertilised table 214 by its own pollen it produced some good seeds though much fewer than self fertilised cowslips or primroses would have produced the longstyled oxlip likewise yielded a very low average of seed as may be seen in the third compartment of tables 215 to 218 when illegitimately fertilised by and when illegitimately fertilising pure cowslips and primroses the four corresponding legitimate unions however were moderately fertile and one namely that between a shortstyled cowslip and the longstyled oxlip in table 217 was nearly as fertile as if both parents had been pure a shortstyled primrose legitimately fertilised by the longstyled oxlip table 218 also yielded a moderately good average namely 487 seeds but if this shortstyled primrose had been fertilised by a longstyled primrose it would have yielded an average of 65 seeds if we take the ten legitimate unions together and the ten illegitimate unions together we shall find that 29 per cent of the flowers fertilised in a legitimate manner yielded capsules these containing on an average 274 good and bad seeds whilst only 15 per cent of the flowers fertilised in an illegitimate manner yielded capsules these containing on an average only 110 good and bad seeds  in a previous part of this chapter it was shown that illegitimate crosses between the longstyled form of the primrose and the longstyled cowslip and between the shortstyled primrose and shortstyled cowslip are more sterile than legitimate crosses between these two species and we now see that the same rule holds good almost invariably with their hybrid offspring whether these are crossed inter se or with either parentspecies so that in this particular case but not as we shall presently see in other cases the same rule prevails with the pure unions between the two forms of the same heterostyled species with crosses between two distinct heterostyled species and with their hybrid offspring  seeds from the longstyled oxlip fertilised by its own pollen were sown and three longstyled plants raised the first of these was identical in every character with its parent the second bore rather smaller flowers of a paler colour almost like those of the primrose the scapes were at first single flowered but later in the season a tall thick scape bearing many flowers like that of the parent oxlip was thrown up the third plant likewise produced at first only singleflowered scapes with the flowers rather small and of a darker yellow but it perished early the second plant also died in september and the first plant though all three grew under very favourable conditions looked very sickly hence we may infer that seedlings from selffertilised oxlips would hardly be able to exist in a state of nature i was surprised to find that all the pollengrains in the first of these seedling oxlips appeared sound and in the second only a moderate number were bad these two plants however had not the power of producing a proper number of seeds for though left uncovered and surrounded by pure primroses and cowslips the capsules were estimated to include an average of only from fifteen to twenty seeds  from having many experiments in hand i did not sow the seed obtained by crossing both forms of the primrose and cowslip with both forms of the oxlip which i now regret but i ascertained an interesting point namely the character of the offspring from oxlips growing in a state of nature near both primroses and cowslips the oxlips were the same plants which after their seeds had been collected were transplanted and experimented on from the seeds thus obtained eight plants were raised which when they flowered might have been mistaken for pure primroses but on close comparison the eye in the centre of the corolla was seen to be of a darker yellow and the peduncles more elongated as the season advanced one of these plants threw up two naked scapes 7 inches in height which bore umbels of flowers of the same character as before this fact led me to examine the other plants after they had flowered and were dug up and i found that the flowerpeduncles of all sprung from an extremely short common scape of which no trace can be found in the pure primrose hence these plants are beautifully intermediate between the oxlip and the primrose inclining rather towards the latter and we may safely conclude that the parent oxlips had been fertilised by the surrounding primroses  from the various facts now given there can be no doubt that the common oxlip is a hybrid between the cowslip p veris brit fl and the primrose p vulgaris brit fl as has been surmised by several botanists it is probable that oxlips may be produced either from the cowslip or the primrose as the seed bearer but oftenest from the latter as i judge from the nature of the stations in which oxlips are generally found 213 see also on this head hardwickes science gossip 1867 pages 114 137 and from the primrose when crossed by the cowslip being more fertile than conversely the cowslip by the primrose the hybrids themselves are also rather more fertile when crossed with the primrose than with the cowslip whichever may be the seedbearing plant the cross is probably between different forms of the two species for we have seen that legitimate hybrid unions are more fertile than illegitimate hybrid unions moreover a friend in surrey found that 29 oxlips which grew in the neighbourhood of his house consisted of 13 longstyled and 16 shortstyled plants now if the parentplants had been illegitimately united either the long or shortstyled form would have greatly preponderated as we shall hereafter see good reason to believe the case of the oxlip is interesting for hardly any other instance is known of a hybrid spontaneously arising in such large numbers over so wide an extent of country the common oxlip not the p elatior of jacq is found almost everywhere throughout england where both cowslips and primroses grow in some districts as i have seen near hartfield in sussex and in parts of surrey specimens may be found on the borders of almost every field and small wood in other districts the oxlip is comparatively rare near my own residence i have found during the last twentyfive years not more than five or six plants or groups of plants it is difficult to conjecture what is the cause of this difference in their number it is almost necessary that a plant or several plants belonging to the same form of one parentspecies should grow near the opposite form of the other parentspecies and it is further necessary that both species should be frequented by the same kind of insect no doubt a moth the cause of the rare appearance of the oxlip in certain districts may be the rarity of some moth which in other districts habitually visits both the primrose and cowslip  finally as the cowslip and primrose differ in the various characters above specifiedas they are in a high degree sterile when intercrossedas there is no trustworthy evidence that either species when uncrossed has ever given birth to the other species or to any intermediate formand as the intermediate forms which are often found in a state of nature have been shown to be more or less sterile hybrids of the first or second generationwe must for the future look at the cowslip and primrose as good and true species  primula elatior jacq or the bardfield oxlip is found in england only in two or three of the eastern counties on the continent it has a somewhat different range from that of the cowslip and primrose and it inhabits some districts where neither of these species live 214 for england see hewett c watson cybele britannica volume 2 1849 page 292 for the continent see lecoq geograph botanique de leurope tome 8 1858 page 142 for the alps see annals and magazine of natural history volume 9 1842 pages 156 and 515 in general appearance it differs so much from the common oxlip that no one accustomed to see both forms in the living state could afterwards confound them but there is scarcely more than a single character by which they can be distinctly defined namely their linearoblong capsules equalling the calyx in length 215 babington manual of british botany 1851 page 258 the capsules when mature differ conspicuously owing to their length from those of the cowslip and primrose with respect to the fertility of the two forms when these are united in the four possible methods they behave like the other heterostyled species of the genus but differ somewhat see tables 18 and 112 in the smaller proportion of the illegitimately fertilised flowers which set capsules that p elatior is not a hybrid is certain for when the two forms were legitimately united they yielded the large average of 471 seeds and when illegitimately united 355 per capsule whereas of the four possible unions table 214 between the two forms of the common oxlip which we know to be a hybrid one alone yielded any seed and in this case the average number was only 116 per capsule moreover i could not detect a single bad pollengrain in the anthers of the shortstyled p elatior whilst in two shortstyled plants of the common oxlip all the grains were bad as were a large majority in a third plant as the common oxlip is a hybrid between the primrose and cowslip it is not surprising that eight longstyled flowers of the primrose fertilised by pollen from the longstyled common oxlip produced eight capsules table 118 containing however only a low average of seeds whilst the same number of flowers of the primrose similarly fertilised by the longstyled bardfield oxlip produced only a single capsule this latter plant being an altogether distinct species from the primrose plants of p elatior have been propagated by seed in a garden for twentyfive years and have kept all this time quite constant excepting that in some cases the flowers varied a little in size and tint 216 see mr h doubleday in the gardeners chronicle 1867 page 435 also mr w marshall ibid page 462 nevertheless according to mr hc watson and dr bromfield 217 phytologist volume 1 page 1001 and volume 3 page 695 plants may be occasionally found in a state of nature in which most of the characters by which this species can be distinguished from p veris and vulgaris fail but such intermediate forms are probably due to hybridisation for kerner states in the paper before referred to that hybrids sometimes though rarely arise in the alps between p elatior and veris  finally although we may freely admit that primula veris vulgaris and elatior as well as all the other species of the genus are descended from a common primordial form yet from the facts above given we must conclude that these three forms are now as fixed in character as are many others which are universally ranked as true species consequently they have as good a right to receive distinct specific names as have for instance the ass quagga and zebra  mr scott has arrived at some interesting results by crossing other heterostyled species of primula 218 journal of the linnean society botany volume 8 1864 page 93 to end i have already alluded to his statement that in four instances not to mention others a species when crossed with a distinct one yielded a larger number of seeds than the same species fertilised illegitimately with its ownform pollen though taken from a distinct plant it has long been known from the researches of kolreuter and gartner that two species when crossed reciprocally sometimes differ as widely as is possible in their fertility thus a when crossed with the pollen of b will yield a large number of seeds whilst b may be crossed repeatedly with pollen of a and will never yield a single seed now mr scott shows in several cases that the same law holds good when two heterostyled species of primula are intercrossed or when one is crossed with a homostyled species but the results are much more complicated than with ordinary plants as two heterostyled dimorphic species can be intercrossed in eight different ways i will give one instance from mr scott the longstyled p hirsuta fertilised legitimately and illegitimately with pollen from the two forms of p auricula and reciprocally the longstyled p auricula fertilised legitimately and illegitimately with pollen from the two forms of p hirsuta did not produce a single seed nor did the shortstyled p hirsuta when fertilised legitimately and illegitimately with the pollen of the two forms of p auricula on the other hand the shortstyled p auricula fertilised with pollen from the longstyled p hirsuta yielded capsules containing on an average no less than 56 seeds and the shortstyled p auricula by pollen of the short styled p hirsuta yielded capsules containing on an average 42 seeds per capsule so that out of the eight possible unions between the two forms of these two species six were utterly barren and two fairly fertile we have seen also the same sort of extraordinary irregularity in the results of my twenty different crosses tables 214 to 218 between the two forms of the oxlip primrose and cowslip mr scott remarks with respect to the results of his trials that they are very surprising as they show us that the sexual forms of a species manifest in their respective powers for conjunction with those of another species physiological peculiarities which might well entitle them by the criterion of fertility to specific distinction  finally although p veris and vulgaris when crossed legitimately and especially when their hybrid offspring are crossed in this manner with both parentspecies were decidedly more fertile than when crossed in an illegitimate manner and although the legitimate cross effected by mr scott between p auricula and hirsuta was more fertile in the ratio of 56 to 42 than the illegitimate cross nevertheless it is very doubtful from the extreme irregularity of the results in the various other hybrid crosses made by mr scott whether it can be predicted that two heterostyled species are generally more fertile if crossed legitimately ie when opposite forms are united than when crossed illegitimately  supplementary note on some wild hybrid verbascums  in an early part of this chapter i remarked that few other instances could be given of a hybrid spontaneously arising in such large numbers and over so wide an extent of country as that of the common oxlip but perhaps the number of wellascertained cases of naturally produced hybrid willows is equally great 219 max wichura die bastardbefruchtung etc der weiden 1865 numerous spontaneous hybrids between several species of cistus found near narbonne have been carefully described by m timballagrave 220 mem de lacad des sciences de toulouse 5e serie tome 5 page 28 and many hybrids between an aceras and orchis have been observed by dr weddell 221 annales des sc nat 3e serie bot tome 18 page 6 in the genus verbascum hybrids are supposed to have often originated in a state of nature 222 see for instance the english flora by sir je smith 1824 volume 1 page 307 some of these undoubtedly are hybrids and several hybrids have originated in gardens but most of these cases require as gartner remarks verification 223 see gartner bastarderzeugung 1849 page 590 hence the following case is worth recording more especially as the two species in question v thapsus and lychnitis are perfectly fertile when insects are excluded showing that the stigma of each flower receives its own pollen moreover the flowers offer only pollen to insects and have not been rendered attractive to them by secreting nectar  i transplanted a young wild plant into my garden for experimental purposes and when it flowered it plainly differed from the two species just mentioned and from a third which grows in this neighbourhood i thought that it was a strange variety of v thapsus it attained the height by measurement of 8 feet it was covered with a net and ten flowers were fertilised with pollen from the same plant later in the season when uncovered the flowers were freely visited by pollencollecting bees nevertheless although many capsules were produced not one contained a single seed during the following year this same plant was left uncovered near plants of v thapsus and lychnitis but again it did not produce a single seed four flowers however which were repeatedly fertilised with pollen of v lychnitis whilst the plant was temporarily kept under a net produced four capsules which contained five one two and two seeds at the same time three flowers were fertilised with pollen of v thapsus and these produced two two and three seeds to show how unproductive these seven capsules were i may state that a fine capsule from a plant of v thapsus growing close by contained above 700 seeds these facts led me to search the moderatelysized field whence my plant had been removed and i found in it many plants of v thapsus and lychnitis as well as thirtythree plants intermediate in character between these two species these thirtythree plants differed much from one another in the branching of the stem they more closely resembled v lychnitis than v thapsus but in height the latter species in the shape of their leaves they often closely approached v lychnitis but some had leaves extremely woolly on the upper surface and decurrent like those of v thapsus yet the degree of woolliness and of decurrency did not always go together in the petals being flat and remaining open and in the manner in which the anthers of the longer stamens were attached to the filaments these plants all took more after v lychnitis than v thapsus in the yellow colour of the corolla they all resembled the latter species on the whole these plants appeared to take rather more after v lychnitis than v thapsus on the supposition that they were hybrids it is not an anomalous circumstance that they should all have produced yellow flowers for gartner crossed white and yellowflowered varieties of verbascum and the offspring thus produced never bore flowers of an intermediate tint but either pure white or pure yellow flowers generally of the latter colour 224 bastardzeugung page 307  my observations were made in the autumn so that i was able to collect some halfmatured capsules from twenty of the thirtythree intermediate plants and likewise capsules of the pure v lychnitis and thapsus growing in the same field all the latter were filled with perfect but immature seeds whilst the capsules of the twenty intermediate plants did not contain one single perfect seed these plants consequently were absolutely barren from this factfrom the one plant which was transplanted into my garden yielding when artificially fertilised with pollen from v lychnitis and thapsus some seeds though extremely few in numberfrom the circumstance of the two pure species growing in the same fieldand from the intermediate character of the sterile plants there can be no doubt that they were hybrids judging from the position in which they were chiefly found i am inclined to believe they were descended from v thapsus as the seedbearer and v lychnitis as the pollenbearer  it is known that many species of verbascum when the stem is jarred or struck by a stick cast off their flowers 225 this was first observed by correa de serra see sir je smiths english flora 1824 volume 1 page 311 also life of sir je smith volume 2 page 210 i was guided to these references by the reverend wa leighton who observed this same phenomenon with v virgatum this occurs with v thapsus as i have repeatedly observed the corolla first separates from its attachment and then the sepals spontaneously bend inwards so as to clasp the ovarium pushing off the corolla by their movement in the course of two or three minutes nothing of this kind takes place with young barely expanded flowers with verbascum lychnitis and as i believe v phoeniceum the corolla is not cast off however often and severely the stem may be struck in this curious property the abovedescribed hybrids took after v thapsus for i observed to my surprise that when i pulled off the flowerbuds round the flowers which i wished to mark with a thread the slight jar invariably caused the corollas to fall off  these hybrids are interesting under several points of view first from the number found in various parts of the same moderatelysized field that they owed their origin to insects flying from flower to flower whilst collecting pollen there can be no doubt although insects thus rob the flowers of a most precious substance yet they do great good for as i have elsewhere shown the seedlings of v thapsus raised from flowers fertilised with pollen from another plant are more vigorous than those raised from selffertilised flowers 226 the effects of cross and selffertilisation 1876 page 89 but in this particular instance the insects did great harm as they led to the production of utterly barren plants secondly these hybrids are remarkable from differing much from one another in many of their characters for hybrids of the first generation if raised from uncultivated plants are generally uniform in character that these hybrids belonged to the first generation we may safely conclude from the absolute sterility of all those observed by me in a state of nature and of the one plant in my garden excepting when artificially and repeatedly fertilised with pure pollen and then the number of seeds produced was extremely small as these hybrids varied so much an almost perfectly graduated series of forms connecting together the two widely distinct parentspecies could easily have been selected this case like that of the common oxlip shows that botanists ought to be cautious in inferring the specific identity of two forms from the presence of intermediate gradations nor would it be easy in the many cases in which hybrids are moderately fertile to detect a slight degree of sterility in such plants growing in a state of nature and liable to be fertilised by either parentspecies thirdly and lastly these hybrids offer an excellent illustration of a statement made by that admirable observer gartner namely that although plants which can be crossed with ease generally produce fairly fertile offspring yet wellpronounced exceptions to this rule occur and here we have two species of verbascum which evidently cross with the greatest ease but produce hybrids which are excessively sterile   chapter iii heterostyled dimorphic plantscontinued  linum grandiflorum longstyled

stigmas  it has long been known that several species of linum present two forms 31 treviranus has shown that this is the case in his review of my original paper botanische zeitung 1863 page 189 and having observed this fact in l flavum more than thirty years ago i was led after ascertaining the nature of heterostylism in primula to examine the first species of linum which i met with namely the beautiful l grandiflorum this plant exists under two forms occurring in about equal numbers which differ little in structure but greatly in function the foliage corolla stamens and pollengrains the latter examined both distended with water and dry are alike in the two forms figure 34 the difference is confined to the pistil in the shortstyled form the styles and the stigmas are only about half the length of those in the long styled a more important distinction is that the five stigmas in the short styled form diverge greatly from one another and pass out between the filaments of the stamens and thus lie within the tube of the corolla in the longstyled form the elongated stigmas stand nearly upright and alternate with the anthers in this latter form the length of the stigmas varies considerably their upper extremities projecting even a little above the anthers or reaching up only to about their middle nevertheless there is never the slightest difficulty in distinguishing between the two forms for besides the difference in the divergence of the stigmas those of the shortstyled form never reach even to the bases of the anthers in this form the papillae on the stigmatic surfaces are shorter darkercoloured and more crowded together than in the longstyled form but these differences seem due merely to the shortening of the stigma for in the varieties of the longstyled form with shorter stigmas the papillae are more crowded and darkercoloured than in those with the longer stigmas considering the slight and variable differences between the two forms of this linum it is not surprising that hitherto they have been overlooked  in 1861 i had eleven plants in my garden eight of which were longstyled and three shortstyled two very fine longstyled plants grew in a bed a hundred yards off all the others and separated from them by a screen of evergreens i marked twelve flowers and placed on their stigmas a little pollen from the shortstyled plants the pollen of the two forms is as stated identical in appearance the stigmas of the longstyled flowers were already thickly covered with their own pollenso thickly that i could not find one bare stigma and it was late in the season namely september 15th altogether it seemed almost childish to expect any result nevertheless from my experiments on primula i had faith and did not hesitate to make the trial but certainly did not anticipate the full result which was obtained the germens of these twelve flowers all swelled and ultimately six fine capsules the seed of which germinated on the following year and two poor capsules were produced only four capsules shanking off these same two longstyled plants produced in the course of the summer a vast number of flowers the stigmas of which were covered with their own pollen but they all proved absolutely barren and their germens did not even swell  the nine other plants six longstyled and three shortstyled grew not very far apart in my flowergarden four of these longstyled plants produced no seed capsules the fifth produced two and the remaining one grew so close to a shortstyled plant that their branches touched and this produced twelve capsules but they were poor ones the case was different with the shortstyled plants the one which grew close to the longstyled plant produced ninetyfour imperfectly fertilised capsules containing a multitude of bad seeds with a moderate number of good ones the two other shortstyled plants growing together were small being partly smothered by other plants they did not stand very close to any longstyled plants yet they yielded together nineteen capsules these facts seem to show that the shortstyled plants are more fertile with their own pollen than are the longstyled and we shall immediately see that this probably is the case but i suspect that the difference in fertility between the two forms was in this instance in part due to a distinct cause i repeatedly watched the flowers and only once saw a humblebee momentarily alight on one and then fly away if bees had visited the several plants there cannot be a doubt that the four longstyled plants which did not produce a single capsule would have borne an abundance but several times i saw small diptera sucking the flowers and these insects though not visiting the flowers with anything like the regularity of bees would carry a little pollen from one form to the other especially when growing near together and the stigmas of the shortstyled plants diverging within the tube of the corolla would be more likely than the upright stigmas of the longstyled plants to receive a small quantity of pollen if brought to them by small insects moreover from the greater number of the longstyled than of the shortstyled plants in the garden the latter would be more likely to receive pollen from the longstyled than the longstyled from the shortstyled  in 1862 i raised thirtyfour plants of this linum in a hotbed and these consisted of seventeen longstyled and seventeen shortstyled forms seed sown later in the flowergarden yielded seventeen longstyled and twelve shortstyled forms these facts justify the statement that the two forms are produced in about equal numbers the thirtyfour plants of the first lot were kept under a net which excluded all insects except such minute ones as thrips i fertilised fourteen longstyled flowers legitimately with pollen from the shortstyled and got eleven fine seedcapsules which contained on an average 86 seeds per capsule but only 56 appeared to be good it may be well to state that ten seeds is the maximum production for a capsule and that our climate cannot be very favourable to this northafrican plant on three occasions the stigmas of nearly a hundred flowers were fertilised illegitimately with their ownform pollen taken from separate plants so as to prevent any possible ill effects from close interbreeding many other flowers were also produced which as before stated must have received plenty of their own pollen yet from all these flowers borne by the seventeen longstyled plants only three capsules were produced one of these included no seed and the other two together gave only five good seeds it is probable that this miserable product of two halffertile capsules from the seventeen plants each of which must have produced at least fifty or sixty flowers resulted from their fertilisation with pollen from the shortstyled plants by the aid of thrips for i made a great mistake in keeping the two forms under the same net with their branches often interlocking and it is surprising that a greater number of flowers were not accidentally fertilised  twelve shortstyled flowers were in this instance castrated and afterwards fertilised legitimately with pollen from the longstyled form and they produced seven fine capsules these included on an average 76 seeds but of apparently good seed only 43 per capsule at three separate times nearly a hundred flowers were fertilised illegitimately with their ownform pollen taken from separate plants and numerous other flowers were produced many of which must have received their own pollen from all these flowers on the seventeen shortstyled plants only fifteen capsules were produced of which only eleven contained any good seed on an average 42 per capsule as remarked in the case of the long styled plants some even of these capsules were perhaps the product of a little pollen accidentally fallen from the adjoining flowers of the other form on to the stigmas or transported by thrips nevertheless the shortstyled plants seem to be slightly more fertile with their own pollen than the longstyled in the proportion of fifteen capsules to three nor can this difference be accounted for by the shortstyled stigmas being more liable to receive their own pollen than the longstyled for the reverse is the case the greater selffertility of the shortstyled flowers was likewise shown in 1861 by the plants in my flower garden which were left to themselves and were but sparingly visited by insects  on account of the probability of some of the flowers on the plants of both forms which were covered under the same net having been legitimately fertilised in an accidental manner the relative fertility of the two legitimate and two illegitimate unions cannot be compared with certainty but judging from the number of good seeds per capsule the difference was at least in the ratio of 100 to 7 and probably much greater  hildebrand tested my results but only on a single shortstyled plant by fertilising many flowers with their ownform pollen and these did not produce any seed this confirms my suspicion that some of the few capsules produced by the foregoing seventeen shortstyled plants were the product of accidental legitimate fertilisation other flowers on the same plant were fertilised by hildebrand with pollen from the longstyled form and all produced fruit 32 botanische zeitung january 1 1864 page 2  the absolute sterility judging from the experiments of 1861 of the longstyled plants with their ownform pollen led me to examine into its apparent cause and the results are so curious that they are worth giving in detail the experiments were tried on plants grown in pots and brought successively into the house  first  pollen from a shortstyled plant was placed on the five stigmas of a longstyled flower and these after thirty hours were found deeply penetrated by a multitude of pollentubes far too numerous to be counted the stigmas had also become discoloured and twisted i repeated this experiment on another flower and in eighteen hours the stigmas were penetrated by a multitude of long pollen tubes this is what might have been expected as the union is a legitimate one the converse experiment was likewise tried and pollen from a longstyled flower was placed on the stigmas of a shortstyled flower and in twentyfour hours the stigmas were discoloured twisted and penetrated by numerous pollentubes and this again is what might have been expected as the union was a legitimate one  secondly  pollen from a longstyled flower was placed on all five stigmas of a longstyled flower on a separate plant after nineteen hours the stigmas were dissected and only a single pollengrain had emitted a tube and this was a very short one to make sure that the pollen was good i took in this case and in most of the other cases pollen either from the same anther or from the same flower and proved it to be good by placing it on the stigma of a shortstyled plant and found numerous pollentubes emitted  thirdly  repeated last experiment and placed ownform pollen on all five stigmas of a longstyled flower after nineteen hours and a half not one single grain had emitted its tube  fourthly  repeated the experiment with the same result after twentyfour hours  fifthly  repeated last experiment and after leaving pollen on for nineteen hours put on an additional quantity of ownform pollen on all five stigmas after an interval of three days the stigmas were examined and instead of being discoloured and twisted they were straight and freshcoloured only one grain had emitted a quite short tube which was drawn out of the stigmatic tissue without being ruptured  the following experiments are more striking  sixthly  i placed ownform pollen on three of the stigmas of a longstyled flower and pollen from a shortstyled flower on the other two stigmas after twentytwo hours these two stigmas were discoloured slightly twisted and penetrated by the tubes of numerous pollengrains the other three stigmas covered with their ownform pollen were fresh and all the pollengrains were loose but i did not dissect the whole stigma  seventhly  experiment repeated in the same manner with the same result  eighthly  experiment repeated but the stigmas were carefully examined after an interval of only five hours and a half the two stigmas with pollen from a shortstyled flower were penetrated by innumerable tubes which were as yet short and the stigmas themselves were not at all discoloured the three stigmas covered with their ownform pollen were not penetrated by a single pollentube  ninthly  put pollen of a shortstyled flower on a single longstyled stigma and ownform pollen on the other four stigmas after twentyfour hours the one stigma was somewhat discoloured and twisted and penetrated by many long tubes the other four stigmas were quite straight and fresh but on dissecting them i found that three pollengrains had protruded very short tubes into the tissue  tenthly  repeated the experiment with the same result after twentyfour hours excepting that only two ownform grains had penetrated the stigmatic tissue with their tubes to a very short depth the one stigma which was deeply penetrated by a multitude of tubes from the shortstyled pollen presented a conspicuous difference in being much curled halfshrivelled and discoloured in comparison with the other four straight and bright pink stigmas  i could add other experiments but those now given amply suffice to show that the pollengrains of a shortstyled flower placed on the stigma of a longstyled flower emit a multitude of tubes after an interval of from five to six hours and penetrate the tissue ultimately to a great depth and that after twentyfour hours the stigmas thus penetrated change colour become twisted and appear halfwithered on the other hand pollengrains from a longstyled flower placed on its own stigmas do not emit their tubes after an interval of a day or even three days or at most only three or four grains out of a multitude emit their tubes and these apparently never penetrate the stigmatic tissue deeply and the stigmas themselves do not soon become discoloured and twisted  this seems to me a remarkable physiological fact the pollengrains of the two forms are undistinguishable under the microscope the stigmas differ only in length degree of divergence and in the size shade of colour and approximation of their papillae these latter differences being variable and apparently due merely to the degree of elongation of the stigma yet we plainly see that the two kinds of pollen and the two stigmas are widely dissimilar in their mutual reactionthe stigmas of each form being almost powerless on their own pollen but causing through some mysterious influence apparently by simple contact for i could detect no viscid secretion the pollengrains of the opposite form to protrude their tubes it may be said that the two pollens and the two stigmas mutually recognise each other by some means taking fertility as the criterion of distinctness it is no exaggeration to say that the pollen of the longstyled linum grandiflorum and conversely that of the other form has been brought to a degree of differentiation with respect to its action on the stigma of the same form corresponding with that existing between the pollen and stigma of species belonging to distinct genera  linum perenne  this species is conspicuously heterostyled as has been noticed by several authors the pistil in the longstyled form is nearly twice as long as that of the shortstyled in the latter the stigmas are smaller and diverging to a greater degree pass out low down between the filaments i could detect no difference in the two forms in the size of the stigmatic papillae in the long styled form alone the stigmatic surfaces of the mature pistils twist round so as to face the circumference of the flower but to this point i shall presently return differently from what occurs in l grandiflorum the longstyled flowers have stamens hardly more than half the length of those in the shortstyled the size of the pollengrains is rather variable after some doubt i have come to the conclusion that there is no uniform difference between the grains in the two forms the longstamens in the shortstyled form project to some height above the corolla and their filaments are coloured blue apparently from exposure to the light the anthers of the longer stamens correspond in height with the lower part of the stigmas of the longstyled flowers and the anthers of the shorter stamens of the latter correspond in the same manner in height with the stigmas of the shortstyled flowers  i raised from seed twentysix plants of which twelve proved to be longstyled and fourteen shortstyled they flowered well but were not large plants as i did not expect them to flower so soon i did not transplant them and they unfortunately grew with their branches closely interlocked all the plants were covered under the same net excepting one of each form of the flowers on the longstyled plants twelve were illegitimately fertilised with their ownform pollen taken in every case from a separate plant and not one set a seed capsule twelve other flowers were legitimately fertilised with pollen from shortstyled flowers and they set nine capsules each including on an average 7 good seeds ten being the maximum number ever produced of the flowers on the shortstyled plants twelve were illegitimately fertilised with ownform pollen and they yielded one capsule including only 3 good seeds twelve other flowers were legitimately fertilised with pollen from longstyled flowers and these produced nine capsules but one was bad the eight good capsules contained on an average 8 good seeds each judging from the number of seeds per capsule the fertility of the two legitimate to that of the two illegitimate unions is as 100 to 20  the numerous flowers on the eleven longstyled plants under the net which were not fertilised produced only three capsules including 8 4 and 1 good seeds whether these three capsules were the product of accidental legitimate fertilisation owing to the branches of the plants of the two forms interlocking i will not pretend to decide the single longstyled plant which was left uncovered and grew close by the uncovered shortstyled plant produced five good pods but it was a poor and small plant  the flowers borne on the thirteen shortstyled plants under the net which were not fertilised produced twelve capsules containing on an average 56 seeds as some of these capsules were very fine and as five were borne on one twig i suspect that some minute insect had accidentally got under the net and had brought pollen from the other form to the flowers which produced this little group of capsules the one uncovered shortstyled plant which grew close to the uncovered longstyled plant yielded twelve capsules  from these facts we have some reason to believe as in the case of l grandiflorum that the shortstyled plants are in a slight degree more fertile with their own pollen than are the longstyled plants anyhow we have the clearest evidence that the stigmas of each form require for full fertility that pollen from the stamens of corresponding height belonging to the opposite form should be brought to them  hildebrand in the paper lately referred to confirms my results he placed a shortstyled plant in his house and fertilised about 20 flowers with their own pollen and about 30 with pollen from another plant belonging to the same form and these 50 flowers did not set a single capsule on the other hand he fertilised about 30 flowers with pollen from the longstyled form and these with the exception of two yielded capsules containing good seeds  it is a singular fact in contrast with what occurred in the case of l grandiflorum that the pollengrains of both forms of l perenne when placed on their ownform stigmas emitted their tubes though this action did not lead to the production of seeds after an interval of eighteen hours the tubes penetrated the stigmatic tissue but to what depth i did not ascertain in this case the impotence of the pollengrains on their own stigmas must have been due either to the tubes not reaching the ovules or to their not acting properly after reaching them  the plants both of l perenne and grandiflorum grew as already stated with their branches interlocked and with scores of flowers of the two forms close together they were covered by a rather coarse net through which the wind when high passed and such minute insects as thrips could not of course be excluded yet we have seen that the utmost possible amount of accidental fertilisation on seventeen longstyled plants in the one case and on eleven longstyled plants in the other resulted in the production in each case of three poor capsules so that when the proper insects are excluded the wind does hardly anything in the way of carrying pollen from plant to plant i allude to this fact because botanists in speaking of the fertilisation of various flowers often refer to the wind or to insects as if the alternative were indifferent this view according to my experience is entirely erroneous when the wind is the agent in carrying pollen either from one sex to the other or from hermaphrodite to hermaphrodite we can recognise structure as manifestly adapted to its action as to that of insects when these are the carriers we see adaptation to the wind in the incoherence of the pollenin the inordinate quantity produced as in the coniferae spinage etcin the dangling anthers well fitted to shake out the pollenin the absence or small size of the perianthin the protrusion of the stigmas at the period of fertilisationin the flowers being produced before they are hidden by the leavesand in the stigmas being downy or plumose as in the gramineae docks etc so as to secure the chanceblown grains in plants which are fertilised by the wind the flowers do not secrete nectar their pollen is too incoherent to be easily collected by insects they have not brightcoloured corollas to serve as guides and they are not as far as i have seen visited by insects when insects are the agents of fertilisation and this is incomparably the more frequent case with hermaphrodite plants the wind plays no part but we see an endless number of adaptations to ensure the safe transport of the pollen by the living workers these adaptations are most easily recognised in irregular flowers but they are present in regular flowers of which those of linum offer a good instance as i will now endeavour to show  i have already alluded to the rotation of each separate stigma in the long styled form of linum perenne in both forms of the other heterostyled species and in the homostyled species of linum which i have seen the stigmatic surfaces face the centre of the flower with the furrowed backs of the stigmas to which the styles are attached facing outwards this is the case with the stigmas of the longstyled flowers of l perenne whilst in bud but by the time the flowers have expanded the five stigmas twist round so as to face the circumference owing to the torsion of that part of the style which lies beneath the stigma i should state that the five stigmas do not always turn round completely two or three sometimes facing only obliquely outwards my observations were made during october and it is not improbable that earlier in the season the torsion would have been more complete for after two or three cold and wet days the movement was very imperfectly performed the flowers should be examined shortly after their expansion as their duration is brief as soon as they begin to wither the styles become spirally twisted all together the original position of the parts being thus lost  he who will compare the structure of the whole flower in both forms of l perenne and grandiflorum and as i may add of l flavum will not doubt about the meaning of this torsion of the styles in the one form alone of l perenne as well as the meaning of the divergence of the stigmas in the shortstyled form of all three species it is absolutely necessary as we know that insects should carry pollen from the flowers of the one form reciprocally to those of the other insects are attracted by five drops of nectar secreted exteriorly at the base of the stamens so that to reach these drops they must insert their proboscides outside the ring of broad filaments between them and the petals in the shortstyled form of the above three species the stigmas face the axis of the flower and had the styles retained their original upright and central position not only would the stigmas have presented their backs to the insects which sucked the flowers but their front and fertile surfaces would have been separated from the entering insects by the ring of broad filaments and would never have received any pollen as it is the styles diverge and pass out between the filaments after this movement the short stigmas lie within the tube of the corolla and their papillous surfaces being now turned upwards are necessarily brushed by every entering insect and thus receive the required pollen  in the longstyled form of l grandiflorum the almost parallel or slightly diverging anthers and stigmas project a little above the tube of the somewhat concave flower and they stand directly over the open space leading to the drops of nectar consequently when insects visit the flowers of either form for the stamens in this species occupy the same position in both forms they will get their foreheads or proboscides well dusted with the coherent pollen as soon as they visit the flowers of the longstyled form they will necessarily leave pollen on the proper surface of the elongated stigmas and when they visit the shortstyled flowers they will leave pollen on the upturned stigmatic surfaces thus the stigmas of both forms will receive indifferently the pollen of both forms but we know that the pollen alone of the opposite form causes fertilisation  figure 35 longstyled form of l perenne var austriacum in its early condition before the stigmas have rotated the petals and calyx have been removed on the near side 33 i neglected to get drawings made from fresh flowers of the two forms but mr fitch has made the above sketch of a long styled flower from dried specimens and from published engravings his wellknown skill ensures accuracy in the proportional size of the parts  in the case of l perenne affairs are arranged more perfectly for the stamens in the two forms stand at different heights so that pollen from the anthers of the longer stamens will adhere to one part of an insects body and will afterwards be brushed off by the rough stigmas of the longer pistils whilst pollen from the anthers of the shorter stamens will adhere to a different part of the insects body and will afterwards be brushed off by the stigmas of the shorter pistils and this is what is required for the legitimate fertilisation of both forms the corolla of l perenne is more expanded than that of l grandiflorum and the stigmas of the longstyled form do not diverge greatly from one another nor do the stamens of either form hence insects especially rather small ones will not insert their proboscides between the stigmas of the longstyled form nor between the anthers of either form figure 35 but will strike against them at nearly right angles with the backs of their head or thorax now in the longstyled flowers if each stigma did not rotate on its axis insects in visiting them would strike their heads against the backs of the stigmas as it is they strike against that surface which is covered with papillae with their heads already charged with pollen from the stamens of corresponding height borne by the flowers of the other form and legitimate fertilisation is thus ensured  thus we can understand the meaning of the torsion of the styles in the long styled flowers alone as well as their divergence in the shortstyled flowers  one other point is worth notice in botanical works many flowers are said to be fertilised in the bud this statement generally rests as far as i can discover on the anthers opening in the bud no evidence being adduced that the stigma is at this period mature or that it is not subsequently acted on by pollen brought from other flowers in the case of cephalanthera grandiflora i have shown that precocious and partial selffertilisation with subsequent full fertilisation is the regular course of events 34 fertilisation of orchids page 108 2nd edition 1877 page 84 the belief that the flowers of many plants are fertilised in the bud that is are perpetually selffertilised is a most effectual bar to understanding their real structure i am however far from wishing to assert that some flowers during certain seasons are not fertilised in the bud for i have reason to believe that this is the case a good observer resting his belief on the usual kind of evidence states that in linum austriacum which is heterostyled and is considered by planchon as a variety of l perenne the anthers open the evening before the expansion of the flowers and that the stigmas are then almost always fertilised 35 h lecoq etudes sur la geogr bot 1856 tome 5 page 325 now we know positively that so far from linum perenne being fertilised by its own pollen in the bud its own pollen is as powerless on the stigma as so much inorganic dust  linum flavum  the pistil of the longstyled form of this species is nearly twice as long as that of the shortstyled the stigmas are longer and the papillae coarser in the shortstyled form the stigmas diverge and pass out between the filaments as in the previous species the stamens in the two forms differ in length and what is singular the anthers of the longer stamens are not so long as those of the other form so that in the shortstyled form both the stigmas and the anthers are shorter than in the longstyled form the pollengrains of the two forms do not differ in size as this species is propagated by cuttings generally all the plants in the same garden belong to the same form i have inquired but have never heard of its seeding in this country certainly my own plants never produced a single seed as long as i possessed only one of the two forms after considerable search i procured both forms but from want of time only a few experiments were made two plants of the two forms were planted some way apart in my garden and were not covered by nets three flowers on the long styled plant were legitimately fertilised with pollen from the shortstyled plant and one of them set a fine capsule no other capsules were produced by this plant three flowers on the shortstyled plant were legitimately fertilised with pollen from the longstyled and all three produced capsules containing respectively no less than 8 9 and 10 seeds three other flowers on this plant which had not been artificially fertilised produced capsules containing 5 1 and 5 seeds and it is quite possible that pollen may have been brought to them by insects from the longstyled plant growing in the same garden nevertheless as they did not yield half the number of seeds compared with the other flowers on the same plant which had been artificially and legitimately fertilised and as the shortstyled plants of the two previous species apparently evince some slight capacity for fertilisation with their ownform pollen these three capsules may have been the product of selffertilisation  besides the three species now described the yellowflowered l corymbiferum is certainly heterostyled as is according to planchon l salsoloides 36 hookers london journal of botany 1848 volume 7 page 174 this botanist is the only one who seems to have inferred that heterostylism might have some important functional bearing dr alefeld who has made a special study of the genus says that about half of the sixtyfive species known to him are heterostyled 37 botanische zeitung september 18 1863 page 281 this is the case with l trigynum which differs so much from the other species that it has been formed by him into a distinct genus 38 it is not improbable that the allied genus hugonia is heterostyled for one species is said by planchon hookers london journal of botany 1848 volume 7 page 525 to be provided with staminibus exsertis another with stylis staminibus longioribus and another has stamina 5 majora stylos longe superantia according to the same author none of the species which inhabit america and the cape of good hope are heterostyled  i have examined only three homostyled species namely l usitatissimum angustifolium and catharticum i raised 111 plants of a variety of the first named species and these when protected under a net all produced plenty of seed the flowers according to h muller are frequented by bees and moths 39 die befruchtung der blumen etc page 168 with respect to l catharticum the same author shows that the flowers are so constructed that they can freely fertilise themselves but if visited by insects they might be cross fertilised he has however only once seen the flowers thus visited during the day but it may be suspected that they are frequented during the night by small moths for the sake of the five minute drops of nectar secreted lastly l lewisii is said by planchon to bear on the same plant flowers with stamens and pistils of the same height and others with the pistils either longer or shorter than the stamens this case formerly appeared to me an extraordinary one but i am now inclined to believe that it is one merely of great variability 310 planchon in hookers london journal of botany 1848 volume 7 page 175 see on this subject asa gray in american journal of science volume 36 september 1863 page 284  pulmonaria boragineae  pulmonaria officinalis  hildebrand has published a full account of this heterostyled plant 311 botanische zeitung 1865 january 13 page 13 the pistil of the longstyled form is twice as long as that of the shortstyled and the stamens differ in a corresponding though converse manner there is no marked difference in the shape or state of surface of the stigma in the two forms the pollengrains of the shortstyled form are to those of the longstyled as 9 to 7 or as 100 to 78 in length and as 7 to 6 in breadth they do not differ in the appearance of their contents the corolla of the one form differs in shape from that of the other in nearly the same manner as in primula but besides this difference the flowers of the shortstyled are generally the larger of the two hildebrand collected on the siebengebirge ten wild longstyled and ten shortstyled plants the former bore 289 flowers of which 186 ie 64 per cent had set fruit yielding 188 seed per fruit the ten shortstyled plants bore 373 flowers of which 262 ie 70 per cent had set fruit yielding 186 seed per fruit so that the shortstyled plants produced many more flowers and these set a rather larger proportion of fruit but the fruits themselves yielded a slightly lower average number of seeds than did the longstyled plants the results of hildebrands experiments on the fertility of the two forms are given in table 319  table 319 pulmonaria officinalis from hildebrand  column

by dr hooker growing by themselves in a garden in surrey and to my surprise about half the flowers had set fruit several of which contained 2 and one contained even 3 seeds these seeds were sown in my garden and eleven seedlings thus raised all of which proved longstyled in accordance with the usual rule in such cases two years afterwards the plants were left uncovered no other plant of the same genus growing in my garden and the flowers were visited by many bees they set an abundance of seeds for instance i gathered from a single plant rather less than half of the seeds which it had produced and they numbered 47 therefore this illegitimately fertilised plant must have produced about 100 seeds that is thrice as many as one of the wild longstyled plants collected on the siebengebirge by hildebrand and which no doubt had been legitimately fertilised in the following year one of my plants was covered by a net and even under these unfavourable conditions it produced spontaneously a few seeds it should be observed that as the flowers stand either almost horizontally or hang considerably downwards pollen from the short stamens would be likely to fall on the stigma we thus see that the english longstyled plants when illegitimately fertilised were highly fertile whilst the german plants similarly treated by hildebrand were completely sterile how to account for this wide discordance in our results i know not hildebrand cultivated his plants in pots and kept them for a time in the house whilst mine were grown out of doors and he thinks that this difference of treatment may have caused the difference in our results but this does not appear to me nearly a sufficient cause although his plants were slightly less productive than the wild ones growing on the siebengbirge my plants exhibited no tendency to become equalstyled so as to lose their proper longstyled character as not rarely happens under cultivation with several heterostyled species of primula but it would appear that they had been greatly affected in function either by longcontinued cultivation or by some other cause we shall see in a future chapter that heterostyled plants illegitimately fertilised during several successive generations sometimes become more selffertile and this may have been the case with my stock of the present species of pulmonaria but in this case we must assume that the longstyled plants were at first sufficiently fertile to yield some seed instead of being absolutely selfsterile like the german plants  pulmonaria angustifolia  figure 36 pulmonaria angustifolia left longstyled form right shortstyled form  seedlings of this plant raised from plants growing wild in the isle of wight were named for me by dr hooker it is so closely allied to the last species differing chiefly in the shape and spotting of the leaves that the two have been considered by several eminent botanistsfor instance benthamas mere varieties but as we shall presently see good evidence can be assigned for ranking them as distinct owing to the doubts on this head i tried whether the two would mutually fertilise one another twelve shortstyled flowers of p angustifolia were legitimately fertilised with pollen from longstyled plants of p officinalis which as we have just seen are moderately selffertile but they did not produce a single fruit thirtysix longstyled flowers of p angustifolia were also illegitimately fertilised during two seasons with pollen from the longstyled p officinalis but all these flowers dropped off unimpregnated had the plants been mere varieties of the same species these illegitimate crosses would probably have yielded some seeds judging from my success in illegitimately fertilising the longstyled flowers of p officinalis and the twelve legitimate crosses instead of yielding no fruit would almost certainly have yielded a considerable number namely about nine judging from the results given in table 320 therefore p officinalis and angustifolia appear to be good and distinct species in conformity with other important functional differences between them immediately to be described  table 320  pulmonaria angustifolia  column 1 nature of the union column

flowers of p angustifolia differ from one another in structure in nearly the same manner as those of p officinalis but in figure 36 a slight bulging of the corolla in the longstyled form where the anthers are seated has been overlooked my son william who examined a large number of wild plants in the isle of wight observed that the corolla though variable in size was generally larger in the longstyled flowers than in the shortstyled and certainly the largest corollas of all were found on the long styled plants and the smallest on the shortstyled exactly the reverse occurs according to hildebrand with p officinalis both the pistils and stamens of p angustifolia vary much in length so that in the shortstyled form the distance between the stigma and the anthers varied from 119 to 65 divisions of the micrometer and in the longstyled from 115 to 112 from an average of seven measurements of each form the distance between these organs in the longstyled is to the same distance in the shortstyled form as 100 to 69 so that the stigma in the one form does not stand on a level with the anthers in the other the longstyled pistil is sometimes thrice as long as that of the shortstyled but from an average of ten measurements of both its length to that of the shortstyled was as 100 to 56 the stigma varies in being more or less though slightly lobed the anthers also vary much in length in both forms but in a greater degree in the longstyled than in the shortstyledform many in the former being from 80 to 63 and in the latter from 80 to 70 divisions of the micrometer in length from an average of seven measurements the shortstyled anthers were to those from the longstyled as 100 to 91 in length lastly the pollengrains from the longstyled flowers varied between 13 and 115 divisions of the micrometer and those from the shortstyled between 15 and 13 the average diameter of 25 grains from the latter or shortstyled form was to that of 20 grains from the longstyled as 100 to 91 we see therefore that the pollengrains from the smaller anthers of the shorter stamens in the longstyled form are as usual of smaller size than those in the other form but what is remarkable a larger proportion of the grains were small shrivelled and worthless this could be seen by merely comparing the contents of the anthers from several distinct plants of each form but in one instance my son found by counting that out of 193 grains from a longstyled flower 53 were bad or 27 per cent whilst out of 265 grains from a shortstyled flower only 18 were bad or 7 per cent from the condition of the pollen in the longstyled form and from the extreme variability of all the organs in both forms we may perhaps suspect that the plant is undergoing a change and tending to become dioecious  my son collected in the isle of wight on two occasions 202 plants of which 125 were longstyled and 77 shortstyled so that the former were the more numerous on the other hand out of 18 plants raised by me from seed only 4 were long styled and 14 shortstyled the shortstyled plants seemed to my son to produce a greater number of flowers than the longstyled and he came to this conclusion before a similar statement had been published by hildebrand with respect to p officinalis my son gathered ten branches from ten different plants of both forms and found the number of flowers of the two forms to be as 100 to 89 190 being shortstyled and 169 longstyled with p officinalis the difference according to hildebrand is even greater namely as 100 flowers for the short styled to 77 for the longstyled plants table 320 shows the results of my experiments  we see in table 320 that the fertility of the two legitimate unions to that of the two illegitimate together is as 100 to 35 judged by the proportion of flowers which produced fruit and as 100 to 32 judged by the average number of seeds per fruit but the small number of fruit yielded by the 18 longstyled flowers in the first line was probably accidental and if so the difference in the proportion of legitimately and illegitimately fertilised flowers which yield fruit is really greater than that represented by the ratio of 100 to 35 the 18 longstyled flowers illegitimately fertilised yielded no seedsnot even a vestige of one two longstyled plants which were placed under a net produced 138 flowers besides those which were artificially fertilised and none of these set any fruit nor did some plants of the same form which were protected during the next summer two other longstyled plants were left uncovered all the shortstyled plants having been previously covered up and humblebees which had their foreheads white with pollen incessantly visited the flowers so that their stigmas must have received an abundance of pollen yet these flowers did not produce a single fruit we may therefore conclude that the longstyled plants are absolutely barren with their ownform pollen though brought from a distinct plant in this respect they differ greatly from the longstyled english plants of p officinalis which were found by me to be moderately selffertile but they agree in their behaviour with the german plants of p officinalis experimented on by hildebrand  eighteen shortstyled flowers legitimately fertilised yielded as may be seen in table 320 15 fruits each having on an average 26 seeds four of these fruits contained the highest possible number of seeds namely 4 and four other fruits contained each 3 seeds the 12 illegitimately fertilised shortstyled flowers yielded 7 fruits including on an average 186 seed and one of these fruits contained the maximum number of 4 seeds this result is very surprising in contrast with the absolute barrenness of the longstyled flowers when illegitimately fertilised and i was thus led to attend carefully to the degree of selffertility of the shortstyled plants a plant belonging to this form and covered by a net bore 28 flowers besides those which had been artificially fertilised and of all these only two produced a fruit each including a single seed this high degree of selfsterility no doubt depended merely on the stigmas not receiving any pollen or not a sufficient quantity for after carefully covering all the longstyled plants in my garden several shortstyled plants were left exposed to the visits of humblebees and their stigmas will thus have received plenty of shortstyled pollen and now about half the flowers thus illegitimately fertilised set fruit i judge of this proportion partly from estimation and partly from having examined three large branches which had borne 31 flowers and these produced 16 fruits of the fruits produced 233 were collected many being left ungathered and these included on an average 182 seed no less than 16 out of the 233 fruits included the highest possible number of seeds namely 4 and 31 included 3 seeds so we see how highly fertile these shortstyled plants were when illegitimately fertilised with their ownform pollen by the aid of bees  the great difference in the fertility of the long and shortstyled flowers when both are illegitimately fertilised is a unique case as far as i have observed with heterostyled plants the longstyled flowers when thus fertilised are utterly barren whilst about half of the shortstyled ones produce capsules and these include a little above twothirds of the number of seeds yielded by them when legitimately fertilised the sterility of the illegitimately fertilised longstyled flowers is probably increased by the deteriorated condition of their pollen nevertheless this pollen was highly efficient when applied to the stigmas of the shortstyled flowers with several species of primula the short styled flowers are much more sterile than the longstyled when both are illegitimately fertilised and it is a tempting view as formerly remarked that this greater sterility of the shortstyled flowers is a special adaptation to check selffertilisation as their stigmas are eminently liable to receive their own pollen this view is even still more tempting in the case of the longstyled form of linum grandiflorum on the other hand with pulmonaria angustifolia it is evident from the corolla projecting obliquely upwards that pollen is much more likely to fall on or to be carried by insects down to the stigma of the shortstyled than of the longstyled flowers yet the shortstyled instead of being more sterile as a protection against selffertilisation are far more fertile than the longstyled when both are illegitimately fertilised  pulmonaria azurea according to hildebrand is not heterostyled 312 die geschlechtervertheilung bei den pflanzen 1867 page 37  from an examination of dried flowers of amsinckia spectabilis sent me by professor asa gray i formerly thought that this plant a member of the boragineae was heterostyled the pistil varies to an extraordinary degree in length being in some specimens twice as long as in others and the point of insertion of the stamens likewise varies but on raising many plants from seed i soon became convinced that the whole case was one of mere variability the firstformed flowers are apt to have stamens somewhat arrested in development with very little pollen in their anthers and in such flowers the stigma projects above the anthers whilst generally it stands below and sometimes on a level with them i could detect no difference in the size of the pollengrain or in the structure of the stigma in the plants which differed most in the above respects and all of them when protected from the access of insects yielded plenty of seeds again from statements made by vaucher and from a hasty inspection i thought at first that the allied anchusa arvensis and echium vulgare were heterostyled but soon saw my error from information given me i examined dried flowers of another member of the boragineae arnebia hispidissima collected from several sites and though the corolla together with the included organs differed much in length there was no sign of heterostylism  polygonum fagopyrum polygonaceae  figure 37 polygonum fagopyrum from h muller upper figure the longstyled form lower figure the shortstyled some of the anthers have dehisced others have not  hildebrand has shown that this plant the common buckwheat is heterostyled 313 die geschlechtervertheilung etc 1867 page 34 in the longstyled form figure 37 the three stigmas project considerably above the eight short stamens and stand on a level with the anthers of the eight long stamens in the shortstyled form and so it is conversely with the stigmas and stamens of this latter form i could perceive no difference in the structure of the stigmas in the two forms the pollengrains of the shortstyled form are to those of the longstyled as 100 to 82 in diameter this plant is therefore without doubt heterostyled  i experimented only in an imperfect manner on the relative fertility of the two forms shortstyled flowers were dragged several times over two heads of flowers on longstyled plants protected under a net which were thus legitimately though not fully fertilised they produced 22 seeds or 11 per flowerhead  three flowerheads on longstyled plants received pollen in the same manner from other longstyled plants and were thus illegitimately fertilised they produced 14 seeds or only 466 per flowerhead  two flowerheads on shortstyled plants received pollen in like manner from longstyled flowers and were thus legitimately fertilised they produced 8 seeds or 4 per flowerhead  four heads on shortstyled plants similarly received pollen from other short styled plants and were thus illegitimately fertilised they produced 9 seeds or 225 per flowerhead  the results from fertilising the flowerheads in the above imperfect manner cannot be fully trusted but i may state that the four legitimately fertilised flowerheads yielded on an average 750 seeds per head whereas the seven illegitimately fertilised heads yielded less than half the number or on an average only 328 seeds the legitimately crossed seeds from the longstyled flowers were finer than those from the illegitimately fertilised flowers on the same plants in the ratio of 100 to 82 as shown by the weights of an equal number  about a dozen plants including both forms were protected under nets and early in the season they produced spontaneously hardly any seeds though at this period the artificially fertilised flowers produced an abundance but it is a remarkable fact that later in the season during september both forms became highly selffertile they did not however produce so many seeds as some neighbouring uncovered plants which were visited by insects therefore the flowers of neither form when left to fertilise themselves late in the season without the aid of insects are nearly so sterile as most other heterostyled plants a large number of insects namely 41 kinds as observed by h muller visit the flowers for the sake of the eight drops of nectar 314 die befruchtung etc page 175 and nature january 1 1874 page 166 he infers from the structure of the flowers that insects would be apt to fertilise them both illegitimately as well as legitimately but he is mistaken in supposing that the longstyled flowers cannot spontaneously fertilise themselves  differently to what occurs in the other genera hitherto noticed polygonum though a very large genus contains as far as is at present known only a single heterostyled species namely the present one h muller in his interesting description of several other species shows that p bistorta is so strongly proterandrous the anthers generally falling off before the stigmas are mature that the flowers must be crossfertilised by the many insects which visit them other species bear much less conspicuous flowers which secrete little or no nectar and consequently are rarely visited by insects these are adapted for selffertilisation though still capable of crossfertilisation according to delpino the polygonaceae are generally fertilised by the wind instead of by insects as in the present genus  leucosmia burnettiana thymeliae  as professor asa gray has expressed his belief that this species and l acuminata as well as some species in the allied genus drymispermum are dimorphic or heterostyled 315 american journal of science 1865 page 101 and seemanns journal of botany volume 3 1865 page 305 i procured from kew through the kindness of dr hooker two dried flowers of the former species an inhabitant of the friendly islands in the pacific the pistil of the longstyled form is to that of the shortstyled as 100 to 86 in length the stigma projects just above the throat of the corolla and is surrounded by five anthers the tips of which reach up almost to its base and lower down within the tubular corolla five other and rather smaller anthers are seated in the shortstyled form the stigma stands some way down the tube of the corolla nearly on a level with the lower anthers of the other form it differs remarkably from the stigma of the longstyled form in being more papillose and in being longer in the ratio of 100 to 60 the anthers of the upper stamens in the shortstyled form are supported on free filaments and project above the throat of the corolla whilst the anthers of the lower stamens are seated in the throat on a level with the upper stamens of the other form the diameters of a considerable number of grains from both sets of anthers in both forms were measured but they did not differ in any trustworthy degree the mean diameter of twentytwo grains from the shortstyled flower was to that of twentyfour grains from the longstyled as 100 to 99 the anthers of the upper stamens in the shortstyled form appeared to be poorly developed and contained a considerable number of shrivelled grains which were omitted in striking the above average notwithstanding the fact of the pollengrains from the two forms not differing in diameter in any appreciable degree there can hardly be a doubt from the great difference in the two forms in the length of the pistil and especially of the stigma together with its more papillose condition in the shortstyled form that the present species is truly heterostyled this case resembles that of linum grandiflorum in which the sole difference between the two forms consists in the length of the pistils and stigmas from the great length of the tubular corolla of leucosmia it is clear that the flowers are crossfertilised by large lepidoptera or by honeysucking birds and the position of the stamens in two whorls one beneath the other which is a character that i have not seen in any other heterostyled dimorphic plant probably serves to smear the inserted organ thoroughly with pollen  menyanthes trifoliata gentianeae  this plant inhabits marshes my son william gathered 247 flowers from so many distinct plants and of these 110 were longstyled and 137 shortstyled the pistil of the longstyled form is in length to that of the shortstyled in the ratio of about 3 to 2 the stigma of the former as my son observed is decidedly larger than that of the shortstyled but in both forms it varies much in size the stamens of the shortstyled are almost double the length of those of the longstyled so that their anthers stand rather above the level of the stigma of the longstyled form the anthers also vary much in size but seem often to be of larger size in the shortstyled flowers my son made with the camera many drawings of the pollengrains and those from the shortstyled flowers were in diameter in nearly the ratio of 100 to 84 to those from the longstyled flowers i know nothing about the capacity for fertilisation in the two forms but shortstyled plants living by themselves in the gardens at kew have produced an abundance of capsules yet the seeds have never germinated and this looks as if the shortstyled form was sterile with its own pollen  limnanthemum indicum gentianeae  this plant is mentioned by mr thwaites in his enumeration of the plants of ceylon as presenting two forms and he was so kind as to send me specimens preserved in spirits the pistil of the longstyled form is nearly thrice as long ie as 14 to 5 as that of the shortstyled and is very much thinner in the ratio of about 3 to 5 the foliaceous stigma is more expanded and twice as large as that of the shortstyled form in the latter the stamens are about twice as long as those of the longstyled and their anthers are larger in the ratio of 100 to 70 the pollengrains after having been long kept in spirits were of the same shape and size in both forms the ovules according to mr thwaites are equally numerous namely from 70 to 80 in the two forms  villarsia sp gentianeae  fritz muller sent me from south brazil dried flowers of this aquatic plant which is closely allied to limnanthemum in the longstyled form the stigma stands some way above the anthers and the whole pistil together with the ovary is in length to that of the shortstyled form as about 3 to 2 in the latter form the anthers stand above the stigma and the style is very short and thick but the pistil varies a good deal in length the stigma being either on a level with the tips of the sepals or considerably beneath them the foliaceous stigma in the longstyled form is larger with the expansions running farther down the style than in the other form one of the most remarkable differences between the two forms is that the anthers of the longer stamens in the short styled flowers are conspicuously longer than those of the shorter stamens in the longstyled flowers in the former the subtriangular pollengrains are larger the ratio between their breadth measured from one angle to the middle of the opposite side and that of the grains from the longstyled flowers being about 100 to 75 fritz muller also informs me that the pollen of the shortstyled flowers has a bluish tint whilst that of the longstyled is yellow when we treat of lythrum salicaria we shall find a strongly marked contrast in the colour of the pollen in two of the forms  the three genera menyanthes limnanthemum and villarsia now described constitute a wellmarked subtribe of the gentianeae all the species as far as at present known are heterostyled and all inhabit aquatic or subaquatic stations  forsythia suspensa oleaceae  professor asa gray states that the plants of this species growing in the botanic gardens at cambridge us are shortstyled but that siebold and zuccarini describe the longstyled form and give figures of two forms so that there can be little doubt as he remarks about the plant being dimorphic 316 the american naturalist july 1873 page 422 i therefore applied to dr hooker who sent me a dried flower from japan another from china and another from the botanic gardens at kew the first proved to be longstyled and the other two shortstyled in the longstyled form the pistil is in length to that of the shortstyled as 100 to 38 the lobes of the stigma being a little longer as 10 to 9 but narrower and less divergent this last character however may be only a temporary one there seems to be no difference in the papillose condition of the two stigmas in the shortstyled form the stamens are in length to those of the longstyled as 100 to 66 but the anthers are shorter in the ratio of 87 to 100 and this is unusual for when there is any difference in size between the anthers of the two forms those from the longer stamens of the shortstyled are generally the longest the pollengrains from the shortstyled flowers are certainly larger but only in a slight degree than those from the longstyled namely as 100 to 94 in diameter the shortstyled form which grows in the gardens at kew has never there produced fruit  forsythia viridissima appears likewise to be heterostyled for professor asa gray says that although the longstyled form alone grows in the gardens at cambridge us the published figures of this species belong to the short styled form  cordia sp cordiaceae  fritz muller sent me dried specimens of this shrub which he believes to be heterostyled and i have not much doubt that this is the case though the usual characteristic differences are not well pronounced in the two forms linum grandiflorum shows us that a plant may be heterostyled in function in the highest degree and yet the two forms may have stamens of equal length and pollengrains of equal size in the present species of cordia the stamens of both forms are of nearly equal length those of the shortstyled being rather the longest and the anthers of both are seated in the mouth of the corolla nor could i detect any difference in the size of the pollengrains when dry or after being soaked in water the stigmas of the longstyled form stand clear above the anthers and the whole pistil is longer than that of the shortstyled in about the ratio of 3 to 2  the stigmas of the shortstyled form are seated beneath the anthers and they are considerably shorter than those of the longstyled form this latter difference is the most important one of any between the two forms  gilia ipomopsis pulchella vel aggregata polemoniaceae  professor asa gray remarks with respect to this plant the tendency to dimorphism of which there are traces or perhaps rather incipient manifestations in various portions of the genus is most marked in g aggregata 317 proceedings of the american academy of arts and sciences june 14 1870 page 275 he sent me some dried flowers and i procured others from kew they differ greatly in size some being nearly twice as long as others namely as 30 to 17 so that it was not possible to compare except by calculation the absolute length of the organs from different plants moreover the relative position of the stigmas and anthers is variable in some long styled flowers the stigmas and anthers were exserted only just beyond the throat of the corolla whilst in others they were exserted as much as 410 of an inch i suspect also that the pistil goes on growing for some time after the anthers have dehisced nevertheless it is possible to class the flowers under two forms in some of the longstyled the length of pistil to that of the shortstyled was as 100 to 82 but this result was gained by reducing the size of the corollas to the same scale in another pair of flowers the difference in length between the pistils of the two forms was certainly greater but they were not actually measured in the shortstyled flowers whether large or small the stigma is seated low down within the tube of the corolla the papillae on the longstyled stigma are longer than those on the shortstyled in the ratio of 100 to 40 the filaments in some of the shortstyled flowers were to those of the longstyled as 100 to 25 in length the free or unattached portion being alone measured but this ratio cannot be trusted owing to the great variability of the stamens the mean diameter of eleven pollengrains from longstyled flowers and of twelve from the shortstyled was exactly the same it follows from these several statements that the difference in length and state of surface of the stigmas in the flowers is the sole reliable evidence that this species is heterostyled for it would be rash to trust to the difference in the length of the pistils seeing how variable they are i should have left the case altogether doubtful had it not been for the observations on the following species and these leave little doubt on my mind that the present plant is truly heterostyled professor gray informs me that in another species g coronopifolia belonging to the same section of the genus he can see no sign of dimorphism  gilia leptosiphon micrantha  a few flowers sent me from kew had been somewhat injured so that i cannot say anything positively with respect to the position and relative length of the organs in the two forms but their stigmas differed almost exactly in the same manner as in the last species the papillae on the longstyled stigma being longer than those on the shortstyled in the ratio of 100 to 42 my son measured nine pollengrains from the longstyled and the same number from the shortstyled form and the mean diameter of the former was to that of the latter as 100 to 81 considering this difference as well as that between the stigmas of the two forms there can be no doubt that this species is heterostyled so probably is gilia nudicaulis which likewise belongs to the leptosiphon section of the genus for i hear from professor asa gray that in some individuals the style is very long with the stigma more or less exserted whilst in others it is deeply included within the tube the anthers being always seated in the throat of the corolla  phlox subulata polemoniaceae  professor asa gray informs me that the greater number of the species in this genus have a long pistil with the stigma more or less exserted whilst several other species especially the annuals have a short pistil seated low down within the tube of the corolla in all the species the anthers are arranged one below the other the uppermost just protruding from the throat of the corolla in phlox subulata alone he has seen both long and short styles and here the shortstyled plant has irrespective of this character been described as a distinct species p nivalis p hentzii and is apt to have a pair of ovules in each cell while the longstyled p subulata rarely shows more than one 318 proceedings of the american academy of arts and sciences june 14 1870 page 248 some dried flowers of both forms were sent me by him and i received others from kew but i have failed to make out whether the species is heterostyled in two flowers of nearly equal size the pistil of the longstyled form was twice as long as that of the shortstyled but in other cases the difference was not nearly so great the stigma of the longstyled pistil stands nearly in the throat of the corolla whilst in the shortstyled it is placed low downsometimes very low down in the tube for it varies greatly in position the stigma is more papillose and of greater length in one instance in the ratio of 100 to 67 in the shortstyled flowers than in the longstyled my son measured twenty pollengrains from a shortstyled flower and nine from a long styled and the former were in diameter to the latter as 100 to 93 and this difference accords with the belief that the plant is heterostyled but the grains from the shortstyled varied much in diameter he afterwards measured ten grains from a distinct longstyled flower and ten from another plant of the same form and these grains differed in diameter in the ratio of 100 to 90 the mean diameter of these two lots of twenty grains was to that of twelve grains from another shortstyled flower as 100 to 75 here then the grains from the shortstyled form were considerably smaller than those from the longstyled which is the reverse of what occurred in the former instance and of what is the general rule with heterostyled plants the whole case is perplexing in the highest degree and will not be understood until experiments are tried on living plants the greater length and more papillose condition of the stigma in the shortstyled than in the longstyled flowers looks as if the plant was heterostyled for we know that with some speciesfor instance leucosmia and certain rubiaceaethe stigma is longer and more papillose in the shortstyled form though the reverse of this holds good in gilia a member of the same family with phlox the similar position of the anthers in the two forms is somewhat opposed to the present species being heterostyled as is the great difference in the length of the pistil in several shortstyled flowers but the extraordinary variability in diameter of the pollengrains and the fact that in one set of flowers the grains from the longstyled flowers were larger than those from the shortstyled is strongly opposed to the belief that phlox subulata is heterostyled possibly this species was once heterostyled but is now becoming subdioecious the shortstyled plants having been rendered more feminine in nature this would account for their ovaries usually containing more ovules and for the variable condition of their pollengrains whether the long styled plants are now changing their nature as would appear to be the case from the variability of their pollengrains and are becoming more masculine i will not pretend to conjecture they might remain as hermaphrodites for the coexistence of hermaphrodite and female plants of the same species is by no means a rare event  erythroxylum sp erythroxylidae  figure 38 erythroxylon sp left longstyled form right shortstyled form from a sketch by fritz muller magnified five times  fritz muller sent me from south brazil dried flowers of this tree together with the drawings figure 38 which show the two forms magnified about five times with the petals removed in the longstyled form the stigmas project above the anthers and the styles are nearly twice as long as those of the shortstyled form in which the stigmas stand beneath the anthers the stigmas in many but not in all the shortstyled flowers are larger than those in the longstyled the anthers of the shortstyled flowers stand on a level with the stigmas of the other form but the stamens are longer by only onefourth or one fifth of their own length than those of the longstyled consequently the anthers of the latter do not stand on a level with but rather above the stigmas of the other form differently from what occurs in the following closely allied genus sethia the stamens are of nearly equal length in the flowers of the same form the pollengrains of the shortstyled flowers measured in their dry state are a little larger than those from the longstyled flowers in about the ratio of 100 to 93 319 f muller remarks in his letter to me that the flowers of which he carefully examined many specimens are curiously variable in the number of their parts 5 sepals and petals 10 stamens and 3 pistils are the prevailing numbers but the sepals and petals often vary from 5 to 7 the stamens from 10 to 14 and the pistils from 3 to 4  sethia acuminata erythroxylidae  mr thwaites pointed out several years ago that this plant exists under two forms which he designated as forma stylosa et staminea and the flowers sent to me by him are clearly heterostyled 320 enumeratio plantarum zeylaniae 1864 page 54 in the longstyled form the pistil is nearly twice as long and the stamens half as long as the corresponding organs in the shortstyled form the stigmas of the longstyled seem rather smaller than those of the shortstyled all the stamens in the shortstyled flowers are of nearly equal length whereas in longstyled they differ in length being alternately a little longer and shorter and this difference in the stamens of the two forms is probably related as we shall hereafter see in the case of the shortstyled flowers of lythrum salicaria to the manner in which insects can best transport pollen from the longstyled flowers to the stigmas of the shortstyled the pollengrains from the shortstyled flowers though variable in size are to those of the longstyled as far as i could make out as 100 to 83 in their longer diameter sethia obtusifolia is heterostyled like s acuminata  cratoxylon formosum hypericineae  mr thiselton dyer remarks that this tree an inhabitant of malacca and borneo appears to be heterostyled 321 journal of botany london 1872 page 26 he sent me dried flowers and the difference between the two forms is conspicuous in the shortstyled form the pistils are in length to those of the shortstyled as 100 to 40 with their globular stigmas about twice as thick these stand just above the numerous anthers and a little beneath the tips of the petals in the shortstyled form the anthers project high above the pistils the stigmas of which diverge between the three bundles of stamens and stand only a little above the tips of the sepals the stamens in this form are to those of the long styled as 100 to 86 in length and therefore they do not differ so much in length as do the pistils ten pollengrains from each form were measured and those from the shortstyled were to those from the longstyled as 100 to 86 in diameter this plant therefore is in all respects a wellcharacterised heterostyled species  aegiphila elata verbenaceae  mr bentham was so kind as to send me dried flowers of this species and of ae mollis both inhabitants of south america the two forms differ conspicuously as the deeply bifid stigma of the one and the anthers of the other project far above the mouth of the corolla in the longstyled form of the present species the style is twice and a half as long as that of the shortstyled the divergent stigmas of the two forms do not differ much in length nor as far as i could perceive in their papillae in the longstyled flowers the filaments adhere to the corolla close up to the anthers which are enclosed some way down within the tube in the shortstyled flowers the filaments are free above the point where the anthers are seated in the other form and they project from the corolla to an equal height with that of the stigmas in the longstyled flowers it is often difficult to measure with accuracy pollengrains which have long been dried and then soaked in water but they here manifestly differed greatly in size those from the shortstyled flowers were to those from the longstyled in diameter in about the ratio of 100 to 62 the two forms of ae mollis present a like difference in the length of their pistils and stamens  aegiphila obdurata  flowers of this bush were sent me from st catharina in brazil by fritz muller and were named for me at kew they appeared at first sight grandly heterostyled as the stigma of the longstyled form projects far out of the corolla whilst the anthers are seated halfway down within the tube whereas in the shortstyled form the anthers project from the corolla and the stigma is enclosed in the tube at nearly the same level with the anthers of the other form the pistil of the longstyled is to that of the shortstyled as 100 to 60 in length and the stigmas taken by themselves as 100 to 55 nevertheless this plant cannot be heterostyled the anthers in the longstyled form are brown tough and fleshy and less than half the length of those in the shortstyled form strictly as 44 to 100 and what is much more important they were in a rudimentary condition in the two flowers examined by me and did not contain a single grain of pollen in the shortstyled form the divided stigma which as we have seen is much shortened is thicker and more fleshy than the stigma of the longstyled and is covered with small irregular projections formed of rather large cells it had the appearance of having suffered from hyperthrophy and is probably incapable of fertilisation if this be so the plant is dioecious and judging from the two species previously described it probably was once heterostyled and has since been rendered dioecious by the pistil in the one form and the stamens in the other having become functionless and reduced in size it is however possible that the flowers may be in the same state as those of the common thyme and of several other labiatae in which females and hermaphrodites regularly coexist fritz muller who thought that the present plant was heterostyled as i did at first informs me that he found bushes in several places growing quite isolated and that these were completely sterile whilst two plants growing close together were covered with fruit this fact agrees better with the belief that the species is dioecious than that it consists of hermaphrodites and females for if any one of the isolated plants had been an hermaphrodite it would probably have produced some fruit  rubiaceae  this great natural family contains a much larger number of heterostyled genera than any other one as yet known  mitchella repens  professor asa gray sent me several living plants collected when out of flower and nearly half of these proved longstyled and the other half shortstyled the white flowers which are fragrant and which secrete plenty of nectar always grow in pairs with their ovaries united so that the two together produce a berrylike double drupe 322 a gray manual of the botany of the united states 1856 page 172 in my first series of experiments 1864 i did not suppose that this curious arrangement of the flowers would have any influence on their fertility and in several instances only one of the two flowers in a pair was fertilised and a large proportion or all of these failed to produce berries in the ensuing year both flowers of each pair were invariably fertilised in the same manner and the latter experiments alone serve to show the proportion of flowers which yield berries when legitimately and illegitimately fertilised but for calculating the average number of seeds per berry i have used those produced during both seasons  in the longstyled flowers the stigma projects just above the bearded throat of the corolla and the anthers are seated some way down the tube in the short styled flowers those organs occupy reversed positions in this latter form the fresh pollengrains are a little larger and more opaque than those of the long styled form the results of my experiments are given in table 321  table 321 mitchella repens  column 1 nature of the union column 2 number of pairs of flowers fertilised during the second season column 3 number of drupes produced during the second season column 4 average number of good seeds per drupe in all the drupes during the two seasons  longstyled by pollen of shortstyled

9  0  20  the two legitimate unions together  17  15  44  the two illegitimate unions together  17  3  21  it follows from this table that 88 per cent of the paired flowers of both forms when legitimately fertilised yielded double berries nineteen of which contained on an average 44 seeds with a maximum in one of 8 seeds of the illegitimately fertilised paired flowers only 18 per cent yielded berries six of which contained on an average only 21 seeds with a maximum in one of 4 seeds thus the two legitimate unions are more fertile than the two illegitimate according to the proportion of flowers which yielded berries in the ratio of 100 to 20 and according to the average number of contained seeds as 100 to 47  three longstyled and three shortstyled plants were protected under separate nets and they produced altogether only 8 berries containing on an average only 15 seed some additional berries were produced which contained no seeds the plants thus treated were therefore excessively sterile and their slight degree of fertility may be attributed in part to the action of the many individuals of thrips which haunted the flowers mr j scott informs me that a single plant probably a longstyled one growing in the botanic gardens at edinburgh which no doubt was freely visited by insects produced plenty of berries but how many of them contained seeds was not observed  borreria nov sp near valerianoides rubiaceae  fritz muller sent me seeds of this plant which is extremely abundant in st catharina in south brazil and ten plants were raised consisting of five long styled and five shortstyled the pistil of the longstyled flowers projects just beyond the mouth of the corolla and is thrice as long as that of the shortstyled and the divergent stigmas are likewise rather larger the anthers in the longstyled form stand low down within the corolla and are quite hidden in the shortstyled flowers the anthers project just above the mouth of the corolla and the stigma stands low down within the tube considering the great difference in the length of the pistils in the two forms it is remarkable that the pollengrains differ very little in size and fritz muller was struck with the same fact in a dry state the grains from the shortstyled flowers could just be perceived to be larger than those from the longstyled and when both were swollen by immersion in water the former were to the latter in diameter in the ratio of 100 to 92 in the longstyled flowers beaded hairs almost fill up the mouth of the corolla and project above it they therefore stand above the anthers and beneath the stigma in the shortstyled flowers a similar brush of hairs is situated low down within the tubular corolla above the stigma and beneath the anthers the presence of these beaded hairs in both forms though occupying such different positions shows that they are probably of considerable functional importance they would serve to guard the stigma of each form from its own pollen but in accordance with professor kerners view their chief use probably is to prevent the copious nectar being stolen by small crawling insects which could not render any service to the species by carrying pollen from one form to the other 323 die schutzmittel der bluthen gegen unberufene gaste 1876 page 37  the flowers are so small and so crowded together that i was not willing to expend time in fertilising them separately but i dragged repeatedly heads of shortstyled flowers over three longstyled flowerheads which were thus legitimately fertilised and they produced many dozen fruits each containing two good seeds i fertilised in the same manner three heads on the same long styled plant with pollen from another longstyled plant so that these were fertilised illegitimately and they did not yield a single seed nor did this plant which was of course protected by a net bear spontaneously any seeds nevertheless another longstyled plant which was carefully protected produced spontaneously a very few seeds so that the longstyled form is not always quite sterile with its own pollen  faramea sp rubiaceae  figure 39 faramea sp left shortstyled form right longstyled form outlines of flowers from dried specimens pollengrains magnified 180 times by fritz muller  fritz muller has fully described the two forms of this remarkable plant an inhabitant of south brazil 324 botanische zeitung september 10 1869 page 606 in the longstyled form the pistil projects above the corolla and is almost exactly twice as long as that of the shortstyled which is included within the tube the former is divided into two rather short and broad stigmas whilst the shortstyled pistil is divided into two long thin sometimes much curled stigmas the stamens of each form correspond in height or length with the pistils of the other form the anthers of the shortstyled form are a little larger than those of the longstyled and their pollengrains are to those of the other form as 100 to 67 in diameter but the pollengrains of the two forms differ in a much more remarkable manner of which no other instance is known those from the shortstyled flowers being covered with sharp points the smaller ones from the longstyled being quite smooth fritz muller remarks that this difference between the pollengrains of the two forms is evidently of service to the plant for the grains from the projecting stamens of the shortstyled form if smooth would have been liable to be blown away by the wind and would thus have been lost but the little points on their surfaces cause them to cohere and at the same time favour their adhesion to the hairy bodies of insects which merely brush against the anthers of these stamens whilst visiting the flowers on the other hand the smooth grains of the longstyled flowers are safely included within the tube of the corolla so that they cannot be blown away but are almost sure to adhere to the proboscis of an entering insect which is necessarily pressed close against the enclosed anthers  it may be remembered that in the longstyled form of linum perenne each separate stigma rotates on its own axis when the flower is mature so as to turn its papillose surface outwards there can be no doubt that this movement which is confined to the longstyled form is effected in order that the proper surface of the stigma should receive pollen brought by insects from the other form now with faramea as fritz muller shows it is the stamens which rotate on their axes in one of the two forms namely the shortstyled in order that their pollen should be brushed off by insects and transported to the stigmas of the other form in the longstyled flowers the anthers of the short enclosed stamens do not rotate on their axes but dehisce on their inner sides as is the common rule with the rubiaceae and this is the best position for the adherence of the pollengrains to the proboscis of an entering insect fritz muller therefore infers that as the plant became heterostyled and as the stamens of the short styled form increased in length they gradually acquired the highly beneficial power of rotating on their own axes but he has further shown by the careful examination of many flowers that this power has not as yet been perfected and consequently that a certain proportion of the pollen is rendered useless namely that from the anthers which do not rotate properly it thus appears that the development of the plant has not as yet been completed the stamens have indeed acquired their proper length but not their full and perfect power of rotation 325 fritz muller gives another instance of the want of absolute perfection in the flowers of another member of the rubiaceae namely posoqueria fragrans which is adapted in a most wonderful manner for crossfertilisation by the agency of moths see botanische zeitung 1866 number 17 in accordance with the nocturnal habits of these insects most of the flowers open only during the night but some open in the day and the pollen of such flowers is robbed as fritz muller has often seen by humblebees and other insects without any benefit being thus conferred on the plant  the several points of difference in structure between the two forms of faramea are highly remarkable until within a recent period if any one had been shown two plants which differed in a uniform manner in the length of their stamens and pistilsin the form of their stigmasin the manner of dehiscence and slightly in the size of their anthersand to an extraordinary degree in the diameter and structure of their pollengrains he would have declared it impossible that the two could have belonged to one and the same species  suteria species unnamed in the herbarium at kew rubiaceae  i owe to the kindness of fritz muller dried flowers of this plant from st catharina in brazil in the longstyled form the stigma stands in the mouth of the corolla above the anthers which latter are enclosed within the tube but only a short way down in the shortstyled form the anthers are placed in the mouth of the corolla above the stigma which occupies the same position as the anthers in the other form being seated only a short way down the tube therefore the pistil of the longstyled form does not exceed in length that of the shortstyled in nearly so great a degree as in many other rubiaceae nevertheless there is a considerable difference in the size of the pollengrains in the two forms for as fritz muller informs me those of the shortstyled are to those of the longstyled as 100 to 75 in diameter  houstonia coerulea rubiaceae  professor asa gray has been so kind as to send me an abstract of some observations made by dr rothrock on this plant the pistil is exserted in the one form and the stamens in the other as has long been observed the stigmas of the longstyled form are shorter stouter and far more hispid than in the other form the stigmatic hairs or papillae on the former are 04 millimetres and on the latter only 023 millimetres in length in the shortstyled form the anthers are larger and the pollengrains when distended with water are to those from the longstyled form as 100 to 72 in diameter  selected capsules from some longstyled plants growing in the botanic gardens at cambridge us near where plants of the other form grew contained on an average 13 seeds but these plants must have been subjected to unfavourable conditions for some longstyled plants in a state of nature yielded an average of 215 seeds per capsule some shortstyled plants which had been planted by themselves in the botanic gardens where it was not likely that they would have been visited by insects that had previously visited longstyled plants produced capsules eleven of which were wholly sterile but one contained 4 and another 8 seeds so that the shortstyled form seems to be very sterile with its own pollen professor asa gray informs me that the other north american species of this genus are likewise heterostyled  oldenlandia sp rubiaceae  mr j scott sent me from india dried flowers of a heterostyled species of this genus which is closely allied to the last the pistil in the longstyled flowers is longer by about a quarter of its length and the stamens shorter in about the same proportion than the corresponding organs in the shortstyled flowers in the latter the anthers are longer and the divergent stigmas decidedly longer and apparently thinner than in the longstyled form owing to the state of the specimens i could not decide whether the stigmatic papillae were longer in the one form than in the other the pollengrains distended with water from the shortstyled flowers were to those from the longstyled as 100 to 78 in diameter as deduced from the mean of ten measurements of each kind  hedyotis sp rubiaceae  fritz muller sent me from st catharina in brazil dried flowers of a small delicate species which grows on wet sand near the edges of freshwater pools in the longstyled form the stigma projects above the corolla and stands on a level with the projecting anthers of the shortstyled form but in the latter the stigmas stand rather beneath the level of the anthers in the other or long styled form these being enclosed within the tube of the corolla the pistil of the longstyled form is nearly thrice as long as that of the shortstyled or speaking strictly as 100 to 39 and the papillae on the stigma of the former are broader in the ratio of 4 to 3 but whether longer than those of the short styled i could not decide in the shortstyled form the anthers are rather larger and the pollengrains are to those from the longstyled flowers as 100 to 88 in diameter fritz muller sent me a second smallsized species which is likewise heterostyled  coccocypselum sp rubiaceae  fritz muller also sent me dried flowers of this plant from st catharina in brazil the exserted stigma of the longstyled form stands a little above the level of the exserted anthers of the shortstyled form and the enclosed stigma of the latter also stands a little above the level of the enclosed anthers in the longstyled form the pistil of the longstyled is about twice as long as that of the shortstyled with its two stigmas considerably longer more divergent and more curled fritz muller informs me that he could detect no difference in the size of the pollengrains in the two forms nevertheless there can be no doubt that this plant is heterostyled  lipostoma sp rubiaceae  dried flowers of this plant which grows in small wet ditches in st catharina in brazil were likewise sent me by fritz muller in the longstyled form the exserted stigma stands rather above the level of the exserted anthers of the other form whilst in the shortstyled form it stands on a level with the anthers of the other form so that the want of strict correspondence in height between the stigmas and anthers in the two forms is reversed compared with what occurs in hedyotis the longstyled pistil is to that of the shortstyled as 100 to 36 in length and its divergent stigmas are longer by fully onethird of their own length than those of the shortstyled form in the latter the anthers are a little larger and the pollengrains are as 100 to 80 in diameter compared with those from the longstyled form  cinchona micrantha rubiaceae  dried specimens of both forms of this plant were sent me from kew 326 my attention was called to this plant by a drawing copied from howards quinologia table 3 given by mr markham in his travels in peru page 539 in the longstyled form the apex of the stigma stands just beneath the bases of the hairy lobes of the corolla whilst the summits of the anthers are seated about halfway down the tube the pistil is in length as 100 to 38 to that of the shortstyled form in the latter the anthers occupy the same position as the stigma of the other form and they are considerably longer than those of the longstyled form as the summit of the stigma in the shortstyled form stands beneath the bases of the anthers which are seated halfway down the corolla the style has been extremely shortened in this form its length to that of the long styled being in the specimens examined only as 53 to 100 the stigma also in the shortstyled form is very much shorter than that in the longstyled in the ratio of 57 to 100 the pollen grains from the shortstyled flowers after having been soaked in water were rather largerin about the ratio of 100 to 91than those from the longstyled flowers and they were more triangular with the angles more prominent as all the grains from the shortstyled flowers were thus characterised and as they had been left in water for three days i am convinced that this difference in shape in the two sets of grains cannot be accounted for by unequal distension with water  besides the several rubiaceous genera already mentioned fritz muller informs me that two or three species of psychotria and rudgea eriantha natives of st catharina in brazil are heterostyled as is manettia bicolor i may add that i formerly fertilised with their own pollen several flowers on a plant of this latter species in my hothouse but they did not set a single fruit from wight and arnotts description there seems to be little doubt that knoxia in india is heterostyled and asa gray is convinced that this is the case with diodia and spermacoce in the united states lastly from mr ww baileys description it appears that the mexican bouvardia leiantha is heterostyled 327 bulletin of the torrey bot club 1876 page 106  altogether we now know of 17 heterostyled genera in the great family of the rubiaceae though more information is necessary with respect to some of them more especially those mentioned in the last paragraph before we can feel absolutely safe in the genera plantarum by bentham and hooker the rubiaceae are divided into 25 tribes containing 337 genera and it deserves notice that the genera now known to be heterostyled are not grouped in one or two of these tribes but are distributed in no less than eight of them from this fact we may infer that most of the genera have acquired their heterostyled structure independently of one another that is they have not inherited this structure from some one or even two or three progenitors in common it further deserves notice that in the homostyled genera as i am informed by professor asa gray the stamens are either exserted or are included within the tube of the corolla in a nearly constant manner so that this character which is not even of specific value in the heterostyled species is often of generic value in other members of the family   chapter iv  heterostyled trimorphic plants  lythrum salicaria description of the three forms their power and complex manner of fertilising one another

those which present three forms these have been observed in three families and consist of species of lythrum and of the allied genus nesaea of oxalis and pontederia in their manner of fertilisation these plants offer a more remarkable case than can be found in any other plant or animal  lythrum salicaria  figure 410 diagram of the flowers of the three forms of lythrum salicaria in their natural position with the petals and calyx removed on the near side enlarged six times top longstyled middle midstyled bottom shortstyled the dotted lines with the arrows show the directions in which pollen must be carried to each stigma to ensure full fertility  the pistil in each form differs from that in either of the other forms and in each there are two sets of stamens different in appearance and function but one set of stamens in each form corresponds with a set in one of the other two forms altogether this one species includes three females or female organs and three sets of male organs all as distinct from one another as if they belonged to different species and if smaller functional differences are considered there are five distinct sets of males two of the three hermaphrodites must coexist and pollen must be carried by insects reciprocally from one to the other in order that either of the two should be fully fertile but unless all three forms coexist two sets of stamens will be wasted and the organisation of the species as a whole will be incomplete on the other hand when all three hermaphrodites coexist and pollen is carried from one to the other the scheme is perfect there is no waste of pollen and no false coadaptation in short nature has ordained a most complex marriagearrangement namely a triple union between three hermaphroditeseach hermaphrodite being in its female organ quite distinct from the other two hermaphrodites and partially distinct in its male organs and each furnished with two sets of males  the three forms may be conveniently called from the unequal lengths of their pistils the longstyled midstyled and shortstyled the stamens also are of unequal lengths and these may be called the longest midlength and shortest two sets of stamens of different length are found in each form the existence of the three forms was first observed by vaucher and subsequently more carefully by wirtgen  but these botanists not being guided by any theory or even suspicion of their functional differences did not perceive some of the most curious points of difference in their structure 41 vaucher hist phys des plantes deurope tome 2 1841 page 371 wirtgen ueber lythrum salicaria und dessen formen verhand des naturhist vereins fur preuss rheinl 5 jahrgang 1848 s 7 i will first briefly describe the three forms by the aid of figure 410 which shows the flowers six times magnified in their natural position with their petals and calyx on the near side removed  longstyled form  this form can be at once recognised by the length of the pistil which is including the ovarium fully onethird longer than that of the midstyled and more than thrice as long as that of the shortstyled form it is so disproportionately long that it projects in the bud through the folded petals it stands out considerably beyond the midlength stamens its terminal portion depends a little but the stigma itself is slightly upturned the globular stigma is considerably larger than that of the other two forms with the papillae on its surface generally longer the six midlength stamens project about twothirds the length of the pistil and correspond in length with the pistil of the midstyled form such correspondence in this and the two following forms is generally very close the difference where there is any being usually in a slight excess of length in the stamens the six shortest stamens lie concealed within the calyx their ends are turned up and they are graduated in length so as to form a double row the anthers of these stamens are smaller than those of the midlength ones the pollen is of the same yellow colour in both sets h muller measured the pollengrain in all three forms and his measurements are evidently more trustworthy than those which i formerly made so i will give them 42 die befruchtung der blumen 1873 page 193 the numbers refer to divisions of the micrometer equalling 1300 millimetres the grains distended with water from the midlength stamens are 7 to 7 12 and those from the shortest stamens 6 to 6 12 in diameter or as 100 to 86 the capsules of this form contain on an average 93 seeds how this average was obtained will presently be explained as these seeds when cleaned seemed larger than those from the midstyled or shortstyled forms 100 of them were placed in a good balance and by the double method of weighing were found to equal 121 seeds of the midstyled or 142 of the shortstyled so that five longstyled seeds very nearly equal six midstyled or seven shortstyled seeds  midstyled form  the pistil occupies the position represented in figure 410 with its extremity considerably upturned but to a variable degree the stigma is seated between the anthers of the longest and the shortest stamens the six longest stamens correspond in length with the pistil of the longstyled form their filaments are coloured bright pink the anthers are darkcoloured but from containing brightgreen pollen and from their early dehiscence they appear emeraldgreen hence in general appearance these stamens are remarkably dissimilar from the midlength stamens of the longstyled form the six shortest stamens are enclosed within the calyx and resemble in all respects the shortest stamens of the longstyled form both these sets correspond in length with the short pistil of the shortstyled form the green pollengrains of the longest stamens are 9 to 10 in diameter whilst the yellow grains from the shortest stamens are only 6 or as 100 to 63 but the pollengrains from different plants appeared to me in this case and others to be in some degree variable in size the capsules contain on an average 130 seeds but perhaps as we shall see this is rather too high an average the seeds themselves as before remarked are smaller than those of the longstyled form  shortstyled form  the pistil is here very short not onethird of the length of that of the long styled form it is enclosed within the calyx which differently from that in the other two forms does not enclose any anthers the end of the pistil is generally bent upwards at right angles the six longest stamens with their pink filaments and green pollen resemble the corresponding stamens of the midstyled form but according to h muller their pollengrains are a little larger namely 9 12 to 10 12 instead of 9 to 10 in diameter the six midlength stamens with their uncoloured filaments and yellow pollen resemble in the size of their pollengrains and in all other respects the corresponding stamens of the longstyled form the difference in diameter between the grains from the two sets of anthers in the shortstyled form is as 100 to 73 the capsules contain fewer seeds on an average than those of either of the preceding forms namely 835 and the seeds are considerably smaller in this latter respect but not in number there is a gradation parallel to that in the length of the pistil the longstyled having the largest seeds the midstyled the next in size and the shortstyled the smallest  we thus see that this plant exists under three female forms which differ in the length and curvature of the style in the size and state of the stigma and in the number and size of the seed there are altogether thirtysix males or stamens and these can be divided into three sets of a dozen each differing from one another in length curvature and colour of the filamentsin the size of the anthers and especially in the colour and diameter of the pollengrains each form bears halfadozen of one kind of stamens and halfadozen of another kind but not all three kinds the three kinds of stamens correspond in length with the three pistils the correspondence is always between half of the stamens in two of the forms with the pistil of the third form table 4a of the diameters of the pollengrains after immersion in water from both sets of stamens in all three forms is copied from h muller they are arranged in the order of their size  table 4a lythrum salicaria diameters of pollengrains after immersion in water  column 1 source of pollengrains column 2 minimum diameter column 3 maximum diameter  longest stamens of shortstyled form  9 12  10 12 longest

form  6  6  we here see that the largest pollengrains come from the longest stamens and the least smallest from the shortest the extreme difference in diameter between them being as 100 to 60  the average number of seeds in the three forms was ascertained by counting them in eight fine selected capsules taken from plants growing wild and the result was as we have seen for the longstyled neglecting decimals 93 midstyled 130 and shortstyled 83 i should not have trusted in these ratios had i not possessed a number of plants in my garden which owing to their youth did not yield the full complement of seed but were of the same age and grew under the same conditions and were freely visited by bees i took six fine capsules from each and found the average to be for the longstyled 80 for the midstyled 97 and for the shortstyled 61 lastly legitimate unions effected by me between the three forms gave as may be seen in the following tables for the long styled an average of 90 seeds for the midstyled 117 and for the shortstyled 71 so that we have good concurrent evidence of a difference in the average production of seed by the three forms to show that the unions effected by me often produced their full effect and may be trusted i may state that one mid styled capsule yielded 151 good seeds which is the same number as in the finest wild capsule which i examined some artificially fertilised short and long styled capsules produced a greater number of seeds than was ever observed by me in wild plants of the same forms but then i did not examine many of the latter this plant i may add offers a remarkable instance how profoundly ignorant we are of the lifeconditions of a species naturally it grows in wet ditches watery places and especially on the banks of streams and though it produces so many minute seeds it never spreads on the adjoining land yet when planted in my garden on clayey soil lying over chalk and which is so dry that a rush cannot be found it thrives luxuriantly grows to above 6 feet in height produces selfsown seedlings and which is a severer test is as fertile as in a state of nature nevertheless it would be almost a miracle to find this plant growing spontaneously on such land as that in my garden  according to vaucher and wirtgen the three forms coexist in all parts of europe some friends gathered for me in north wales a number of twigs from separate plants growing near one another and classified them my son did the same in hampshire and here is the result  table 422 lythrum salicaria classification according to form of flower

thrice the number had been collected the three forms would probably have been found nearly equal i infer this from considering the above figures and from my son telling me that if he had collected in another spot he felt sure that the midstyled plants would have been in excess i several times sowed small parcels of seed and raised all three forms but i neglected to record the parentform excepting in one instance in which i raised from shortstyled seed twelve plants of which only one turned out longstyled four midstyled and seven shortstyled  two plants of each form were protected from the access of insects during two successive years and in the autumn they yielded very few capsules and presented a remarkable contrast with the adjoining uncovered plants which were densely covered with capsules in 1863 a protected longstyled plant produced only five poor capsules two midstyled plants produced together the same number and two shortstyled plants only a single one these capsules contained very few seeds yet the plants were fully productive when artificially fertilised under the net in a state of nature the flowers are incessantly visited for their nectar by hive and other bees various diptera and lepidoptera 43 h muller gives a list of the species die befruchtung der blumen page 196 it appears that one bee the cilissa melanura almost confines its visits to this plant the nectar is secreted all round the base of the ovarium but a passage is formed along the upper and inner side of the flower by the lateral deflection not represented in the diagram of the basal portions of the filaments so that insects invariably alight on the projecting stamens and pistil and insert their proboscides along the upper and inner margin of the corolla we can now see why the ends of the stamens with their anthers and the ends of the pistils with their stigmas are a little upturned so that they may be brushed by the lower hairy surfaces of the insects bodies the shortest stamens which lie enclosed within the calyx of the long and midstyled forms can be touched only by the proboscis and narrow chin of a bee hence they have their ends more upturned and they are graduated in length so as to fall into a narrow file sure to be raked by the thin intruding proboscis the anthers of the longer stamens stand laterally farther apart and are more nearly on the same level for they have to brush against the whole breadth of the insects body in very many other flowers the pistil or the stamens or both are rectangularly bent to one side of the flower this bending may be permanent as with lythrum and many others or may be effected as in dictamnus fraxinella and others by a temporary movement which occurs in the case of the stamens when the anthers dehisce and in the case of the pistil when the stigma is mature but these two movements do not always take place simultaneously in the same flower now i have found no exception to the rule that when the stamens and pistil are bent they bend to that side of the flower which secretes nectar even though there be a rudimentary nectary of large size on the opposite side as in some species of corydalis when nectar is secreted on all sides they bend to that side where the structure of the flower allows the easiest access to it as in lythrum various papilionaceae and others the rule consequently is that when the pistils and stamens are curved or bent the stigma and anthers are thus brought into the pathway leading to the nectary there are a few cases which seem to be exceptions to this rule but they are not so in truth for instance in the gloriosa lily the stigma of the grotesque and rectangularly bent pistil is brought not into any pathway from the outside towards the nectarsecreting recesses of the flower but into the circular route which insects follow in proceeding from one nectary to the other in scrophularia aquatica the pistil is bent downwards from the mouth of the corolla but it thus strikes the pollendusted breast of the wasps which habitually visit these illscented flowers in all these cases we see the supreme dominating power of insects on the structure of flowers especially of those which have irregular corollas flowers which are fertilised by the wind must of course be excepted but i do not know of a single instance of an irregular flower which is thus fertilised  another point deserves notice in each of the three forms two sets of stamens correspond in length with the pistils in the other two forms when bees suck the flowers the anthers of the longest stamens bearing the green pollen are rubbed against the abdomen and the inner sides of the hind legs as is likewise the stigma of the longstyled form the anthers of the midlength stamens and the stigma of the midstyled form are rubbed against the under side of the thorax and between the front pair of legs and lastly the anthers of the shortest stamens and the stigma of the shortstyled form are rubbed against the proboscis and chin for the bees in sucking the flowers insert only the front part of their heads into the flower on catching bees i observed much green pollen on the inner sides of the hind legs and on the abdomen and much yellow pollen on the under side of the thorax there was also pollen on the chin and it may be presumed on the proboscis but this was difficult to observe i had however independent proof that pollen is carried on the proboscis for a small branch of a protected shortstyled plant which produced spontaneously only two capsules was accidentally left during several days pressing against the net and bees were seen inserting their proboscides through the meshes and in consequence numerous capsules were formed on this one small branch from these several facts it follows that insects will generally carry the pollen of each form from the stamens to the pistil of corresponding length and we shall presently see the importance of this adaptation it must not however be supposed that the bees do not get more or less dusted all over with the several kinds of pollen for this could be seen to occur with the green pollen from the longest stamens moreover a case will presently be given of a longstyled plant producing an abundance of capsules though growing quite by itself and the flowers must have been fertilised by their own kinds of pollen but these capsules contained a very poor average of seed hence insects and chiefly bees act both as general carriers of pollen and as special carriers of the right sort  wirtgen remarks on the variability of this plant in the branching of the stem in the length of the bracteae size of the petals and in several other characters 44 verhand des naturhist vereins fur pr rheinl 5 jahrgang 1848 pages 11 13 the plants which grew in my garden had their leaves which differed much in shape arranged oppositely alternately or in whorls of three in this latter case the stems were hexagonal those of the other plants being quadrangular but we are concerned chiefly with the reproductive organs the upward bending of the pistil is variable and especially in the shortstyled form in which it is sometimes straight sometimes slightly curved but generally bent at right angles the stigma of the longstyled pistil frequently has longer papillae or is rougher than that of the midstyled and the latter than that of the shortstyled but this character though fixed and uniform in the two forms of primula veris etc is here variable for i have seen mid styled stigmas rougher than those of the longstyled 45 the plants which i observed grew in my garden and probably varied rather more than those growing in a state of nature h muller has described the stigmas of all three forms with great care and he appears to have found the stigmatic papillae differing constantly in length and structure in the three forms being longest in the longstyled form the degree to which the longest and midlength stamens are graduated in length and have their ends upturned is variable sometimes all are equally long the colour of the green pollen in the longest stamens is variable being sometimes pale greenishyellow in one shortstyled plant it was almost white the grains vary a little in size i examined one shortstyled plant with the grains from the midlength and shortest anthers of the same size we here see great variability in many important characters and if any of these variations were of service to the plant or were correlated with useful functional differences the species is in that state in which natural selection might readily do much for its modification  on the power of mutual fertilisation between the three forms  nothing shows more clearly the extraordinary complexity of the reproductive system of this plant than the necessity of making eighteen distinct unions in order to ascertain the relative fertilising power of the three forms thus the longstyled form has to be fertilised with pollen from its own two kinds of anthers from the two in the midstyled and from the two in the shortstyled form the same process has to be repeated with the midstyled and shortstyled forms it might have been thought sufficient to have tried on each stigma the green pollen for instance from either the mid or shortstyled longest stamens and not from both but the result proves that this would have been insufficient and that it was necessary to try all six kinds of pollen on each stigma as in fertilising flowers there will always be some failures it would have been advisable to have repeated each of the eighteen unions a score of times but the labour would have been too great as it was i made 223 unions ie on an average i fertilised above a dozen flowers in the eighteen different methods each flower was castrated the adjoining buds had to be removed so that the flowers might be safely marked with thread wool etc and after each fertilisation the stigma was examined with a lens to see that there was sufficient pollen on it plants of all three forms were protected during two years by large nets on a framework two plants were used during one or both years in order to avoid any individual peculiarity in a particular plant as soon as the flowers had withered the nets were removed and in the autumn the capsules were daily inspected and gathered the ripe seeds being counted under the microscope i have given these details that confidence may be placed in the following tables and as some excuse for two blunders which i believe were made these blunders are referred to with their probable cause in two footnotes to the tables the erroneous numbers however are entered in the tables that it may not be supposed that i have in any one instance tampered with the results  a few words explanatory of the three tables must be given each is devoted to one of the three forms and is divided into six compartments the two upper ones in each table show the number of good seeds resulting from the application to the stigma of pollen from the two sets of stamens which correspond in length with the pistil of that form and which are borne by the other two forms such unions are of a legitimate nature the two next lower compartments show the result of the application of pollen from the two sets of stamens not corresponding in length with the pistil and which are borne by the other two forms these unions are illegitimate the two lowest compartments show the result of the application of each forms own two kinds of pollen from the two sets of stamens belonging to the same form and which do not equal the pistil in length these unions are likewise illegitimate the term ownform pollen here used does not mean pollen from the flower to be fertilisedfor this was never usedbut from another flower on the same plant or more commonly from a distinct plant of the same form the figure 0 means that no capsule was produced or if a capsule was produced that it contained no good seed in some part of each row of figures in each compartment a short horizontal line may be seen the unions above this line were made in 1862 and below it in 1863 it is of importance to observe this as it shows that the same general result was obtained during two successive years but more especially because 1863 was a very hot and dry season and the plants had occasionally to be watered this did not prevent the full complement of seed being produced from the more fertile unions but it rendered the less fertile ones even more sterile than they otherwise would have been i have seen striking instances of this fact in making illegitimate and legitimate unions with primula and it is well known that the conditions of life must be highly favourable to give any chance of success in producing hybrids between species which are crossed with difficulty  table 423 lythrum salicaria longstyled form  table 4231 legitimate union  13 flowers fertilised by the longest stamens of the midstyled these

away from any other plant so that the flowers could have received only their own two kinds of pollen the flowers were incessantly visited by bees and their stigmas must have received successive applications of pollen on the most favourable days and at the most favourable hours all who have crossed plants know that this highly favours fertilisation this plant produced an abundant crop of

gives an average of 215 seeds per capsule as we know that the longstyled form when standing near plants of the other two forms and fertilised by insects produces on an average 93 seeds per capsule we see that this form fertilised by its own two pollens yields only between onefourth and onefifth of the full number of seed i have spoken as if the plant had received both its own kinds of pollen and this is of course possible but from the enclosed position of the shortest stamens it is much more probable that the stigma received exclusively pollen from the midlength stamens and this as may be

of 136 seeds in table 4245 was due to a gross error the flowers to be fertilised by their own longest stamens were first marked by white thread and those by the midlength stamens of the longstyled

hardly any doubt that i fertilised a flower marked with white thread as if it had been marked with white silk with respect to the capsule which yielded 92 seeds in the same column with that which yielded 136 i do not know what to think i endeavoured to prevent pollen dropping from an upper to a lower flower and i tried to remember to wipe the pincers carefully after each fertilisation but in making eighteen different unions sometimes on windy days and pestered by bees and flies buzzing about some few errors could hardly be avoided one day i had to keep a third man by me all the time to prevent the bees visiting the uncovered plants for in a few seconds time they might have done irreparable mischief it was also extremely difficult to exclude minute diptera from the net in 1862 i made

illegitimately by the other stamens of the long and midstyled forms yielded only two very poor capsules  twenty shortstyled flowers fertilised illegitimately by their own stamens yielded only two poor or perhaps three capsules  if we take all six legitimate unions together and all twelve illegitimate unions together we get the following results  table 426  column 1 nature of union column 2 number of flowers fertilised column 3 number of capsules produced column 4 average number of seeds per capsule column 5 average number of seeds per flower fertilised  the six legitimate unions  75  56  9629  7189 the twelve illegitimate unions  146  36  4472  1103  therefore the fertility of the legitimate unions to that of the illegitimate as judged by the proportion of the fertilised flowers which yielded capsules is as 100 to 33 and judged by the average number of seeds per capsule as 100 to 46  from this summary and the several foregoing tables we see that it is only pollen from the longest stamens which can fully fertilise the longest pistil only that from the midlength stamens the midlength pistil and only that from the shortest stamens the shortest pistil and now we can comprehend the meaning of the almost exact correspondence in length between the pistil in each form and a set of six stamens in two of the other forms for the stigma of each form is thus rubbed against that part of the insects body which becomes charged with the proper pollen it is also evident that the stigma of each form fertilised in three different ways with pollen from the longest midlength and shortest stamens is acted on very differently and conversely that the pollen from the twelve longest twelve midlength and twelve shortest stamens acts very differently on each of the three stigmas so that there are three sets of female and of male organs moreover in most cases the six stamens of each set differ somewhat in their fertilising power from the six corresponding ones in one of the other forms we may further draw the remarkable conclusion that the greater the inequality in length between the pistil and the set of stamens the pollen of which is employed for its fertilisation by so much is the sterility of the union increased there are no exceptions to this rule to understand what follows the reader should look to tables 423 424 and 425 and to the diagram figure 410 in the longstyled form the short stamens obviously differ in length from the pistil to a greater degree than do the midlength stamens and the capsules produced by the use of pollen from the shortest stamens contain fewer seeds than those produced by the pollen from the midlength stamens the same result follows with the longstyled form from the use of the pollen of shortest stamens of the midstyled form and of the midlength stamens of the shortstyled form the same rule also holds good with the midstyled and short styled forms when illegitimately fertilised with pollen from the stamens more or less unequal in length to their pistils certainly the difference in sterility in these several cases is slight but as far as we are enabled to judge it always increases with the increasing inequality of length between the pistil and the stamens which are used in each case  the correspondence in length between the pistil in each form and a set of stamens in the other two forms is probably the direct result of adaptation as it is of high service to the species by leading to full and legitimate fertilisation but the rule of the increased sterility of the illegitimate unions according to the greater inequality in length between the pistils and stamens employed for the union can be of no service with some heterostyled dimorphic plants the difference of fertility between the two illegitimate unions appears at first sight to be related to the facility of selffertilisation so that when from the position of the parts the liability in one form to self fertilisation is greater than in the other a union of this kind has been checked by having been rendered the more sterile of the two but this explanation does not apply to lythrum thus the stigma of the longstyled form is more liable to be illegitimately fertilised with pollen from its own mid length stamens or with pollen from the midlength stamens of the shortstyled form than by its own shortest stamens or those of the midstyled form yet the two former unions which it might have been expected would have been guarded against by increased sterility are much less likely to be effected the same relation holds good even in a more striking manner with the midstyled form and with the shortstyled form as far as the extreme sterility of all its illegitimate unions allows of any comparison we are led therefore to conclude that the rule of increased sterility in accordance with increased inequality in length between the pistils and stamens is a purposeless result incidental on those changes through which the species has passed in acquiring certain characters fitted to ensure the legitimate fertilisation of the three forms  another conclusion which may be drawn from tables 423 424 and 425 even from a glance at them is that the midstyled form differs from both the others in its much higher capacity for fertilisation in various ways not only did the twentyfour flowers legitimately fertilised by the stamens of corresponding lengths all or all but one yield capsules rich in seed but of the other four illegitimate unions that by the longest stamens of the shortstyled form was highly fertile though less so than the two legitimate unions and that by the midlength stamens of the longstyled form was fertile to a considerable degree the remaining two illegitimate unions namely with this forms own pollen were sterile but in different degrees so that the midstyled form when fertilised in the six different possible methods evinces five grades of fertility by comparing tables 4243 and 4246 we may see that the action of the pollen from the shortest stamens of the longstyled and midstyled forms is widely different in the one case above half the fertilised flowers yielded capsules containing a fair number of seeds in the other case not one capsule was produced so again the green largegrained pollen from the longest stamens of the shortstyled and midstyled forms in tables 4244 and 4245 is widely different in both these cases the difference in action is so plain that it cannot be mistaken but it can be corroborated if we look to table 425 to the legitimate action of the shortest stamens of the long and midstyled forms on the shortstyled form we again see a similar but slighter difference the pollen of the shortest stamens of the midstyled form yielding a smaller average of seed during the two years of 1862 and 1863 than that from the shortest stamens of the longstyled form again if we look to table 423 to the legitimate action on the longstyled form of the green pollen of the two sets of longest stamens we shall find exactly the same result namely that the pollen from the longest stamens of the midstyled form yielded during both years fewer seeds than that from the longest stamens of the shortstyled form hence it is certain that the two kinds of pollen produced by the midstyled form are less potent than the two similar kinds of pollen produced by the corresponding stamens of the other two forms  in close connection with the lesser potency of the two kinds of pollen of the midstyled form is the fact that according to h muller the grains of both are a little less in diameter than the corresponding grains produced by the other two forms thus the grains from the longest stamens of the midstyled form are 9 to 10 whilst those from the corresponding stamens of the shortstyled form are 9 12 to 10 12 in diameter so again the grains from the shortest stamens of the midstyled are 6 whilst those from the corresponding stamens of the long styled are 6 to 6 12 in diameter it would thus appear as if the male organs of the midstyled form though not as yet rudimentary were tending in this direction on the other hand the female organs of this form are in an eminently efficient state for the naturally fertilised capsules yielded a considerably larger average number of seeds than those of the other two formsalmost every flower which was artificially fertilised in a legitimate manner produced a capsuleand most of the illegitimate unions were highly productive the mid styled form thus appears to be highly feminine in nature and although as just remarked it is impossible to consider its two welldeveloped sets of stamens which produce an abundance of pollen as being in a rudimentary condition yet we can hardly avoid connecting as balanced the higher efficiency of the female organs in this form with the lesser efficiency and lesser size of its two kinds of pollengrains the whole case appears to me a very curious one  it may be observed in tables 423 to 425 that some of the illegitimate unions yielded during neither year a single seed but judging from the longstyled plants it is probable if such unions were to be effected repeatedly by the aid of insects under the most favourable conditions some few seeds would be produced in every case anyhow it is certain that in all twelve illegitimate unions the pollentubes penetrated the stigma in the course of eighteen hours at first i thought that two kinds of pollen placed together on the same stigma would perhaps yield more seed than one kind by itself but we have seen that this is not so with each forms own two kinds of pollen nor is it probable in any case as i occasionally got by the use of a single kind of pollen fully as many seeds as a capsule naturally fertilised ever produces moreover the pollen from a single anther is far more than sufficient to fertilise fully a stigma hence in this as with so many other plants more than twelve times as much of each kind of pollen is produced as is necessary to ensure the full fertilisation of each form from the dusted condition of the bodies of the bees which i caught on the flowers it is probable that pollen of various kinds is often deposited on all three stigmas but from the facts already given with respect to the two forms of primula there can hardly be a doubt that pollen from the stamens of corresponding length placed on a stigma would be prepotent over any other kind of pollen and obliterate its effectseven if the latter had been placed on the stigma some hours previously  finally it has now been shown that lythrum salicaria presents the extraordinary case of the same species bearing three females different in structure and function and three or even five sets if minor differences are considered of males each set consisting of halfadozen which likewise differ from one another in structure and function  lythrum graefferi  i have examined numerous dried flowers of this species each from a separate plant sent me from kew like l salicaria it is trimorphic and the three forms apparently occur in about equal numbers in the longstyled form the pistil projects about onethird of the length of the calyx beyond its mouth and is therefore relatively much shorter than in l salicaria the globose and hirsute stigma is larger than that of the other two forms the six midlength stamens which are graduated in length have their anthers standing close above and close beneath the mouth of the calyx the six shortest stamens rise rather above the middle of the calyx in the midstyled form the stigma projects just above the mouth of the calyx and stands almost on a level with the midlength stamens of the long and shortstyled forms its own longest stamens project well above the mouth of the calyx and stand a little above the level of the stigma of the longstyled form in short without entering on further details there is a close general correspondence in structure between this species and l salicaria but with some differences in the proportional lengths of the parts the fact of each of the three pistils having two sets of stamens of corresponding lengths borne by the two other forms comes out conspicuously in the midstyled form the pollengrains from the longest stamens are nearly double the diameter of those from the shortest stamens so that there is a greater difference in this respect than in l salicaria in the longstyled form also the difference in diameter between the pollengrains of the midlength and shortest stamens is greater than in l salicaria these comparisons however must be received with caution as they were made on specimens soaked in water after having been long kept dry  lythrum thymifolia  this form according to vaucher is dimorphic like primula and therefore presents only two forms 48 hist phys des plantes deurope tome 2 1841 pages 369 371 i received two dried flowers from kew which consisted of the two forms in one the stigma projected far beyond the calyx in the other it was included within the calyx in this latter form the style was only onefourth of the length of that in the other form there are only six stamens these are somewhat graduated in length and their anthers in the shortstyled form stand a little above the stigma but yet by no means equal in length the pistil of the longstyled form in the latter the stamens are rather shorter than those in the other form the six stamens alternate with the petals and therefore correspond homologically with the longest stamens of l salicaria and l graefferi  lythrum hyssopifolia  this species is said by vaucher but i believe erroneously to be dimorphic i have examined dried flowers from twentytwo separate plants from various localities sent to me by mr hewett c watson professor babington and others these were all essentially alike so that the species cannot be heterostyled the pistil varies somewhat in length but when unusually long the stamens are likewise generally long in the bud the stamens are short and vaucher was perhaps thus deceived there are from six to nine stamens graduated in length the three stamens which vary in being either present or absent correspond with the six shorter stamens of l salicaria and with the six which are always absent in l thymifolia the stigma is included within the calyx and stands in the midst of the anthers and would generally be fertilised by them but as the stigma and anthers are upturned and as according to vaucher there is a passage left in the upper side of the flower to the nectary there can hardly be a doubt that the flowers are visited by insects and would occasionally be crossfertilised by them as surely as the flowers of the shortstyled l salicaria the pistil of which and the corresponding stamens in the other two forms closely resemble those of l hyssopifolia according to vaucher and lecoq this species which is an annual generally grows almost solitarily 49 geograph bot de leurope tome 6 1857 page 157 whereas the three preceding species are social and this fact alone would almost have convinced me that l hyssopifolia was not heterostyled as such plants cannot habitually live isolated any better than one sex of a dioecious species  we thus see that within this genus some species are heterostyled and trimorphic one apparently heterostyled and dimorphic and one homostyled  nesaea verticillata  i raised a number of plants from seed sent me by professor asa gray and they presented three forms these differed from one another in the proportional lengths of their organs of fructification and in all respects in very nearly the same way as the three forms of lythrum graefferi the green pollengrains from the longest stamens measured along their longer axis and not distended with water were 137000 of an inch in length those from the midlength stamens 9 to 107000 and those from the shortest stamens 8 to 97000 of an inch so that the largest pollengrains are to the smallest in diameter as 100 to 65 this plant inhabits swampy ground in the united states according to fritz muller a species of this genus in st catharina in southern brazil is homostyled 410 botanische zeitung 1868 page 112  lagerstroemia indica  this plant a member of the lythraceae may perhaps be heterostyled or may formerly have been so it is remarkable from the extreme variability of its stamens on a plant growing in my hothouse the flowers included from nineteen to twentynine short stamens with yellow pollen which correspond in position with the shortest stamens of lythrum and from one to five the latter number being the commonest very long stamens with thick fleshcoloured filaments and green pollen corresponding in position with the longest stamens of lythrum in one flower two of the long stamens produced green while a third produced yellow pollen although the filaments of all three were thick and flesh coloured in an anther of another flower one cell contained green and the other yellow pollen the green and yellow pollengrains from the stamens of different length are of the same size the pistil is a little bowed upwards with the stigma seated between the anthers of the short and long stamens so that this plant was midstyled eight flowers were fertilised with green pollen and six with yellow pollen but not one set fruit this latter fact by no means proves that the plant is heterostyled as it may belong to the class of selfsterile species another plant growing in the botanic gardens at calcutta as mr j scott informs me was longstyled and it was equally sterile with its own pollen whilst a longstyled plant of l reginae though growing by itself produced fruit i examined dried flowers from two plants of l parviflora both of which were longstyled and they differed from l indica in having eight long stamens with thick filaments and a crowd of shorter stamens thus the evidence whether l indica is heterostyled is curiously conflicting the unequal number of the short and long stamens their extreme variability and especially the fact of their pollengrains not differing in size are strongly opposed to this belief on the other hand the difference in length of the pistils in two of the plants their sterility with their own pollen and the difference in length and structure of the two sets of stamens in the same flower and in the colour of their pollen favour the belief we know that when plants of any kind revert to a former condition they are apt to be highly variable and the two halves of the same organ sometimes differ much as in the case of the abovedescribed anther of the lagerstroemia we may therefore suspect that this species was once heterostyled and that it still retains traces of its former state together with a tendency to revert more completely to it it deserves notice as bearing on the nature of lagerstroemia that in lythrum hyssopifolia which is a homostyled species some of the shorter stamens vary in being either present or absent and that these same stamens are altogether absent in l thymifolia in another genus of the lythraceae namely cuphea three species raised by me from seed certainly were homostyled nevertheless their stamens consisted of two sets differing in length and in the colour and thickness of their filaments but not in the size or colour of their pollengrains so that they thus far resembled the stamens of lagerstroemia i found that cuphea purpurea was highly fertile with its own pollen when artificially aided but sterile when insects were excluded 411 mr spence informs me that in several species of the genus mollia tiliaceae which he collected in south america the stamens of the five outer cohorts have purplish filaments and green pollen whilst the stamens of the five inner cohorts have yellow pollen he therefore suspected that these species might prove to be heterostyled and trimorphic but he did not notice the length of the pistils in the allied luhea the outer purplish stamens are destitute of anthers i procured some specimens of mollia lepidota and speciosa from kew but could not make out that their pistils differed in length in different plants and in all those which i examined the stigma stood close beneath the uppermost anthers the numerous stamens are graduated in length and the pollengrains from the longest and shortest ones did not present any marked difference in diameter therefore these species do not appear to be heterostyled  oxalis geraniaceae  figure 411 oxalis speciosa with the petals removed left longstyled centre midstyled right shortstyled s s s stigmas the dotted lines with arrows show which pollen must be carried to the stigmas for legitimate fertilisation  in 1863 mr roland trimen wrote to me from the cape of good hope that he had there found species of oxalis which presented three forms and of these he enclosed drawings and dried specimens of one species he collected 43 flowers from distinct plants and they consisted of 10 longstyled 12 midstyled and 21 shortstyled of another species he collected 13 flowers consisting of 3 longstyled 7 midstyled and 3 shortstyled in 1866 professor hildebrand proved by an examination of the specimens in several herbaria that 20 species are certainly heterostyled and trimorphic and 51 others almost certainly so 412 monatsber der akad der wiss berlin 1866 pages 352 372 he gives drawings of the three forms at page 42 of his geschlechtervertheilung etc 1867 he also made some interesting observations on living plants belonging to one form alone for at that time he did not possess the three forms of any living species during the years 1864 to 1868 i occasionally experimented on oxalis speciosa but until now have never found time to publish the results in 1871 hildebrand published an admirable paper in which he shows in the case of two species of oxalis that the sexual relations of the three forms are nearly the same as in lythrum salicaria 413 botanische zeitung 1871 pages 416 and 432 i will now give an abstract of his observations and afterwards of my own less complete ones i may premise that in all the species seen by me the stigmas of the five straight pistils of the longstyled form stand on a level with the anthers of the longest stamens in the two other forms in the mid styled form the stigmas pass out between the filaments of the longest stamens as in the shortstyled form of linum and they stand rather nearer to the upper anthers than to the lower ones in the shortstyled form the stigmas also pass out between the filaments nearly on a level with the tips of the sepals the anthers in this latter form and in the midstyled rise to the same height as the corresponding stigmas in the other two forms  oxalis valdiviana  this species an inhabitant of the west coast of south america bears yellow flowers hildebrand states that the stigmas of the three forms do not differ in any marked manner but that the pistil of the shortstyled form alone is destitute of hairs the diameters of the pollengrains are as follows  table 4b oxalis valdiviana diameters of pollengrains in divisions of the micrometer  column 1 source of pollengrains column 2 minimum diameter column 3

fertilised flowers only 6 yielded capsules which contained 383 seeds on an average therefore the fertility of the six legitimate to that of the twelve illegitimate unions as judged by the proportion of flowers that yielded capsules is as 100 to 2 and as judged by the average number of seeds per capsule as 100 to 34 it may be added that some plants which were protected by nets did not spontaneously produce any fruit nor did one which was left uncovered by itself and was visited by bees on the other hand scarcely a single flower on some uncovered plants of the three forms growing near together failed to produce fruit  oxalis regnelli  this species bears white flowers and inhabits southern brazil hildebrand says that the stigma of the longstyled form is somewhat larger than that of the mid styled and this than that of the shortstyled the pistil of the latter is clothed with a few hairs whilst it is very hairy in the other two forms the diameter of the pollengrains from both sets of the longest stamens equals 9 divisions of the micrometerthat from the midlength stamens of the long styled form between 8 and 9 and of the shortstyled 8and that from the shortest stamens of both sets 7 so that the extreme difference in diameter is as 9 to 7 or as 100 to 78 the experiments made by hildebrand which are not so numerous as in the last case are given in table 428 in the

but more striking for 41 flowers belonging to the three forms fertilised legitimately all yielded capsules containing on an average 1031 seeds whilst 39 flowers fertilised illegitimately did not yield a single capsule or seed therefore the fertility of the six legitimate to that of the several illegitimate unions as judged both by the proportion of flowers which yielded capsules and by the average number of contained seeds is as 100 to 0  oxalis speciosa  this species which bears pink flowers was introduced from the cape of good hope a sketch of the reproductive organs of the three forms figure 411 has already been given the stigma of the longstyled form with the papillae on its surface included is twice as large as that of the shortstyled and that of the midstyled intermediate in size the

5836 seeds ninetyfive flowers illegitimately fertilised yielded 12 capsules containing on an average 2858 seeds therefore the fertility of the six legitimate to that of the twelve illegitimate unions as judged by the proportion of flowers which yielded capsules is as 100 to 15 and judged by the average number of seeds per capsule as 100 to 49 this plant in comparison with the two south american species previously described produces many more seeds and the illegitimately fertilised flowers are not quite so sterile  oxalis rosea  hildebrand possessed in a living state only the longstyled form of this trimorphic chilian species 414 monatsber der akad der wiss berlin 1866 page 372 the pollengrains from the two sets of anthers differ in diameter as 9 to 75 or as 100 to 83 he has further shown that there is an analogous difference between the grains from the two sets of anthers of the same flower in five other species of oxalis besides those already described the present species differs remarkably from the longstyled form of the three species previously experimented on in a much larger proportion of the flowers setting capsules when fertilised with their ownform pollen hildebrand fertilised 60 flowers with pollen from the midlength stamens of either the same or another flower and they yielded no less than 55 capsules or 92 per cent these capsules contained on an average 562 seeds but we have no means of judging how near an approach this average makes to that from flowers legitimately fertilised he also fertilised 45 flowers with pollen from the shortest stamens and these yielded only 17 capsules or 31 per cent containing on an average only 265 seeds we thus see that about thrice as many flowers when fertilised with pollen from the midlength stamens produced capsules and these contained twice as many seeds as did the flowers fertilised with pollen from the shortest stamens it thus appears and we find some evidence of the same fact with o speciosa that the same rule holds good with oxalis as with lythrum salicaria namely that in any two unions the greater the inequality in length between the pistils and stamens or which is the same thing the greater the distance of the stigma from the anthers the pollen of which is used for fertilisation the less fertile is the unionwhether judged by the proportion of flowers which set capsules or by the average number of seeds per capsule the rule cannot be explained in this case any more than in that of lythrum by supposing that wherever there is greater liability to selffertilisation this is checked by the union being rendered more sterile for exactly the reverse occurs the liability to selffertilisation being greatest in the unions between the pistils and stamens which approach each other the nearest and these are the more fertile i may add that i also possessed some longstyled plants of this species one was covered by a net and it set spontaneously a few capsules though extremely few compared with those produced by a plant growing by itself but exposed to the visits of bees  with most of the species of oxalis the shortstyled form seems to be the most sterile of the three forms when these are illegitimately fertilised and i will add two other cases to those already given i fertilised 29 shortstyled flowers of o compressa with pollen from their own two sets of stamens the pollen grains of which differ in diameter as 100 and 83 and not one produced a capsule i formerly cultivated during several years the shortstyled form of a species purchased under the name of o bowii but i have some doubts whether it was rightly named and fertilised many flowers with their own two kinds of pollen which differ in diameter in the usual manner but never got a single seed on the other hand hildebrand says that the shortstyled form of o deppei growing by itself yields plenty of seed but it is not positively known that this species is heterostyled and the pollengrains from the two sets of anthers do not differ in diameter  some facts communicated to me by fritz muller afford excellent evidence of the utter sterility of one of the forms of certain trimorphic species of oxalis when growing isolated he has seen in st catharina in brazil a large field of young sugarcane many acres in extent covered with the red blossoms of one form alone and these did not produce a single seed his own land is covered with the shortstyled form of a whiteflowered trimorphic species and this is equally sterile but when the three forms were planted near together in his garden they seeded freely with two other trimorphic species he finds that isolated plants are always sterile  fritz muller formerly believed that a species of oxalis which is so abundant in st catharina that it borders the roads for miles was dimorphic instead of trimorphic although the pistils and stamens vary greatly in length as was evident in some specimens sent to me yet the plants can be divided into two sets according to the lengths of these organs a large proportion of the anthers are of a white colour and quite destitute of pollen others which are pale yellow contain many bad with some good grains and others again which are bright yellow have apparently sound pollen but he has never succeeded in finding any fruit on this species the stamens in some of the flowers are partially converted into petals fritz muller after reading my description hereafter to be given of the illegitimate offspring of various heterostyled species suspects that these plants of oxalis may be the variable and sterile offspring of a single form of some trimorphic species perhaps accidentally introduced into the district which has since been propagated asexually it is probable that this kind of propagation would be much aided by there being no expenditure in the production of seed  oxalis biophytum sensitiva  this plant is ranked by many botanists as a distinct genus mr thwaites sent me a number of flowers preserved in spirits from ceylon and they are clearly trimorphic the style of the longstyled form is clothed with many scattered hairs both simple and glandular such hairs are much fewer on the style of the midstyled and quite absent from that of the shortstyled form so that this plant resembles in this respect o valdiviana and regnelli calling the length of the two lobes of the stigma of the longstyled form 100 that of the mid styled is 141 and that of the shortstyled 164 in all other cases in which the stigma in this genus differs in size in the three forms the difference is of a reversed nature the stigma of the longstyled being the largest and that of the shortstyled the smallest the diameter of the pollengrains from the longest stamens being represented by 100 those from the midlength stamens are 91 and those from the shortest stamens 84 in diameter this plant is remarkable as we shall see in the last chapter of this volume by producing longstyled midstyled and shortstyled cleistogamic flowers  homostyled species of oxalis  although the majority of the species in the large genus oxalis seem to be trimorphic some are homostyled that is exist under a single form for instance the common o acetosella and according to hildebrand two other widely distributed european species o stricta and corniculata fritz muller also informs me that a similarly constituted species is found in st catharina and that it is quite fertile with its own pollen when insects are excluded the stigmas of o stricta and of another homostyled species namely o tropaeoloides commonly stand on a level with the upper anthers and both these species are likewise quite fertile when insects are excluded  with respect to o acetosella hildebrand says that in all the many specimens examined by him the pistil exceeded the longer stamens in length i procured 108 flowers from the same number of plants growing in three distant parts of england of these 86 had their stigmas projecting considerably above whilst 22 had them nearly on a level with the upper anthers in one lot of 17 flowers from the same wood the stigmas in every flower projected fully as much above the upper anthers as these stood above the lower anthers so that these plants might fairly be compared with the longstyled form of a heterostyled species and i at first thought that o acetosella was trimorphic but the case is one merely of great variability the pollengrains from the two sets of anthers as observed by hildebrand and myself do not differ in diameter i fertilised twelve flowers on several plants with pollen from a distinct plant choosing those with pistils of a different length and 10 of these ie 83 per cent produced capsules which contained on an average 79 seeds fourteen flowers were fertilised with their own pollen and 11 of these ie 79 per cent yielded capsules containing a larger average of seed namely 92 these plants therefore in function show not the least sign of being heterostyled i may add that 18 flowers protected by a net were left to fertilise themselves and only 10 of these ie 55 per cent yielded capsules which contained on an average only 63 seeds so that the access of insects or artificial aid in placing pollen on the stigma increases the fertility of the flowers and i found that this applied especially to those having shorter pistils it should be remembered that the flowers hang downwards so that those with short pistils would be the least likely to receive their own pollen unless they were aided in some manner  finally as hildebrand has remarked there is no evidence that any of the heterostyled species of oxalis are tending towards a dioecious condition as zuccarini and lindley inferred from the differences in the reproductive organs of the three forms the meaning of which they did not understand  pontederia sp pontederiaceae  fritz muller found this aquatic plant which is allied to the liliaceae growing in the greatest profusion on the banks of a river in southern brazil 415 ueber den trimorphismus der pontederien jenaische zeitschrift etc band 6 1871 page 74 but only two forms were found the flowers of which include three long and three short stamens the pistil of the longstyled form in two dried flowers which were sent me was in length as 100 to 32 and its stigma as 100 to 80 compared with the same organs in the shortstyled form the longstyled stigma projects considerably above the upper anthers of the same flower and stands on a level with the upper ones of the shortstyled form in the latter the stigma is seated beneath both its own sets of anthers and is on a level with the anthers of the shorter stamens in the longstyled form the anthers of the longer stamens of the shortstyled form are to those of the shorter stamens of the longstyled form as 100 to 88 in length the pollengrains distended with water from the longer stamens of the shortstyled form are to those from the shorter stamens of the same form as 100 to 87 in diameter as deduced from ten measurements of each kind we thus see that the organs in these two forms differ from one another and are arranged in an analogous manner as in the long and shortstyled forms of the trimorphic species of lythrum and oxalis moreover the longer stamens of the longstyled form of pontederia and the shorter ones of the shortstyled form are placed in a proper position for fertilising the stigma of a midstyled form but fritz muller although he examined a vast number of plants could never find one belonging to the midstyled form the older flowers of the longstyled and shortstyled plants had set plenty of apparently good fruit and this might have been expected as they could legitimately fertilise one another although he could not find the midstyled form of this species he possessed plants of another species growing in his garden and all these were midstyled and in this case the pollengrains from the anthers of the longer stamens were to those from the shorter stamens of the same flower as 100 to 86 in diameter as deduced from ten measurements of each kind these midstyled plants growing by themselves never produced a single fruit  considering these several facts there can hardly be a doubt that both these species of pontederia are heterostyled and trimorphic this case is an interesting one for no other monocotyledonous plant is known to be heterostyled moreover the flowers are irregular and all other heterostyled plants have almost symmetrical flowers the two forms differ somewhat in the colour of their corollas that of the shortstyled being of a darker blue whilst that of the longstyled tends towards violet and no other such case is known lastly the three longer stamens alternate with the three shorter ones whereas in lythrum and oxalis the long and short stamens belong to distinct whorls with respect to the absence of the midstyled form in the case of the pontederia which grows wild in southern brazil this would probably follow if only two forms had been originally introduced there for as we shall hereafter see from the observations of hildebrand fritz muller and myself when one form of oxalis is fertilised exclusively by either of the other two forms the offspring generally belong to the two parentforms  fritz muller has recently discovered as he informs me a third species of pontederia with all three forms growing together in pools in the interior of s brazil so that no shadow of doubt can any longer remain about this genus including trimorphic species he sent me dried flowers of all three forms in the longstyled form the stigma stands a little above the tips of the petals and on a level with the anthers of the longest stamens in the other two forms the pistil is in length to that of the midstyled as 100 to 56 and to that of the shortstyled as 100 to 16 its summit is rectangularly bent upwards and the stigma is rather broader than that of the midstyled and broader in about the ratio of 7 to 4 than that of the shortstyled in the midstyled form the stigma is placed rather above the middle of the corolla and nearly on a level with the midlength stamens in the other two forms its summit is a little bent upwards in the shortstyled form the pistil is as we have seen very short and differs from that in the other two forms in being straight it stands rather beneath the level of the anthers of the shortest stamens in the longstyled and midstyled forms the three anthers of each set of stamens more especially those of the shortest stamens are placed one beneath the other and the ends of the filaments are bowed a little upwards so that the pollen from all the anthers would be effectively brushed off by the proboscis of a visiting insect the relative diameters of the pollengrains after having been long soaked in water are given in table 4d as measured by my son francis  table 4d pontederia diameters of pollengrains after having been long soaked in water in divisions of the micrometer  column 1 source of pollengrains column 2 diameter  longstyled form midlength stamens average of 20 measurements 132 longstyled form shortest stamens 10 measurements 90  midstyled form longest stamens 15 measurements  164 midstyled form shortest stamens 20 measurements 91  shortstyled form longest stamens 20 measurements 146 shortstyled form midlength stamens 20 measurements 123  we have here the usual rule of the grains from the longer stamens the tubes of which have to penetrate the longer pistil being larger than those from the stamens of less length the extreme difference in diameter between the grains from the longest stamens of the midstyled form and from the shortest stamens of the longstyled is as 164 to 90 or as 100 to 55 and this is the greatest difference observed by me in any heterostyled plant it is a singular fact that the grains from the corresponding longest stamens in the two forms differ considerably in diameter as do those in a lesser degree from the corresponding midlength stamens in the two forms whilst those from the corresponding shortest stamens in the long and midstyled forms are almost exactly equal their inequality in the two first cases depends on the grains in both sets of anthers in the shortstyled form being smaller than those from the corresponding anthers in the other two forms and here we have a case parallel with that of the midstyled form of lythrum salicaria in this latter plant the pollengrains of the midstyled forms are of smaller size and have less fertilising power than the corresponding ones in the other two forms whilst the ovarium however fertilised yields a greater number of seeds so that the midstyled form is altogether more feminine in nature than the other two forms in the case of pontederia the ovarium includes only a single ovule and what the meaning of the difference in size between the pollengrains from the corresponding sets of anthers may be i will not pretend to conjecture  the clear evidence that the species just described is heterostyled and trimorphic is the more valuable as there is some doubt with respect to p cordata an inhabitant of the united states mr leggett suspects that it is either dimorphic or trimorphic for the pollengrains of the longer stamens are more than twice the diameter or than eight times the mass of the grains of the shorter stamens though minute these smaller grains seem as perfect as the larger ones 416 bulletin of the torrey botanical club 1875 volume 6 page 62 on the other hand he says that in all the mature flowers the style was as long at least as the longer stamens whilst in the young flowers it was intermediate in length between the two sets of stamens and if this be so the species can hardly be heterostyled   chapter v  illegitimate offspring of heterostyled plants  illegitimate offspring from all three forms of lythrum salicaria their dwarfed stature and sterility some utterly barren

equalstyled varieties of p veris transmission of form by pulmonaria and polygonum concluding remarks close parallelism between illegitimate fertilisation and hybridism  we have hitherto treated of the fertility of the flowers of heterostyled plants when legitimately and illegitimately fertilised the present chapter will be devoted to the character of their offspring or seedlings those raised from legitimately fertilised seeds will be here called legitimate seedlings or plants and those from illegitimately fertilised seeds illegitimate seedlings or plants they differ chiefly in their degree of fertility and in their powers of growth or vigour i will begin with trimorphic plants and i must remind the reader that each of the three forms can be fertilised in six different ways so that all three together can be fertilised in eighteen different ways for instance a longstyled form can be fertilised legitimately by the longest stamens of the midstyled and shortstyled forms and illegitimately by its own form and midlength and shortest stamens also by the midlength stamens of the midstyled and by the shortest stamens of the shortstyled form so that the longstyled can be fertilised legitimately in two ways and illegitimately in four ways the same holds good with respect to the midstyled and shortstyled forms therefore with trimorphic species six of the eighteen unions yield legitimate offspring and twelve yield illegitimate offspring  i will give the results of my experiments in detail partly because the observations are extremely troublesome and will not probably soon be repeated thus i was compelled to count under the microscope above 20000 seeds of lythrum salicariabut chiefly because light is thus indirectly thrown on the important subject of hybridism  lythrum salicaria  of the twelve illegitimate unions two were completely barren so that no seeds were obtained and of course no seedlings could be raised seedlings were however raised from seven of the ten remaining illegitimate unions such illegitimate seedlings when in flower were generally allowed to be freely and legitimately fertilised through the agency of bees by other illegitimate plants belonging to the two other forms growing close by this is the fairest plan and was usually followed but in several cases which will always be stated illegitimate plants were fertilised with pollen taken from legitimate plants belonging to the other two forms and this as might have been expected increased their fertility lythrum salicaria is much affected in its fertility by the nature of the season and to avoid error from this source as far as possible my observations were continued during several years some few experiments were tried in 1863 the summer of 1864 was too hot and dry and though the plants were copiously watered some few apparently suffered in their fertility whilst others were not in the least affected the years 1865 and especially 1866 were highly favourable only a few observations were made during 1867 the results are arranged in classes according to the parentage of the plants in each case the average number of seeds per capsule is given generally taken from ten capsules which according to my experience is a nearly sufficient number the maximum number of seeds in any one capsule is also given and this is a useful point of comparison with the normal standardthat is with the number of seeds produced by legitimate plants legitimately fertilised i will give likewise in each case the minimum number when the maximum and minimum differ greatly if no remark is made on the subject it may be understood that the extremes are so closely connected by intermediate figures that the average is a fair one large capsules were always selected for counting in order to avoid overestimating the infertility of the several illegitimate plants  in order to judge of the degree of inferiority in fertility of the several illegitimate plants the following statement of the average and of the maximum number of seeds produced by ordinary or legitimate plants when legitimately fertilised some artificially and some naturally will serve as a standard of comparison and may in each case be referred to but i give under each experiment the percentage of seeds produced by the illegitimate plants in comparison with the standard legitimate number of the same form for instance ten capsules from the illegitimate longstyled plant number 10 which was legitimately and naturally fertilised by other illegitimate plants contained on an average 442 seeds whereas the capsules on legitimate longstyled plants legitimately and naturally fertilised by other legitimate plants contained on an average 93 seeds therefore this illegitimate plant yielded only 47 per cent of the full and normal complement of seeds  standard number of seeds produced by legitimate plants of the three forms when legitimately fertilised  longstyled form average number of seeds in each capsule 93 maximum number observed out of twentythree capsules 159  midstyled form average number of seeds 130 maximum number observed out of thirtyone capsules 151  shortstyled form average number of seeds 835 but we may for the sake of brevity say 83 maximum number observed out of twentyfive capsules 112  classes 1 and 2 illegitimate plants raised from longstyled parents fertilised with pollen from the midlength or the shortest stamens of other plants of the same form  from this union i raised at different times three lots of illegitimate seedlings amounting altogether to 56 plants i must premise that from not foreseeing the result i did not keep a memorandum whether the eight plants of the first lot were the product of the midlength or shortest stamens of the same form but i have good reason to believe that they were the product of the latter these eight plants were much more dwarfed and much more sterile than those in the other two lots the latter were raised from a longstyled plant growing quite isolated and fertilised by the agency of bees with its own pollen and it is almost certain from the relative position of the organs of fructification that the stigma under these circumstances would receive pollen from the midlength stamens  all the fiftysix plants in these three lots proved longstyled now if the parentplants had been legitimately fertilised by pollen from the longest stamens of the midstyled and shortstyled forms only about onethird of the seedlings would have been longstyled the other twothirds being midstyled and shortstyled in some other trimorphic and dimorphic genera we shall find the same curious fact namely that the longstyled form fertilised illegitimately by its ownform pollen produces almost exclusively longstyled seedlings 51 hildebrand first called attention to this fact in the case of primula sinensis botanische zeitung january 1 1864 page 5 but his results were not nearly so uniform as mine  the eight plants of the first lot were of low stature three which i measured attained when fully grown the heights of only 28 29 and 47 inches whilst legitimate plants growing close by were double this height one being 77 inches they all betrayed in their general appearance a weak constitution they flowered rather later in the season and at a later age than ordinary plants some did not flower every year and one plant behaving in an unprecedented manner did not flower until three years old in the two other lots none of the plants grew quite to their full and proper height as could at once be seen by comparing them with the adjoining rows of legitimate plants in several plants in all three lots many of the anthers were either shrivelled or contained brown and tough or pulpy matter without any good pollengrains and they never shed their contents they were in the state designated by gartner as contabescent which term i will for the future use 52 beitrage zur kenntniss der befruchtung 1844 page 116 in one flower all the anthers were contabescent excepting two which appeared to the naked eye sound but under the microscope about twothirds of the pollengrains were seen to be small and shrivelled in another plant in which all the anthers appeared sound many of the pollen grains were shrivelled and of unequal sizes i counted the seeds produced by seven plants 1 to 7 in the first lot of eight plants probably the product of parents fertilised by their ownform shortest stamens and the seeds produced by three plants in the other two lots almost certainly the product of parents fertilised by their ownform midlength stamens  plant 1  this longstyled plant was allowed during 1863 to be freely and legitimately fertilised by an adjoining illegitimate midstyled plant but it did not yield a single seedcapsule it was then removed and planted in a remote place close to a brother longstyled plant number 2 so that it must have been freely though illegitimately fertilised under these circumstances it did not yield during 1864 and 1865 a single capsule i should here state that a legitimate or ordinary longstyled plant when growing isolated and freely though illegitimately fertilised by insects with its own pollen yielded an immense number of capsules which contained on an average 215 seeds  plant 2  this longstyled plant after flowering during 1863 close to an illegitimate midstyled plant produced less than twenty capsules which contained on an average between four and five seeds when subsequently growing in company with number 1 by which it will have been illegitimately fertilised it yielded in 1866 not a single capsule but in 1865 it yielded twentytwo capsules the best of these fifteen in number were examined eight contained no seed and the remaining seven contained on an average only three seeds and these seeds were so small and shrivelled that i doubt whether they would have germinated  plants 3 and 4  these two longstyled plants after being freely and legitimately fertilised during 1863 by the same illegitimate midstyled plant as in the last case were as miserably sterile as number 2  plant 5  this longstyled plant after flowering in 1863 close to an illegitimate mid styled plant yielded only four capsules which altogether included only five seeds during 1864 1865 and 1866 it was surrounded either by illegitimate or legitimate plants of the other two forms but it did not yield a single capsule it was a superfluous experiment but i likewise artificially fertilised in a legitimate manner twelve flowers but not one of these produced a capsule so that this plant was almost absolutely barren  plant 6  this longstyled plant after flowering during the favourable year of 1866 surrounded by illegitimate plants of the other two forms did not produce a single capsule  plant 7  this longstyled plant was the most fertile of the eight plants of the first lot during 1865 it was surrounded by illegitimate plants of various parentage many of which were highly fertile and must thus have been legitimately fertilised it produced a good many capsules ten of which yielded an average of 361 seeds with a maximum of 47 and a minimum of 22 so that this plant produced 39 per cent of the full number of seeds during 1864 it was surrounded by legitimate and illegitimate plants of the other two forms and nine capsules one poor one being rejected yielded an average of 419 seeds with a maximum of 56 and a minimum of 28 so that under these favourable circumstances this plant the most fertile of the first lot did not yield when legitimately fertilised quite 45 per cent of the full complement of seeds  in the second lot of plants in the present class descended from the longstyled form almost certainly fertilised with pollen from its own midlength stamens the plants as already stated were not nearly so dwarfed or so sterile as in the first lot all produced plenty of capsules i counted the number of seeds in only three plants namely numbers 8 9 and 10  plant 8  this plant was allowed to be freely fertilised in 1864 by legitimate and illegitimate plants of the other two forms and ten capsules yielded on an average 411 seeds with a maximum of 73 and a minimum of 11 hence this plant produced only 44 per cent of the full complement of seeds  plant 9  this longstyled plant was allowed in 1865 to be freely fertilised by illegitimate plants of the other two forms most of which were moderately fertile fifteen capsules yielded on an average 571 seeds with a maximum of 86 and a minimum of 23 hence the plant yielded 61 per cent of the full complement of seeds  plant 10  this longstyled plant was freely fertilised at the same time and in the same manner as the last ten capsules yielded an average of 442 seeds with a maximum of 69 and a minimum of 25 hence this plant yielded 47 per cent of the full complement of seeds  the nineteen longstyled plants of the third lot of the same parentage as the last lot were treated differently for they flowered during 1867 by themselves so that they must have been illegitimately fertilised by one another it has already been stated that a legitimate longstyled plant growing by itself and visited by insects yielded an average of 215 seeds per capsule with a maximum of 35 but to judge fairly of its fertility it ought to have been observed during successive seasons we may also infer from analogy that if several legitimate longstyled plants were to fertilise one another the average number of seeds would be increased but how much increased i do not know hence i have no perfectly fair standard of comparison by which to judge of the fertility of the three following plants of the present lot the seeds of which i counted  plant 11  this longstyled plant produced a large crop of capsules and in this respect was one of the most fertile of the whole lot of nineteen plants but the average from ten capsules was only 359 seeds with a maximum of 60 and a minimum of 8  plant 12  this longstyled plant produced very few capsules and ten yielded an average of only 154 seeds with a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 4  plant 13  this plant offers an anomalous case it flowered profusely yet produced very few capsules but these contained numerous seeds ten capsules yielded an average of 719 seeds with a maximum of 95 and a minimum of 29 considering that this plant was illegitimate and illegitimately fertilised by its brother longstyled seedlings the average and the maximum are so remarkably high that i cannot at all understand the case we should remember that the average for a legitimate plant legitimately fertilised is 93 seeds  class 3 illegitimate plants raised from a shortstyled parent fertilised with pollen from ownform midlength stamens  i raised from this union nine plants of which eight were shortstyled and one longstyled so that there seems to be a strong tendency in this form to reproduce when selffertilised the parentform but the tendency is not so strong as with the longstyled these nine plants never attained the full height of legitimate plants growing close to them the anthers were contabescent in many of the flowers on several plants  plant 14  this shortstyled plant was allowed during 1865 to be freely and legitimately fertilised by illegitimate plants descended from selffertilised mid long and shortstyled plants fifteen capsules yielded an average of 283 seeds with a maximum of 51 and a minimum of 11 hence this plant produced only 33 per cent of the proper number of seeds the seeds themselves were small and irregular in shape although so sterile on the female side none of the anthers were contabescent  plant 15  this shortstyled plant treated like the last during the same year yielded an average from fifteen capsules of 27 seeds with a maximum of 49 and a minimum of 7 but two poor capsules may be rejected and then the average rises to 326 with the same maximum of 49 and a minimum of 20 so that this plant attained 38 per cent of the normal standard of fertility and was rather more fertile than the last yet many of the anthers were contabescent  plant 16  this shortstyled plant treated like the two last yielded from ten capsules an average of 778 seeds with a maximum of 97 and a minimum of 60 so that this plant produced 94 per cent of the full number of seeds  plant 17  this the one longstyled plant of the same parentage as the last three plants when freely and legitimately fertilised in the same manner as the last yielded an average from ten capsules of 763 rather poor seeds with a maximum of 88 and a minimum of 57 hence this plant produced 82 per cent of the proper number of seeds twelve flowers enclosed in a net were artificially and legitimately fertilised with pollen from a legitimate shortstyled plant and nine capsules yielded an average of 825 seeds with a maximum of 98 and a minimum of 51 so that its fertility was increased by the action of pollen from a legitimate plant but still did not reach the normal standard  class 4 illegitimate plants raised from a midstyled parent fertilised with pollen from ownform longest stamens  after two trials i succeeded in raising only four plants from this illegitimate union these proved to be three midstyled and one longstyled but from so small a number we can hardly judge of the tendency in midstyled plants when selffertilised to reproduce the same form these four plants never attained their full and normal height the longstyled plant had several of its anthers contabescent  plant 18  this midstyled plant when freely and legitimately fertilised during 1865 by illegitimate plants descended from selffertilised long short and midstyled plants yielded an average from ten capsules of 1026 seeds with a maximum of 131 and a minimum of 63 hence this plant did not produce quite 80 per cent of the normal number of seeds twelve flowers were artificially and legitimately fertilised with pollen from a legitimate longstyled plant and yielded from nine capsules an average of 1161 seeds which were finer than in the previous case with a maximum of 135 and a minimum of 75 so that as with plant 17 pollen from a legitimate plant increased the fertility but did not bring it up to the full standard  plant 19  this midstyled plant fertilised in the same manner and at the same period as the last yielded an average from ten capsules of 734 seeds with a maximum of 87 and a minimum of 64 hence this plant produced only 56 per cent of the full number of seeds thirteen flowers were artificially and legitimately fertilised with pollen from a legitimate longstyled plant and yielded ten capsules with an average of 956 seeds so that the application of pollen from a legitimate plant added as in the two previous cases to the fertility but did not bring it up to the proper standard  plant 20  this longstyled plant of the same parentage with the two last midstyled plants and freely fertilised in the same manner yielded an average from ten capsules of 696 seeds with a maximum of 83 and a minimum of 52 hence this plant produced 75 per cent of the full number of seeds  class 5 illegitimate plants raised from a shortstyled parent fertilised with pollen from the midlength stamens of the longstyled form  in the four previous classes plants raised from the three forms fertilised with pollen from either the longer or shorter stamens of the same form but generally not from the same plant have been described six other illegitimate unions are possible namely between the three forms and the stamens in the other two forms which do not correspond in height with their pistils but i succeeded in raising plants from only three of these six unions from one of them forming the present class 5 twelve plants were raised these consisted of eight short styled and four longstyled plants with not one midstyled these twelve plants never attained quite their full and proper height but by no means deserved to be called dwarfs the anthers in some of the flowers were contabescent one plant was remarkable from all the longer stamens in every flower and from many of the shorter ones having their anthers in this condition the pollen of four other plants in which none of the anthers were contabescent was examined in one a moderate number of grains were minute and shrivelled but in the other three they appeared perfectly sound with respect to the power of producing seed five plants numbers 21 to 25 were observed one yielded scarcely more than half the normal number a second was slightly infertile but the three others actually produced a larger average number of seeds with a higher maximum than the standard in my concluding remarks i shall recur to this fact which at first appears inexplicable  plant 21  this shortstyled plant freely and legitimately fertilised during 1865 by illegitimate plants descended from selffertilised long mid and shortstyled parents yielded an average from ten capsules of 43 seeds with a maximum of 63 and a minimum of 26 hence this plant which was the one with all its longer and many of its shorter stamens contabescent produced only 52 per cent of the proper number of seeds  plant 22  this shortstyled plant produced perfectly sound pollen as viewed under the microscope during 1866 it was freely and legitimately fertilised by other illegitimate plants belonging to the present and the following class both of which include many highly fertile plants under these circumstances it yielded from eight capsules an average of 1005 seeds with a maximum of 123 and a minimum of 86 so that it produced 121 per cent of seeds in comparison with the normal standard during 1864 it was allowed to be freely and legitimately fertilised by legitimate and illegitimate plants and yielded an average from eight capsules of 1042 seeds with a maximum of 125 and a minimum of 90 consequently it exceeded the normal standard producing 125 per cent of seeds in this case as in some previous cases pollen from legitimate plants added in a small degree to the fertility of the plant and the fertility would perhaps have been still greater had not the summer of 1864 been very hot and certainly unfavourable to some of the plants of lythrum  plant 23  this shortstyled plant produced perfectly sound pollen during 1866 it was freely and legitimately fertilised by the other illegitimate plants specified under the last experiment and eight capsules yielded an average of 1135 seeds with a maximum of 123 and a minimum of 93 hence this plant exceeded the normal standard producing no less than 136 per cent of seeds  plant 24  this longstyled plant produced pollen which seemed under the microscope sound but some of the grains did not swell when placed in water during 1864 it was legitimately fertilised by legitimate and illegitimate plants in the same manner as plant 22 but yielded an average from ten capsules of only 55 seeds with a maximum of 88 and a minimum of 24 thus attaining 59 per cent of the normal fertility this low degree of fertility i presume was owing to the unfavourable season for during 1866 when legitimately fertilised by illegitimate plants in the manner described under number 22 it yielded an average from eight capsules of 82 seeds with a maximum of 120 and a minimum of 67 thus producing 88 per cent of the normal number of seeds  plant 25  the pollen of this longstyled plant contained a moderate number of poor and shrivelled grains and this is a surprising circumstance as it yielded an extraordinary number of seeds during 1866 it was freely and legitimately fertilised by illegitimate plants as described under number 22 and yielded an average from eight capsules of 1225 seeds with a maximum of 149 and a minimum of 84 hence this plant exceeded the normal standard producing no less than 131 per cent of seeds  class 6 illegitimate plants raised from midstyled parents fertilised with pollen from the shortest stamens of the longstyled form  i raised from this union twentyfive plants which proved to be seventeen long styled and eight midstyled but not one shortstyled none of these plants were in the least dwarfed i examined during the highly favourable season of 1866 the pollen of four plants in one midstyled plant some of the anthers of the longest stamens were contabescent but the pollengrains in the other anthers were mostly sound as they were in all the anthers of the shortest stamens in two other midstyled and in one longstyled plant many of the pollengrains were small and shrivelled and in the latter plant as many as a fifth or sixth part appeared to be in this state i counted the seeds in five plants numbers 26 to 30 of which two were moderately sterile and three fully fertile  plant 26  this midstyled plant was freely and legitimately fertilised during the rather unfavourable year 1864 by numerous surrounding legitimate and illegitimate plants it yielded an average from ten capsules of 835 seeds with a maximum of 110 and a minimum of 64 thus attaining 64 per cent of the normal fertility during the highly favourable year 1866 it was freely and legitimately fertilised by illegitimate plants belonging to the present class and to class 5 and yielded an average from eight capsules of 86 seeds with a maximum of 109 and a minimum of 61 and thus attained 66 per cent of the normal fertility this was the plant with some of the anthers of the longest stamens contabescent as above mentioned  plant 27  this midstyled plant fertilised during 1864 in the same manner as the last yielded an average from ten capsules of 994 seeds with a maximum of 122 and a minimum of 53 thus attaining to 76 per cent of the normal fertility if the season had been more favourable its fertility would probably have been somewhat greater but judging from the last experiment only in a slight degree  plant 28  this midstyled plant when legitimately fertilised during the favourable season of 1866 in the manner described under number 26 yielded an average from eight capsules of 89 seeds with a maximum of 119 and a minimum of 69 thus producing 68 per cent of the full number of seeds in the pollen of both sets of anthers nearly as many grains were small and shrivelled as sound  plant 29  this longstyled plant was legitimately fertilised during the unfavourable season of 1864 in the manner described under number 26 and yielded an average from ten capsules of 846 seeds with a maximum of 132 and a minimum of 47 thus attaining to 91 per cent of the normal fertility during the highly favourable season of 1866 when fertilised in the manner described under number 26 it yielded an average from nine capsules one poor capsule having been excluded of 100 seeds with a maximum of 121 and a minimum of 77 this plant thus exceeded the normal standard and produced 107 per cent of seeds in both sets of anthers there were a good many bad and shrivelled pollengrains but not so many as in the lastdescribed plant  plant 30  this longstyled plant was legitimately fertilised during 1866 in the manner described under number 26 and yielded an average from eight capsules of 94 seeds with a maximum of 106 and a minimum of 66 so that it exceeded the normal standard yielding 101 per cent of seeds  plant 31  some flowers on this longstyled plant were artificially and legitimately fertilised by one of its brother illegitimate midstyled plants and five capsules yielded an average of 906 seeds with a maximum of 97 and a minimum of 79 hence as far as can be judged from so few capsules this plant attained under these favourable circumstances 98 per cent of the normal standard  class 7 illegitimate plants raised from midstyled parents fertilised with pollen from the longest stamens of the shortstyled form  it was shown in the last chapter that the union from which these illegitimate plants were raised is far more fertile than any other illegitimate union for the midstyled parent when thus fertilised yielded an average all very poor capsules being excluded of 1028 seeds with a maximum of 130 and the seedlings in the present class likewise have their fertility not at all lessened forty plants were raised and these attained their full height and were covered with seedcapsules nor did i observe any contabescent anthers it deserves also particular notice that these plants differently from what occurred in any of the previous classes consisted of all three forms namely eighteen shortstyled fourteen longstyled and eight midstyled plants as these plants were so fertile i counted the seeds only in the two following cases  plant 32  this midstyled plant was freely and legitimately fertilised during the unfavourable year of 1864 by numerous surrounding legitimate and illegitimate plants eight capsules yielded an average of 1272 seeds with a maximum of 144 and a minimum of 96 so that this plant attained 98 per cent of the normal standard  plant 33  this shortstyled plant was fertilised in the same manner and at the same time with the last and ten capsules yielded an average of 1139 with a maximum of 137 and a minimum of 90 hence this plant produced no less than 137 per cent of seeds in comparison with the normal standard  concluding remarks on the illegitimate offspring of the three forms of lythrum salicaria  from the three forms occurring in approximately equal numbers in a state of nature and from the results of sowing seed naturally produced there is reason to believe that each form when legitimately fertilised reproduces all three forms in about equal numbers now we have seen and the fact is a very singular one that the fiftysix plants produced from the longstyled form illegitimately fertilised with pollen from the same form class 1 and 2 were all longstyled the shortstyled form when selffertilised class 3 produced eight shortstyled and one longstyled plant and the midstyled form similarly treated class 4 produced three midstyled and one longstyled offspring so that these two forms when illegitimately fertilised with pollen from the same form evince a strong but not exclusive tendency to reproduce the parentform when the shortstyled form was illegitimately fertilised by the longstyled form class 5 and again when the midstyled was illegitimately fertilised by the longstyled class 6 in each case the two parentforms alone were reproduced as thirtyseven plants were raised from these two unions we may with much confidence believe that it is the rule that plants thus derived usually consist of both parentforms but not of the third form when however the midstyled form was illegitimately fertilised by the longest stamens of the shortstyled class 7 the same rule did not hold good for the seedlings consisted of all three forms the illegitimate union from which these latter seedlings were raised is as previously stated singularly fertile and the seedlings themselves exhibited no signs of sterility and grew to their full height from the consideration of these several facts and from analogous ones to be given under oxalis it seems probable that in a state of nature the pistil of each form usually receives through the agency of insects pollen from the stamens of corresponding height from both the other forms but the case last given shows that the application of two kinds of pollen is not indispensable for the production of all three forms hildebrand has suggested that the cause of all three forms being regularly and naturally reproduced may be that some of the flowers are fertilised with one kind of pollen and others on the same plant with the other kind of pollen finally of the three forms the longstyled evinces somewhat the strongest tendency to reappear amongst the offspring whether both or one or neither of the parents are longstyled  table 530 tabulated results of the fertility of the foregoing illegitimate plants when legitimately fertilised generally by

plants is in many respects a highly remarkable phenomenon thirtythree plants in the seven classes were subjected to various trials and the seeds carefully counted some of them were artificially fertilised but the far greater number were freely fertilised and this is the better and natural plan through the agency of insects by other illegitimate plants in the right hand or percentage column in table 530 a wide difference in fertility between the plants in the first four and the last three classes may be perceived in the first four classes the plants are descended from the three forms illegitimately fertilised with pollen taken from the same form but only rarely from the same plant it is necessary to observe this latter circumstance for as i have elsewhere shown most plants when fertilised with their own pollen or that from the same plant are in some degree sterile and the seedlings raised from such unions are likewise in some degree sterile dwarfed and feeble 53 the effects of cross and self fertilisation in the vegetable kingdom 1876 none of the nineteen illegitimate plants in the first four classes were completely fertile one however was nearly so yielding 96 per cent of the proper number of seeds from this high degree of fertility we have many descending gradations till we reach an absolute zero when the plants though bearing many flowers did not produce during successive years a single seed or even seedcapsule some of the most sterile plants did not even yield a single seed when legitimately fertilised with pollen from legitimate plants there is good reason to believe that the first seven plants in class 1 and 2 were the offspring of a longstyled plant fertilised with pollen from its ownform shortest stamens and these plants were the most sterile of all the remaining plants in class 1 and 2 were almost certainly the product of pollen from the midlength stamens and although very sterile they were less so than the first set none of the plants in the first four classes attained their full and proper stature the first seven which were the most sterile of all as already stated were by far the most dwarfed several of them never reaching to half their proper height these same plants did not flower at so early an age or at so early a period in the season as they ought to have done the anthers in many of their flowers and in the flowers of some other plants in the first six classes were either contabescent or included numerous small and shrivelled pollengrains as the suspicion at one time occurred to me that the lessened fertility of the illegitimate plants might be due to the pollen alone having been affected i may remark that this certainly was not the case for several of them when fertilised by sound pollen from legitimate plants did not yield the full complement of seeds hence it is certain that both the female and male reproductive organs were affected in each of the seven classes the plants though descended from the same parents sown at the same time and in the same soil differed much in their average degree of fertility  turning now to the fifth sixth and seventh classes and looking to the right hand column of table 530 we find nearly as many plants with a percentage of seeds above the normal standard as beneath it as with most plants the number of seeds produced varies much it might be thought that the present case was one merely of variability but this view must be rejected as far as the less fertile plants in these three classes are concerned first because none of the plants in class 5 attained their proper height which shows that they were in some manner affected and secondly because many of the plants in classes 5 and 6 produced anthers which were either contabescent or included small and shrivelled pollengrains and as in these cases the male organs were manifestly deteriorated it is by far the most probable conclusion that the female organs were in some cases likewise affected and that this was the cause of the reduced number of seeds  with respect to the six plants in these three classes which yielded a very high percentage of seeds the thought naturally arises that the normal standard of fertility for the longstyled and shortstyled forms with which alone we are here concerned may have been fixed too low and that the six legitimate plants are merely fully fertile the standard for the longstyled form was deduced by counting the seeds in twentythree capsules and for the shortstyled form from twentyfive capsules i do not pretend that this is a sufficient number of capsules for absolute accuracy but my experience has led me to believe that a very fair result may thus be gained as however the maximum number observed in the twentyfive capsules of the shortstyled form was low the standard in this case may possibly be not quite high enough but it should be observed in the case of the illegitimate plants that in order to avoid overestimating their infertility ten very fine capsules were always selected and the years 1865 and 1866 during which the plants in the three latter classes were experimented on were highly favourable for seedproduction now if this plan of selecting very fine capsules during favourable seasons had been followed for obtaining the normal standards instead of taking during various seasons the first capsules which came to hand the standards would undoubtedly have been considerably higher and thus the fact of the six foregoing plants appearing to yield an unnaturally high percentage of seeds may perhaps be explained on this view these plants are in fact merely fully fertile and not fertile to an abnormal degree nevertheless as characters of all kinds are liable to variation especially with organisms unnaturally treated and as in the four first and more sterile classes the plants derived from the same parents and treated in the same manner certainly did vary much in sterility it is possible that certain plants in the latter and more fertile classes may have varied so as to have acquired an abnormal degree of fertility but it should be noticed that if my standards err in being too low the sterility of all the many sterile plants in the several classes will have to be estimated by so much the higher finally we see that the illegitimate plants in the four first classes are all more or less sterile some being absolutely barren with one alone almost completely fertile in the three latter classes some of the plants are moderately sterile whilst others are fully fertile or possibly fertile in excess  the last point which need here be noticed is that as far as the means of comparison serve some degree of relationship generally exists between the infertility of the illegitimate union of the several parentforms and that of their illegitimate offspring thus the two illegitimate unions from which the plants in classes 6 and 7 were derived yielded a fair amount of seed and only a few of these plants are in any degree sterile on the other hand the illegitimate unions between plants of the same form always yield very few seeds and their seedlings are very sterile longstyled parentplants when fertilised with pollen from their ownform shortest stamens appear to be rather more sterile than when fertilised with their ownform midlength stamens and the seedlings from the former union were much more sterile than those from the latter union in opposition to this relationship shortstyled plants illegitimately fertilised with pollen from the midlength stamens of the long styled form class 5 are very sterile whereas some of the offspring raised from this union were far from being highly sterile it may be added that there is a tolerably close parallelism in all the classes between the degree of sterility of the plants and their dwarfed stature as previously stated an illegitimate plant fertilised with pollen from a legitimate plant has its fertility slightly increased the importance of the several foregoing conclusions will be apparent at the close of this chapter when the illegitimate unions between the forms of the same species and their illegitimate offspring are compared with the hybrid unions of distinct species and their hybrid offspring  oxalis  no one has compared the legitimate and illegitimate offspring of any trimorphic species in this genus hildebrand sowed illegitimately fertilised seeds of oxalis valdiviana but they did not germinate 54 botanische zeitung 1871 page 433 footnote and this fact as he remarks supports my view that an illegitimate union resembles a hybrid one between two distinct species for the seeds in this latter case are often incapable of germination  the following observations relate to the nature of the forms which appear among the legitimate seedlings of oxalis valdiviana hildebrand raised as described in the paper just referred to 211 seedlings from all six legitimate unions and the three forms appeared among the offspring from each union for instance longstyled plants were legitimately fertilised with pollen from the longest stamens of the midstyled form and the seedlings consisted of 15 longstyled 18 midstyled and 6 shortstyled we here see that a few shortstyled plants were produced though neither parent was shortstyled and so it was with the other legitimate unions out of the above 211 seedlings 173 belonged to the same two forms as their parents and only 38 belonged to the third form distinct from either parent in the case of o regnelli the result as observed by hildebrand was nearly the same but more striking all the offspring from four of the legitimate unions consisted of the two parentforms whilst amongst the seedlings from the other two legitimate unions the third form appeared thus of the 43 seedlings from the six legitimate unions 35 belonged to the same two forms as their parents and only 8 to the third form fritz muller also raised in brazil seedlings from longstyled plants of o regnelli legitimately fertilised with pollen from the longest stamens of the midstyled form and all these belonged to the two parentforms 55 jenaische zeitschrift etc band 6 1871 page 75 lastly seedlings were raised by me from longstyled plants of o speciosa legitimately fertilised by the shortstyled form and from the latter reciprocally fertilised by the longstyled and these consisted of 33 longstyled and 26 shortstyled plants with not one midstyled form there can therefore be no doubt that the legitimate offspring from any two forms of oxalis tend to belong to the same two forms as their parents but that a few seedlings belonging to the third form occasionally make their appearance and this latter fact as hildebrand remarks may be attributed to atavism as some of their progenitors will almost certainly have belonged to the third form  when however any one form of oxalis is fertilised illegitimately with pollen from the same form the seedlings appear to belong invariably to this form thus hildebrand states that longstyled plants of o rosea growing by themselves have been propagated in germany year after year by seed and have always produced longstyled plants 56 ueber den trimorphismus in der gattung oxalis monatsberichte der akad der wissen zu berlin 21 june 1866 page 373 and botanische zeitung 1871 page 435 again 17 seedlings were raised from mid styled plants of o hedysaroides growing by themselves and these were all mid styled so that the forms of oxalis when illegitimately fertilised with their own pollen behave like the longstyled form of lythrum salicaria which when thus fertilised always produced with me longstyled offspring  primula  primula sinensis  i raised during february 1862 from some longstyled plants illegitimately fertilised with pollen from the same form twentyseven seedlings these were all longstyled they proved fully fertile or even fertile in excess for ten flowers fertilised with pollen from other plants of the same lot yielded nine capsules containing on an average 3975 seeds with a maximum in one capsule of 66 seeds four other flowers legitimately crossed with pollen from a legitimate plant and four flowers on the latter crossed with pollen from the illegitimate seedlings yielded seven capsules with an average of 53 seeds with a maximum of 72 i must here state that i have found some difficulty in estimating the normal standard of fertility for the several unions of this species as the results differ much during successive years and the seeds vary so greatly in size that it is hard to decide which ought to be considered good in order to avoid over estimating the infertility of the several illegitimate unions i have taken the normal standard as low as possible  from the foregoing twentyseven illegitimate plants fertilised with their own form pollen twentyfive seedling grandchildren were raised and these were all longstyled so that from the two illegitimate generations fiftytwo plants were raised and all without exception proved longstyled these grandchildren grew vigorously and soon exceeded in height two other lots of illegitimate seedlings of different parentage and one lot of equalstyled seedlings presently to be described hence i expected that they would have turned out highly ornamental plants but when they flowered they seemed as my gardener remarked to have gone back to the wild state for the petals were palecoloured narrow sometimes not touching each other flat generally deeply notched in the middle but not flexuous on the margin and with the yellow eye or centre conspicuous altogether these flowers were strikingly different from those of their progenitors and this i think can only be accounted for on the principle of reversion most of the anthers on one plant were contabescent seventeen flowers on the grandchildren were illegitimately fertilised with pollen taken from other seedlings of the same lot and produced fourteen capsules containing on an average 292 seeds but they ought to have contained about 35 seeds fifteen flowers legitimately fertilised with pollen from an illegitimate shortstyled plant belonging to the lot next to be described produced fourteen capsules containing an average of 46 seeds they ought to have contained at least 50 seeds hence these grandchildren of illegitimate descent appear to have lost though only in a very slight degree their full fertility  we will now turn to the shortstyled form from a plant of this kind fertilised with its ownform pollen i raised during february 1862 eight seedlings seven of which were shortstyled and one longstyled they grew slowly and never attained to the full stature of ordinary plants some of them flowered precociously and others late in the season four flowers on these shortstyled seedlings and four on the one longstyled seedling were illegitimately fertilised with their ownform pollen and produced only three capsules containing on an average 236 seeds with a maximum of 29 but we cannot judge of their fertility from so few capsules and i have greater doubts about the normal standard for this union than about any other but i believe that rather above 25 seeds would be a fair estimate eight flowers on these same short styled plants and the one longstyled illegitimate plant were reciprocally and legitimately crossed they produced five capsules which contained an average of 286 seeds with a maximum of 36 a reciprocal cross between legitimate plants of the two forms would have yielded an average of at least 57 seeds with a possible maximum of 74 seeds so that these illegitimate plants were sterile when legitimately crossed  i succeeded in raising from the above seven shortstyled illegitimate plants fertilised with their ownform pollen only six plantsgrandchildren of the first union these like their parents were of low stature and had so poor a constitution that four died before flowering with ordinary plants it has been a rare event with me to have more than a single plant die out of a large lot the two grandchildren which lived and flowered were shortstyled and twelve of their flowers were fertilised with their ownform pollen and produced twelve capsules containing an average of 282 seeds so that these two plants though belonging to so weakly a set were rather more fertile than their parents and perhaps not in any degree sterile four flowers on the same two grandchildren were legitimately fertilised by a longstyled illegitimate plant and produced four capsules containing only 322 seeds instead of about 64 seeds which is the normal average for legitimate shortstyled plants legitimately crossed  by looking back it will be seen that i raised at first from a shortstyled plant fertilised with its ownform pollen one longstyled and seven shortstyled illegitimate seedlings these seedlings were legitimately intercrossed and from their seed fifteen plants were raised grandchildren of the first illegitimate union and to my surprise all proved shortstyled twelve shortstyled flowers borne by these grandchildren were illegitimately fertilised with pollen taken from other plants of the same lot and produced eight capsules which contained an average of 218 seeds with a maximum of 35 these figures are rather below the normal standard for such a union six flowers were also legitimately fertilised with pollen from an illegitimate longstyled plant and produced only three capsules containing on an average 236 seeds with a maximum of 35 such a union in the case of a legitimate plant ought to have yielded an average of 64 seeds with a possible maximum of 73 seeds  summary on the transmission of form constitution and fertility of the illegitimate offspring of primula sinensis  in regard to the longstyled plants their illegitimate offspring of which fiftytwo were raised in the course of two generations were all longstyled 57 dr hildebrand who first called attention to this subject botanische zeitung 1864 page 5 raised from a similar illegitimate union seventeen plants of which fourteen were longstyled and three shortstyled from a shortstyled plant illegitimately fertilised with its own pollen he raised fourteen plants of which eleven were shortstyled and three longstyled these plants grew vigorously but the flowers in one instance were small appearing as if they had reverted to the wild state in the first illegitimate generation they were perfectly fertile and in the second their fertility was only very slightly impaired with respect to the shortstyled plants twentyfour out of twenty five of their illegitimate offspring were shortstyled they were dwarfed in stature and one lot of grandchildren had so poor a constitution that four out of six plants perished before flowering the two survivors when illegitimately fertilised with their ownform pollen were rather less fertile than they ought to have been but their loss of fertility was clearly shown in a special and unexpected manner namely when legitimately fertilised by other illegitimate plants thus altogether eighteen flowers were fertilised in this manner and yielded twelve capsules which included on an average only 285 seeds with a maximum of 45 now a legitimate shortstyled plant would have yielded when legitimately fertilised an average of 64 seeds with a possible maximum of 74 this particular kind of infertility will perhaps be best appreciated by a simile we may assume that with mankind six children would be born on an average from an ordinary marriage but that only three would be born from an incestuous marriage according to the analogy of primula sinensis the children of such incestuous marriages if they continued to marry incestuously would have their sterility only slightly increased but their fertility would not be restored by a proper marriage for if two children both of incestuous origin but in no degree related to each other were to marry the marriage would of course be strictly legitimate nevertheless they would not give birth to more than half the full and proper number of children  equalstyled variety of primula sinensis  as any variation in the structure of the reproductive organs combined with changed function is a rare event the following cases are worth giving in detail my attention was first called to the subject by observing in 1862 a longstyled plant descended from a selffertilised longstyled parent which had some of its flowers in an anomalous state namely with the stamens placed low down in the corolla as in the ordinary longstyled form but with the pistils so short that the stigmas stood on a level with the anthers these stigmas were nearly as globular and as smooth as in the shortstyled form instead of being elongated and rough as in the longstyled form here then we have combined in the same flower the short stamens of the longstyled form with a pistil closely resembling that of the shortstyled form but the structure varied much even on the same umbel for in two flowers the pistil was intermediate in length between that of the long and that of the shortstyled form with the stigma elongated as in the former and smooth as in the latter and in three other flowers the structure was in all respects like that of the longstyled form these modifications appeared to me so remarkable that i fertilised eight of the flowers with their own pollen and obtained five capsules which contained on an average 43 seeds and this number shows that the flowers had become abnormally fertile in comparison with those of ordinary long styled plants when selffertilised i was thus led to examine the plants in several small collections and the result showed that the equalstyled variety was not rare  table 531 primula sinensis preponderance of longstyled over the shortstyled form  column 1 name of owner or place column 2 longstyled form column 3 shortstyled form column 4 equalstyled variety  mr horwood  0  0  17 mr duck  20  0  9 baston

forms would no doubt occur in nearly equal numbers as i infer from the analogy of the other heterostyled species of primula and from having raised the two forms of the present species in exactly the same number from flowers which had been legitimately crossed the preponderance in table 531 of the longstyled form over the shortstyled in the proportion of 134 to 51 results from gardeners generally collecting seed from selffertilised flowers and the longstyled flowers produce spontaneously much more seed as shown in the first chapter than the shortstyled owing to the anthers of the longstyled form being placed low down in the corolla so that when the flowers fall off the anthers are dragged over the stigma and we now also know that longstyled plants when selffertilised very generally reproduce longstyled offspring from the consideration of this table it occurred to me in the year 1862 that almost all the plants of the chinese primrose cultivated in england would sooner or later become longstyled or equalstyled and now at the close of 1876 i have had five small collections of plants examined and almost all consisted of longstyled with some more or less wellcharacterised equalstyled plants but with not one shortstyled  with respect to the equalstyled plants in the table mr horwood raised from purchased seeds four plants which he remembered were certainly not longstyled but either short or equalstyled probably the latter these four plants were kept separate and allowed to fertilise themselves from their seed the seventeen plants in the table were raised all of which proved equalstyled the stamens stood low down in the corolla as in the longstyled form and the stigmas which were globular and smooth were either completely surrounded by the anthers or stood close above them my son william made drawings for me by the aid of the camera of the pollen of one of the above equalstyled plants and in accordance with the position of the stamens the grains resembled in their small size those of the longstyled form he also examined pollen from two equal styled plants at southampton and in both of them the grains differed extremely in size in the same anthers a large number being small and shrivelled whilst many were fully as large as those of the shortstyled form and rather more globular it is probable that the large size of these grains was due not to their having assumed the character of the shortstyled form but to monstrosity for max wichura has observed pollengrains of monstrous size in certain hybrids the vast number of the small shrivelled grains in the above two cases explains the fact that though equalstyled plants are generally fertile in a high degree yet some of them yield few seeds i may add that my son compared in 1875 the grains from two whiteflowered plants in both of which the pistil projected above the anthers but neither were properly longstyled or equal styled and in the one in which the stigma projected most the grains were in diameter to those in the other plant in which the stigma projected less as 100 to 88 whereas the difference between the grains from perfectly characterised longstyled and shortstyled plants is as 100 to 57 so that these two plants were in an intermediate condition to return to the 17 plants in the first line of table 531 from the relative position of their stigmas and anthers they could hardly fail to fertilise themselves and accordingly four of them spontaneously yielded no less than 180 capsules of these mr horwood selected eight fine capsules for sowing and they included on an average 548 seeds with a maximum of 72 he gave me thirty other capsules taken by hazard of which twentyseven contained good seeds averaging 355 with a maximum of 70 but if six poor capsules each with less than 13 seeds be excluded the average rises to 425 these are higher numbers than could be expected from either well characterised form if selffertilised and this high degree of fertility accords with the view that the male organs belonged to one form and the female organs partially to the other form so that a selfunion in the case of the equal styled variety is in fact a legitimate union  the seed saved from the above seventeen selffertilised equalstyled plants produced sixteen plants which all proved equalstyled and resembled their parents in all the abovespecified respects the stamens however in one plant were seated higher up the tube of the corolla than in the true longstyled form in another plant almost all the anthers were contabescent these sixteen plants were the grandchildren of the four original plants which it is believed were equalstyled so that this abnormal condition was faithfully transmitted probably through three and certainly through two generations the fertility of one of these grandchildren was carefully observed six flowers were fertilised with pollen from the same flower and produced six capsules containing on an average 68 seeds with a maximum of 82 and a minimum of 40 thirteen capsules spontaneously selffertilised yielded an average of 532 seeds with the astonishing maximum in one of 97 seeds in no legitimate union has so high an average as 68 seeds been observed by me or nearly so high a maximum as 82 and 97 these plants therefore not only have lost their proper heterostyled structure and peculiar functional powers but have acquired an abnormal grade of fertilityunless indeed their high fertility may be accounted for by the stigmas receiving pollen from the circumjacent anthers at exactly the most favourable period  with respect to mr ducks lot in table 531 seed was saved from a single plant of which the form was not observed and this produced nine equalstyled and twenty longstyled plants the equalstyled resembled in all respects those previously described and eight of their capsules spontaneously selffertilised contained on an average 444 seeds with a maximum of 61 and a minimum of 23 in regard to the twenty longstyled plants the pistil in some of the flowers did not project quite so high as in ordinary longstyled flowers and the stigmas though properly elongated were smooth so that we have here a slight approach in structure to the pistil of the shortstyled form some of these longstyled plants also approached the equalstyled in function for one of them produced no less than fifteen spontaneously selffertilised capsules and of these eight contained on an average 317 seeds with a maximum of 61 this average would be rather low for a longstyled plant artificially fertilised with its own pollen but is high for one spontaneously selffertilised for instance thirty four capsules produced by the illegitimate grandchildren of a longstyled plant spontaneously selffertilised contained on an average only 91 seeds with a maximum of 46 some seeds indiscriminately saved from the foregoing twentynine equalstyled and longstyled plants produced sixteen seedlings grandchildren of the original plant belonging to mr duck and these consisted of fourteen equal styled and two longstyled plants and i mention this fact as an additional instance of the transmission of the equalstyled variety  the third lot in table 531 namely the baston plants are the last which need be mentioned the long and shortstyled plants and the fifteen equalstyled plants were descended from two distinct stocks the latter were derived from a single plant which the gardener is positive was not longstyled hence probably it was equalstyled in all these fifteen plants the anthers occupying the same position as in the longstyled form closely surrounded the stigma which in one instance alone was slightly elongated notwithstanding this position of the stigma the flowers as the gardener assured me did not yield many seeds and this difference from the foregoing cases may perhaps have been caused by the pollen being bad as in some of the southampton equalstyled plants  conclusions with respect to the equalstyled variety of p sinensis  that this is a variation and not a third or distinct form as in the trimorphic genera lythrum and oxalis is clear for we have seen its first appearance in one out of a lot of illegitimate longstyled plants and in the case of mr ducks seedlings longstyled plants only slightly deviating from the normal state as well as equalstyled plants were produced from the same self fertilised parent the position of the stamens in their proper place low down in the tube of the corolla together with the small size of the pollengrains show firstly that the equalstyled variety is a modification of the long styled form and secondly that the pistil is the part which has varied most as indeed was obvious in many of the plants this variation is of frequent occurrence and is strongly inherited when it has once appeared it would however have possessed little interest if it had consisted of a mere change of structure but this is accompanied by modified fertility its occurrence apparently stands in close relation with the illegitimate birth of the parent plant but to this whole subject i shall hereafter recur  primula auricula  although i made no experiments on the illegitimate offspring of this species i refer to it for two reasonsfirst because i have observed two equalstyled plants in which the pistil resembled in all respects that of the longstyled form whilst the stamens had become elongated as in the shortstyled form so that the stigma was almost surrounded by the anthers the pollengrains however of the elongated stamens resembled in their small size those of the shorter stamens proper to the longstyled form hence these plants have become equalstyled by the increased length of the stamens instead of as with p sinensis by the diminished length of the pistil mr j scott observed five other plants in the same state and he shows that one of them when self fertilised yielded more seed than an ordinary long or shortstyled form would have done when similarly fertilised but that it was far inferior in fertility to either form when legitimately crossed 58 journal of the proceedings of the linnean society 8 1864 page 91 hence it appears that the male and female organs of this equalstyled variety have been modified in some special manner not only in structure but in functional powers this moreover is shown by the singular fact that both the longstyled and shortstyled plants fertilised with pollen from the equalstyled variety yield a lower average of seed than when these two forms are fertilised with their own pollen  the second point which deserves notice is that florists always throw away the longstyled plants and save seed exclusively from the shortstyled form nevertheless as mr scott was informed by a man who raises this species extensively in scotland about onefourth of the seedlings appear longstyled so that the shortstyled form of the auricula when fertilised by its own pollen does not reproduce the same form in so large a proportion as in the case of p sinensis we may further infer that the shortstyled form is not rendered quite sterile by a long course of fertilisation with pollen of the same form but as there would always be some liability to an occasional cross with the other form we cannot tell how long selffertilisation has been continued  primula farinosa  mr scott says that it is not at all uncommon to find equalstyled plants of this heterostyled species 59 journal of the proceedings of the linnean society 8 1864 page 115 judging from the size of the pollengrains these plants owe their structure as in the case of p auricula to the abnormal elongation of the stamens of the longstyled form in accordance with this view they yield less seed when crossed with the longstyled form than with the short styled but they differ in an anomalous manner from the equalstyled plants of p auricula in being extremely sterile with their own pollen  primula elatior  it was shown in the first chapter on the authority of herr breitenbach that equalstyled flowers are occasionally found on this species whilst growing in a state of nature and this is the only instance of such an occurrence known to me with the exception of some wild plants of the oxlipa hybrid between p veris and vulgariswhich were equalstyled herr breitenbachs case is remarkable in another way for equalstyled flowers were found in two instances on plants which bore both longstyled and shortstyled flowers in every other instance these two forms and the equalstyled variety have been produced by distinct plants  primula vulgaris brit fl  var acaulis of linn and p acaulis of jacq  var rubra  mr scott states that this variety which grew in the botanic garden in edinburgh was quite sterile when fertilised with pollen from the common primrose as well as from a white variety of the same species but that some of the plants when artificially fertilised with their own pollen yielded a moderate supply of seed 510 journal of the proceedings of the linnean society 8 1864 page 98 he was so kind as to send me some of these self fertilised seeds from which i raised the plants immediately to be described i may premise that the results of my experiments on the seedlings made on a large scale do not accord with those by mr scott on the parentplant  first in regard to the transmission of form and colour the parentplant was longstyled and of a rich purple colour from the selffertilised seed 23 plants were raised of these 18 were purple of different shades with two of them a little streaked and freckled with yellow thus showing a tendency to reversion and 5 were yellow but generally with a brighter orange centre than in the wild flower all the plants were profuse flowerers all were longstyled but the pistil varied a good deal in length even on the same plant being rather shorter or considerably longer than in the normal longstyled form and the stigmas likewise varied in shape it is therefore probable that an equal styled variety of the primrose might be found on careful search and i have received two accounts of plants apparently in this condition the stamens always occupied their proper position low down in the corolla and the pollengrains were of the small size proper to the longstyled form but were mingled with many minute and shrivelled grains the yellowflowered and the purpleflowered plants of this first generation were fertilised under a net with their own pollen and the seed separately sown from the former 22 plants were raised and all were yellow and longstyled from the latter or the purpleflowered plants 24 longstyled plants were raised of which 17 were purple and 7 yellow in this last case we have an instance of reversion in colour without the possibility of any cross to the grandparents or more distant progenitors of the plants in question altogether 23 plants in the first generation and 46 in the second generation were raised and the whole of these 69 illegitimate plants were longstyled  eight purpleflowered and two yellowflowered plants of the first illegitimate generation were fertilised in various ways with their own pollen and with that of the common primrose and the seeds were separately counted but as i could detect no difference in fertility between the purple and yellow varieties the results are run together in table 532  table 532 primula

form of the common primrose legitimately fertilised with pollen from the longstyled illegitimate purple and yellowflowered plants 10  6  305  61  6  if we compare the figures in this table with those given in the first chapter showing the normal fertility of the common primrose we shall see that the illegitimate purple and yellowflowered varieties are very sterile for instance 72 flowers were fertilised with their own pollen and produced only 11 good capsules but by the standard they ought to have produced 48 capsules and each of these ought to have contained on an average 522 seeds instead of only 115 seeds when these plants were illegitimately and legitimately fertilised with pollen from the common primrose the average numbers were increased but were far from attaining the normal standards so it was when both forms of the common primrose were fertilised with pollen from these illegitimate plants and this shows that their male as well as their female organs were in a deteriorated condition the sterility of these plants was shown in another way namely by their not producing any capsules when the access of all insects except such minute ones as thrips was prevented for under these circumstances the common longstyled primrose produces a considerable number of capsules there can therefore be no doubt that the fertility of these plants was greatly impaired the loss is not correlated with the colour of the flower and it was to ascertain this point that i made so many experiments as the parentplant growing in edinburgh was found by mr scott to be in a high degree sterile it may have transmitted a similar tendency to its offspring independently of their illegitimate birth i am however inclined to attribute some weight to the illegitimacy of their descent both from the analogy of other cases and more especially from the fact that when the plants were legitimately fertilised with pollen of the common primrose they yielded an average as may be seen in the table of only 5 more seeds than when illegitimately fertilised with the same pollen now we know that it is eminently characteristic of the illegitimate offspring of primula sinensis that they yield but few more seeds when legitimately fertilised than when fertilised with their ownform pollen  primula veris brit fl  var officinalis of linn p officinalis of jacq  seeds from the shortstyled form of the cowslip fertilised with pollen from the same form germinate so badly that i raised from three successive sowings only fourteen plants which consisted of nine shortstyled and five longstyled plants hence the shortstyled form of the cowslip when selffertilised does not transmit the same form nearly so truly as does that of p sinensis from the longstyled form always fertilised with its ownform pollen i raised in the first generation three longstyled plantsfrom their seed 53 longstyled grandchildrenfrom their seed 4 longstyled greatgrandchildrenfrom their seed 20 longstyled greatgreatgrandchildrenand lastly from their seed 8 longstyled and 2 shortstyled greatgreatgreatgrandchildren in this last generation shortstyled plants appeared for the first time in the course of the six generationsthe parent longstyled plant which was fertilised with pollen from another plant of the same form being counted as the first generation their appearance may be attributed to atavism from two other longstyled plants fertilised with their ownform pollen 72 plants were raised which consisted of 68 longstyled and 4 shortstyled so that altogether 162 plants were raised from illegitimately fertilised longstyled cowslips and these consisted of 156 longstyled and 6 shortstyled plants  we will now turn to the fertility and powers of growth possessed by the illegitimate plants from a shortstyled plant fertilised with its ownform pollen one shortstyled and two longstyled plants and from a longstyled plant similarly fertilised three longstyled plants were at first raised the fertility of these six illegitimate plants was carefully observed but i must premise that i cannot give any satisfactory standard of comparison as far as the number of the seeds is concerned for though i counted the seeds of many legitimate plants fertilised legitimately and illegitimately the number varied so greatly during successive seasons that no one standard will serve well for illegitimate unions made during different seasons moreover the seeds in the same capsule frequently differ so much in size that it is scarcely possible to decide which ought to be counted as good seed there remains as the best standard of comparison the proportional number of fertilised flowers which produce capsules containing any seed  first for the one illegitimate shortstyled plant in the course of three seasons 27 flowers were illegitimately fertilised with pollen from the same plant and they yielded only a single capsule which however contained a rather large number of seeds for a union of this nature namely 23 as a standard of comparison i may state that during the same three seasons 44 flowers borne by legitimate shortstyled plants were selffertilised and yielded 26 capsules so that the fact of the 27 flowers on the illegitimate plant having produced only one capsule proves how sterile it was to show that the conditions of life were favourable i will add that numerous plants of this and other species of primula all produced an abundance of capsules whilst growing close by in the same soil with the present and following plants the sterility of the above illegitimate shortstyled plant depended on both the male and female organs being in a deteriorated condition this was manifestly the case with the pollen for many of the anthers were shrivelled or contabescent nevertheless some of the anthers contained pollen with which i succeeded in fertilising some flowers on the illegitimate longstyled plants immediately to be described four flowers on this same shortstyled plant were likewise legitimately fertilised with pollen from one of the following longstyled plants but only one capsule was produced containing 26 seeds and this is a very low number for a legitimate union  with respect to the five illegitimate longstyled plants of the first generation derived from the above selffertilised shortstyled and longstyled parents their fertility was observed during the same three years these five plants when selffertilised differed considerably from one another in their degree of fertility as was the case with the illegitimate longstyled plants of lythrum salicaria and their fertility varied much according to the season i may premise as a standard of comparison that during the same years 56 flowers on legitimate longstyled plants of the same age and grown in the same soil were fertilised with their own pollen and yielded 27 capsules that is 48 per cent on one of the five illegitimate longstyled plants 36 flowers were self fertilised in the course of the three years but they did not produce a single capsule many of the anthers on this plant were contabescent but some seemed to contain sound pollen nor were the female organs quite impotent for i obtained from a legitimate cross one capsule with good seed on a second illegitimate longstyled plant 44 flowers were fertilised during the same years with their own pollen but they produced only a single capsule the third and fourth plants were in a very slight degree more productive the fifth and last plant was decidedly more fertile for 42 selffertilised flowers yielded 11 capsules altogether in the course of the three years no less than 160 flowers on these five illegitimate longstyled plants were fertilised with their own pollen but they yielded only 22 capsules according to the standard above given they ought to have yielded 80 capsules these 22 capsules contained on an average 151 seeds i believe subject to the doubts before specified that with legitimate plants the average number from a union of this nature would have been above 20 seeds twentyfour flowers on these same five illegitimate longstyled plants were legitimately fertilised with pollen from the abovedescribed illegitimate shortstyled plant and produced only 9 capsules which is an extremely small number for a legitimate union these 9 capsules however contained an average of 38 apparently good seeds which is as large a number as legitimate plants sometimes yield but this high average was almost certainly false and i mention the case for the sake of showing the difficulty of arriving at a fair result for this average mainly depended on two capsules containing the extraordinary numbers of 75 and 56 seeds these seeds however though i felt bound to count them were so poor that judging from trials made in other cases i do not suppose that one would have germinated and therefore they ought not to have been included lastly 20 flowers were legitimately fertilised with pollen from a legitimate plant and this increased their fertility for they produced 10 capsules yet this is but a very small proportion for a legitimate union  there can therefore be no doubt that these five longstyled plants and the one shortstyled plant of the first illegitimate generation were extremely sterile their sterility was shown as in the case of hybrids in another way namely by their flowering profusely and especially by the long endurance of the flowers for instance i fertilised many flowers on these plants and fifteen days afterwards namely on march 22nd i fertilised numerous longstyled and short styled flowers on common cowslips growing close by these latter flowers on april 8th were withered whilst most of the illegitimate flowers remained quite fresh for several days subsequently so that some of these illegitimate plants after being fertilised remained in full bloom for above a month  we will now turn to the fertility of the 53 illegitimate longstyled grandchildren descended from the longstyled plant which was first fertilised with its own pollen the pollen in two of these plants included a multitude of small and shrivelled grains nevertheless they were not very sterile for 25 flowers fertilised with their own pollen produced 15 capsules containing an average of 163 seeds as already stated the probable average with legitimate plants for a union of this nature is rather above 20 seeds these plants were remarkably healthy and vigorous as long as they were kept under highly favourable conditions in pots in the greenhouse and such treatment greatly increases the fertility of the cowslip when these same plants were planted during the next year which however was an unfavourable one out of doors in good soil 20 selffertilised flowers produced only 5 capsules containing extremely few and wretched seeds  four longstyled greatgrandchildren were raised from the selffertilised grandchildren and were kept under the same highly favourable conditions in the greenhouse 10 of their flowers were fertilised with ownform pollen and yielded the large proportion of 6 capsules containing on an average 187 seeds from these seeds 20 longstyled greatgreatgrandchildren were raised which were likewise kept in the greenhouse thirty of their flowers were fertilised with their own pollen and yielded 17 capsules containing on an average no less than 32 mostly fine seeds it appears therefore that the fertility of these plants of the fourth illegitimate generation as long as they were kept under highly favourable conditions had not decreased but had rather increased the result however was widely different when they were planted out of doors in good soil where other cowslips grew vigorously and were completely fertile for these illegitimate plants now became much dwarfed in stature and extremely sterile notwithstanding that they were exposed to the visits of insects and must have been legitimately fertilised by the surrounding legitimate plants a whole row of these plants of the fourth illegitimate generation thus freely exposed and legitimately fertilised produced only 3 capsules containing on an average only 17 seeds during the ensuing winter almost all these plants died and the few survivors were miserably unhealthy whilst the surrounding legitimate plants were not in the least injured  the seeds from the greatgreatgrandchildren were sown and 8 longstyled and 2 shortstyled plants of the fifth illegitimate generation raised these whilst still in the greenhouse produced smaller leaves and shorter flowerstalks than some legitimate plants with which they grew in competition but it should be observed that the latter were the product of a cross with a fresh stocka circumstance which by itself would have added much to their vigour 511 for full details of this experiment see my effects of cross and self fertilisation 1876 page 220 when these illegitimate plants were transferred to fairly good soil out of doors they became during the two following years much more dwarfed in stature and produced very few flowerstems and although they must have been legitimately fertilised by insects they yielded capsules compared with those produced by the surrounding legitimate plants in the ratio only of 5 to 100 it is therefore certain that illegitimate fertilisation continued during successive generations affects the powers of growth and fertility of p veris to an extraordinary degree more especially when the plants are exposed to ordinary conditions of life instead of being protected in a greenhouse  equalstyled red variety of primula veris  mr scott has described a plant of this kind growing in the botanic garden of edinburgh 512 proceedings of the linnean society volume 8 1864 page 105 he states that it was highly selffertile although insects were excluded and he explains this fact by showing first that the anthers and stigma are in close apposition and that the stamens in length position and size of their pollengrains resemble those of the shortstyled form whilst the pistil resembles that of the longstyled form both in length and in the structure of the stigma hence the selfunion of this variety is in fact a legitimate union and consequently is highly fertile mr scott further states that this variety yielded very few seeds when fertilised by either the long or short styled common cowslip and again that both forms of the latter when fertilised by the equalstyled variety likewise produced very few seeds but his experiments with the cowslip were few and my results do not confirm his in any uniform manner  i raised twenty plants from selffertilised seed sent me by mr scott and they all produced red flowers varying slightly in tint of these two were strictly longstyled both in structure and in function for their reproductive powers were tested by crosses with both forms of the common cowslip six plants were equalstyled but on the same plant the pistil varied a good deal in length during different seasons this was likewise the case according to mr scott with the parentplant lastly twelve plants were in appearance shortstyled but they varied much more in the length of their pistils than ordinary short styled cowslips and they differed widely from the latter in their powers of reproduction their pistils had become shortstyled in structure whilst remaining longstyled in function shortstyled cowslips when insects are excluded are extremely barren for instance on one occasion six fine plants produced only about 50 seeds that is less than the product of two good capsules and on another occasion not a single capsule now when the above twelve apparently shortstyled seedlings were similarly treated nearly all produced a great abundance of capsules containing numerous seeds which germinated remarkably well moreover three of these plants which during the first year were furnished with quite short pistils on the following year produced pistils of extraordinary length the greater number therefore of these shortstyled plants could not be distinguished in function from the equal styled variety the anthers in the six equalstyled and in the apparently twelve shortstyled plants were seated high up in the corolla as in the true short styled cowslip and the pollengrains resembled those of the same form in their large size but were mingled with a few shrivelled grains in function this pollen was identical with that of the shortstyled cowslip for ten longstyled flowers of the common cowslip legitimately fertilised with pollen from a true equalstyled variety produced six capsules containing on an average 344 seeds whilst seven capsules on a shortstyled cowslip illegitimately fertilised with pollen from the equalstyled variety yielded an average of only 145 seeds  as the equalstyled plants differ from one another in their powers of reproduction and as this is an important subject i will give a few details with respect to five of them first an equalstyled plant protected from insects as was done in all the following cases with one stated exception spontaneously produced numerous capsules five of which gave an average of 448 seeds with a maximum in one capsule of 57 but six capsules the product of fertilisation with pollen from a shortstyled cowslip and this is a legitimate union gave an average of 285 seeds with a maximum of 49 and this is a much lower average than might have been expected secondly nine capsules from another equalstyled plant which had not been protected from insects but probably was selffertilised gave an average of 452 seeds with a maximum of 58 thirdly another plant which had a very short pistil in 1865 produced spontaneously many capsules six of which contained an average of 339 seeds with a maximum of 38 in 1866 this same plant had a pistil of wonderful length for it projected quite above the anthers and the stigma resembled that of the longstyled form in this condition it produced spontaneously a vast number of fine capsules six of which contained almost exactly the same average number as before namely 343 with a maximum of 38 four flowers on this plant legitimately fertilised with pollen from a shortstyled cowslip yielded capsules with an average of 302 seeds fourthly another shortstyled plant spontaneously produced in 1865 an abundance of capsules ten of which contained an average of 356 seeds with a maximum of 54 in 1866 this same plant had become in all respects longstyled and ten capsules gave almost exactly the same average as before namely 351 seeds with a maximum of 47 eight flowers on this plant legitimately fertilised with pollen from a shortstyled cowslip produced six capsules with the high average of 53 seeds and the high maximum of 67 eight flowers were also fertilised with pollen from a longstyled cowslip this being an illegitimate union and produced seven capsules containing an average of 244 seeds with a maximum of 32 the fifth and last plant remained in the same condition during both years it had a pistil rather longer than that of the true shortstyled form with the stigma smooth as it ought to be in this form but abnormal in shape like a muchelongated inverted cone it produced spontaneously many capsules five of which in 1865 gave an average of only 156 seeds and in 1866 ten capsules still gave an average only a little higher namely of 221 with a maximum of 30 sixteen flowers were fertilised with pollen from a longstyled cowslip and produced 12 capsules with an average of 249 seeds and a maximum of 42 eight flowers were fertilised with pollen from a shortstyled cowslip but yielded only two capsules containing 18 and 23 seeds hence this plant in function and partially in structure was in an almost exactly intermediate state between the longstyled and shortstyled form but inclining towards the shortstyled and this accounts for the low average of seeds which it produced when spontaneously selffertilised  the foregoing five plants thus differ much from one another in the nature of their fertility in two individuals a great difference in the length of the pistil during two succeeding years made no difference in the number of seeds produced as all five plants possessed the male organs of the shortstyled form in a perfect state and the female organs of the longstyled form in a more or less complete state they spontaneously produced a surprising number of capsules which generally contained a large average of remarkably fine seeds with ordinary cowslips legitimately fertilised i once obtained from plants cultivated in the greenhouse the high average from seven capsules of 587 seeds with a maximum in one capsule of 87 seeds but from plants grown out of doors i never obtained a higher average than 41 seeds now two of the equal styled plants grown out of doors and spontaneously selffertilised gave averages of 44 and 45 seeds but this high fertility may perhaps be in part attributed to the stigma receiving pollen from the surrounding anthers at exactly the right period two of these plants fertilised with pollen from a shortstyled cowslip and this in fact is a legitimate union gave a lower average than when selffertilised on the other hand another plant when similarly fertilised by a cowslip yielded the unusually high average of 53 seeds with a maximum of 67 lastly as we have just seen one of these plants was in an almost exactly intermediate condition in its female organs between the long and shortstyled forms and consequently when selffertilised yielded a low average of seed if we add together all the experiments which i made on the equalstyled plants 41 spontaneously selffertilised capsules insects having been excluded gave an average of 34 seeds which is exactly the same number as the parentplant yielded in edinburgh thirtyfour flowers fertilised with pollen from the shortstyled cowslip and this is an analogous union produced 17 capsules containing an average of 338 seeds it is a rather singular circumstance for which i cannot account that 20 flowers artificially fertilised on one occasion with pollen from the same plants yielded only ten capsules containing the low average of 267 seeds  as bearing on inheritance it may be added that 72 seedlings were raised from one of the redflowered strictly equalstyled selffertilised plants descended from the similarly characterised edinburgh plant these 72 plants were therefore grandchildren of the edinburgh plant and they all bore as in the first generation red flowers with the exception of one plant which reverted in colour to the common cowslip in regard to structure nine plants were truly longstyled and had their stamens seated low down in the corolla in the proper position the remaining 63 plants were equalstyled though the stigma in about a dozen of them stood a little below the anthers we thus see that the anomalous combination in the same flower of the male and female sexual organs which properly exist in the two distinct forms was inherited with much force thirty six seedlings were also raised from long and shortstyled common cowslips crossed with pollen from the equalstyled variety of these plants one alone was equalstyled 20 were shortstyled but with the pistil in three of them rather too long and the remaining 15 were longstyled in this case we have an illustration of the difference between simple inheritance and prepotency of transmission for the equalstyled variety when selffertilised transmits its character as we have just seen with much force but when crossed with the common cowslip cannot withstand the greater power of transmission of the latter  pulmonaria  i have little to say on this genus i obtained seeds of p officinalis from a garden where the longstyled form alone grew and raised 11 seedlings which were all longstyled these plants were named for me by dr hooker they differed as has been shown from the plants belonging to this species which in germany were experimented on by hildebrand 513 botanische zeitung 1865 page 13 for he found that the longstyled form was absolutely sterile with its own pollen whilst my longstyled seedlings and the parentplants yielded a fair supply of seed when selffertilised plants of the longstyled form of pulmonaria angustifolia were like hildebrands plants absolutely sterile with their own pollen so that i could never procure a single seed on the other hand the shortstyled plants of this species differently from those of p officinalis were fertile with their own pollen in a quite remarkable degree for a heterostyled plant from seeds carefully selffertilised i raised 18 plants of which 13 proved shortstyled and 5 longstyled  polygonum fagopyrum  from flowers on longstyled plants fertilised illegitimately with pollen from the same plant 49 seedlings were raised and these consisted of 45 longstyled and 4 shortstyled from flowers on shortstyled plants illegitimately fertilised with pollen from the same plant 33 seedlings were raised and these consisted of 20 shortstyled and 13 longstyled so that the usual rule of illegitimately fertilised longstyled plants tending much more strongly than shortstyled plants to reproduce their own form here holds good the illegitimate plants derived from both forms flowered later than the legitimate and were to the latter in height as 69 to 100 but as these illegitimate plants were descended from parents fertilised with their own pollen whilst the legitimate plants were descended from parents crossed with pollen from a distinct individual it is impossible to know how much of their difference in height and period of flowering is due to the illegitimate birth of the one set and how much to the other set being the product of a cross between distinct plants  concluding remarks on the illegitimate offspring of heterostyled trimorphic and dimorphic plants  it is remarkable how closely and in how many points illegitimate unions between the two or three forms of the same heterostyled species together with their illegitimate offspring resemble hybrid unions between distinct species together with their hybrid offspring in both cases we meet with every degree of sterility from very slightly lessened fertility to absolute barrenness when not even a single seedcapsule is produced in both cases the facility of effecting the first union is much influenced by the conditions to which the plants are exposed 514 this has been remarked by many experimentalists in effecting crosses between distinct species and in regard to illegitimate unions i have given in the first chapter a striking illustration in the case of primula veris both with hybrids and illegitimate plants the innate degree of sterility is highly variable in plants raised from the same motherplant in both cases the male organs are more plainly affected than the female and we often find contabescent anthers enclosing shrivelled and utterly powerless pollengrains the more sterile hybrids as max wichura has well shown are sometimes much dwarfed in stature and have so weak a constitution that they are liable to premature death 515 die bastardbefruchtung im pflanzenreich 1865 and we have seen exactly parallel cases with the illegitimate seedlings of lythrum and primula many hybrids are the most persistent and profuse flowerers as are some illegitimate plants when a hybrid is crossed by either pure parentform it is notoriously much more fertile than when crossed inter se or by another hybrid so when an illegitimate plant is fertilised by a legitimate plant it is more fertile than when fertilised inter se or by another illegitimate plant when two species are crossed and they produce numerous seeds we expect as a general rule that their hybrid offspring will be moderately fertile but if the parent species produce extremely few seeds we expect that the hybrids will be very sterile but there are marked exceptions as shown by gartner to these rules so it is with illegitimate unions and illegitimate offspring thus the mid styled form of lythrum salicaria when illegitimately fertilised with pollen from the longest stamens of the shortstyled form produced an unusual number of seeds and their illegitimate offspring were not at all or hardly at all sterile on the other hand the illegitimate offspring from the longstyled form fertilised with pollen from the shortest stamens of the same form yielded few seeds and the illegitimate offspring thus produced were very sterile but they were more sterile than might have been expected relatively to the difficulty of effecting the union of the parent sexual elements no point is more remarkable in regard to the crossing of species than their unequal reciprocity thus species a will fertilise b with the greatest ease but b will not fertilise a after hundreds of trials we have exactly the same case with illegitimate unions for the midstyled lythrum salicaria was easily fertilised by pollen from the longest stamens of the shortstyled form and yielded many seeds but the latter form did not yield a single seed when fertilised by the longest stamens of the midstyled form  another important point is prepotency gartner has shown that when a species is fertilised with pollen from another species if it be afterwards fertilised with its own pollen or with that of the same species this is so prepotent over the foreign pollen that the effect of the latter though placed on the stigma some time previously is entirely destroyed exactly the same thing occurs with the two forms of a heterostyled species thus several longstyled flowers of primula veris were fertilised illegitimately with pollen from another plant of the same form and twentyfour hours afterwards legitimately with pollen from a short styled darkred polyanthus which is a variety of p veris and the result was that every one of the thirty seedlings thus raised bore flowers more or less red showing plainly how prepotent the legitimate pollen from a shortstyled plant was over the illegitimate pollen from a longstyled plant  in all the several foregoing points the parallelism is wonderfully close between the effects of illegitimate and hybrid fertilisation it is hardly an exaggeration to assert that seedlings from an illegitimately fertilised heterostyled plant are hybrids formed within the limits of one and the same species this conclusion is important for we thus learn that the difficulty in sexually uniting two organic forms and the sterility of their offspring afford no sure criterion of socalled specific distinctness if any one were to cross two varieties of the same form of lythrum or primula for the sake of ascertaining whether they were specifically distinct and he found that they could be united only with some difficulty that their offspring were extremely sterile and that the parents and their offspring resembled in a whole series of relations crossed species and their hybrid offspring he might maintain that his varieties had been proved to be good and true species but he would be completely deceived in the second place as the forms of the same trimorphic or dimorphic heterostyled species are obviously identical in general structure with the exception of the reproductive organs and as they are identical in general constitution for they live under precisely the same conditions the sterility of their illegitimate unions and that of their illegitimate offspring must depend exclusively on the nature of the sexual elements and on their incompatibility for uniting in a particular manner and as we have just seen that distinct species when crossed resemble in a whole series of relations the forms of the same species when illegitimately united we are led to conclude that the sterility of the former must likewise depend exclusively on the incompatible nature of their sexual elements and not on any general difference in constitution or structure we are indeed led to this same conclusion by the impossibility of detecting any differences sufficient to account for certain species crossing with the greatest ease whilst other closely allied species cannot be crossed or can be crossed only with extreme difficulty we are led to this conclusion still more forcibly by considering the great difference which often exists in the facility of crossing reciprocally the same two species for it is manifest in this case that the result must depend on the nature of the sexual elements the male element of the one species acting freely on the female element of the other but not so in a reversed direction and now we see that this same conclusion is independently and strongly fortified by the consideration of the illegitimate unions of trimorphic and dimorphic heterostyled plants in so complex and obscure a subject as hybridism it is no slight gain to arrive at a definite conclusion namely that we must look exclusively to functional differences in the sexual elements as the cause of the sterility of species when first crossed and of their hybrid offspring it was this consideration which led me to make the many observations recorded in this chapter and which in my opinion make them worthy of publication   chapter vi concluding remarks on heterostyled plants  the essential character of heterostyled plants summary of the differences in fertility between legitimately and illegitimately fertilised plants diameter of the pollengrains size of anthers and structure of stigma in the different forms affinities of the genera which include heterostyled species nature of the advantages derived from heterostylism the means by which plants became heterostyled transmission of form equalstyled varieties of heterostyled plants final remarks  in the foregoing chapters all the heterostyled plants known to me have been more or less fully described several other cases have been indicated especially by professor asa gray and kuhn in which the individuals of the same species differ in the length of their stamens and pistils 61 asa gray american journal of science 1865 page 101 and elsewhere as already referred to kuhn botanische zeitung 1867 page 67 but as i have been often deceived by this character taken alone it seems to me the more prudent course not to rank any species as heterostyled unless we have evidence of more important differences between the forms as in the diameter of the pollengrains or in the structure of the stigma the individuals of many ordinary hermaphrodite plants habitually fertilise one another owing to their male and female organs being mature at different periods or to the structure of the parts or to selfsterility etc and so it is with many hermaphrodite animals for instance landsnails or earthworms but in all these cases any one individual can fully fertilise or be fertilised by any other individual of the same species this is not so with heterostyled plants a longstyled midstyled or shortstyled plant cannot fully fertilise or be fertilised by any other individual but only by one belonging to another form thus the essential character of plants belonging to the heterostyled class is that the individuals are divided into two or three bodies like the males and females of dioecious plants or of the higher animals which exist in approximately equal numbers and are adapted for reciprocal fertilisation the existence therefore of two or three bodies of individuals differing from one another in the above more important characteristics offers by itself good evidence that the species is heterostyled but absolutely conclusive evidence can be derived only from experiments and by finding that pollen must be applied from the one form to the other in order to ensure complete fertility  in order to show how much more fertile each form is when legitimately fertilised with pollen from the other form or in the case of trimorphic species with the proper pollen from one of the two other forms than when illegitimately fertilised with its ownform pollen i will append table 633 giving a summary of the results in all the cases hitherto ascertained the fertility of the unions may be judged by two standards namely by the proportion of flowers which when fertilised in the two methods yield capsules and by the average

or three forms of the same heterostyled species do not differ from one another in general habit or foliage as sometimes though rarely happens with the two sexes of dioecious plants nor does the calyx differ but the corolla sometimes differs slightly in shape owing to the different position of the anthers in borreria the hairs within the tube of the corolla are differently situated in the longstyled and shortstyled forms in pulmonaria there is a slight difference in the size of the corolla and in pontederia in its colour in the reproductive organs the differences are much greater and more important in the one form the stamens may be all of the same length and in the other graduated in length or alternately longer and shorter the filaments may differ in colour and thickness and are sometimes nearly thrice as long in the one form as in the other they adhere also for very different proportional lengths to the corolla the anthers sometimes differ much in size in the two forms owing to the rotation of the filaments the anthers when mature dehisce towards the circumference of the flower in one form of faramea and towards the centre in the other form the pollengrains sometimes differ conspicuously in colour and often to an extraordinary degree in diameter they differ also somewhat in shape and apparently in their contents as they are unequally opaque in the shortstyled form of faramea the pollengrains are covered with sharp points so as to cohere readily together or to an insect whilst the smaller grains of the longstyled form are quite smooth  with respect to the pistil the style may be almost thrice as long in the one form as in the other in oxalis it sometimes differs in hairiness in the three forms in linum the pistils either diverge and pass out between the filaments or stand nearly upright and parallel to them the stigmas in the two forms often differ much in size and shape and more especially in the length and thickness of their papillae so that the surface may be rough or quite smooth owing to the rotation of the styles the papillose surface of the stigma is turned outwards in one form of linum perenne and inwards in the other form in flowers of the same age of primula veris the ovules are larger in the longstyled than in the shortstyled form the seeds produced by the two or three forms often differ in number and sometimes in size and weight thus five seeds from the longstyled form of lythrum salicaria equal in weight six from the midstyled and seven from the shortstyled form lastly shortstyled plants of pulmonaria officinalis bear a larger number of flowers and these set a larger proportional number of fruit which however yield a lower average number of seed than the longstyled plants with heterostyled plants we thus see in how many and in what important characters the forms of the same undoubted species often differ from one anothercharacters which with ordinary plants would be amply sufficient to distinguish species of the same genus  as the pollengrains of ordinary species belonging to the same genus generally resemble one another closely in all respects it is worth while to show in table 634 the difference in diameter between the grains from the two or three forms of the same heterostyled species in the fortythree cases in which this was ascertained but it should be observed that some of the following measurements are only approximately accurate as only a few grains were measured in several cases also the grains had been dried and were then soaked in water whenever they were of an elongated shape their longer diameters were measured the grains from the shortstyled plants are invariably larger than those from the longstyled whenever there is any difference between them the diameter of the former is represented in the table by the number 100  table 634 relative diameter of the pollengrains from the forms of the same heterostyled species those from the shortstyled form being represented by 100

86  we here see that with seven or eight exceptions out of the fortythree cases the pollengrains from one form are larger than those from the other form of the same species the extreme difference is as 100 to 55 and we should bear in mind that in the case of spheres differing to this degree in diameter their contents differ in the ratio of six to one with all the species in which the grains differ in diameter there is no exception to the rule that those from the anthers of the shortstyled form the tubes of which have to penetrate the longer pistil of the longstyled form are larger than the grains from the other form this curious relation led delpino as it formerly did me to believe that the larger size of the grains in the shortstyled flowers is connected with the greater supply of matter needed for the development of their longer tubes 62 sull opera la distribuzione dei sessi nelle piante etc 1867 page 17 but the case of linum in which the grains of the two forms are of equal size whilst the pistil of the one is about twice as long as that of the other made me from the first feel very doubtful with respect to this view my doubts have since been strengthened by the cases of limnanthemum and coccocypselum in which the grains are of equal size in the two forms whilst in the former genus the pistil is nearly thrice and in the latter twice as long as in the other form in those species in which the grains are of unequal size in the two forms there is no close relationship between the degree of their inequality and that of their pistils thus in pulmonaria officinalis and in erythroxylum the pistil in the longstyled form is about twice the length of that in the other form whilst in the former species the pollengrains are as 100 to 78 and in the latter as 100 to 93 in diameter in the two forms of suteria the pistil differs but little in length whilst the pollengrains are as 100 to 75 in diameter these cases seem to prove that the difference in size between the grains in the two forms is not determined by the length of the pistil down which the tubes have to grow that with plants in general there is no close relationship between the size of the pollengrains and the length of the pistil is manifest for instance i found that the distended grains of datura arborea were 00243 of an inch in diameter and the pistil no less than 925 inches in length now the pistil in the small flowers of polygonum fagopyrum is very short yet the larger pollengrains from the shortstyled plants had exactly the same diameter as those from the datura with its enormously elongated pistil  notwithstanding these several considerations it is difficult quite to give up the belief that the pollengrains from the longer stamens of heterostyled plants have become larger in order to allow of the development of longer tubes and the foregoing opposing facts may possibly be reconciled in the following manner the tubes are at first developed from matter contained within the grains for they are sometimes exserted to a considerable length before the grains have touched the stigma but botanists believe that they afterwards draw nourishment from the conducting tissue of the pistil it is hardly possible to doubt that this must occur in such cases as that of the datura in which the tubes have to grow down the whole length of the pistil and therefore to a length equalling 3806 times the diameter of the grains namely 00243 of an inch from which they are protruded i may here remark that i have seen the pollengrains of a willow immersed in a very weak solution of honey protrude their tubes in the course of twelve hours to a length thirteen times as great as the diameter of the grains now if we suppose that the tubes in some heterostyled species are developed wholly or almost wholly from matter contained within the grains while in other species from matter yielded by the pistil we can see that in the former case it would be necessary that the grains of the two forms should differ in size relatively to the length of the pistil which the tubes have to penetrate but that in the latter case it would not be necessary that the grains should thus differ whether this explanation can be considered satisfactory must remain at present doubtful  there is another remarkable difference between the forms of several heterostyled species namely in the anthers of the shortstyled flowers which contain the larger pollengrains being longer than those of the longstyled flowers this is the case with hottonia palustris in the ratio of 100 to 83 with limnanthemum indicum the ratio is as 100 to 70 with the allied menyanthes the anthers of the shortstyled form are a little and with villarsia conspicuously larger than those of the longstyled with pulmonaria angustifolia they vary much in size but from an average of seven measurements of each kind the ratio is as 100 to 91 in six genera of the rubiaceae there is a similar difference either slightly or well marked lastly in the trimorphic pontederia the ratio is 100 to 88 the anthers from the longest stamens in the shortstyled form being compared with those from the shortest stamens in the longstyled form on the other hand there is a similar and wellmarked difference in the length of the stamens in the two forms of forsythia suspensa and of linum flavum but in these two cases the anthers of the shortstyled flowers are shorter than those of the longstyled the relative size of the anthers was not particularly attended to in the two forms of the other heterostyled plants but i believe that they are generally equal as is certainly the case with those of the common primrose and cowslip  the pistil differs in length in the two forms of every heterostyled plant and although a similar difference is very general with the stamens yet in the two forms of linum grandiflorum and of cordia they are equal there can hardly be a doubt that the relative length of these organs is an adaptation for the safe transportal by insects of the pollen from the one form to the other the exceptional cases in which these organs do not stand exactly on a level in the two forms may probably be explained by the manner in which the flowers are visited with most of the species if there is any difference in the size of the stigma of the two forms that of the longstyled whatever its shape may be is larger than that of the shortstyled but here again there are some exceptions to the rule for in the shortstyled form of leucosmia burnettiana the stigmas are longer and much narrower than those of the longstyled the ratio between the lengths of the stigmas in the two forms being 100 to 60 in the three rubiaceous genera faramea houstonia and oldenlandia the stigmas of the short styled form are likewise somewhat longer and narrower and in the three forms of oxalis sensitiva the difference is strongly marked for if the length of the two stigmas of the longstyled pistil be taken as 100 it will be represented in the mid and shortstyled forms by the numbers 141 and 164 as in all these cases the stigmas of the shortstyled pistil are seated low down within a more or less tubular corolla it is probable that they are better fitted by being long and narrow for brushing the pollen off the inserted proboscis of an insect  with many heterostyled plants the stigma differs in roughness in the two forms and when this is the case there is no known exception to the rule that the papillae on the stigma of the longstyled form are longer and often thicker than those on that of the shortstyled for instance the papillae on the longstyled stigma of hottonia palustris are more than twice the length of those in the other form this holds good even in the case of houstonia coerulea in which the stigmas are much shorter and stouter in the longstyled than in the shortstyled form for the papillae on the former compared with those on the latter are as 100 to 58 in length the length of the pistil in the longstyled form of linum grandiflorum varies much and the stigmatic papillae vary in a corresponding manner from this fact i inferred at first that in all cases the difference in length between the stigmatic papillae in the two forms was one merely of correlated growth but this can hardly be the true or general explanation as the shorter stigmas of the longstyled form of houstonia have the longer papillae it is a more probable view that the papillae which render the stigma of the longstyled form of various species rough serve to entangle effectually the largesized pollengrains brought by insects from the shortstyled form thus ensuring its legitimate fertilisation this view is supported by the fact that the pollengrains from the two forms of eight species in table 634 hardly differ in diameter and the papillae on their stigmas do not differ in length  the species which are at present positively or almost positively known to be heterostyled belong as shown in table 635 to 38 genera widely distributed throughout the world these genera are included in fourteen families most of which are very distinct from one another for they belong to nine of the several great series into which phanerogamic plants have been divided by bentham and hooker  table 635 list of genera including heterostyled species  dicotyledons  hypericineae cratoxylon  erythroxyleae erythroxylum sethia  geraniaceae linum oxalis  lythraceae lythrum neseae  rubiaceae cinchona bouvardia manettia hedyotis oldenlandia houstonia coccocypselum lipostoma knoxia faramea psychotria rudgea suteria mitchella

verbenaceae aegiphila  polygoneae polygonum  thymeleae thymelea  monocotyledons  pontederiaceae pontederia  in some of these families the heterostyled condition must have been acquired at a very remote period thus the three closely allied genera menyanthes limnanthemum and villarsia inhabit respectively europe india and south america heterostyled species of hedyotis are found in the temperate regions of north and the tropical regions of south america trimorphic species of oxalis live on both sides of the cordillera in south america and at the cape of good hope in these and some other cases it is not probable that each species acquired its heterostyled structure independently of its close allies if they did not do so the three closely connected genera of the menyantheae and the several trimorphic species of oxalis must have inherited their structure from a common progenitor but an immense lapse of time will have been necessary in all such cases for the modified descendants of a common progenitor to have spread from a single centre to such widely remote and separated areas the family of the rubiaceae contains not far short of as many heterostyled genera as all the other thirteen families together and hereafter no doubt other rubiaceous genera will be found to be heterostyled although a large majority are homostyled several closely allied genera in this family probably owe their heterostyled structure to descent in common but as the genera thus characterised are distributed in no less than eight of the tribes into which this family has been divided by bentham and hooker it is almost certain that several of them must have become heterostyled independently of one another what there is in the constitution or structure of the members of this family which favours their becoming heterostyled i cannot conjecture some families of considerable size such as the boragineae and verbenaceae include as far as is at present known only a single heterostyled genus polygonum also is the sole heterostyled genus in its family and though it is a very large genus no other species except p fagopyrum is thus characterised we may suspect that it has become heterostyled within a comparatively recent period as it seems to be less strongly so in function than the species in any other genus for both forms are capable of yielding a considerable number of spontaneously selffertilised seeds polygonum in possessing only a single heterostyled species is an extreme case but every other genus of considerable size which includes some such species likewise contains homostyled species lythrum includes trimorphic dimorphic and homostyled species  trees bushes and herbaceous plants both large and small bearing single flowers or flowers in dense spikes or heads have been rendered heterostyled so have plants which inhabit alpine and lowland sites dry land marshes and water 63 out of the 38 genera known to include heterostyled species about eight or 21 per cent are more or less aquatic in their habits i was at first struck with this fact for i was not then aware how large a proportion of ordinary plants inhabit such stations heterostyled plants may be said in one sense to have their sexes separated as the forms must mutually fertilise one another therefore it seemed worth while to ascertain what proportion of the genera in the linnean classes monoecia dioecia and polygamia contained species which live in water marshes bogs or watery places in sir wj hookers british flora 4th edition 1838 these three linnean classes include 40 genera 17 of which ie 43 per cent contain species inhabiting the justspecified stations so that 43 per cent of those british plants which have their sexes separated are more or less aquatic in their habits whereas only 21 per cent of heterostyled plants have such habits i may add that the hermaphrodite classes from monandria to gynandria inclusive contain 447 genera of which 113 are aquatic in the above sense or only 25 per cent it thus appears as far as can be judged from such imperfect data that there is some connection between the separation of the sexes in plants and the watery nature of the sites which they inhabit but that this does not hold good with heterostyled species  when i first began to experimentise on heterostyled plants it was under the impression that they were tending to become dioecious but i was soon forced to relinquish this notion as the longstyled plants of primula which from possessing a longer pistil larger stigma shorter stamens with smaller pollen grains seemed to be the more feminine of the two forms yielded fewer seeds than the shortstyled plants which appeared to be in the above respects the more masculine of the two moreover trimorphic plants evidently come under the same category with dimorphic and the former cannot be looked at as tending to become dioecious with lythrum salicaria however we have the curious and unique case of the midstyled form being more feminine or less masculine in nature than the other two forms this is shown by the large number of seeds which it yields in whatever manner it may be fertilised and by its pollen the grains of which are of smaller size than those from the corresponding stamens in the other two forms when applied to the stigma of any form producing fewer seeds than the normal number if we suppose the process of deterioration of the male organs in the midstyled form to continue the final result would be the production of a female plant and lythrum salicaria would then consist of two heterostyled hermaphrodites and a female no such case is known to exist but it is a possible one as hermaphrodite and female forms of the same species are by no means rare although there is no reason to believe that heterostyled plants are regularly becoming dioecious yet they offer singular facilities as will hereafter be shown for such conversion and this appears occasionally to have been effected  we may feel sure that plants have been rendered heterostyled to ensure cross fertilisation for we now know that a cross between the distinct individuals of the same species is highly important for the vigour and fertility of the offspring the same end is gained by dichogamy or the maturation of the reproductive elements of the same flower at different periodsby dioeciousnessselfsterilitythe prepotency of pollen from another individual over a plants own pollenand lastly by the structure of the flower in relation to the visits of insects the wonderful diversity of the means for gaining the same end in this case and in many others depends on the nature of all the previous changes through which the species has passed and on the more or less complete inheritance of the successive adaptations of each part to the surrounding conditions plants which are already well adapted by the structure of their flowers for crossfertilisation by the aid of insects often possess an irregular corolla which has been modelled in relation to their visits and it would have been of little or no use to such plants to have become heterostyled we can thus understand why it is that not a single species is heterostyled in such great families as the leguminosae labiatae scrophulariaceae orchideae etc all of which have irregular flowers every known heterostyled plant however depends on insects for its fertilisation and not on the wind so that it is a rather surprising fact that only one genus pontederia has a plainly irregular corolla  why some species are adapted for crossfertilisation whilst others within the same genus are not so or if they once were have since lost such adaptation and in consequence are now usually selffertilised i have endeavoured elsewhere to explain to a certain limited extent 64 the effects of cross and self fertilisation 1876 page 441 if it be further asked why some species have been adapted for this end by being made heterostyled rather than by any of the above specified means the answer probably lies in the manner in which heterostylism originateda subject immediately to be discussed heterostyled species however have an advantage over dichogamous species as all the flowers on the same heterostyled plant belong to the same form so that when fertilised legitimately by insects two distinct individuals are sure to intercross on the other hand with dichogamous plants early or late flowers on the same individual may intercross and a cross of this kind does hardly any or no good whenever it is profitable to a species to produce a large number of seeds and this obviously is a very common case heterostyled will have an advantage over dioecious plants as all the individuals of the former whilst only half of the latter that is the females yield seeds on the other hand heterostyled plants seem to have no advantage as far as crossfertilisation is concerned over those which are sterile with their own pollen they lie indeed under a slight disadvantage for if two selfsterile plants grow near together and far removed from all other plants of the same species they will mutually and perfectly fertilise one another whilst this will not be the case with heterostyled dimorphic plants unless they chance to belong to opposite forms  it may be added that species which are trimorphic have one slight advantage over the dimorphic for if only two individuals of a dimorphic species happen to grow near together in an isolated spot the chances are even that both will belong to the same form and in this case they will not produce the full number of vigorous and fertile seedlings all these moreover will tend strongly to belong to the same form as their parents on the other hand if two plants of the same trimorphic species happen to grow in an isolated spot the chances are two to one in favour of their not belonging to the same form and in this case they will legitimately fertilise one another and yield the full complement of vigorous offspring  the means by which plants may have been rendered heterostyled  this is a very obscure subject on which i can throw little light but which is worthy of discussion it has been shown that heterostyled plants occur in fourteen natural families dispersed throughout the whole vegetable kingdom and that even within the family of the rubiaceae they are dispersed in eight of the tribes we may therefore conclude that this structure has been acquired by various plants independently of inheritance from a common progenitor and that it can be acquired without any great difficultythat is without any very unusual combination of circumstances  it is probable that the first step towards a species becoming heterostyled is great variability in the length of the pistil and stamens or of the pistil alone such variations are not very rare with amsinckia spectabilis and nolana prostrata these organs differ so much in length in different individuals that until experimenting on them i thought both species heterostyled the stigma of gesneria pendulina sometimes protrudes far beyond and is sometimes seated beneath the anthers so it is with oxalis acetosella and various other plants i have also noticed an extraordinary amount of difference in the length of the pistil in cultivated varieties of primula veris and vulgaris  as most plants are at least occasionally crossfertilised by the aid of insects we may assume that this was the case with our supposed varying plant but that it would have been beneficial to it to have been more regularly cross fertilised we should bear in mind how important an advantage it has been proved to be to many plants though in different degrees and ways to be cross fertilised it might well happen that our supposed species did not vary in function in the right manner so as to become either dichogamous or completely selfsterile or in structure so as to ensure crossfertilisation if it had thus varied it would never have been rendered heterostyled as this state would then have been superfluous but the parentspecies of our several existing heterostyled plants may have been and probably were judging from their present constitution in some degree selfsterile and this would have made regular crossfertilisation still more desirable  now let us take a highly varying species with most or all of the anthers exserted in some individuals and in others seated low down in the corolla with the stigma also varying in position in like manner insects which visited such flowers would have different parts of their bodies dusted with pollen and it would be a mere chance whether this were left on the stigma of the next flower which was visited if all the anthers could have been placed on the same level in all the plants then abundant pollen would have adhered to the same part of the body of the insects which frequented the flowers and would afterwards have been deposited without loss on the stigma if it likewise stood on the same unvarying level in all the flowers but as the stamens and pistils are supposed to have already varied much in length and to be still varying it might well happen that they could be reduced much more easily through natural selection into two sets of different lengths in different individuals than all to the same length and level in all the individuals we know from innumerable instances in which the two sexes and the young of the same species differ that there is no difficulty in two or more sets of individuals being formed which inherit different characters in our particular case the law of compensation or balancement which is admitted by many botanists would tend to cause the pistil to be reduced in those individuals in which the stamens were greatly developed and to be increased in length in those which had their stamens but little developed  now if in our varying species the longer stamens were to be nearly equalised in length in a considerable body of individuals with the pistil more or less reduced and in another body the shorter stamens to be similarly equalised with the pistil more or less increased in length crossfertilisation would be secured with little loss of pollen and this change would be so highly beneficial to the species that there is no difficulty in believing that it could be effected through natural selection our plant would then make a close approach in structure to a heterostyled dimorphic species or to a trimorphic species if the stamens were reduced to two lengths in the same flower in correspondence with that of the pistils in the other two forms but we have not as yet even touched on the chief difficulty in understanding how heterostyled species could have originated a completely selfsterile plant or a dichogamous one can fertilise and be fertilised by any other individual of the same species whereas the essential character of a heterostyled plant is that an individual of one form cannot fully fertilise or be fertilised by an individual of the same form but only by one belonging to another form  h muller has suggested that ordinary or homostyled plants may have been rendered heterostyled merely through the effects of habit 65 die befruchtung der blumen page 352 whenever pollen from one set of anthers is habitually applied to a pistil of particular length in a varying species he believes that at last the possibility of fertilisation in any other manner will be nearly or completely lost he was led to this view by observing that diptera frequently carried pollen from the longstyled flowers of hottonia to the stigma of the same form and that this illegitimate union was not nearly so sterile as the corresponding union in other heterostyled species but this conclusion is directly opposed by some other cases for instance by that of linum grandiflorum for here the longstyled form is utterly barren with its ownform pollen although from the position of the anthers this pollen is invariably applied to the stigma it is obvious that with heterostyled dimorphic plants the two female and the two male organs differ in power for if the same kind of pollen be placed on the stigmas of the two forms and again if the two kinds of pollen be placed on the stigmas of the same form the results are in each case widely different nor can we see how this differentiation of the two female and two male organs could have been effected merely through each kind of pollen being habitually placed on one of the two stigmas  another view seems at first sight probable namely that an incapacity to be fertilised in certain ways has been specially acquired by heterostyled plants we may suppose that our varying species was somewhat sterile as is often the case with pollen from its own stamens whether these were long or short and that such sterility was transferred to all the individuals with pistils and stamens of the same length so that these became incapable of intercrossing freely but that such sterility was eliminated in the case of the individuals which differed in the length of their pistils and stamens it is however incredible that so peculiar a form of mutual infertility should have been specially acquired unless it were highly beneficial to the species and although it may be beneficial to an individual plant to be sterile with its own pollen crossfertilisation being thus ensured how can it be any advantage to a plant to be sterile with half its brethren that is with all the individuals belonging to the same form moreover if the sterility of the unions between plants of the same form had been a special acquirement we might have expected that the longstyled form fertilised by the longstyled would have been sterile in the same degree as the shortstyled fertilised by the shortstyled but this is hardly ever the case on the contrary there is sometimes the widest difference in this respect as between the two illegitimate unions of pulmonaria angustifolia and of hottonia palustris  it is a more probable view that the male and female organs in two sets of individuals have been by some means specially adapted for reciprocal action and that the sterility between the individuals of the same set or form is an incidental and purposeless result the meaning of the term incidental may be illustrated by the greater or less difficulty in grafting or budding together two plants belonging to distinct species for as this capacity is quite immaterial to the welfare of either it cannot have been specially acquired and must be the incidental result of differences in their vegetative systems but how the sexual elements of heterostyled plants came to differ from what they were whilst the species was homostyled and how they became coadapted in two sets of individuals are very obscure points we know that in the two forms of our existing heterostyled plants the pistil always differs and the stamens generally differ in length so does the stigma in structure the anthers in size and the pollengrains in diameter it appears therefore at first sight probable that organs which differ in such important respects could act on one another only in some manner for which they had been specially adapted the probability of this view is supported by the curious rule that the greater the difference in length between the pistils and stamens of the trimorphic species of lythrum and oxalis the products of which are united for reproduction by so much the greater is the infertility of the union the same rule applies to the two illegitimate unions of some dimorphic species namely primula vulgaris and pulmonaria angustifolia but it entirely fails in other cases as with hottonia palustris and linum grandiflorum we shall however best perceive the difficulty of understanding the nature and origin of the coadaptation between the reproductive organs of the two forms of heterostyled plants by considering the case of linum grandiflorum the two forms of this plant differ exclusively as far as we can see in the length of their pistils in the longstyled form the stamens equal the pistil in length but their pollen has no more effect on it than so much inorganic dust whilst this pollen fully fertilises the short pistil of the other form now it is scarcely credible that a mere difference in the length of the pistil can make a wide difference in its capacity for being fertilised we can believe this the less because with some plants for instance amsinckia spectabilis the pistil varies greatly in length without affecting the fertility of the individuals which are intercrossed so again i observed that the same plants of primula veris and vulgaris differed to an extraordinary degree in the length of their pistils during successive seasons nevertheless they yielded during these seasons exactly the same average number of seeds when left to fertilise themselves spontaneously under a net  we must therefore look to the appearance of inner or hidden constitutional differences between the individuals of a varying species of such a nature that the male element of one set is enabled to act efficiently only on the female element of another set we need not doubt about the possibility of variations in the constitution of the reproductive system of a plant for we know that some species vary so as to be completely selfsterile or completely selffertile either in an apparently spontaneous manner or from slightly changed conditions of life gartner also has shown that the individual plants of the same species vary in their sexual powers in such a manner that one will unite with a distinct species much more readily than another 66 gartner bastarderzeugung im pflanzenreich 1849 page 165 but what the nature of the inner constitutional differences may be between the sets or forms of the same varying species or between distinct species is quite unknown it seems therefore probable that the species which have become heterostyled at first varied so that two or three sets of individuals were formed differing in the length of their pistils and stamens and in other coadapted characters and that almost simultaneously their reproductive powers became modified in such a manner that the sexual elements in one set were adapted to act on the sexual elements of another set and consequently that these elements in the same set or form incidentally became illadapted for mutual interaction as in the case of distinct species i have elsewhere shown that the sterility of species when first crossed and of their hybrid offspring must also be looked at as merely an incidental result following from the special coadaptation of the sexual elements of the same species 67 origin of species 6th edition page 247 variation of animals and plants under domestication 2nd edition volume 2 page 169 the effects of cross and selffertilisation page 463 it may be well here to remark that judging from the remarkable power with which abruptly changed conditions of life act on the reproductive system of most organisms it is probable that the close adaptation of the male to the female elements in the two forms of the same heterostyled species or in all the individuals of the same ordinary species could be acquired only under longcontinued nearly uniform conditions of life we can thus understand the striking parallelism which has been shown to exist between the effects of illegitimately uniting heterostyled plants and of crossing distinct species the great difference in the degree of sterility between the various heterostyled species when illegitimately fertilised and between the two forms of the same species when similarly fertilised harmonises well with the view that the result is an incidental one which follows from changes gradually effected in their reproductive systems in order that the sexual elements of the distinct forms should act perfectly on one another  transmission of the two forms by heterostyled plants  the transmission of the two forms by heterostyled plants with respect to which many facts were given in the last chapter may perhaps be found hereafter to throw some light on their manner of development hildebrand observed that seedlings from the longstyled form of primula sinensis when fertilised with pollen from the same form were mostly longstyled and many analogous cases have since been observed by me all the known cases are given in tables 636 and 637  table 636 nature of the offspring from illegitimately fertilised dimorphic plants  column 1 species and form

17  0  we see in these two tables that the offspring from a form illegitimately fertilised with pollen from another plant of the same form belong with a few exceptions to the same form as their parents for instance out of 162 seedlings from longstyled plants of primula veris fertilised during five generations in this manner 156 were longstyled and only 6 shortstyled of 69 seedlings from p vulgaris similarly raised all were longstyled so it was with 56 seedlings from the longstyled form of the trimorphic lythrum salicaria and with numerous seedlings from the longstyled form of oxalis rosea the offspring from the shortstyled forms of dimorphic plants and from both the midstyled and shortstyled forms of trimorphic plants fertilised with their ownform pollen likewise tend to belong to the same form as their parents but not in so marked a manner as in the case of the longstyled form there are three cases in table 637 in which a form of lythrum was fertilised illegitimately with pollen from another form and in two of these cases all the offspring belonged to the same two forms as their parents whilst in the third case they belonged to all three forms  the cases hitherto given relate to illegitimate unions but hildebrand fritz muller and myself found that a very large proportion or all of the offspring from a legitimate union between any two forms of the trimorphic species of oxalis belonged to the same two forms a similar rule therefore holds good with unions which are fully fertile as with those of an illegitimate nature which are more or less sterile when some of the seedlings from a heterostyled plant belong to a different form from that of its parents hildebrand accounts for the fact by reversion for instance the longstyled parentplant of primula veris from which the 162 illegitimate seedlings in table 636 were derived in the course of five generations was itself no doubt derived from the union of a longstyled and a shortstyled parent and the 6 shortstyled seedlings may be attributed to reversion to their shortstyled progenitor but it is a surprising fact in this case and in other similar ones that the number of the offspring which thus reverted was not larger the fact is rendered still more strange in the particular instance of p veris for there was no reversion until four or five generations of longstyled plants had been raised it may be seen in both tables that the longstyled form transmits its form much more faithfully than does the shortstyled when both are fertilised with their ownform pollen and why this should be so it is difficult to conjecture unless it be that the aboriginal parentform of most heterostyled species possessed a pistil which exceeded its own stamens considerably in length 68 it may be suspected that this was the case with primula judging from the length of the pistil in several allied genera see mr j scott journal of the linnean society botany volume 8 1864 page 85 herr breitenbach found many specimens of primula elatior growing in a state of nature with some flowers on the same plant longstyled others shortstyled and others equalstyled and the longstyled form greatly preponderated in number there being 61 of this form to 9 of the shortstyled and 15 of the equalstyled i will only add that in a state of nature any single plant of a trimorphic species no doubt produces all three forms and this may be accounted for either by its several flowers being separately fertilised by both the other forms as hildebrand supposes or by pollen from both the other forms being deposited by insects on the stigma of the same flower  equalstyled varieties  the tendency of the dimorphic species of primula to produce equalstyled varieties deserves notice cases of this kind have been observed as shown in the last chapter in no less than six species namely p veris vulgaris sinensis auricula farinosa and elatior in the case of p veris the stamens resemble in length position and size of their pollengrains the stamens of the shortstyled form whilst the pistil closely resembles that of the longstyled but as it varies much in length one proper to the shortstyled form appears to have been elongated and to have assumed at the same time the functions of a longstyled pistil consequently the flowers are capable of spontaneous self fertilisation of a legitimate nature and yield a full complement of seed or even more than the number produced by ordinary flowers legitimately fertilised with p sinensis on the other hand the stamens resemble in all respects the shorter ones proper to the longstyled form whilst the pistil makes a near approach to that of the shortstyled but as it varies in length it would appear as if a longstyled pistil had been reduced in length and modified in function the flowers in this case as in the last are capable of spontaneous legitimate fertilisation and are rather more productive than ordinary flowers legitimately fertilised with p auricula and farinosa the stamens resemble those of the shortstyled form in length but those of the longstyled in the size of their pollengrains the pistil also resembles that of the longstyled so that although the stamens and pistil are of nearly equal length and consequently pollen is spontaneously deposited on the stigma yet the flowers are not legitimately fertilised and yield only a very moderate supply of seed we thus see firstly that equalstyled varieties have originated in various ways and secondly that the combination of the two forms in the same flower differs in completeness with p elatior some of the flowers on the same plant have become equalstyled instead of all of them as in the other species  mr scott has suggested that the equalstyled varieties arise through reversion to the former homostyled condition of the genus this view is supported by the remarkable fidelity with which the equalstyled variation is transmitted after it has once appeared i have shown in chapter 13 of my variation of animals and plants under domestication that any cause which disturbs the constitution tends to induce reversion and it is chiefly the cultivated species of primula which become equalstyled illegitimate fertilisation which is an abnormal process is likewise an exciting cause and with illegitimately descended long styled plants of p sinensis i have observed the first appearance and subsequent stages of this variation with some other plants of p sinensis of similar parentage the flowers appeared to have reverted to their original wild condition again some hybrids between p veris and vulgaris were strictly equalstyled and others made a near approach to this structure all these facts support the view that this variation results at least in part from reversion to the original state of the genus before the species had become heterostyled on the other hand some considerations indicate as previously remarked that the aboriginal parentform of primula had a pistil which exceeded the stamens in length the fertility of the equalstyled varieties has been somewhat modified being sometimes greater and sometimes less than that of a legitimate union another view however may be taken with respect to the origin of the equal styled varieties and their appearance may be compared with that of hermaphrodites amongst animals which properly have their sexes separated for the two sexes are combined in a monstrous hermaphrodite in a somewhat similar manner as the two sexual forms are combined in the same flower of an equal styled variety of a heterostyled species  final remarks  the existence of plants which have been rendered heterostyled is a highly remarkable phenomenon as the two or three forms of the same undoubted species differ not only in important points of structure but in the nature of their reproductive powers as far as structure is concerned the two sexes of many animals and of some plants differ to an extreme degree and in both kingdoms the same species may consist of males females and hermaphrodites certain hermaphrodite cirripedes are aided in their reproduction by a whole cluster of what i have called complemental males which differ wonderfully from the ordinary hermaphrodite form with ants we have males and females and two or three castes of sterile females or workers with termites there are as fritz muller has shown both winged and wingless males and females besides the workers but in none of these cases is there any reason to believe that the several males or several females of the same species differ in their sexual powers except in the atrophied condition of the reproductive organs in the workers of social insects many hermaphrodite animals must unite for reproduction but the necessity of such union apparently depends solely on their structure on the other hand with heterostyled dimorphic species there are two females and two sets of males and with trimorphic species three females and three sets of males which differ essentially in their sexual powers we shall perhaps best perceive the complex and extraordinary nature of the marriage arrangements of a trimorphic plant by the following illustration let us suppose that the individuals of the same species of ant always lived in triple communities and that in one of these a largesized female differing also in other characters lived with six middlesized and six smallsized males in the second community a middlesized female lived with six large and six smallsized males and in the third a smallsized female lived with six large and six middlesized males each of these three females though enabled to unite with any male would be nearly sterile with her own two sets of males and likewise with two other sets of males of the same size with her own which lived in the other two communities but she would be fully fertile when paired with a male of her own size hence the thirtysix males distributed by halfdozens in the three communities would be divided into three sets of a dozen each and these sets as well as the three females would differ from one another in their reproductive powers in exactly the same manner as do the distinct species of the same genus but it is a still more remarkable fact that young ants raised from any one of the three female ants illegitimately fertilised by a male of a different size would resemble in a whole series of relations the hybrid offspring from a cross between two distinct species of ants they would be dwarfed in stature and more or less or even utterly barren naturalists are so much accustomed to behold great diversities of structure associated with the two sexes that they feel no surprise at almost any amount of difference but differences in sexual nature have been thought to be the very touchstone of specific distinction we now see that such sexual differencesthe greater or less power of fertilising and being fertilisedmay characterise the coexisting individuals of the same species in the same manner as they characterise and have kept separate those groups of individuals produced during the lapse of ages which we rank and denominate as distinct species   chapter vii polygamous dioecious and gynodioecious plants  the conversion in various ways of hermaphrodite into dioecious plants heterostyled plants rendered dioecious rubiaceae verbenaceae polygamous and subdioecious plants euonymus fragaria the two subforms of both sexes of rhamnus and epigaea ilex gynodioecious plants thymus difference in fertility of the hermaphrodite and female individuals satureia manner in which the two forms probably originated scabiosa and other gynodioecious plants difference in the size of the corolla in the forms of polygamous dioecious and gynodioecious plants  there are several groups of plants in which all the species are dioecious and these exhibit no rudiments in the one sex of the organs proper to the other about the origin of such plants nothing is known it is possible that they may be descended from ancient lowly organised forms which had from the first their sexes separated so that they have never existed as hermaphrodites there are however many other groups of species and single ones which from being allied on all sides to hermaphrodites and from exhibiting in the female flowers plain rudiments of male organs and conversely in the male flowers rudiments of female organs we may feel sure are descended from plants which formerly had the two sexes combined in the same flower it is a curious and obscure problem how and why such hermaphrodites have been rendered bisexual  if in some individuals of a species the stamens alone were to abort females and hermaphrodites would be left existing of which many instances occur and if the female organs of the hermaphrodite were afterwards to abort the result would be a dioecious plant conversely if we imagine the female organs alone to abort in some individuals males and hermaphrodites would be left and the hermaphrodites might afterwards be converted into females  in other cases as in that of the common ashtree mentioned in the introduction the stamens are rudimentary in some individuals the pistils in others others again remaining as hermaphrodites here the modification of the two sets of organs appears to have occurred simultaneously as far as we can judge from their equal state of abortion if the hermaphrodites were supplanted by the individuals having separated sexes and if these latter were equalised in number a strictly dioecious species would be formed  there is much difficulty in understanding why hermaphrodite plants should ever have been rendered dioecious there would be no such conversion unless pollen was already carried regularly by insects or by the wind from one individual to the other for otherwise every step towards dioeciousness would lead towards sterility as we must assume that crossfertilisation was assured before an hermaphrodite could be changed into a dioecious plant we may conclude that the conversion has not been effected for the sake of gaining the great benefits which follow from crossfertilisation we can however see that if a species were subjected to unfavourable conditions from severe competition with other plants or from any other cause the production of the male and female elements and the maturation of the ovules by the same individual might prove too great a strain on its powers and the separation of the sexes would then be highly beneficial this however would be effected only under the contingency of a reduced number of seeds produced by the females alone being sufficient to keep up the stock  there is another way of looking at the subject which partially removes a difficulty that appears at first sight insuperable namely that during the conversion of an hermaphrodite into a dioecious plant the male organs must abort in some individuals and the female organs in others yet as all are exposed to the same conditions it might have been expected that those which varied would tend to vary in the same manner as a general rule only a few individuals of a species vary simultaneously in the same manner and there is no improbability in the assumption that some few individuals might produce larger seeds than the average better stocked with nourishment if the production of such seeds were highly beneficial to a species and on this head there can be little doubt the variety with the large seeds would tend to increase 71 see the facts given in the effects of cross and selffertilisation page 353 but in accordance with the law of compensation we might expect that the individuals which produced such seeds would if living under severe conditions tend to produce less and less pollen so that their anthers would be reduced in size and might ultimately become rudimentary this view occurred to me owing to a statement by sir je smith that there are female and hermaphrodite plants of serratula tinctoria and that the seeds of the former are larger than those of the hermaphrodite form 72 transactions of the linnean society volume 8 page 600 it may also be worth while to recall the case of the midstyled form of lythrum salicaria which produces a larger number of seeds than the other forms and has somewhat smaller pollengrains which have less fertilising power than those of the corresponding stamens in the other two forms but whether the larger number of seeds is the indirect cause of the diminished power of the pollen or vice versa i know not as soon as the anthers in a certain number of individuals became reduced in size in the manner just suggested or from any other cause the other individuals would have to produce a larger supply of pollen and such increased development would tend to reduce the female organs through the law of compensation so as ultimately to leave them in a rudimentary condition and the species would then become dioecious  instead of the first change occurring in the female organs we may suppose that the male ones first varied so that some individuals produced a larger supply of pollen this would be beneficial under certain circumstances such as a change in the nature of the insects which visited the flowers or in their becoming more anemophilous for such plants require an enormous quantity of pollen the increased action of the male organs would tend to affect through compensation the female organs of the same flower and the final result would be that the species would consist of males and hermaphrodites but it is of no use considering this case and other analogous ones for as stated in the introduction the coexistence of male and hermaphrodite plants is excessively rare  it is no valid objection to the foregoing views that changes of such a nature would be effected with extreme slowness for we shall presently see good reason to believe that various hermaphrodite plants have become or are becoming dioecious by many and excessively small steps in the case of polygamous species which exist as males females and hermaphrodites the latter would have to be supplanted before the species could become strictly dioecious but the extinction of the hermaphrodite form would probably not be difficult as a complete separation of the sexes appears often to be in some way beneficial the males and females would also have to be equalised in number or produced in some fitting proportion for the effectual fertilisation of the females  there are no doubt many unknown laws which govern the suppression of the male or female organs in hermaphrodite plants quite independently of any tendency in them to become monoecious dioecious or polygamous we see this in those hermaphrodites which from the rudiments still present manifestly once possessed more stamens or pistils than they now doeven twice as many as a whole verticil has often been suppressed robert brown remarks that the order of reduction or abortion of the stamina in any natural family may with some confidence be predicted by observing in other members of the family in which their number is complete the order of the dehiscence of the anthers 73 transactions of the linnean society volume 12 page 98 or miscellaneous works volume 2 pages 27881 for the lesser permanence of an organ is generally connected with its lesser perfection and he judges of perfection by priority of development he also states that whenever there is a separation of the sexes in an hermaphrodite plant which bears flowers on a simple spike it is the females which expand first and this he likewise attributes to the female sex being the more perfect of the two but why the female should be thus valued he does not explain  plants under cultivation or changed conditions of life frequently become sterile and the male organs are much oftener affected than the female though the latter alone are sometimes affected the sterility of the stamens is generally accompanied by a reduction in their size and we may feel sure from a widespread analogy that both the male and female organs would become rudimentary in the course of many generations if they failed altogether to perform their proper functions according to gartner if the anthers on a plant are contabescent and when this occurs it is always at a very early period of growth the female organs are sometimes precociously developed 74 beitrage zur kenntniss etc page 117 et seq the whole subject of the sterility of plants from various causes has been discussed in my variation of animals and plants under domestication chapter 18 2nd edition volume 2 pages 14656 i mention this case as it appears to be one of compensation so again is the well known fact that plants which increase largely by stolons or other such means are often utterly barren with a large proportion of their pollengrains in a worthless condition  hildebrand has shown that with hermaphrodite plants which are strongly proterandrous the stamens in the flowers which open first sometimes abort and this seems to follow from their being useless as no pistils are then ready to be fertilised conversely the pistils in the flowers which open last sometimes abort as when they are ready for fertilisation all the pollen has been shed he further shows by means of a series of gradations amongst the compositae that a tendency from the causes just specified to produce either male or female florets sometimes spreads to all the florets on the same head and sometimes even to the whole plant 75 ueber die geschlechtsverhaltnisse bei den compositen 1869 page 89 and in this latter case the species becomes dioecious in those rare instances mentioned in the introduction in which some of the individuals of both monoecious and hermaphrodite plants are proterandrous others being proterogynous their conversion into a dioecious condition would probably be much facilitated as they already consist of two bodies of individuals differing to a certain extent in their reproductive functions  dimorphic heterostyled plants offer still more strongly marked facilities for becoming dioecious for they likewise consist of two bodies of individuals in approximately equal numbers and what probably is more important both the male and female organs differ in the two forms not only in structure but in function in nearly the same manner as do the reproductive organs of two distinct species belonging to the same genus now if two species are subjected to changed conditions though of the same nature it is notorious that they are often affected very differently therefore the male organs for instance in one form of a heterostyled plant might be affected by those unknown causes which induce abortion differently from the homologous but functionally different organs in the other form and so conversely with the female organs thus the great difficulty before alluded to is much lessened in understanding how any cause whatever could lead to the simultaneous reduction and ultimate suppression of the male organs in half the individuals of a species and of the female organs in the other half whilst all were subjected to exactly the same conditions of life  that such reduction or suppression has occurred in some heterostyled plants is almost certain the rubiaceae contain more heterostyled genera than any other family and from their wide distribution we may infer that many of them became heterostyled at a remote period so that there will have been ample time for some of the species to have been since rendered dioecious asa gray informs me that coprosma is dioecious and that it is closely allied through nertera to mitchella which as we know is a heterostyled dimorphic species in the male flowers of coprosma the stamens are exserted and in the female flowers the stigmas so that judging from the affinities of the above three genera it seems probable that an ancient shortstyled form bearing long stamens with large anthers and large pollengrains as in the case of several rubiaceous genera has been converted into the male coprosma and that an ancient longstyled form with short stamens small anthers and small pollengrains has been converted into the female form but according to mr meehan mitchella itself is dioecious in some districts for he says that one form has small sessile anthers without a trace of pollen the pistil being perfect while in another form the stamens are perfect and the pistil rudimentary 76 proceedings of the academy of sciences of philadelphia july 28 1868 page 183 he adds that plants may be observed in the autumn bearing an abundant crop of berries and others without a single one should these statements be confirmed mitchella will be proved to be heterostyled in one district and dioecious in another  asperula is likewise a rubiaceous genus and from the published description of the two forms of a scoparia an inhabitant of tasmania i did not doubt that it was heterostyled but on examining some flowers sent me by dr hooker they proved to be dioecious the male flowers have large anthers and a very small ovarium surmounted by a mere vestige of a stigma without any style whilst the female flowers possess a large ovarium the anthers being rudimentary and apparently quite destitute of pollen considering how many rubiaceous genera are heterostyled it is a reasonable suspicion that this asperula is descended from a heterostyled progenitor but we should be cautious on this head for there is no improbability in a homostyled rubiaceous plant becoming dioecious moreover in an allied plant galium cruciatum the female organs have been suppressed in most of the lower flowers whilst the upper ones remain hermaphrodite and here we have a modification of the sexual organs without any connection with heterostylism  mr thwaites informs me that in ceylon various rubiaceous plants are heterostyled but in the case of discospermum one of the two forms is always barren the ovary containing about two aborted ovules in each loculus whilst in the other form each loculus contains several perfect ovules so that the species appears to be strictly dioecious  most of the species of the south american genus aegiphila a member of the verbenaceae apparently are heterostyled and both fritz muller and myself thought that this was the case with ae obdurata so closely did its flowers resemble those of the heterostyled species but on examining the flowers the anthers of the longstyled form were found to be entirely destitute of pollen and less than half the size of those in the other form the pistil being perfectly developed on the other hand in the shortstyled form the stigmas are reduced to half their proper length having also an abnormal appearance whilst the stamens are perfect this plant therefore is dioecious and we may i think conclude that a shortstyled progenitor bearing long stamens exserted beyond the corolla has been converted into the male and a longstyled progenitor with fully developed stigmas into the female  from the number of bad pollengrains in the small anthers of the short stamens of the longstyled form of pulmonaria angustifolia we may suspect that this form is tending to become female but it does not appear that the other or shortstyled form is becoming more masculine certain appearances countenance the belief that the reproductive system of phlox subulata is likewise undergoing a change of some kind  i have now given the few cases known to me in which heterostyled plants appear with some considerable degree of probability to have been rendered dioecious nor ought we to expect to find many such cases for the number of heterostyled species is by no means large at least in europe where they could hardly have escaped notice therefore the number of dioecious species which owe their origin to the transformation of heterostyled plants is probably not so large as might have been anticipated from the facilities which they offer for such conversion  in searching for cases like the foregoing ones i have been led to examine some dioecious or subdioecious plants which are worth describing chiefly as they show by what fine gradations hermaphrodites may pass into polygamous or dioecious species  polygamous dioecious and subdioecious plants  euonymus europaeus celastrineae  figure 712 euonymus europaeus left hermaphrodite or male right female  the spindletree is described in all the botanical works which i have consulted as an hermaphrodite asa gray speaks of the flowers of the american species as perfect whilst those in the allied genus celastrus are said to be polygamo dioecious if a number of bushes of our spindletree be examined about half will be found to have stamens equal in length to the pistil with welldeveloped anthers the pistil being likewise to all appearance well developed the other half have a perfect pistil with the stamens short bearing rudimentary anthers destitute of pollen so that these bushes are females all the flowers on the same plant present the same structure the female corolla is smaller than that on the polleniferous bushes the two forms are shown in figure 712  i did not at first doubt that this species existed under an hermaphrodite and female form but we shall presently see that some of the bushes which appear to be hermaphrodites never produce fruit and these are in fact males the species therefore is polygamous in the sense in which i use the term and trioecious the flowers are frequented by many diptera and some small hymenoptera for the sake of the nectar secreted by the disc but i did not see a single bee at work nevertheless the other insects sufficed to fertilise effectually female bushes growing at a distance of even 30 yards from any polleniferous bush  the small anthers borne by the short stamens of the female flowers are well formed and dehisce properly but i could never find in them a single grain of pollen it is somewhat difficult to compare the length of the pistils in the two forms as they vary somewhat in this respect and continue to grow after the anthers are mature the pistils therefore in old flowers on a polleniferous plant are often of considerably greater length than in young flowers on a female plant on this account the pistils from five flowers from so many hermaphrodite or male bushes were compared with those from five female bushes before the anthers had dehisced and whilst the rudimentary ones were of a pink colour and not at all shrivelled these two sets of pistils did not differ in length or if there was any difference those of the polleniferous flowers were rather the longest in one hermaphrodite plant which produced during three years very few and poor fruit the pistil much exceeded in length the stamens bearing perfect and as yet closed anthers and i never saw such a case on any female plant it is a surprising fact that the pistil in the male and in the semisterile hermaphrodite flowers has not been reduced in length seeing that it performs very poorly or not at all its proper function the stigmas in the two forms are exactly alike and in some of the polleniferous plants which never produced any fruit i found that the surface of the stigma was viscid so that pollengrains adhered to it and had exserted their tubes the ovules are of equal size in the two forms therefore the most acute botanist judging only by structure would never have suspected that some of the bushes were in function exclusively males  thirteen bushes growing near one another in a hedge consisted of eight females quite destitute of pollen and of five hermaphrodites with welldeveloped anthers in the autumn the eight females were well covered with fruit excepting one which bore only a moderate number of the five hermaphrodites one bore a dozen or two fruits and the remaining four bushes several dozen but their number was as nothing compared with those on the female bushes for a single branch between two and three feet in length from one of the latter yielded more than any one of the hermaphrodite bushes the difference in the amount of fruit produced by the two sets of bushes is all the more striking as from the sketches above given it is obvious that the stigmas of the polleniferous flowers can hardly fail to receive their own pollen whilst the fertilisation of the female flowers depends on pollen being brought to them by flies and the smaller hymenoptera which are far from being such efficient carriers as bees  i now determined to observe more carefully during successive seasons some bushes growing in another place about a mile distant as the female bushes were so highly productive i marked only two of them with the letters a and b and five polleniferous bushes with the letters c to g i may premise that the year 1865 was highly favourable for the fruiting of all the bushes especially for the polleniferous ones some of which were quite barren except under such favourable conditions the season of 1864 was unfavourable in 1863 the female a produced some fruit in 1864 only 9 and in 1865 97 fruit the female b in 1863 was covered with fruit in 1864 it bore 28 and in 1865 innumerable very fine fruits i may add that three other female trees growing close by were observed but only during 1863 and they then bore abundantly with respect to the polleniferous bushes the one marked c did not bear a single fruit during the years 1863 and 1864 but during 1865 it produced no less than 92 fruit which however were very poor i selected one of the finest branches with 15 fruit and these contained 20 seeds or on an average 133 per fruit i then took by hazard 15 fruit from an adjoining female bush and these contained 43 seeds that is more than twice as many or on an average 286 per fruit many of the fruits from the female bushes included four seeds and only one had a single seed whereas not one fruit from the polleniferous bushes contained four seeds moreover when the two lots of seeds were compared it was manifest that those from the female bushes were the larger the second polleniferous bush d bore in 1863 about two dozen fruitin 1864 only 3 very poor fruit each containing a single seedand in 1865 20 equally poor fruit lastly the three polleniferous bushes e f and g did not produce a single fruit during the three years 1863 1864 and 1865  we thus see that the female bushes differ somewhat in their degree of fertility and the polleniferous ones in the most marked manner we have a perfect gradation from the female bush b which in 1865 was covered with innumerable fruitsthrough the female a which produced during the same year 97through the polleniferous bush c which produced this year 92 fruits these however containing a very low average number of seeds of small sizethrough the bush d which produced only 20 poor fruitto the three bushes e f and g which did not this year or during the two previous years produce a single fruit if these latter bushes and the more fertile female ones were to supplant the others the spindletree would be as strictly dioecious in function as any plant in the world this case appears to me very interesting as showing how gradually an hermaphrodite plant may be converted into a dioecious one 77 according to fritz muller botanische zeitung 1870 page 151 a chamissoa amaranthaceae in southern brazil is in nearly the same state as our euonymus the ovules are equally developed in the two forms in the female the pistil is perfect whilst the anthers are entirely destitute of pollen in the polleniferous form the pistil is short and the stigmas never separate from one another so that although their surfaces are covered with fairly welldeveloped papillae they cannot be fertilised these latter plants do not commonly yield any fruit and are therefore in function males nevertheless on one occasion fritz muller found flowers of this kind in which the stigmas had separated and they produced some fruit  seeing how general it is for organs which are almost or quite functionless to be reduced in size it is remarkable that the pistils of the polleniferous plants should equal or even exceed in length those of the highly fertile female plants this fact formerly led me to suppose that the spindletree had once been heterostyled the hermaphrodite and male plants having been originally long styled with the pistils since reduced in length but with the stamens retaining their former dimensions whilst the female plant had been originally short styled with the pistil in its present state but with the stamens since greatly reduced and rendered rudimentary a conversion of this kind is at least possible although it is the reverse of that which appears actually to have occurred with some rubiaceous genera and aegiphila for with these plants the shortstyled form has become the male and the longstyled the female it is however a more simple view that sufficient time has not elapsed for the reduction of the pistil in the male and hermaphrodite flowers of our euonymus though this view does not account for the pistils in the polleniferous flowers being sometimes longer than those in the female flowers  fragaria vesca virginiana chiloensis etc rosaceae  a tendency to the separation of the sexes in the cultivated strawberry seems to be much more strongly marked in the united states than in europe and this appears to be the result of the direct action of climate on the reproductive organs in the best account which i have seen it is stated that many of the varieties in the united states consist of three forms namely females which produce a heavy crop of fruitof hermaphrodites which seldom produce other than a very scanty crop of inferior and imperfect berriesand of males which produce none 78 mr leonard wray gardeners chronicle 1861 page 716 the most skilful cultivators plant seven rows of female plants then one row of hermaphrodites and so on throughout the field the males bear large the hermaphrodites midsized and the females small flowers the latter plants produce few runners whilst the two other forms produce many consequently as has been observed both in england and in the united states the polleniferous forms increase rapidly and tend to supplant the females we may therefore infer that much more vital force is expended in the production of ovules and fruit than in the production of pollen another species the hautbois strawberry f elatior is more strictly dioecious but lindley made by selection an hermaphrodite stock 79

caspary left longstyled male right shortstyled male  figure 714 rhamnus catharticus left longstyled female right shortstyled female  this plant is well known to be dioecious my son william found the two sexes growing in about equal numbers in the isle of wight and sent me specimens together with observations on them each sex consists of two subforms the two forms of the male differ in their pistils in some plants it is quite small without any distinct stigma in others the pistil is much more developed with the papillae on the stigmatic surfaces moderately large the ovules in both kinds of males are in an aborted condition on my mentioning this case to professor caspary he examined several male plants in the botanic gardens at konigsberg where there were no females and sent me the drawings in figure 713  in the english plants the petals are not so greatly reduced as represented in this drawing my son observed that those males which had their pistils moderately welldeveloped bore slightly larger flowers and what is very remarkable their pollengrains exceeded by a little in diameter those of the males with greatly reduced pistils this fact is opposed to the belief that the present species was once heterostyled for in this case it might have been expected that the shorterstyled plants would have had larger pollengrains  in the female plants the stamens are in an extremely rudimentary condition much more so than the pistils in the males the pistil varies considerably in length in the female plants so that they may be divided into two subforms according to the length of this organ both the petals and sepals are decidedly smaller in the females than in the males and the sepals do not turn downwards as do those of the male flowers when mature all the flowers on the same male or same female bush though subject to some variability belong to the same subform and as my son never experienced any difficulty in deciding under which class a plant ought to be included he believes that the two subforms of the same sex do not graduate into one another i can form no satisfactory theory how the four forms of this plant originated  rhamnus lanceolatus  this plant exists in the united states as i am informed by professor asa gray under two hermaphrodite forms in the one which may be called the shortstyled the flowers are subsolitary and include a pistil about twothirds or only half as long as that in the other form it has also shorter stigmas the stamens are of equal length in the two forms but the anthers of the shortstyled contain rather less pollen as far as i could judge from a few dried flowers my son compared the pollengrains from the two forms and those from the longstyled flowers were to those from the shortstyled on an average from ten measurements as 10 to 9 in diameter so that the two hermaphrodite forms of this species resemble in this respect the two male forms of r catharticus the longstyled form is not so common as the shortstyled the latter is said by asa gray to be the more fruitful of the two as might have been expected from its appearing to produce less pollen and from the grains being of smaller size it is therefore the more highly feminine of the two the longstyled form produces a greater number of flowers which are clustered together instead of being sub solitary they yield some fruit but as just stated are less fruitful than the other form so that this form appears to be the more masculine of the two on the supposition that we have here an hermaphrodite plant becoming dioecious there are two points deserving notice firstly the greater length of the pistil in the incipient male form and we have met with a nearly similar case in the male and hermaphrodite forms of euonymus compared with the females secondly the larger size of the pollengrains in the more masculine flowers which perhaps may be attributed to their having retained their normal size whilst those in the incipient female flowers have been reduced the longstyled form of r lanceolatus seems to correspond with the males of r catharticus which have a longer pistil and larger pollengrains light will perhaps be thrown on the nature of the forms in this genus as soon as the power of both kinds of pollen on both stigmas is ascertained several other species of rhamnus are said to be dioecious or subdioecious 710 lecoq

 this plant appears to be in nearly the same state as rhamnus catharticus it is described by asa gray as existing under four forms 711 american journal of science july 1876 also the american naturalist 1876 page 490 1 with long style perfect stigma and short abortive stamens 2 shorter style but with stigma equally perfect short abortive stamens these two female forms amounted to 20 per cent of the specimens received from one locality in maine but all the fruiting specimens belonged to the first form 3 style long as in number 1 but with stigma imperfect stamens perfect 4 style shorter than in the last stigma imperfect stamens perfect these two latter forms are evidently males therefore as asa gray remarks the flowers may be classified into two kinds each with two modifications the two main kinds characterised by the nature and perfection of the stigma along with more or less abortion of the stamens their modifications by the length of the style mr meehan has described the extreme variability of the corolla and calyx in this plant and shows that it is dioecious 712 variations in epigaea repens proc acad nat soc of philadelphia may 1868 page 153 it is much to be wished that the pollengrains in the two male forms should be compared and their fertilising power tried on the two female forms  ilex aquifolium aquifoliaceae  in the several works which i have consulted one author alone says that the holly is dioecious 713 vaucher hist phys des plantes deurope 1841 tome 2 page 11 during several years i have examined many plants but have never found one that was really hermaphrodite i mention this genus because the stamens in the female flowers although quite destitute of pollen are but slightly and sometimes not at all shorter than the perfect stamens in the male flowers in the latter the ovary is small and the pistil is almost aborted the filaments of the perfect stamens adhere for a greater length to the petals than in the female flowers the corolla of the latter is rather smaller than that of the male the male trees produce a greater number of flowers than the females asa gray informs me that i opaca which represents in the united states our common holly appears judging from dried flowers to be in a similar state and so it is according to vaucher with several other but not with all the species of the genus  gynodioecious plants  the plants hitherto described either show a tendency to become dioecious or apparently have become so within a recent period but the species now to be considered consist of hermaphrodites and females without males and rarely show any tendency to be dioecious as far as can be judged from their present condition and from the absence of species having separated sexes within the same groups species belonging to the present class which i have called gyno dioecious are found in various widely distinct families but are much more common in the labiatae as has long been noticed by botanists than in any other group such cases have been noticed by myself in thymus serpyllum and vulgaris satureia hortensis origanum vulgare and mentha hirsuta and by others in nepeta glechoma mentha vulgaris and aquatica and prunella vulgaris in these two latter species the female form according to h muller is infrequent to these must be added dracocephalum moldavicum melissa officinalis and clinopodium and hyssopus officinalis 714 h muller die befruchtung der blumen 1873 and nature 1873 page 161 vaucher plantes deurope tome 3 page 611 for dracocephalum schimper as quoted by braun annals and magazine of natural history 2nd series volume 18 1856 page 380 lecoq geographie bot de leurope tome 8 pages 33 38 44 etc both vaucher and lecoq were mistaken in thinking that several of the plants named in the text are dioecious they appear to have assumed that the hermaphrodite form was a male perhaps they were deceived by the pistil not becoming fully developed and of proper length until some time after the anthers have dehisced in the two lastnamed plants the female form likewise appears to be rare for i raised many seedlings of both and all were hermaphrodites it has already been remarked in the introduction that androdioecious species as they may be called or those which consist of hermaphrodites and males are extremely rare or hardly exist  thymus serpyllum  the hermaphrodite plants present nothing particular in the state of their reproductive organs and so it is in all the following cases the females of the present species produce rather fewer flowers and have somewhat smaller corollas than the hermaphrodites so that near torquay where this plant abounds i could after a little practice distinguish the two forms whilst walking quickly past them according to vaucher the smaller size of the corolla is common to the females of most or all of the abovementioned labiatae the pistil of the female though somewhat variable in length is generally shorter with the margins of the stigma broader and formed of more lax tissue than that of the hermaphrodite the stamens in the female vary excessively in length they are generally enclosed within the tube of the corolla and their anthers do not contain any sound pollen but after long search i found a single plant with the stamens moderately exserted and their anthers contained a very few fullsized grains together with a multitude of minute empty ones in some females the stamens are extremely short and their minute anthers though divided into the two normal cells or loculi contained not a trace of pollen in others again the anthers did not exceed in diameter the filaments which supported them and were not divided into two loculi judging from what i have myself seen and from the descriptions of others all the plants in britain germany and near mentone are in the state just described and i have never found a single flower with an aborted pistil it is therefore remarkable that according to delpino this plant near florence is generally trimorphic consisting of males with aborted pistils females with aborted stamens and hermaphrodites 715 sull opera la distribuzione dei sessi nelle piante etc 1867 page 7 with respect to germany h muller die befruchtung etc page 327  i found it very difficult to judge of the proportional number of the two forms at torquay they often grow mingled together but with large patches consisting of one form alone at first i thought that the two were nearly equal in number but on examining every plant which grew close to the edge of a little overhanging dry cliff about 200 yards in length i found only 12 females all the rest some hundreds in number being hermaphrodites again on an extensive gently sloping bank which was so thickly covered with this plant that viewed from the distance of half a mile it appeared of a pink colour i could not discover a single female therefore the hermaphrodites must greatly exceed in number the females at least in the localities examined by me a very dry station apparently favours the presence of the female form with some of the other abovenamed labiatae the nature of the soil or climate likewise seems to determine the presence of one or both forms thus with nepeta glechoma mr hart found in 1873 that all the plants which he examined near kilkenny in ireland were females whilst all near bath were hermaphrodites and near hertford both forms were present but with a preponderance of hermaphrodites 716 nature june 1873 page 162 it would however be a mistake to suppose that the nature of the conditions determines the form independently of inheritance for i sowed in the same small bed seeds of t serpyllum gathered at torquay from the female alone and these produced an abundance of both forms there is every reason to believe from large patches consisting of the same form that the same individual plant however much it may spread always retains the same form in two distant gardens i found masses of the lemonthyme t citriodorus a var of t serpyllum which i was informed had grown there during many years and every flower was female  with respect to the fertility of the two forms i marked at torquay a large hermaphrodite and a large female plant of nearly equal sizes and when the seeds were ripe i gathered all the heads the two heaps were of very nearly equal bulk but the heads from the female plant numbered 160 and their seeds weighed 87 grains whilst those from the hermaphrodite plant numbered 200 and their seeds weighed only 49 grains so that the seeds from the female plant were to those from the hermaphrodite as 100 to 56 in weight if the relative weight of the seeds from an equal number of flowerheads from the two forms be compared the ratio is as 100 for the female to 45 for the hermaphrodite form  thymus vulgaris  figure 715 thymus vulgaris magnified left hermaphrodite right two females  the common garden thyme resembles in almost every respect t serpyllum the same slight differences between the stigmas of the two forms could be perceived in the females the stamens are not generally quite so much reduced as in the same form of t serpyllum in some specimens sent me from mentone by mr moggridge together with the sketches in figure 715 the anthers of the female though small were well formed but they contained very little pollen and not a single sound grain could be detected eighteen seedlings were raised from purchased seed sown in the same small bed and these consisted of seven hermaphrodites and eleven females they were left freely exposed to the visits of bees and no doubt every female flower was fertilised for on placing under the microscope a large number of stigmas from female plants not one could be found to which pollengrains of thyme did not adhere the seeds were carefully collected from the eleven female plants and they weighed 987 grains and those from the seven hermaphrodites 365 grains this gives for an equal number of plants the ratio of 100 to 58 and we here see as in the last case how much more fertile the females are than the hermaphrodites these two lots of seeds were sown separately in two adjoining beds and the seedlings from both the hermaphrodite and female parentplants consisted of both forms  satureia hortensis  eleven seedlings were raised in separate pots in a hotbed and afterwards kept in the greenhouse they consisted of ten females and of a single hermaphrodite whether or not the conditions to which they had been subjected caused the great excess of females i do not know in the females the pistil is rather longer than that of the hermaphrodite and the stamens are mere rudiments with minute colourless anthers destitute of pollen the windows of the greenhouse were left open and the flowers were incessantly visited by humble and hive bees although the ten females did not produce a single grain of pollen yet they were all thoroughly well fertilised by the one hermaphrodite plant and this is an interesting fact it should be added that no other plant of this species grew in my garden the seeds were collected from the finest female plant and they weighed 78 grains whilst those from the hermaphrodite which was a rather larger plant than the female weighed only 332 grains that is in the ratio of 100 to 43 the female form therefore is very much more fertile than the hermaphrodite as in the two last cases but the hermaphrodite was necessarily selffertilised and this probably diminished its fertility  we may now consider the probable means by which so many of the labiatae have been separated into two forms and the advantages thus gained h muller supposes that originally some individuals varied so as to produce more conspicuous flowers and that insects habitually visited these first and then dusted with their pollen visited and fertilised the less conspicuous flowers 717 die befruchtung der blumen pages 319 326 the production of pollen by the latter plants would thus be rendered superfluous and it would be advantageous to the species that their stamens should abort so as to save useless expenditure they would thus be converted into females but another view may be suggested as the production of a large supply of seeds evidently is of high importance to many plants and as we have seen in the three foregoing cases that the females produce many more seeds than the hermaphrodites increased fertility seems to me the more probable cause of the formation and separation of the two forms from the data above given it follows that ten plants of thymus serpyllum if half consisted of hermaphrodites and half of females would yield seeds compared with ten hermaphrodite plants in the ratio of 100 to 72 under similar circumstances the ratio with satureia hortensis subject to the doubt from the selffertilisation of the hermaphrodite would be as 100 to 60 whether the two forms originated in certain individuals varying and producing more seed than usual and consequently producing less pollen or in the stamens of certain individuals tending from some unknown cause to abort and consequently producing more seed it is impossible to decide but in either case if the tendency to the increased production of seed were steadily favoured the result would be the complete abortion of the male organs i shall presently discuss the cause of the smaller size of the female corolla  scabiosa arvensis dipsaceae  it has been shown by h muller that this species exists in germany under an hermaphrodite and female form 718 die befruchtung der blumen page 368 the two forms occur not only in germany but in england and france lecoq geographie bot 1857 tome 6 pages 473 477 says that male plants as well as hermaphrodites and females coexist it is however possible that he may have been deceived by the flowers being so strongly proterandrous from what lecoq says s succisa likewise appears to occur under two forms in france in my neighbourhood kent the female plants do not nearly equal in number the hermaphrodites the stamens of the females vary much in their degree of abortion in some plants they are quite short and produce no pollen in others they reach to the mouth of the corolla but their anthers are not half the proper size never dehisce and contain but few pollengrains these being colourless and of small diameter the hermaphrodite flowers are strongly proterandrous and h muller shows that whilst all the stigmas on the same flowerhead are mature at nearly the same time the stamens dehisce one after the other so that there is a great excess of pollen which serves to fertilise the female plants as the production of pollen by one set of plants is thus rendered superfluous their male organs have become more or less completely aborted should it be hereafter proved that the female plants yield as is probable more seeds than the hermaphrodites i should be inclined to extend the same view to this plant as to the labiatae i have also observed the existence of two forms in our endemic s succisa and in the exotic s atropurpurea in the latter plant differently to what occurs in s arvensis the female flowers especially the larger circumferential ones are smaller than those of the hermaphrodite form according to lecoq the female flowerheads of s succisa are likewise smaller than those of what he calls the male plants but which are probably hermaphrodites  echium vulgare boragineae  the ordinary hermaphrodite form appears to be proterandrous and nothing more need be said about it the female differs in having a much smaller corolla and shorter pistil but a welldeveloped stigma the stamens are short the anthers do not contain any sound pollengrains but in their place yellow incoherent cells which do not swell in water some plants were in an intermediate condition that is had one or two or three stamens of proper length with perfect anthers the other stamens being rudimentary in one such plant half of one anther contained green perfect pollengrains and the other half yellowish green imperfect grains both forms produced seed but i neglected to observe whether in equal numbers as i thought that the state of the anthers might be due to some fungoid growth i examined them both in the bud and mature state but could find no trace of mycelium in 1862 many female plants were found and in 1864 32 plants were collected in two localities exactly half of which were hermaphrodites fourteen were females and two in an intermediate condition in 1866 15 plants were collected in another locality and these consisted of four hermaphrodites and eleven females i may add that this season was a wet one which shows that the abortion of the stamens can hardly be due to the dryness of the sites where the plants grew as i at one time thought probable seeds from an hermaphrodite were sown in my garden and of the 23 seedlings raised one belonged to the intermediate form all the others being hermaphrodites though two or three of them had unusually short stamens i have consulted several botanical works but have found no record of this plant varying in the manner here described  plantago lanceolata plantagineae  delpino states that this plant presents in italy three forms which graduate from an anemophilous into an entomophilous condition according to h muller there are only two forms in germany neither of which show any special adaptation for insect fertilisation and both appear to be hermaphrodites 719 die befruchtung etc page 342 but i have found in two localities in england female and hermaphrodite forms existing together and the same fact has been noticed by others 720 mr cw crocker the gardeners chronicle 1864 page 294 mr w marshall writes to me to the same effect from ely the females are less frequent than the hermaphrodites their stamens are short and their anthers which are of a brighter green whilst young than those of the other form dehisce properly yet contain either no pollen or a small amount of imperfect grains of variable size all the flowerheads on a plant belong to the same form it is well known that this species is strongly proterogynous and i found that the protruding stigmas of both the hermaphrodite and female flowers were penetrated by pollentubes whilst their own anthers were immature and had not escaped out of the bud plantago media does not present two forms but it appears from asa grays description that such is the case with four of the north american species 721 manual of the botany of the northern united states 2nd edition 1856 page 269 see also american journal of science november 1862 page 419 and proceedings of the american academy of science october 14 1862 page 53 the corolla does not properly expand in the short stamened form of these plants  cnicus serratula eriophorum  in the compositae cnicus palustris and acaulis are said by sir je smith to exist as hermaphrodites and females the former being the more frequent with serratula tinctoria a regular gradation may be followed from the hermaphrodite to the female form in one of the latter plants the stamens were so tall that the anthers embraced the style as in the hermaphrodites but they contained only a few grains of pollen and these in an aborted condition in another female on the other hand the anthers were much more reduced in size than is usual lastly dr dickie has shown that with eriophorum angustifolium cyperaceae hermaphrodite and female forms exist in scotland and the arctic regions both of which yield seed 722 sir je smith transactions of the linnean society volume 13 page 599 dr dickie journal of the linnean society botany volume 9 1865 page 161  it is a curious fact that in all the foregoing polygamous dioecious and gyno dioecious plants in which any difference has been observed in the size of the corolla in the two or three forms it is rather larger in the females which have their stamens more or less or quite rudimentary than in the hermaphrodites or males this holds good with euonymus rhamnus catharticus ilex fragaria all or at least most of the beforenamed labiatae scabiosa atropurpurea and echium vulgare so it is according to von mohl with cardamine amara geranium sylvaticum myosotis and salvia on the other hand as von mohl remarks when a plant produces hermaphrodite flowers and others which are males owing to the more or less complete abortion of the female organs the corollas of the males are not at all increased in size or only exceptionally and in a slight degree as in acer 723 botanische zeitung 1863 page 326 it seems therefore probable that the decreased size of the female corollas in the foregoing cases is due to a tendency to abortion spreading from the stamens to the petals we see how intimately these organs are related in double flowers in which the stamens are readily converted into petals indeed some botanists believe that petals do not consist of leaves directly metamorphosed but of metamorphosed stamens that the lessened size of the corolla in the above case is in some manner an indirect result of the modification of the reproductive organs is supported by the fact that in rhamnus catharticus not only the petals but the green and inconspicuous sepals of the female have been reduced in size and in the strawberry the flowers are largest in the males midsized in the hermaphrodites and smallest in the females these latter casesthe variability in the size of the corolla in some of the above species for instance in the common thymetogether with the fact that it never differs greatly in size in the two formsmake me doubt much whether natural selection has come into playthat is whether in accordance with h mullers belief the advantage derived from the polleniferous flowers being visited first by insects has been sufficient to lead to a gradual reduction of the corolla of the female we should bear in mind that as the hermaphrodite is the normal form its corolla has probably retained its original size 724 it does not appear to me that kerners view die schutzmittel des pollens 1873 page 56 can be accepted in the present cases namely that the larger corolla in the hermaphrodites and males serves to protect their pollen from rain in the genus thymus for instance the aborted anthers of the female are much better protected than the perfect ones of the hermaphrodite an objection to the above view should not be passed over namely that the abortion of the stamens in the females ought to have added through the law of compensation to the size of the corolla and this perhaps would have occurred had not the expenditure saved by the abortion of the stamens been directed to the female reproductive organs so as to give to this form increased fertility

drosera miscellaneous observations on various other cleistogamic plants anemophilous species producing cleistogamic flowers leersia perfect flowers rarely developed summary and concluding remarks on the origin of cleistogamic flowers the chief conclusions which may be drawn from the observations in this volume  it was known even before the time of linnaeus that certain plants produced two kinds of flowers ordinary open and minute closed ones and this fact formerly gave rise to warm controversies about the sexuality of plants these closed flowers have been appropriately named cleistogamic by dr kuhn 81 botanische zeitung 1867 page 65 they are remarkable from their small size and from never opening so that they resemble buds their petals are rudimentary or quite aborted their stamens are often reduced in number with the anthers of very small size containing few pollengrains which have remarkably thin transparent coats and generally emit their tubes whilst still enclosed within the anthercells and lastly the pistil is much reduced in size with the stigma in some cases hardly at all developed these flowers do not secrete nectar or emit any odour from their small size as well as from the corolla being rudimentary they are singularly inconspicuous consequently insects do not visit them nor if they did could they find an entrance such flowers are therefore invariably selffertilised yet they produce an abundance of seed in several cases the young capsules bury themselves beneath the ground and the seeds are there matured these flowers are developed before or after or simultaneously with the perfect ones their development seems to be largely governed by the conditions to which the plants are exposed for during certain seasons or in certain localities only cleistogamic or only perfect flowers are produced  dr kuhn in the article above referred to gives a list of 44 genera including species which bear flowers of this kind to this list i have added some genera and the authorities are appended in a footnote i have omitted three names from reasons likewise given in the footnote but it is by no means easy to decide in all cases whether certain flowers ought to be ranked as cleistogamic for instance mr bentham informs me that in the south of france some of the flowers on the vine do not fully open and yet set fruit and i hear from two experienced gardeners that this is the case with the vine in our hothouses but as the flowers do not appear to be completely closed it would be imprudent to consider them as cleistogamic the flowers of some aquatic and marsh plants for instance of ranunculus aquatalis alisma natans subularia illecebrum menyanthes and euryale remain closely shut as long as they are submerged and in this condition fertilise themselves 82 delpino sull opera la distribuzione dei sessi nelle piante etc 1867 page 30 subularia however sometimes has its flowers fully expanded beneath the water see sir je smith english flora volume 3 1825 page 157 for the behaviour of menyanthes in russia see gillibert in act acad st petersb 1777 part 2 page 45on euryale gardeners chronicle 1877 page 280 they behave in this manner apparently as a protection to their pollen and produce open flowers when exposed to the air so that these cases seem rather different from those of true cleistogamic flowers and have not been included in the list again the flowers of some plants which are produced very early or very late in the season do not properly expand and these might perhaps be considered as incipiently cleistogamic but as they do not present any of the remarkable peculiarities proper to the class and as i have not found any full record of such cases they are not entered in the list when however it is believed on fairly good evidence that the flowers on a plant in its native country do not open at any hour of the day or night and yet set seeds capable of germination these may fairly be considered as cleistogamic notwithstanding that they present no peculiarities of structure i will now give as complete a list of the genera containing cleistogamic species as i have been able to collect  table 838 list of genera including cleistogamic species chiefly after kuhn 83 i have omitted trifolium and arachis from the list because von mohl says botanische zeitung 1863 page 312 that the flowerstems merely draw the flowers beneath the ground and that these do not appear to be properly cleistogamic correa de mello journal of the linnean society botany volume 11 1870 page 254 observed plants of arachis in brazil and could never find such flowers plantago has been omitted because as far as i can discover it produces hermaphrodite and female flowerheads but not cleistogamic flowers krascheninikowia vel stellaria has been omitted because it seems very doubtful from maximowicz description whether the lower flowers which have no petals or very small ones and barren stamens or none are cleistogamic the upper hermaphrodite flowers are said never to produce fruit and therefore probably act as males moreover in stellaria graminea as babington remarks british botany 1851 page 51 shorter and longer petals accompany an imperfection of the stamens or germen  i have added to the list the following cases several acanthaceae for which see j scott in journal of botany london new

flowers of this plant in its native home never open but they do not appear to be reduced in size nor is this the case with the flowers of certain species of epidendron cattleya etc see second edition of my fertilisation of orchids page 147 which without expanding produce capsules it is therefore doubtful whether these orchideae ought to have been included in the list from what duvaljouve says

they are very widely distributed in the vegetable series they are more common in the family of the leguminosae than in any other and next in order in that of the acanthaceae and malpighiaceae a large number but not all the species of certain genera as of oxalis and viola bear cleistogamic as well as ordinary flowers a second point which deserves notice is that a considerable proportion of the genera produce more or less irregular flowers this is the case with about 32 out of the 55 genera but to this subject i shall recur  i formerly made many observations on cleistogamic flowers but only a few of them are worth giving since the appearance of an admirable paper by hugo von mohl whose examination was in some respects much more complete than mine 84 botanische zeitung 1863 page 30928 his paper includes also an interesting history of our knowledge on the subject  viola canina  the calyx of the cleistogamic flowers differs in no respect from that of the perfect ones the petals are reduced to five minute scales the lower one which represents the lower lip is considerably larger than the others but with no trace of the spurlike nectary its margins are smooth whilst those of the other four scalelike petals are papillose d muller of upsala says that in the specimens which he observed the petals were completely aborted 85 ibid 1857 page 730 this paper contains the first full and satisfactory account of any cleistogamic flower the stamens are very small and only the two lower ones are provided with anthers which do not cohere together as in the perfect flowers the anthers are minute with the two cells or loculi remarkably distinct they contain very little pollen in comparison with those of the perfect flowers the connective expands into a membranous hoodlike shield which projects above the anthercells these two lower stamens have no vestige of the curious appendages which secrete nectar in the perfect flowers the three other stamens are destitute of anthers and have broader filaments with their terminal membranous expansions flatter or not so hoodlike as those of the two antheriferous stamens the pollengrains have remarkably thin transparent coats when exposed to the air they shrivel up quickly when placed in water they swell and are then 8107000 of an inch in diameter and therefore of smaller size than the ordinary pollengrains similarly treated which have a diameter of 13147000 of an inch in the cleistogamic flowers the pollengrains as far as i could see never naturally fall out of the anthercells but emit their tubes through a pore at the upper end i was able to trace the tubes from the grains some way down the stigma the pistil is very short with the style hooked so that its extremity which is a little enlarged or funnelshaped and represents the stigma is directed downwards being covered by the two membranous expansions of the antheriferous stamens it is remarkable that there is an open passage from the enlarged funnelshaped extremity to within the ovarium this was evident as slight pressure caused a bubble of air which had been drawn in by some accident to travel freely from one end to the other a similar passage was observed by michalet in v alba the pistil therefore differs considerably from that of the perfect flower for in the latter it is much longer and straight with the exception of the rectangularly bent stigma nor is it perforated by an open passage  the ordinary or perfect flowers have been said by some authors never to produce capsules but this is an error though only a small proportion of them do so this appears to depend in some cases on their anthers not containing even a trace of pollen but more generally on bees not visiting the flowers i twice covered with a net a group of flowers and marked with threads twelve of them which had not as yet expanded this precaution is necessary for though as a general rule the perfect flowers appear considerably before the cleistogamic ones yet occasionally some of the latter are produced early in the season and their capsules might readily be mistaken for those produced by the perfect flowers not one of the twelve marked perfect flowers yielded a capsule whilst others under the net which had been artificially fertilised produced five capsules and these contained exactly the same average number of seeds as some capsules from flowers outside the net which had been fertilised by bees i have repeatedly seen bombus hortorum lapidarius and a third species as well as hivebees sucking the flowers of this violet i marked six which were thus visited and four of them produced fine capsules the two others were gnawed off by some animal i watched bombus hortorum for some time and whenever it came to a flower which did not stand in a convenient position to be sucked it bit a hole through the spurlike nectary such illplaced flowers would not yield any seed or leave descendants and the plants bearing them would thus tend to be eliminated through natural selection  the seeds produced by the cleistogamic and perfect flowers do not differ in appearance or number on two occasions i fertilised several perfect flowers with pollen from other individuals and afterwards marked some cleistogamic flowers on the same plants and the result was that 14 capsules produced by the perfect flowers contained on an average 985 seeds and 17 capsules from the cleistogamic ones contained 964 seedsan amount of difference of no significance it is remarkable how much more quickly the capsules from the cleistogamic flowers are developed than those from the perfect ones for instance several perfect flowers were crossfertilised on april 14th 1863 and a month afterwards may 15th eight young cleistogamic flowers were marked with threads and when the two sets of capsules thus produced were compared on june 3rd there was scarcely any difference between them in size  viola odorata whiteflowered single cultivated variety  the petals are represented by mere scales as in the last species but differently from in the last all five stamens are provided with diminutive anthers small bundles of pollentubes were traced from the five anthers into the somewhat distant stigma the capsules produced by these flowers bury themselves in the soil if it be loose enough and there mature themselves 86 vaucher says hist phys des plantes deurope tome 3 1844 page 309 that v hirta and collina likewise bury their capsules see also lecoq geograph bot tome 5 1856 page 180 lecoq says that it is only these latter capsules which possess elastic valves but i think this must be a misprint as such valves would obviously be of no use to the buried capsules but would serve to scatter the seeds of the subaerial ones as in the other species of viola it is remarkable that this plant according to delpino does not produce cleistogamic flowers in one part of liguria whilst the perfect flowers are there abundantly fertile 87 sull opera la distribuzione dei sessi nelle piante etc 1867 page 30 on the other hand cleistogamic flowers are produced by it near turin another fact is worth giving as an instance of correlated development i found on a purple variety after it had produced its perfect double flowers and whilst the white single variety was bearing its cleistogamic flowers many budlike bodies which from their position on the plant were certainly of a cleistogamic nature they consisted as could be seen on bisecting them of a dense mass of minute scales closely folded over one another exactly like a cabbagehead in miniature i could not detect any stamens and in the place of the ovarium there was a little central column the doubleness of the perfect flowers had thus spread to the cleistogamic ones which therefore were rendered quite sterile  viola hirta  the five stamens of the cleistogamic flowers are provided as in the last case with small anthers from all of which pollentubes proceed to the stigma the petals are not quite so much reduced as in v canina and the short pistil instead of being hooked is merely bent into a rectangle of several perfect flowers which i saw visited by hiveand humblebees six were marked but they produced only two capsules some of the others having been accidentally injured m monnier was therefore mistaken in this case as in that of v odorata in supposing that the perfect flowers always withered away and aborted he states that the peduncles of the cleistogamic flowers curve downwards and bury the ovaries beneath the soil 88 these statements are taken from professor olivers excellent article in the natural history review july 1862 page 238 with respect to the supposed sterility of the perfect flowers in this genus see also timballagrave botanische zeitung 1854 page 772 i may here add that fritz muller as i hear from his brother has found in the highlands of southern brazil a whiteflowered species of violet which bears subterranean cleistogamic flowers  viola nana  mr scott sent me seeds of this indian species from the sikkim terai from which i raised many plants and from these other seedlings during several successive generations they produced an abundance of cleistogamic flowers during the whole of each summer but never a perfect one when mr scott wrote to me his plants in calcutta were behaving similarly though his collector saw the species in flower in its native site this case is valuable as showing that we ought not to infer as has sometimes been done that a species does not bear perfect flowers when growing naturally because it produces only cleistogamic flowers under culture the calyx of these flowers is sometimes formed of only three sepals two being actually suppressed and not merely coherent with the others this occurred with five out of thirty flowers which were examined for this purpose the petals are represented by extremely minute scales of the stamens two bear anthers which are in the same state as in the previous species but as far as i could judge each of the two cells contained only from 20 to 25 delicate transparent pollengrains these emitted their tubes in the usual manner the three other stamens bore very minute rudimentary anthers one of which was generally larger than the other two but none of them contained any pollen in one instance however a single cell of the larger rudimentary anther included a little pollen the style consists of a short flattened tube somewhat expanded at its upper end and this forms an open channel leading into the ovarium as described under v canina it is slightly bent towards the two fertile anthers  viola roxburghiana  this species bore in my hothouse during two years a multitude of cleistogamic flowers which resembled in all respects those of the last species but no perfect ones were produced mr scott informs me that in india it bears perfect flowers only during the cold season and that these are quite fertile during the hot and more especially during the rainy season it bears an abundance of cleistogamic flowers  many other species besides the five now described produce cleistogamic flowers this is the case according to d muller michalet von mohl and hermann muller with v elatior lancifolia sylvatica palustris mirabilis bicolor ionodium and biflora but v tricolor does not produce them  michalet asserts that v palustris produces near paris only perfect flowers which are quite fertile but that when the plant grows on mountains cleistogamic flowers are produced and so it is with v biflora the same author states that he has seen in the case of v alba flowers intermediate in structure between the perfect and cleistogamic ones according to m boisduval an italian species v ruppii never bears in france des fleurs bien apparentes ce qui ne lempeche pas de fructifier  it is interesting to observe the gradation in the abortion of the parts in the cleistogamic flowers of the several foregoing species it appears from the statements by d muller and von mohl that in v mirabilis the calyx does not remain quite closed all five stamens are provided with anthers and some pollengrains probably fall out of the cells on the stigma instead of protruding their tubes whilst still enclosed as in the other species in v hirta all five stamens are likewise antheriferous the petals are not so much reduced and the pistil not so much modified as in the following species in v nana and elatior only two of the stamens properly bear anthers but sometimes one or even two of the others are thus provided lastly in v canina never more than two of the stamens as far as i have seen bear anthers the petals are much more reduced than in v hirta and according to d muller are sometimes quite absent  oxalis acetosella  the existence of cleistogamic flowers on this plant was discovered by michalet 89 bulletin soc bot de france tome 7 1860 page 465 they have been fully described by von mohl and i can add hardly anything to his description in my specimens the anthers of the five longer stamens were nearly on a level with the stigmas whilst the smaller and less plainly bilobed anthers of the five shorter stamens stood considerably below the stigmas so that their tubes had to travel some way upwards according to michalet these latter anthers are sometimes quite aborted in one case the tubes which ended in excessively fine points were seen by me stretching upwards from the lower anthers towards the stigmas which they had not as yet reached my plants grew in pots and long after the perfect flowers had withered they produced not only cleistogamic but a few minute open flowers which were in an intermediate condition between the two kinds in one of these the pollentubes from the lower anthers had reached the stigmas though the flower was open the footstalks of the cleistogamic flowers are much shorter than those of the perfect flowers and are so much bowed downwards that they tend according to von mohl to bury themselves in the moss and dead leaves on the ground michalet also says that they are often hypogean in order to ascertain the number of seeds produced by these flowers i marked eight of them two failed one cast its seed abroad and the remaining five contained on an average 100 seeds per capsule this is rather above the average 92 which eleven capsules from perfect flowers fertilised with their own pollen yielded and considerably above the average 79 from the capsules of perfect flowers fertilised with pollen from another plant but this latter result must i think have been accidental  hildebrand whilst searching various herbaria observed that many other species of oxalis besides o acetosella produce cleistogamic flowers 810 monatsbericht der akad der wiss zu berlin 1866 page 369 and i hear from him that this is the case with the heterostyled trimorphic o incarnata from the cape of good hope  oxalis biophytum sensitiva  this plant is ranked by many botanists as a distinct genus but as a subgenus by bentham and hooker many of the early flowers on a midstyled plant in my hothouse did not open properly and were in an intermediate condition between cleistogamic and perfect their petals varied from a rudiment to about half their proper size nevertheless they produced capsules i attributed their state to unfavourable conditions for later in the season fully expanded flowers of the proper size appeared but mr thwaites afterwards sent me from ceylon a number of longstyled midstyled and shortstyled flowerstalks preserved in spirits and on the same stalks with the perfect flowers some of which were fully expanded and others still in bud there were small budlike bodies containing mature pollen but with their calyces closed these cleistogamic flowers do not differ much in structure from the perfect ones of the corresponding form with the exception that their petals are reduced to extremely minute barely visible scales which adhere firmly to the rounded bases of the shorter stamens their stigmas are much less papillose and smaller in about the ratio of 13 to 20 divisions of the micrometer as measured transversely from apex to apex than the stigmas of the perfect flowers the styles are furrowed longitudinally and are clothed with simple as well as glandular hairs but only in the cleistogamic flowers produced by the long styled and midstyled forms the anthers of the longer stamens are a little smaller than the corresponding ones of the perfect flowers in about the ratio of 11 to 14 they dehisce properly but do not appear to contain much pollen many pollengrains were attached by short tubes to the stigmas but many others still adhering to the anthers had emitted their tubes to a considerable length without having come in contact with the stigmas living plants ought to be examined as the stigmas at least of the longstyled form project beyond the calyx and if visited by insects which however is very improbable might be fertilised with pollen from a perfect flower the most singular fact about the present species is that longstyled cleistogamic flowers are produced by the longstyled plants and midstyled as well as shortstyled cleistogamic flowers by the other two forms so that there are three kinds of cleistogamic and three kinds of perfect flowers produced by this one species most of the heterostyled species of oxalis are more or less sterile many absolutely so if illegitimately fertilised with their ownform pollen it is therefore probable that the pollen of the cleistogamic flowers has been modified in power so as to act on their own stigmas for they yield an abundance of seeds we may perhaps account for the cleistogamic flowers consisting of the three forms through the principle of correlated growth by which the cleistogamic flowers of the double violet have been rendered double  vandellia nummularifolia  dr kuhn has collected all the notices with respect to cleistogamic flowers in this genus and has described from dried specimens those produced by an abyssinian species 811 botanische zeitung 1867 page 65 mr scott sent me from calcutta seeds of the above common indian weed from which many plants were successively raised during several years the cleistogamic flowers are very small being when fully mature under 120 of an inch 127 millimetres in length the calyx does not open and within it the delicate transparent corolla remains closely folded over the ovarium there are only two anthers instead of the normal number of four and their filaments adhere to the corolla the cells of the anthers diverge much at their lower ends and are only 5700 of an inch 181 millimetres in their longer diameter they contain but few pollengrains and these emit their tubes whilst still within the anther the pistil is very short and is surmounted by a bilobed stigma as the ovary grows the two anthers together with the shrivelled corolla all attached by the dried pollentubes to the stigma are torn off and carried upwards in the shape of a little cap the perfect flowers generally appear before the cleistogamic but sometimes simultaneously with them during one season a large number of plants produced no perfect flowers it has been asserted that the latter never yield capsules but this is a mistake as they do so even when insects are excluded fifteen capsules from cleistogamic flowers on plants growing under favourable conditions contained on an average 642 seeds with a maximum of 87 whilst 20 capsules from plants growing much crowded yielded an average of only 48 sixteen capsules from perfect flowers artificially crossed with pollen from another plant contained on an average 93 seeds with a maximum of 137 thirteen capsules from selffertilised perfect flowers gave an average of 62 seeds with a maximum of 135 therefore the capsules from the cleistogamic flowers contained fewer seeds than those from perfect flowers when crossfertilised and slightly more than those from perfect flowers selffertilised  dr kuhn believes that the abyssinian v sessiflora does not differ specifically from the foregoing species but its cleistogamic flowers apparently include four anthers instead of two as above described the plants moreover of v sessiflora produce subterranean runners which yield capsules and i never saw a trace of such runners in v nummularifolia although many plants were cultivated  linaria spuria  michalet says that short thin twisted branches are developed from the buds in the axils of the lower leaves and that these bury themselves in the ground 812 bulletin soc bot de france tome 7 1860 page 468 they there produce flowers not offering any peculiarity in structure excepting that their corollas though properly coloured are deformed these flowers may be ranked as cleistogamic as they are developed and not merely drawn beneath the ground  ononis columnae  plants were raised from seeds sent me from northern italy the sepals of the cleistogamic flowers are elongated and closely pressed together the petals are much reduced in size colourless and folded over the interior organs the filaments of the ten stamens are united into a tube and this is not the case according to von mohl with the cleistogamic flowers of other leguminosae five of the stamens are destitute of anthers and alternate with the five thus provided the two cells of the anthers are minute rounded and separated from one another by connective tissue they contain but few pollengrains and these have extremely delicate coats the pistil is hookshaped with a plainly enlarged stigma which is curled down towards the anthers it therefore differs much from that of the perfect flower during the year 1867 no perfect flowers were produced but in the following year there were both perfect and cleistogamic ones  ononis minutissima  my plants produced both perfect and cleistogamic flowers but i did not examine the latter some of the former were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant and six capsules thus obtained yielded on an average 366 seeds with a maximum of 5 in one twelve perfect flowers were marked and allowed to fertilise themselves spontaneously under a net and they yielded eight capsules containing on an average 238 seeds with a maximum of 3 in one fiftythree capsules produced by the cleistogamic flowers contained on an average 41 seeds so that these were the most productive of all and the seeds themselves looked finer even than those from the crossed perfect flowers according to mr bentham o parviflora likewise bears cleistogamic flowers and he informs me that these flowers are produced by all three species early in the spring whilst the perfect ones appear afterwards and therefore in a reversed order compared with those of viola and oxalis some of the species for instance ononis columnae bear a fresh crop of cleistogamic flowers in the autumn  lathyrus nissolia  this plant apparently offers a case of the first stage in the production of cleistogamic flowers for on plants growing in a state of nature many of the flowers never expand and yet produce fine pods some of the buds are so large that they seem on the point of expansion others are much smaller but none so small as the true cleistogamic flowers of the foregoing species as i marked these buds with thread and examined them daily there could be no mistake about their producing fruit without having expanded  several other leguminous genera produce cleistogamic flowers as may be seen in table 838 but much does not appear to be known about them von mohl says that their petals are commonly rudimentary that only a few of their anthers are developed their filaments are not united into a tube and their pistils are hookshaped in three of the genera namely vicia amphicarpaea and voandzeia the cleistogamic flowers are produced on subterranean stems the perfect flowers of voandzeia which is a cultivated plant are said never to produce fruit 813 correa de mello journal of the linnean society botany volume 11 1870 page 254 particularly attended to the flowering and fruiting of this african plant which is sometimes cultivated in brazil but we should remember how often fertility is affected by cultivation  impatiens fulva  mr aw bennett has published an excellent description with figures of this plant 814 journal of the linnean society botany volume 13 1872 page 147 he shows that the cleistogamic and perfect flowers differ in structure at a very early period of growth so that the existence of the former cannot be due merely to the arrested development of the lattera conclusion which indeed follows from most of the previous descriptions mr bennett found on the banks of the wey that the plants which bore cleistogamic flowers alone were to those bearing perfect flowers as 20 to 1 but we should remember that this is a naturalised species the perfect flowers are usually barren in england but professor asa gray writes to me that after midsummer in the united states some or many of them produce capsules  impatiens nolimetangere  i can add nothing of importance to von mohls description excepting that one of the rudimentary petals shows a vestige of a nectary as mr bennett likewise found to be the case with i fulva as in this latter species all five stamens produce some pollen though small in amount a single anther contains according to von mohl not more than 50 grains and these emit their tubes while still enclosed within it the pollengrains of the perfect flowers are tied together by threads but not so far as i could see those of the cleistogamic flowers and a provision of this kind would here have been useless as the grains can never be transported by insects the flowers of i balsamina are visited by humblebees 815 h muller die befruchtung etc page 170 and i am almost sure that this is the case with the perfect flowers of i nolimetangere from the perfect flowers of this latter species covered with a net eleven spontaneously selffertilised capsules were produced and these yielded on an average 345 seeds some perfect flowers with their anthers still containing an abundance of pollen were fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant and the three capsules thus produced contained to my surprise only 2 2 and 1 seed as i balsamina is proterandrous so probably is the present species and if so crossfertilisation was effected by me at too early a period and this may account for the capsules yielding so few seeds  drosera rotundifolia  the first flowerstems which were thrown up by some plants in my greenhouse bore only cleistogamic flowers the petals of small size remained permanently closed over the reproductive organs but their white tips could just be seen between the almost completely closed sepals the pollen which was scanty in amount but not so scanty as in viola or oxalis remained enclosed within the anthers whence the tubes proceeded and penetrated the stigma as the ovarium swelled the little withered corolla was carried upwards in the form of a cap these cleistogamic flowers produced an abundance of seed later in the season perfect flowers appeared with plants in a state of nature the flowers open only in the early morning as i have been informed by mr wallis who particularly attended to the time of their flowering in the case of d anglica the still folded petals on some plants in my greenhouse opened just sufficiently to leave a minute aperture the anthers dehisced properly but the pollengrains adhered in a mass to them and thence emitted their tubes which penetrated the stigmas these flowers therefore were in an intermediate condition and could not be called either perfect or cleistogamic  a few miscellaneous observations may be added with respect to some other species as throwing light on our subject mr scott states that eranthemum ambiguum bears three kinds of flowerslarge conspicuous open ones which are quite sterileothers of intermediate size which are open and moderately fertileand lastly small closed or cleistogamic ones which are perfectly fertile 816 journal of botany london new series volume 1 1872 pages 161 4 ruellia tuberosa likewise one of the acanthaceae produces both open and cleistogamic flowers the latter yield from 18 to 24 whilst the former only from 8 to 10 seeds these two kinds of flowers are produced simultaneously whereas in several other members of the family the cleistogamic ones appear only during the hot season according to torrey and gray the north american species of helianthemum when growing in poor soil produce only cleistogamic flowers the cleistogamic flowers of specularia perfoliata are highly remarkable as they are closed by a tympanum formed by the rudimentary corolla and without any trace of an opening the stamens vary from 3 to 5 in number as do the sepals 817 von mohl botanische zeitung 1863 pages 314 and 323 dr bromfield phytologist volume 3 page 530 also remarks that the calyx of the cleistogamic flowers is usually only 3cleft while that of the perfect flower is mostly 5 cleft the collecting hairs on the pistil which play so important a part in the fertilisation of the perfect flowers are here quite absent drs hooker and thomson state that some of the indian species of campanula produce two kinds of flowers the smaller ones being borne on longer peduncles with differently formed sepals and producing a more globose ovary 818 journal of the linnean society volume 2 1857 page 7 see also professor oliver in natural history review 1862 page 240 the flowers are closed by a tympanum like that in specularia some of the plants produce both kinds of flowers others only one kind both yield an abundance of seeds professor oliver adds that he has seen flowers on campanula colorata in an intermediate condition between cleistogamic and perfect ones  the solitary almost sessile cleistogamic flowers produced by monochoria vaginalis are differently protected from those in any of the previous cases namely within a short sack formed of the membranous spathe without any opening or fissure there is only a single fertile stamen the style is almost obsolete with the three stigmatic surfaces directed to one side both the perfect and cleistogamic flowers produce seeds 819 dr kirk journal of the linnean society volume 8 1864 page 147  the cleistogamic flowers on some of the malpighiaceae seem to be more profoundly modified than those in any of the foregoing genera according to a de jussieu they are differently situated from the perfect flowers they contain only a single stamen instead of 5 or 6 and it is a strange fact that this particular stamen is not developed in the perfect flowers of the same species 820 archives du museum tome 3 1843 pages 3538 8286 589 598 the style is absent or rudimentary and there are only two ovaries instead of three thus these degraded flowers as jussieu remarks laugh at our classifications for the greater number of the characters proper to the species to the genus to the family to the class disappear i may add that their calyces are not glandular and as according to kerner the fluid secreted by such glands generally serves to protect the flowers from crawling insects which steal the nectar without aiding in their crossfertilisation 821 die schutzmittel der bluthen gegen unberufene gaste 1876 page 25 the deficiency of the glands in the cleistogamic flowers of these plants may perhaps be accounted for by their not requiring any such protection  as the asclepiadous genus stapelia is said to produce cleistogamic flowers the following case may be worth giving i have never heard of the perfect flowers of hoya carnosa setting seeds in this country but some capsules were produced in mr farrers hothouse and the gardener detected that they were the product of minute budlike bodies three or four of which could sometimes be found on the same umbel with the perfect flowers they were quite closed and hardly thicker than their peduncles the sepals presented nothing particular but internally and alternating with them there were five small flattened heartshaped papillae like rudiments of petals but the homological nature of which appeared doubtful to mr bentham and dr hooker no trace of anthers or of stamens could be detected and i knew from having examined many cleistogamic flowers what to look for there were two ovaries full of ovules quite open at their upper ends with their edges festooned but with no trace of a proper stigma in all these flowers one of the two ovaries withered and blackened long before the other the one perfect capsule 3 12 inches in length which was sent me had likewise been developed from a single carpel this capsule contained an abundance of plumose seeds many of which appeared quite sound but they did not germinate when sown at kew therefore the little budlike flower which produced this capsule probably was as destitute of pollen as were those which i examined  juncus bufonius and hordeum  all the species hitherto mentioned which produce cleistogamic flowers are entomophilous but four genera juncus hordeum cryptostachys and leersia are anemophilous juncus bufonius is remarkable by bearing in parts of russia only cleistogamic flowers which contain three instead of the six anthers found in the perfect flowers 822 see dr aschersons interesting paper in botanische zeitung 1871 page 551 in the genus hordeum it has been shown by delpino that the majority of the flowers are cleistogamic some of the others expanding and apparently allowing of crossfertilisation 823 bollettini del comizio agrario parmense marzo e aprile 1871 an abstract of this valuable paper is given in botanische zeitung 1871 page 537 see also hildebrand on hordeum in monatsbericht d k akad berlin october 1872 page 760 i hear from fritz muller that there is a grass in southern brazil in which the sheath of the uppermost leaf half a metre in length envelopes the whole panicle and this sheath never opens until the selffertilised seeds are ripe on the roadside some plants had been cut down whilst the cleistogamic panicles were developing and these plants afterwards produced free or unenclosed panicles of small size bearing perfect flowers  leersia oryzoides  it has long been known that this plant produces cleistogamic flowers but these were first described with care by m duvaljouve 824 bulletin bot soc de france tome 10 1863 page 194 i procured plants from a stream near reigate and cultivated them for several years in my greenhouse the cleistogamic flowers are very small and usually mature their seeds within the sheaths of the leaves these flowers are said by duvaljouve to be filled by slightly viscid fluid but this was not the case with several that i opened but there was a thin film of fluid between the coats of the glumes and when these were pressed the fluid moved about giving a similarly deceptive appearance of the whole inside of the flower being thus filled the stigma is very small and the filaments extremely short the anthers are less than 150 of an inch in length or about onethird of the length of those in the perfect flowers one of the three anthers dehisces before the two others can this have any relation with the fact that in some other species of leersia only two stamens are fully developed 825 asa gray manual of botany of the united states 1856 page 540 the anthers shed their pollen on the stigma at least in one instance this was clearly the case and by tearing open the anthers under water the grains were easily detached towards the apex of the anther the grains are arranged in a single row and lower down in two or three rows so that they could be counted and there were about 35 in each cell or 70 in the whole anther and this is an astonishingly small number for an anemophilous plant the grains have very delicate coats are spherical and about 57000 of an inch 0181 millimetres whilst those of the perfect flowers are about 77000 of an inch 0254 millimetres in diameter  m duvaljouve states that the panicles very rarely protrude from their sheaths but that when this does happen the flowers expand and exhibit welldeveloped ovaries and stigmas together with fullsized anthers containing apparently sound pollen nevertheless such flowers are invariably quite sterile schreiber had previously observed that if a panicle is only half protruded this half is sterile whilst the still included half is fertile some plants which grew in a large tub of water in my greenhouse behaved on one occasion in a very different manner they protruded two very large muchbranched panicles but the florets never opened though these included fully developed stigmas and stamens supported on long filaments with large anthers that dehisced properly if these florets had opened for a short time unperceived by me and had then closed again the empty anthers would have been left dangling outside nevertheless they yielded on august 17th an abundance of fine ripe seeds here then we have a near approach to the single case as yet known of this grass producing in a state of nature in germany perfect flowers which yielded a copious supply of fruit 826 dr ascherson botanische zeitung 1864 page 350 seeds from the cleistogamic flowers were sent by me to mr scott in calcutta who there cultivated the plants in various ways but they never produced perfect flowers  in europe leersia oryzoides is the sole representative of its genus and duval jouve after examining several exotic species found that it apparently is the sole one which bears cleistogamic flowers it ranges from persia to north america and specimens from pennsylvania resembled the european ones in their concealed manner of fructification there can therefore be little doubt that this plant generally propagates itself throughout an immense area by cleistogamic seeds and that it can hardly ever be invigorated by cross fertilisation it resembles in this respect those plants which are now widely spread though they increase solely by asexual generation 827 i have collected several such cases in my variation under domestication chapter 18 2nd edition volume 2 page 153  concluding remarks on cleistogamic flowers  that these flowers owe their structure primarily to the arrested development of perfect ones we may infer from such cases as that of the lower rudimentary petal in viola being larger than the others like the lower lip of the perfect flowerfrom a vestige of a spur in the cleistogamic flowers of impatiens from the ten stamens of ononis being united into a tubeand other such structures the same inference may be drawn from the occurrence in some instances on the same plant of a series of gradations between the cleistogamic and perfect flowers but that the former owe their origin wholly to arrested development is by no means the case for various parts have been specially modified so as to aid in the selffertilisation of the flowers and as a protection to the pollen for instance the hookshaped pistil in viola and in some other genera by which the stigma is brought close to the fertile anthers the rudimentary corolla of specularia modified into a perfectly closed tympanum and the sheath of monochoria modified into a closed sackthe excessively thin coats of the pollengrainsthe anthers not being all equally aborted and other such cases moreover mr bennett has shown that the buds of the cleistogamic and perfect flowers of impatiens differ at a very early period of growth  the degree to which many of the most important organs in these degraded flowers have been reduced or even wholly obliterated is one of their most remarkable peculiarities reminding us of many parasitic animals in some cases only a single anther is left and this contains but few pollengrains of diminished size in other cases the stigma has disappeared leaving a simple open passage into the ovarium it is also interesting to note the complete loss of trifling points in the structure or functions of certain parts which though of service to the perfect flowers are of none to the cleistogamic for instance the collecting hairs on the pistil of specularia the glands on the calyx of the malpighiaceae the nectarsecreting appendages to the lower stamens of viola the secretion of nectar by other parts the emission of a sweet odour and apparently the elasticity of the valves in the buried capsules of viola odorata we here see as throughout nature that as soon as any part or character becomes superfluous it tends sooner or later to disappear  another peculiarity in these flowers is that the pollengrains generally emit their tubes whilst still enclosed within the anthers but this is not so remarkable a fact as was formerly thought when the case of asclepias was alone known 828 the case of asclepias was described by r brown baillon asserts adansonia tome 2 1862 page 58 that with many plants the tubes are emitted from pollengrains which have not come into contact with the stigma and that they may be seen advancing horizontally through the air towards the stigma i have observed the emission of the tubes from the pollenmasses whilst still within the anthers in three widely distinct orchidean genera namely aceras malaxis and neottia see the various contrivances by which orchids are fertilised 2nd edition page 258 it is however a wonderful sight to behold the tubes directing themselves in a straight line to the stigma when this is at some little distance from the anthers as soon as they reach the stigma or the open passage leading into the ovarium no doubt they penetrate it guided by the same means whatever these may be as in the case of ordinary flowers i thought that they might be guided by the avoidance of light some pollengrains of a willow were therefore immersed in an extremely weak solution of honey and the vessel was placed so that the light entered only in one direction laterally or from below or from above but the long tubes were in each case protruded in every possible direction  as cleistogamic flowers are completely closed they are necessarily self fertilised not to mention the absence of any attraction to insects and they thus differ widely from the great majority of ordinary flowers delpino believes that cleistogamic flowers have been developed in order to ensure the production of seeds under climatic or other conditions which tend to prevent the fertilisation of the perfect flowers 829 sull opera la distribuzione dei sessi nelle piante 1867 page 30 i do not doubt that this holds good to a certain limited extent but the production of a large supply of seeds with little consumption of nutrient matter or expenditure of vital force is probably a far more efficient motive power the whole flower is much reduced in size but what is much more important an extremely small quantity of pollen has to be formed as none is lost through the action of insects or the weather and pollen contains much nitrogen and phosphorus von mohl estimated that a single cleistogamic anthercell of oxalis acetosella contained from one to two dozen pollengrains we will say 20 and if so the whole flower can have produced at most 400 grains with impatiens the whole number may be estimated in the same manner at 250 with leersia at 210 and with viola nana at only 100 these figures are wonderfully low compared with the 243600 pollengrains produced by a flower of leontodon the 4863 by an hibiscus or the 3654000 by a paeony 830 the authorities for these statements are given in my effects of cross and selffertilisation page 376 we thus see that cleistogamic flowers produce seeds with a wonderfully small expenditure of pollen and they produce as a general rule quite as many seeds as the perfect flowers  that the production of a large number of seeds is necessary or beneficial to many plants needs no evidence so of course is their preservation before they are ready for germination and it is one of the many remarkable peculiarities of the plants which bear cleistogamic flowers that an incomparably larger proportion of them than of ordinary plants bury their young ovaries in the groundan action which it may be presumed serves to protect them from being devoured by birds or other enemies but this advantage is accompanied by the loss of the power of wide dissemination no less than eight of the genera in the list at the beginning of this chapter include species which act in this manner namely several kinds of viola oxalis vandellia linaria commelina and at least three genera of leguminosae the seeds also of leersia though not buried are concealed in the most perfect manner within the sheaths of the leaves cleistogamic flowers possess great facilities for burying their young ovaries or capsules owing to their small size pointed shape closed condition and the absence of a corolla and we can thus understand how it is that so many of them have acquired this curious habit  it has already been shown that in about 32 out of the 55 genera in the list just referred to the perfect flowers are irregular and this implies that they have been specially adapted for fertilisation by insects moreover three of the genera with regular flowers are adapted by other means for the same end flowers thus constructed are liable during certain seasons to be imperfectly fertilised namely when the proper insects are scarce and it is difficult to avoid the belief that the production of cleistogamic flowers which ensures under all circumstances a full supply of seed has been in part determined by the perfect flowers being liable to fail in their fertilisation but if this determining cause be a real one it must be of subordinate importance as four of the genera in the list are fertilised by the wind and there seems no reason why their perfect flowers should fail to be fertilised more frequently than those in any other anemophilous genus in contrast with what we here see with respect to the large proportion of the perfect flowers being irregular one genus alone out of the 38 heterostyled genera described in the previous chapters bears such flowers yet all these genera are absolutely dependent on insects for their legitimate fertilisation i know not how to account for this difference in the proportion of the plants bearing regular and irregular flowers in the two classes unless it be that the heterostyled flowers are already so well adapted for crossfertilisation through the position of their stamens and pistils and the difference in power of their two or three kinds of pollen that any additional adaptation namely through the flowers being made irregular has been rendered superfluous  although cleistogamic flowers never fail to yield a large number of seeds yet the plants bearing them usually produce perfect flowers either simultaneously or more commonly at a different period and these are adapted for or admit of crossfertilisation from the cases given of the two indian species of viola which produced in this country during several years only cleistogamic flowers and of the numerous plants of vandellia and of some plants of ononis which behaved during one whole season in the same manner it appears rash to infer from such cases as that of salvia cleistogama not having produced perfect flowers during five years in germany 831 dr ascherson botanische zeitung 1871 page 555 and of an aspicarpa not having done so during several years in paris that these plants would not bear perfect flowers in their native homes von mohl and several other botanists have repeatedly insisted that as a general rule the perfect flowers produced by cleistogamic plants are sterile but it has been shown under the head of the several species that this is not the case the perfect flowers viola are indeed sterile unless they are visited by bees but when thus visited they yield the full number of seeds as far as i have been able to discover there is only one absolute exception to the rule that the perfect flowers are fertile namely that of voandzeia and in this case we should remember that cultivation often affects injuriously the reproductive organs although the perfect flowers of leersia sometimes yield seeds yet this occurs so rarely as far as hitherto observed that it practically forms a second exception to the rule  as cleistogamic flowers are invariably fertilised and as they are produced in large numbers they yield altogether a much larger supply of seeds than do the perfect flowers on the same plant but the latter flowers will occasionally be crossfertilised and their offspring will thus be invigorated as we may infer from a widespread analogy but of such invigoration i have only a small amount of direct evidence two crossed seedlings of ononis minutissima were put into competition with two seedlings raised from cleistogamic flowers they were at first all of equal height the crossed were then slightly beaten but on the following year they showed the usual superiority of their class and were to the selffertilised plants of cleistogamic origin as 100 to 88 in mean height with vandellia twenty crossed plants exceeded in height twenty plants raised from cleistogamic seeds only by a little namely in the ratio of 100 to 94  it is a natural inquiry how so many plants belonging to various very distinct families first came to have the development of their flowers arrested so as ultimately to become cleistogamic that a passage from the one state to the other is far from difficult is shown by the many recorded cases of gradations between the two states on the same plant in viola oxalis biophytum campanula etc in the several species of viola the various parts of the flowers have also been modified in very different degrees those plants which in their own country produce flowers of full or nearly full size but never expand as with thelymitra and yet set fruit might easily be rendered cleistogamic lathyrus nissolia seems to be in an incipient transitional state as does drosera anglica the flowers of which are not perfectly closed there is good evidence that flowers sometimes fail to expand and are somewhat reduced in size owing to exposure to unfavourable conditions but still retain their fertility unimpaired linnaeus observed in 1753 that the flowers on several plants brought from spain and grown at upsala did not show any corolla and yet produced seeds asa gray has seen flowers on exotic plants in the northern united states which never expanded and yet fruited with certain english plants which bear flowers during nearly the whole year mr bennett found that those produced during the winter season were fertilised in the bud whilst with other species having fixed times for flowering but which had been tempted by a mild january to put forth a few wretched flowers no pollen was discharged from the anthers and no seed was formed the flowers of lysimachia vulgaris if fully exposed to the sun expand properly while those growing in shady ditches have smaller corollas which open only slightly and these two forms graduate into one another in intermediate stations herr bouches observations are of especial interest for he shows that both temperature and the amount of light affect the size of the corolla and he gives measurements proving that with some plants the corolla is diminished by the increasing cold and darkness of the changing season whilst with others it is diminished by the increasing heat and light 832 for the statement by linnaeus see mohl in botanische zeitung 1863 page 327 asa gray american journal of science 2nd series volume 39 1865 page 105 bennett in nature november 1869 page 11 the reverend g henslow also says gardeners chronicle 1877 page 271 also nature october 19 1876 page 543 that when the autumn draws on and habitually in winter for such of our wild flowers as blossom at that season the flowers are selffertilised on lysimachia h muller nature september 1873 page 433 bouche sitzungsbericht der gesell naturforsch freunde october 1874 page 90  the belief that the first step towards flowers being rendered cleistogamic was due to the conditions to which they were exposed is supported by the fact of various plants belonging to this class either not producing their cleistogamic flowers under certain conditions or on the other hand producing them to the complete exclusion of the perfect ones thus some species of viola do not bear cleistogamic flowers when growing on the lowlands or in certain districts other plants when cultivated have failed to produce perfect flowers during several successive years and this is the case with juncus bufonius in its native land of russia cleistogamic flowers are produced by some species late and by others early in the season and this agrees with the view that the first step towards their development was due to climate though the periods at which the two sorts of flowers now appear must since have become much more distinctly defined we do not know whether too low are too high a temperature or the amount of light acts in a direct manner on the size of the corolla or indirectly through the male organs being first affected however this may be if a plant were prevented either early or late in the season from fully expanding its corolla with some reduction in its size but with no loss of the power of selffertilisation then natural selection might well complete the work and render it strictly cleistogamic the various organs would also it is probable be modified by the peculiar conditions to which they are subjected within a completely closed flower also by the principle of correlated growth and by the tendency in all reduced organs finally to disappear the result would be the production of cleistogamic flowers such as we now see them and these are admirably fitted to yield a copious supply of seed at a wonderfully small cost to the plant  i will now sum up very briefly the chief conclusions which seem to follow from the observations given in this volume cleistogamic flowers afford as just stated an abundant supply of seeds with little expenditure and we can hardly doubt that they have had their structure modified and degraded for this special purpose perfect flowers being still almost always produced so as to allow of occasional crossfertilisation hermaphrodite plants have often been rendered monoecious dioecious or polygamous but as the separation of the sexes would have been injurious had not pollen been already transported habitually by insects or by the wind from flower to flower we may assume that the process of separation did not commence and was not completed for the sake of the advantages to be gained from crossfertilisation the sole motive for the separation of the sexes which occurs to me is that the production of a great number of seeds might become superfluous to a plant under changed conditions of life and it might then be highly beneficial to it that the same flower or the same individual should not have its vital powers taxed under the struggle for life to which all organisms are subjected by producing both pollen and seeds with respect to the plants belonging to the gynodioecious subclass or those which coexist as hermaphrodites and females it has been proved that they yield a much larger supply of seed than they would have done if they had all remained hermaphrodites and we may feel sure from the large number of seeds produced by many plants that such production is often necessary or advantageous it is therefore probable that the two forms in this subclass have been separated or developed for this special end  various hermaphrodite plants have become heterostyled and now exist under two or three forms and we may confidently believe that this has been effected in order that crossfertilisation should be assured for the full and legitimate fertilisation of these plants pollen from the one form must be applied to the stigma of another if the sexual elements belonging to the same form are united the union is an illegitimate one and more or less sterile with dimorphic species two illegitimate unions and with trimorphic species twelve are possible there is reason to believe that the sterility of these unions has not been specially acquired but follows as an incidental result from the sexual elements of the two or three forms having been adapted to act on one another in a particular manner so that any other kind of union is inefficient like that between distinct species another and still more remarkable incidental result is that the seedlings from an illegitimate union are often dwarfed and more or less or completely barren like hybrids from the union of two widely distinct species   index  acanthaceae  acer campestre  adoxa  aegiphila elata mollis obdurata  alefeld dr on linum  alisma natans  amphicarpaea
