the midland institute   the proceedings which have now been brought satisfactorily to an end are of a kind which nobody who has sensibility as well as sense can take a part in without some emotion an illustrious french philosopher who happened to be an examiner of candidates for admission to the polytechnic school once confessed that when a youth came before him eager to do his best competently taught and of an apt intelligence he needed all his selfcontrol to press back the tears from his eyes well when we think how much industry patience and intelligent discipline how many hard hours of selfdenying toil how many temptations to worthless pleasures resisted how much steadfast feeling for things that are honest and true and of good reportare all represented by the young men and young women to whom i have had the honour of giving your prizes tonight we must all feel our hearts warmed and gladdened in generous sympathy with so much excellence so many good hopes and so honourable a display of those qualities which make life better worth having for ourselves and are so likely to make the world better worth living in for those who are to come after us  if a prizegiving is always an occasion of lively satisfaction my own satisfaction is all the greater at this moment because your institute which is doing such good work in the world and is in every respect so prosperous and so flourishing is the creation of the people of your own district without subsidy and without direction either from london or from oxford or from cambridge or from any other centre whatever nobody in this town at any rate needs any argument of mine to persuade him that we can only be sure of advancing all kinds of knowledge and developing our national life in all its plenitude and variety on condition of multiplying these local centres both of secondary and higher education and encouraging each of them to fight its own battle and do its work in its own way for my own part i look with the utmost dismay at the concentration not only of population but of the treasures of instruction in our vast city on the banks of the thames at birmingham as i am informed one has not far to look for an example of this one of the branches of your multifarious trades in this town is the manufacture of jewellery some of it is said commonly to be wanting in taste elegance skill though some of it alsoif i am not misinformedis good enough to be passed off at rome and at paris even to connoisseurs as of roman or french production now the nation possesses a most superb collection of all that is excellent and beautiful in jewellers work when i say that the nation possesses it i mean that london possesses it the university of oxford by the way has also purchased a portion but that is not at present accessible if one of your craftsmen in that kind wants to profit by these admirable models he must go to london what happens is that he goes to the capital and stays there its superficial attractions are too strong for him you lose a clever workman and a citizen and he adds one more atom to that huge overgrown and unwieldy community now why in the name of common sense should not a portion of the castellani collection pass six months of the year in birmingham the very place of all others where it is most likely to be of real service and to make an effective mark on the national taste1  to pass on to the more general remarks which you are accustomed to expect from the president of the institute on this occasion when i consulted one of your townsmen as to the subject which he thought would be most useful and most interesting to you he said pray talk about anything you please if it is only not education there is a saying that there are two kinds of foolish people in the world those who give advice and those who do not take it my friend and i in this matter represent these two interesting divisions of the race for in spite of what he said it is upon education after all that i propose to offer you some short observations you will believe it no affectation on my part when i say that i shall do so with the sincerest willingness to be corrected by those of wider practical experience in teaching i am well aware too that i have very little that is new to say but education is one of those matters on which much that has already been said will long bear saying over and over again  i have been looking through the report of your classes and two things have rather struck me which i will mention one of them is the very large attendance in the french classes this appears a singularly satisfactory thing because you could scarcely do a hardworking man of whatever class a greater service than to give him easy access to french literature montesquieu used to say that he had never known a pain or a distress which he could not soothe by half an hour of a good book and perhaps it is no more of an exaggeration to say that a man who can read french with comfort need never have a dull hour our own literature has assuredly many a kingly name in boundless riches and infinite imaginative variety there is no rival to shakespeare in the world in energy and height and majesty milton and burke have no masters but besides its great men of this loftier sort france has a long list of authors who have produced a literature whose chief mark is its agreeableness as has been so often said the genius of the french language is its clearness firmness and order to this clearness certain circumstances in the history of french society have added the delightful qualities of liveliness in union with urbanity now as one of the most important parts of popular education is to put people in the way of amusing and refreshing themselves in a rational rather than an irrational manner it is a great gain to have given them the key to the most amusing and refreshing set of books in the world  and here perhaps i may be permitted to remark that it seems a pity that racine is so constantly used as a schoolbook instead of some of the moderns who are nearer to ourselves in ideas and manners racine is a great and admirable writer but what you want for ordinary readers who have not much time and whose faculties of attention are already largely exhausted by the more important industry of the day is a book which brings literature more close to actual life than such a poet as racine does this is exactly one of the gifts and charms of modern french to put what i mean very shortly i would say by way of illustration that a man who could read the essays of ste beuve with moderate comfort would have in his handsof course i am now speaking of the active and busy part of the world not of bookmen and studentswould i say have in his hands one of the very best instruments that i can think of such work is exquisite and instructive in itself it is a model of gracious writing it is full of ideas it breathes the happiest moods over us and it is the most suggestive of guides for those who have the capacity of extensive interests to all the greater spheres of thought and history  this word brings me back to the second fact that has struck me in your report and it is this the subject of english history has apparently so little popularity that the class is as near being a failure as anything connected with the midland institute can be on the whole whatever may be the ability and the zeal of the teacher this is in my humble judgment neither very surprising nor particularly mortifying if we think what history in the established conception of it means how are we to expect workmen to make their way through constitutional antiquities through the labyrinthine shifts of party intrigue at home and through the entanglements of intricate diplomacy abroadshallow village tales as emerson calls them these studies are fit enough for professed students of the special subject but such exploration is for the ordinary run of men and women impossible and i do not know that it would lead them into very fruitful lands even if it were easy you know what the great duke of marlborough said that he had learnt all the history he ever knew out of shakespeares historical plays i have long thought that if we persuaded those classes who have to fight their own little battles of blenheim for bread every day to make such a beginning of history as is furnished by shakespeares plays and scotts novels we should have done more to imbue them with a real interest in the past of mankind than if we had taken them through a course of hume and smollett or hallam on the english constitution or even the dazzling macaulay what i for one should like to see in such an institution as this would be an attempt to compress the whole history of england into a dozen or fifteen lectureslectures of course accompanied by catechetical instruction i am not so extravagant as to dream that a short general course of this kind would be enough to go over so many of the details as it is desirable for men to know but details in popular instruction though not in study of the writer or the university professor are only important after you have imparted the largest general truths it is the general truths that stir a lifelike curiosity as to the particulars which they are the means of lighting up now this short course would be quite enough to present in a bold outlineand it need not be a whit the less true and real for being both bold and rapidthe great chains of events and the decisive movements that have made of ourselves and our institutions what we and what they arethe teutonic beginnings the conquest the great charter the hundred years war the reformation the civil wars and the revolution the emancipation of the american colonies from the monarchy if this course were framed and filled in with a true social intelligencemen would find that they had at the end of it a fair ideaan idea that might be of great value and at any rate an idea much to be preferred to that blank ignorance which is in so many cases practically the only alternativeof the large issues of our past of the antagonistic principles that strove with one another for mastery of the chief material forces and moral currents of successive ages and above all of those great men and our fathers that begat usthe pyms the hampdens the cromwells the chathamsyes and shall we not say the washingtonsto whose sagacity bravery and unquenchable ardour for justice and order and equal laws all our englishspeaking peoples owe a debt that can never be paid  another point is worth thinking of besides the reduction of history for your purposes to a comprehensive body of rightly grouped generalities dr arnold says somewhere that he wishes the public might have a history of our present state of society traced backwards it is the present that really interests us it is the present that we seek to understand and to explain i do not in the least want to know what happened in the past except as it enables me to see my way more clearly through what is happening today i want to know what men thought and did in the thirteenth century not out of any dilettante or idle antiquarians curiosity but because the thirteenth century is at the root of what men think and do in the nineteenth well then it cannot be a bad educational rule to start from what is most interesting and to work from that outwards and backwards by beginning with the present we see more clearly what are the two things best worth attending to in historynot party intrigues nor battles nor dynastic affairs nor even many acts of parliament but the great movements of the economic forces of a society on the one hand and on the other the forms of religious opinion and ecclesiastical organisation all the rest are important but their importance is subsidiary  allow me to make one more remark on this subject if a dozen or a score of wise lectures would suffice for a general picture of the various phases through which our own society has passed there ought to be added to the course of popular instruction as many lectures more which should trace the history not of england but of the world and the history of the world ought to go before the history of england this is no paradox but the deliberate opinion of many of those who have thought most deeply about the farreaching chain of human progress when i was on a visit to the united states some years agothings may have improved since theni could not help noticing that the history classes in their common schools all began their work with the year 1776 when the american colonies formed themselves into an independent confederacy the teaching assumed that the creation of the universe occurred about that date what could be more absurd more narrow and narrowing more mischievously misleading as to the whole purport and significance of history as if the laws the representative institutions the religious uses the scientific methods the moral ideas which give to an american citizen his character and mental habits and social surroundings had not all their roots in the deeds and thoughts of wise and brave men who lived in centuries which are of course just as much the inheritance of the vast continent of the west as they are of the little island from whence its first colonisers sailed forth  well there is something nearly as absurd if not quite in our common plan of taking for granted that people should begin their reading of history not in 1776 but in 1066 as if this could bring into our minds what is after all the greatest lesson of history namely the fact of its oneness of the interdependence of all the elements that have in the course of long ages made the european of today what we see him to be it is no doubt necessary for clear and definite comprehension to isolate your phenomenon and to follow the stream of our own history separately but that cannot be enough we must also see that this stream is the effluent of a far broader and mightier floodwhose springs and sources and great tributaries lay higher up in the history of mankind  we are learning says mr freeman whose little book on the unity of history i cannot be wrong in warmly recommending even to the busiest among you that european history from its first glimmerings to our own day is one unbroken drama no part of which can be rightly understood without reference to the other parts which come before and after it we are learning that of this great drama rome is the centre the point to which all roads lead and from which all roads lead no less the world of independent greece stands on one side of it the world of modern europe stands on another but the history alike of the great centre itself and of its satellites on either side can never be fully grasped except from a point of view wide enough to take in the whole group and to mark the relations of each of its members to the centre and to one another  now the counsel which our learned historian thus urges upon the scholar and the leisured student equally represents the point of view which is proper for the more numerous classes of whom we are thinking tonight the scale will have to be reduced all save the very broadest aspects of things will have to be left out none save the highest ranges and the streams of most copious volume will find a place in that map small as is the scale and many as are its omissions yet if a man has intelligently followed the very shortest course of universal history it will be the fault of his teacher if he has not acquired an impressive conception which will never be effaced of the destinies of man upon the earth of the mighty confluence of forces working on from age to age which have their meeting in every one of us here tonight of the order in which each state of society has followed its foregoer according to great and changeless laws embracing all things and all times of the thousand faithful hands that have one after another each in their several degrees orders and capacities trimmed the silver lamp of knowledge and kept its sacred flame bright from generation to generation and age to age now in one land and now in another from its early spark among faroff dim chaldeans down to goethe and faraday and darwin and all the other good workers of our own day  the shortest course of universal history will let him see how he owes to the greek civilisation on the shores of the mediterranean two thousand years back a debt extending from the architectural forms of this very town hall to some of the most systematic operations of his own mind will let him see the forum of rome its roads and its gates    what conflux issuing forth or entering in   prætors proconsuls to their provinces   hasting or on return in robes of state  all busily welding an empire together in a marvellous framework of citizenship manners and laws that laid assured foundations for a still higher civilisation that was to come after he will learn how when the roman empire declined then at damascus and bagdad and seville the mahometan conquerors took up the torch of science and learning and handed it on to western europe when the new generations were ready he will learn how in the meantime during ages which we both wrongly and ungratefully call dark from rome again that other great organisation the mediæval church had arisen which amid many imperfections and some crimes did a work that no glory of physical science can equal and no instrument of physical science can compass in purifying mens appetites in setting discipline and direction on their lives and in offering to humanity new types of moral obligation and fairer ideals of saintly perfection whose light still shines like a star to guide our own poor voyages it is only by this contemplation of the life of our race as a whole that men see the beginnings and the ends of things learn not to be nearsighted in history but to look before and after see their own part and lot in the rising up and going down of empires and faiths since first recorded time began and what i am contending for is that even if you can take your young men and women no farther than the mere vestibule of this ancient and ever venerable temple of many marvels you will have opened to them the way to a kind of knowledge that not only enlightens the understanding but enriches the characterwhich is a higher thing than mere intellectand makes it constantly alive with the spirit of beneficence  i know it is said that such a view of collective history is true but that you will never get plain people to respond to it it is a thing for intellectual dilettanti and moralising virtuosi well we do not know because we have never yet honestly tried what the commonest people will or will not respond to when sir richard wallaces pictures were being exhibited at bethnal green after people had said that the workers had no souls for art and would not appreciate its treasures a story is told of a female in very poor clothes gazing intently at a picture of the infant jesus in the arms of his mother and then exclaiming who would not try to be a good woman who had such a child as that we have never yet i say tried the height and pitch to which our people are capable of rising  i have thought it well to take this opportunity of saying a word for history because i cannot help thinking that one of the most narrow and what will eventually be one of the most impoverishing characteristics of our day is the excessive supremacy claimed for physical science this is partly due no doubt to a most wholesome reaction against the excessive supremacy that has hitherto been claimed for literature and held by literature in our schools and universities at the same time it is well to remember that the historic sciences are making strides not unworthy of being compared with those of the physical sciences and not only is there room for both but any system is radically wrong which excludes or depresses either to the advantage of the other2  and now there is another idea which i should like to throw out if you will not think it too tedious and too special it is an old saying that after all the great end and aim of the british constitution is to get twelve honest men into a box that is really a very sensible way of putting the theory that the first end of government is to give security to life and property and to make people keep their contracts but with this view it is not only important that you should get twelve honest men into a box the twelve honest men must have in their heads some notions as to what constitutes evidence now it is surely a striking thing that while we are so careful to teach physical science and literature while men want to be endowed in order to have leisure to explore our spinal cords and to observe the locomotor system of medusæand i have no objection against those who urge on all these studiesyet there is no systematic teaching very often no teaching at all in the principles of evidence and reasoning even for the bulk of those who would be very much offended if we were to say that they are not educated of course i use the term evidence in a wider sense than the testimony in crimes and contracts and the other business of courts of law questions of evidence are rising at every hour of the day as bentham says it is a question of evidence with the cook whether the joint of meat is roasted enough it has been excellently said that the principal and most characteristic difference between one human intellect and another consists in their ability to judge correctly of evidence most of us mr mill says are very unsafe hands at estimating evidence if appeal cannot be made to actual eyesight indeed if we think of some of the tales that have been lately diverting the british association we might perhaps go farther and describe many of us as very bad hands at estimating evidence even where appeal can be made to actual eyesight eyesight in fact is the least part of the matter the senses are as often the tools as the guides of reason one of the longest chapters in the history of vulgar error would contain the cases in which the eyes have only seen what old prepossessions inspired them to see and were blind to all that would have been fatal to the prepossessions it is beyond all question or dispute says voltaire that magic words and ceremonies are quite capable of most effectually destroying a whole flock of sheep if the words be accompanied by a sufficient quantity of arsenic sorcery has no doubt been explodedat least we assume that it hasbut the temper that made men attribute all the efficacy to the magic words and entirely overlook the arsenic still prevails in a great host of moral and political affairs into which it is not convenient to enter here the stability of a government for instance is constantly set down to some ornamental part of it when in fact the ornamental part has no more to do with stability than the incantations of the soothsayer  you have heard again that for many generations the people of the isle of st kilda believed that the arrival of a ship in the harbour inflicted on the islanders epidemic colds in the head and many ingenious reasons were from time to time devised by clever men why the ship should cause colds among the population at last it occurred to somebody that the ship might not be the cause of the colds but that both might be the common effects of some other cause and it was then remembered that a ship could only enter the harbour when there was a strong northeast wind blowing  however faithful the observation as soon as ever a man uses words he may begin at that moment to go wrong a village apothecary it has been said and if possible in a still greater degree an experienced nurse is seldom able to describe the plainest case without employing a phraseology of which every word is a theory the simplest narrative of the most illiterate observer involves more or less of hypothesisyet both by the observer himself and by most of those who listen to him each of these conjectural assumptions is treated as respectfully as if it were an established axiom we are supposed to deny the possibility of a circumstance when in truth we only deny the evidence alleged for it we allow the excellence of reasoning from certain data to captivate our belief in the truth of the data themselves even when they are unproved and unprovable there is no end in short of the ways in which men habitually go wrong in their reasoning tacit or expressed the greatest boon that any benefactor could confer on the human race would be to teach menand especially womento quantify their propositions it sometimes seems as if swift were right when he said that mankind were just as fit for flying as for thinking  now it is quite true that motherwit and the common experiences of life do often furnish people with a sort of shrewd and sound judgment that carries them very creditably through the world they come to good conclusions though perhaps they would give bad reasons for them if they were forced to find their reasons but you cannot count upon motherwit in everybody perhaps not even in a majority and then as for the experience of lifethere are a great many questions and those of the deepest ultimate importance to mankind in which the ordinary experience of life sheds no light until it has been interrogated and interpreted by men with trained minds it is far easier as has been said to acquire facts than to judge what they prove what is done in our systems of training to teach people how to judge what facts prove there is mathematics no doubt anybody who has done even no more than the first book of euclids geometry ought to have got into his head the notion of a demonstration of the rigorously close connection between a conclusion and its premisses of the necessity of being able to show how each link in the chain comes to be where it is and that it has a right to be there this however is a long way from the facts of real life and a man might well be a great geometer and still be a thoroughly bad reasoner in practical questions  again in other of your classes in chemistry in astronomy in natural history besides acquiring groups of facts the student has a glimpse of the method by which they were discovered of the type of inference to which the discovery conforms so that the discovery of a new comet the detection of a new species the invention of a new chemical compound each becomes a lesson of the most beautiful and impressive kind in the art of reasoning and it would be superfluous and impertinent for me here to point out how valuable such lessons are in the way of mental discipline apart from the fruit they bear in other ways but here again the relation to the judgments we have to form in the moral political practical sphere is too remote and too indirect the judgments in this region of the most brilliant and successful explorers in physical science seem to be exactly as liable to every kind of fallacy as those of other people the application of scientific method and conception to society is yet in its infancy and the novum organum or the principia of moral and social phenomena will perhaps not be wholly disclosed to any of us now alive in any case it is clear that for the purposes of such an institution as this if the rules of evidence and proof and all the other safeguards for making your propositions true and relevant are to be taught at all they must be taught not only in an elementary form but with illustrations that shall convey their own direct reference and application to practical life if everybody could find time to master mills logic or so instructive and interesting a book as professor jevonss principles of science a certain number at any rate of the bad mental habits of people would be cured and for those of you here who have leisure enough and want to find a worthy keystone of your culture it would be hard to find a better thing to do for the next six months than to work through one or both of the books i have just namedpen in hand the ordinary textbooks of formal logic do not seem to meet the special aim which i am now trying to impress as desirablenamely the habit of valuing not merely speculative nor scientific truth but the truth of practical life a practising of the intellect in forming and expressing the opinions and judgments that form the staple of our daily discourse  it is now accepted that the most effective way of learning a foreign language is to begin by reading books written in it or by conversing in itand then after a certain empirical familiarity with vocabulary and construction has been acquired one may proceed to master the grammar just in the same way it would seem to be the best plan to approach the art of practical reasoning in concrete examples in cases of actual occurrence and living interest and then after the processes of disentangling a complex group of propositions of dividing and shifting of scenting a fallacy have all become familiar it may be worth while to find names for them all and to set out rules for reasoning rightly just as in the former illustration the rules of writing correctly follow a certain practice rather than precede it  now it has long seemed to me that the best way of teaching carefulness and precision in dealing with propositions might be found through the medium of the argumentation in the courts of justice this is reasoning in real matter there is a famous book well known to legal studentssmiths leading caseswhich contains a selection of important decisions and sets forth the grounds on which the courts arrived at them i have often thought that a dozen or a score of cases might be collected from this book into a small volume that would make such a manual as no other matter could for opening plain mens eyes to the logical pitfalls among which they go stumbling and crashing when they think they are disputing like socrates or reasoning like newton they would see how a proposition or an expression that looks straightforward and unmistakable is yet on examination found to be capable of bearing several distinct interpretations and meaning several distinct things how the same evidence may warrant different conclusions and what kinds of evidence carry with them what degrees of validity how certain sorts of facts can only be proved in one way and certain other sorts of facts in some other way how necessary it is before you set out to know exactly what it is you intend to show or what it is you intend to dispute how there may be many argumentative objections to a proposition yet the balance be in favour of its adoption it is from the generality of people having neglected to practise the attention on these and the like matters that interest and prejudice find so ready an instrument of sophistry in that very art of speech which ought to be the organ of reason and truth to bring the matter to a point then i submit that it might be worth while in this and all such institutions to have a class for the study of logic reasoning evidence and that such a class might well find its best material in selections from leading cases and from benthams rationale of judicial evidence elucidated by those special sections in mills logic or smaller manuals such as those of mr fowler the oxford professor of logic which treat of the department of fallacies perhaps benthams book of fallacies is too political for me to commend it to you here but if there happens to be any one in birmingham who is fond of meeting proposed changes by saying that they are utopian that they are good in theory but bad in practice that they are too good to be realised and so forth then i can promise him that he will in that book hear of something very much to his advantage3  an incidental advantagewhich is worth mentioningof making legal instances the medium of instruction in practical logic would be that people wouldnot learn law of course in the present state of our system but they would have their attention called in a direct and businesslike way to the lawyers point of view and those features of procedure in which every man and woman in the land has so immediate an interest perhaps if people interested themselves more seriously than is implied by reading famous cases in the newspapers we should get rid for one thing of the rule which makes the accused person in a criminal case incompetent to testify and for another of that infamous license of crossexamination to credit which is not only barbarous to those who have to submit to it but leads to constant miscarriage of justice in the case of those who rather than submit to it will suffer wrong  it will be said i daresay that overmuch scruple about our propositions and the evidence for them will reduce men especially the young to the intellectual condition of the great philosopher marphurius in molières comedy marphurius rebukes sganarelle for saying he had come into the roomwhat you should say is that it seems i am come into the room instead of the downright affirmations and burly negations so becoming to britons he would bring down all our propositions to the attenuation of a possibility or a perhaps we need not fear such an end the exigencies of practical affairs will not allow this endless balancing they are always driving men to the other extreme making us like the new judge who first heard the counsel on one side and made up his mind on the merits of the case until the turn of the opposing counsel came and then the new counsel filled the judge with so many doubts and perplexities that he suddenly vowed that nothing would induce him to pay any heed to evidence again as long as he lived  i do not doubt that i shall be blamed in what i have said about french and about history for encouraging a spirit of superficiality and of contentment with worthless smatterings of things to this i should answer that as archbishop whately pointed out long ago it is a fallacy to mistake general truths for superficial truths or a knowledge of the leading propositions of a subject for a superficial knowledge to have a general knowledge of a subject is to know only its leading truths but to know these thoroughly so as to have a true conception of the subject in its great features mill and i need not point out that instruction may be of the most general kind and still possess that most important quality of all instructionnamely being methodical                                       i think popular instruction has been made much more repulsive than it need have been and more repulsive than it ought to have been because those who have had the control of the movement for the last fifty years have been too anxious to make the type of popular instruction conform to the type of academic instruction proper to learned men the principles of instruction have been too rigorously ascetic and puritanical and instead of making the access to knowledge as easy as possible we have delighted in forcing every pilgrim to make his journey to the shrine of the muses with a hairshirt on his back and peas in his shoes nobody would say that macaulay had a superficial knowledge of the things best worth knowing in ancient literature yet we have his own confession that when he became a busy manas you are all busythen he read his classics not like a collegian but like a man of the world if he did not know a word he passed it over and if a passage refused to give up its meaning at the second reading then he let it alone now the aims of academic education and those of popular education areit is obvious if you come to think of itquite different the end of the one is rather to increase knowledge of the other to diffuse it and to increase mens interest in what is already known if therefore i am for making certain kinds of instruction as general as they can possibly be made in these local centres i should give to the old seats of learning a very special function indeed  it would be absurd to attempt to discuss academic organisation here at this hour i only want to ask you as politicians whose representatives in parliament will ultimately settle the matterto reflect whether the money now consumed in idle fellowships might not be more profitably employed in endowing inquirers the favourite argument of those who support prize fellowships is that they are the only means by which a child of the workingclass can raise himself to the highest positions in the land my answer to this would be that in the first place it is of questionable expediency to invite the cleverest members of any class to leave itinstead of making their abilities available in it and so raising the whole class along with and by means of their own rise second these prize fellowships will continue and must continue to be carried off by those who can afford time and money to educate their sons for the competition third i doubt the expediencyand the history of oxford within the last twentyfive years strikingly confirms this doubtof giving to a young man of any class what is practically a premium on indolence and the removal of a motive to selfreliant and energetic spirit of enterprise the best thing that i can think of as happening to a young man is this that he should have been educated at a dayschool in his own town that he should have opportunities of following also the higher education in his own town and that at the earliest convenient time he should be taught to earn his own living  the universities might then be left to their proper business of study knowledge for its own sake is clearly an object which only a very small portion of society can be spared to pursue only a very few men in a generation have that devouring passion for knowing which is the true inspirer of fruitful study and exploration even if the passion were more common than it is the world could not afford on any very large scale that men should indulge in it the great business of the world has to be carried on one of the greatest of all hindrances to making things better is the habit of taking for granted that plans or ideas simply because they are different and approach the matter from different sides are therefore the rivals and enemies instead of being the friends and complements of one another but a great and wealthy society like ours ought very well to be able to nourish one or two great seats for the augmentation of true learning and at the same time make sure that young menand again i say especially young womenshould have good education of the higher kind within reach of their own hearths                                       it is not necessary for me here i believe to dwell upon any of the great commonplaces which the follower of knowledge does well to keep always before his eyes and which represent the wisdom of many generations of studious experience you may have often heard from others or may have found out how good it is to have on your shelves however scantily furnished they may be three or four of those books to which it is well to give ten minutes every morning before going down into the battle and choking dust of the day men will name these books for themselves one will choose the bible another goethe one the imitation of christ another wordsworth perhaps it matters little what it be so long as your writer has cheerful seriousness elevation calm and above all a sense of size and strength which shall open out the day before you and bestow gifts of fortitude and mastery  then to turn to the intellectual side you know as well as i or any one can tell you that knowledge is worth little until you have made it so perfectly your own as to be capable of reproducing it in precise and definite form goethe said that in the end we only retain of our studies after all what we practically employ of them and it is at least well that in our serious studies we should have the possibility of practically turning them to a definite destination clearly before our eyes nobody can be sure that he has got clear ideas on a subject unless he has tried to put them down on a piece of paper in independent words of his own it is an excellent plan too when you have read a good book to sit down and write a short abstract of what you can remember of it it is a still better plan if you can make up your minds to a slight extra labour to do what lord strafford and gibbon and daniel webster did after glancing over the title subject or design of a book these eminent men would take a pen and write roughly what questions they expected to find answered in it what difficulties solved what kind of information imparted such practices keep us from reading with the eye only gliding vaguely over the page and they help us to place our new acquisitions in relation with what we knew before it is almost always worth while to read a thing twice over to make sure that nothing has been missed or dropped on the way or wrongly conceived or interpreted and if the subject be serious it is often well to let an interval elapse ideas relations statements of fact are not to be taken by storm we have to steep them in the mind in the hope of thus extracting their inmost essence and significance if one lets an interval pass and then returns it is surprising how clear and ripe that has become which when we left it seemed crude obscure full of perplexity  all this takes trouble no doubt but then it will not do to deal with ideas that we find in books or elsewhere as a certain bird does with its eggsleave them in the sand for the sun to hatch and chance to rear people who follow this plan possess nothing better than ideas halfhatched and convictions reared by accident they are like a man who should pace up and down the world in the delusion that he is clad in sumptuous robes of purple and velvet when in truth he is only halfcovered by the rags and tatters of other peoples castoff clothes  apart from such mechanical devices as these i have mentioned there are habits and customary attitudes of mind which a conscientious reader will practise if he desires to get out of a book still greater benefits than the writer of it may have designed or thought of for example he should never be content with mere aggressive and negatory criticism of the page before him the page may be open to such criticism and in that case it is natural to indulge in it but the reader will often find an unexpected profit by asking himselfwhat does this error teach me how comes that fallacy to be here how came the writer to fall into this defect of taste to ask such questions gives a reader a far healthier tone of mind in the long run more seriousness more depth more moderation of judgment more insight into other mens ways of thinking as well as into his own than any amount of impatient condemnation and hasty denial even when both condemnation and denial may be in their place  again let us not be too ready to detect an inconsistency in our author but rather let us teach ourselves to distinguish between inconsistency and having two sides to an opinion before i admit that two and two are four some one said i must first know to what use you are going to put the proposition that is to say even the plainest proposition needs to be stated with a view to the drift of the discussion in hand or with a view to some special part of the discussion when the turn of some other part of the matter comes it will be convenient and often necessary to bring out into full light another side of your opinion not contradictory but complementary and the great distinction of a candid disputant or of a reader of good faith is his willingness to take pains to see the points of reconciliation among different aspects and different expressions of what is substantially the same judgment  then again nobody here needs to be reminded that the great successes of the world have been affairs of a second a third nay a fiftieth trial the history of literature of science of art of industrial achievements all testify to the truth that success is only the last term of what looked like a series of failures what is true of the great achievements of history is true also of the little achievements of the observant cultivator of his own understanding if a man is despondent about his work the best remedy that i can prescribe to him is to turn to a good biography there he will find that other men before him have known the dreary reaction that follows longsustained effort and he will find that one of the differences between the firstrate man and the fifthrate lies in the rigour with which the firstrate man recovers from this reaction and crushes it down and again flings himself once more upon the breach i remember the wisest and most virtuous man i have ever known or am ever likely to knowmr millonce saying to me that whenever he had written anything he always felt profoundly dissatisfied with it and it was only by reflecting that he had felt the same about other pieces of which the world had thought well that he could bring himself to send the new production to the printer the heroism of the scholar and the truthseeker is not less admirable than the heroism of the manatarms  finally you none of you need to be reminded of the most central and important of all the commonplaces of the studentthat the stuff of which life is made is time that it is better as goethe said to do the most trifling thing in the world than to think half an hour a trifling thing nobody means by this that we are to have no pleasures where time is lost and wasted is where many people lose and waste their moneyin things that are neither pleasure nor businessin those random and officious sociabilities which neither refresh nor instruct nor invigorate but only fret and benumb and wear all edge off the mind all these things however you have all of you often thought about yet alas we are so ready to forget both in these matters and in other and weightier how irrevocable are our mistakes    the moving finger writes and having writ   moves on nor all your piety nor wit   can lure it back to cancel half a line   nor all your tears wipe out a word of it   and now i think i cannot ask you to listen any longer i will only add that these ceremonial anniversaries when they are over sometimes slightly tend to depress us unless we are on our guard when the prizes of the year are all distributed and the address is at an end we perhaps ask ourselves well and what then it is not to be denied that the expectations of the first fervent promoters of popular instruction by such institutes as thisof men like lord brougham and others a generation agowere not fulfilled the principal reason was that the elementary instruction of the country was not then sufficiently advanced to supply a population ready to take advantage of education in the higher subjects well we are in a fair way for removing that obstacle it is true that the old world moves tardily on its arduous way but even if the results of all our efforts in the cause of education were smaller than they are there are still two considerations that ought to weigh with us and encourage us  for one thing you never know what child in rags and pitiful squalor that meets you in the street may have in him the germ of gifts that might add new treasures to the storehouse of beautiful things or noble acts in that great storm of terror which swept over france in 1793 a certain man who was every hour expecting to be led off to the guillotine uttered this memorable sentiment even at this incomprehensible momenthe saidwhen morality enlightenment love of country all of them only make death at the prisondoor or on the scaffold more certainyes on the fatal tumbril itself with nothing free but my voice i could still cry take care to a child that should come too near the wheel perhaps i may save his life perhaps he may one day save his country this is a generous and inspiring thoughtone to which the roughesthanded man or woman in birmingham may respond as honestly and heartily as the philosopher who wrote it it ought to shame the listlessness with which so many of us see the great phantasmagoria of life pass before us  there is another thought to encourage us still more direct and still more positive the boisterous old notion of heroworship which has been preached by so eloquent a voice in our age is after all now seen to be a halftruth and to contain the less edifying and the less profitable half of the truth the world will never be able to spare its hero and the man with the rare and inexplicable gift of genius will always be as commanding a figure as he has ever been what we see every day with increasing clearness is that not only the wellbeing of the many but the chances of exceptional genius moral or intellectual in the gifted few are highest in a society where the average interest curiosity capacity are all highest the moral of this for you and for me is plain we cannot like beethoven or handel lift the soul by the magic of divine melody into the seventh heaven of ineffable vision and hope incommensurable we cannot like newton weigh the faroff stars in a balance and measure the heavings of the eternal flood we cannot like voltaire scorch up what is cruel and false by a word as a flame nor like milton or burke awaken mens hearts with the note of an organtrumpet we cannot like the great saints of the churches and the great sages of the schools add to those acquisitions of spiritual beauty and intellectual mastery which have one by one and little by little raised man from being no higher than the brute to be only a little lower than the angels but what we can dothe humblest of us in this great hallis by diligently using our own minds and diligently seeking to extend our own opportunities to others to help to swell that common tide on the force and the set of whose currents depends the prosperous voyaging of humanity when our names are blotted out and our place knows us no more the energy of each social service will remain and so too let us not forget will each social disservice remain like the unending stream of one of natures forces the thought that this is so may well lighten the poor perplexities of our daily life and even soothe the pang of its calamities it lifts us from our feet as on wings opening a larger meaning to our private toil and a higher purpose to our public endeavour it makes the morning as we awake to it welcome and the evening like a soft garment as it wraps us about it nerves our arm with boldness against oppression and injustice and strengthens our voice with deeper accents against falsehood while we are yet in the full noon of our daysyes and perhaps it will shed some ray of consolation when our eyes are growing dim to it all and we go down into the valley of the dark shadow   footnotes  1 sir henry cole cb writes to the times oct 13 on this suggestion as followsin justice to the lords president of the council on education i hope you will allow me the opportunity of stating that from 1855 the science and art department has done its very utmost to induce schools of art to receive deposits of works of art for study and popular examination and to circulate its choicest objects useful to manufacturing industry in corroboration of this assertion please to turn to p 435 of the twentysecond report of the department just issued you will there find that upwards of 26907 objects of art besides 23911 paintings and drawings have been circulated since 1855 and in some cases have been left for several months for exhibition in the localities they have been seen by more than 6000000 of visitors besides having been copied by students etc and the localities have taken the great sum of £116182 for showing them  the department besides has tried every efficient means to induce other public institutions which are absolutely choked with superfluous specimens to concur in a general principle of circulating the nations works of art but without success  the chief of our national storehouses of works of art actually repudiates the idea that its objects are collected for purposes of education and declares that they are only things rare and curious the very reverse of what common sense says they are  further the department to tempt schools of art to acquire objects permanently for art museums attached to them offered a grant in aid of 50 per cent of the cost price of the objects   2 a very eminent physicist writes to me on this passage i cannot help smiling when i think of the place of physical science in the endowed schools etc my reference was to the great prevalence of such assertions as that human progress depends upon increase of our knowledge of the conditions of material phenomena dr draper for instance lays this down as a fundamental axiom of history as if moral advance the progressive elevation of types of character and ethical ideals were not at least an equally important cause of improvement in civilisation the type of saint vincent de paul is plainly as indispensable to progress as the type of newton   3 this suggestion has fortunately found favour in a quarter where shrewd and critical common sense is never wanting the economist oct 14 writessuch a textbook commented on to a class by a man trained to estimate the value of evidence would form a most valuable study and not we should imagine at all less fascinating than valuable of course the class suggested would not be a class in english law but in the principles on which evidence should be estimated and the special errors to which in common life average minds are most liable we regard this suggestion as a most useful one and as one which would not only greatly contribute to the educational worth of an institute for adults but also to its popularity
