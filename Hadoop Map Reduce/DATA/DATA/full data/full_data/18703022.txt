chapter i   when i abandoned the home of my girlhood and took my delicate child to california i started upon the journey goaded only by apathetic hopes sustained only by the desperation of despair  marjorie was my all and i could no longer endure the tension of her gradual decline as i watched her fade away i realized that my closest friends were becoming reconciled to my bereavement with the philosophical fortitude of spectators when i was coolly advised not to sacrifice pecuniary interests for the sentiment of a hopeless experiment an outraged love grew strong and defiant the calculating counsel so cruel and unexpected strengthened at last the timid resolution even the silent walls of my house oppressed while an absolute hatred of the machinery of life seized my tired soul i determined to be free at any price fresh courage entered my life and impelled me to remove without a pang most cherished household gods my relief was immoderate when everything was gone then i experienced for the first time in years the sweet exhilaration that welcomes breathlessly a change in my dreams i had apparitions of purple mountains and long quiet days purified with sunshine suddenly into my sad life there came new hope kindled it seemed from the very ashes of an abortive past  before i realized the initial steps of my undertaking anticipated perplexities had been absorbed by the novel conditions of our journey four days away from the old home and new york found me happier than for months when i saw for the first time a flush upon the pallid cheeks of my child the faintest reflection of the coveted boon i sought  a fresh excitement made me strong for each new duty the present at last held all that i craved when i watched my child among her pillows so much better that she prattled of great plans to be carried out on the far away coast i loved even then the land to see the little one sleep and watch for her awakening among the great quiet mountains was to my heart an ecstasy dear mamma she cried clasping her thin hands as the train clambered close to the silent monarchs of the west i want to touch they  yes sweetheart i said when marjorie is strong and well she shall not only touch the dear mountains but she shall crawl into their very arms mamma will take her into the beautiful cañons where little streams always sing to the tall ferns we shall have a picnic and perhaps the fairies will come when my little girl sees the fairy queen she can ask for a boon like mabel in the song perhaps the queen will say so this is little marjorie who came all the way from new york to see us marjorie is a good child and was very patient during her long journey she took her bitter medicine bravely and now she must be rewarded what shall be done for her my fairies  then perhaps one kind fairy may say her cheeks must grow pink like a la france rose and another her limbs must grow strong like a perfect tree and a third her eyes must be bright like the stars and she must soon be well and as happy as she is pretty  thus i romanced to my patient child snatching an inspiration from every mile that drove us into the far country  when we entered the wide trackless desertthe home of distorted yuccas which stretched gaunt arms to the cloudless sky like hopeless criminals doomed to the intermediate wastes of purgatoryi knew that the happy valley lay beyond then my child was sleeping for long hours at a time nor did she awaken until the last yucca had vanished from the deserts edge then she opened her eyes in wonderland for the overland train had completed its conquest the great mountain chains had been passed over in safety while far behind fields of snow and shrieking blasts were forgotten as we glided peacefully into the beautiful valley of san gabriel that pet marjorie might live  our long journey was ended we could rest although not perfectly until after leaving the pleasant hotel known as the east san gabriel when i hoped to find in the old spanish home of the doña maria del valle the coveted seclusion of which i had dreamed  from the beginning of our journey everyone had been interested in marjorie  i soon found myself accepting small attentions from sympathetic strangers as naturally as i would have accepted a few weeks before the favors of old friends  it thus happened that i first heard of the doña maria del valle through a lady and her son with whom i traveled a most perfect place for pet marjorie would be with the doña maria del valle mrs sanderson had told me shortly after our arrival in san gabriel when i inquired of all for a home that would shelter us for at least a year marjorie must not live in a hotel exposed to the constant excitement of robust children and irresponsible strangers  besides i desired to try not only the winter of southern california but the long unimpassioned summer so conducive to the restoration of the delicate  my new friend had spent the previous season in san gabriel she was familiar with the locality and offered at once to intercede in our behalf with the doña maria del valle when she told in her captivating way of the quaint picturesque spanish home i could content myself with no other retreat and begged that the preliminary arrangements might be made at once from the first moment of our acquaintance mrs sandersons attentions had been agreeable as soon as we arrived at the hotel she was perfectly at home every one hastened to serve her and i perceived that she was an acknowledged authority wherever she went my mind was not then equal to the analysis of character i was unsuspicious and willing to believe in the assumed qualities of those about me it was enough that my child was improving hourly in health and that i had found a congenial and sympathetic companion in my extremity  now that i have undertaken a story in which mrs sanderson and her son sidney so conspicuously figure i feel compelled to review carefully my early and subsequent impressions of both in order that the events of our short and memorable acquaintance may be readily understood  doubtless my estimate of entire strangers would have been different under less intense circumstances but at that time any one who appeared interested in my child was at once my friendnot only the conspicuous and influential but the humble and uncultivated as well looking back over those trying weeks i now remember hosts of delicate attentions dispensed by the unpretentious that at the time were hardly realized owing to the effusive ostentations of the sandersons  since i have studied carefully the events which followed rapidly from the beginning of our acquaintance i am certain that neither marjorie nor myself would have received the slightest notice from either mrs sanderson or her son had we failed in their selfish entertainment my little girl beautiful and bright unconsciously stole into the coldest hearts but i know now that it was not her delicate frame nor the pathos of a defrauded childhood that won the devotion of mrs sanderson it was simply that marjorie was an additional amusement an additional effect enlivening the small court which the lady invariably held the capricious woman petted the child only for entertainment a thoroughbred dog or a kitten could have won her interest as successfully had her passing mood been favorable to their antics her fancy for myself was equally selfish i was young enough to interest her son and from the first she evidently regarded me as a convenient and suitable companion for the winter i learned afterwards that mrs sanderson was notoriously fond of young widows she treated them with unusual favor in view of eventual schemes which she generally worked her only idea of life was entertainment and in order to satisfy her thirst for novelty she had always chosen pretty widows to expand her power and promote her individual caprices unincumbered by the unreasonable demands of a husband she regarded a pathetic young widow a most desirable companion always securing if possible a fresh one for the nucleus of her social experiments  why i should have submitted to this womans patronage i can not understand my only excuse is the recollection of an unsuspicious joy that came like new life into my soul marjorie was getting well and there was no one who understood my happiness like mrs sanderson it never occurred to me to doubt her sincerity that she was often haughty and disagreeable to others i saw but for me she had only indulgence and delicate sympathy under calming climatic influences my pagan intuitions grew hourly beneath the lights and shadows of the prophetic mountains analytical tendencies ceased possibly my creeds became unorthodox but they expanded cheerfully each day that they might hold more of gods harmonious universe and less of mans deformity  i believed afresh in universal philanthropy the sweet lethargic days were satisfying i had no desire to analyze the motives of my associates  i was no longer interested in attenuated studies of character the book of nature and the literal tales of mother goose now constituted my library for the present the wise men of athens were no wiser than the man who so successfully evaded the consequences of the bramble bush now that my child had been given back to me no unnecessary suspicions disturbed my credulous content i had been tired so long that to rest at last necessarily developed passive conditions over which i had but languid control  mrs sanderson crossing my path at this particular time appeared to be the very person to stimulate my reviving interest in life and i accepted eagerly and without analysis the friendship she offered  from the first i had been fascinated by her alertness unconsciously i felt indebted to her for my renewed fortunes it was not until long afterward that i discovered how very little she really did for me or for anyone else when she appeared to be doing so much she always assumed the leadership of social affairs so cleverly that to have questioned her right would have proved fatal to the individual it was impossible to resist her personality when she chose to be engaging  she was tall and slender with the established slenderness that emphasizes distinction at fortyfive when plump women often exhibit the ripeness of decay  in a word mrs sanderson eclipsed completely her feminine contemporaries often exciting jealous antagonisms  the ladys superior preservation was at times exasperating and her scornful indifference to topics usually interesting to middle life disconcerted and annoyed domestic women of her own age her infirmities she heroically concealed and was never surprised into the acknowledgement of a physical weakness the chronic afflictions of other women never moved her to sympathetic confidences in fact she avoided systematically the society of older women while she ingratiated herself irresistibly with young people of both sexes  for these reasons mrs sanderson was frequently disliked but as few dared to oppose her openly her sway always grew to be absolute     chapter ii   mrs sanderson at the various stations of her social pilgrimage had managed to create fresh enthusiasms for every shrine each year found her alert substituting new images for those cast down and withal grading so ingeniously the declivities of time that the world failed to detect the skillful engineering because for her there had been none of those abrupt drops so disastrous to the grace of womanhood  she was always in sympathy with the age for this reason she was perpetually surrounded by young people who referred to her upon all questions accepting her decree as preëminent  her distinguished bearing and captivating manners were so infectious that before she had been in san gabriel a week she was the recognized authority of the hotel  it was suicidal to ones standing with a laundress to advocate the doctrines of unfluted linen contrary to the opinion of mrs sanderson even the nonemotional wing lee replied to my entreaty to handle less roughly marjories frocks high tone lady she muchey likey my washey my starchey i felt the propriety of the rebuke when mrs sanderson at that moment sauntered past my door  having established her position even in the estimation of the domestics and celestials it is not surprising that at the end of two weeks she was widely known in the district of san gabriel devoutly feared by the usual social barometers of the hotel adored by all on whom she smiled and hated by the unfortunate few ostracized from her favor she seemed the sun of the san gabriel social system compelling sidney and every one about her to reflect modestly the capricious beams she magnanimously bestowed in the meantime a marvelous change had taken place in the bare apartments that up to the present time had not been distinguished as the choice of a popular leader the rooms were no longer suggestive of the fluctuating tourist but suddenly became rich in abiding personality and comfort  it was observable that the obsequious housekeeper had rifled other apartments and that couches and easy chairs had materialized with a due conformity to the prolific climate  the formerly obtrusive white walls soon grew companionable as pictures draperies japanese plaques and characteristic indian baskets sprouted upon them each night in all directions were strewn evidences of travel and refinement  in the bepillowed alcove a dainty tea table invited the five oclock teabibbers of the circle elect while a piano and stringed instruments allured the musical and always the young  more noticeable however than all else in the rooms was the display of attractive photographs indicating for the sandersons a large and distinguished acquaintance of beautiful women  sids sweethearts the mother said playfully to the girls who questioned her about the rival beauties and when a pert miss bravely intimated that young sanderson must be a kind of a blue beard the lady goodnaturedly replied oh yes sid is terribly fickle most of the dear ones have been beheaded long ago and now the naughty boy is only in love with his mother  at the same time we noticed that the face of one beautiful girl was repeated many times in the collection and inferred that this particular beauty still found favor  the son was noncommittal he submitted indifferently to the attentions of the various young women who thronged his mothers rooms yet more often appeared bored than entertained  had i met sidney away from his clever relative i am certain i would never have honored him with my acquaintance but from the first his mother compelled me as well as her entire circle of friends to accept the young man at her estimate sidney sanderson was undoubtedly a striking development of his type but foolish indulgence a naturally indolent and unsympathetic dispositiontogether with certain disreputable vices had made him totally unworthy of the consideration he received about his full blond physique there was a blasé indifference which unfortunately very often fascinates young girls yet without his mother the young man would have found it difficult to retain social approbation deprived of her shielding expedients his dissipations would have become notorious his gentlemanly pretensions questioned  away from her farreaching influence her vigilant contrivance and conquering resources he would not have been long courted or extolled  the usual unhappy demand for young men would doubtless have insured for a time his toleration about the hotel but his position would have been different he would have been openly criticised and perhaps denounced unprotected by his mothers popularity  as it was no one dared to hint an unfavorable judgment on the son of the gifted mother who put words into his mouth and characteristics to his account which in reminiscent moods must have embarrassed him  mrs sanderson approved or withered instantly our plans although she never neglected to refer with the sweetest subserviency to her son ask sid she would say i dare say he will think it quite the thing for us all but his judgments are so much quieter than mine that he is best to consult thus she constituted her selfinstructed oracle a paramount authority  i am still fascinated with the recollections of this wily woman her ability to deceive captivates me now as in the beginning of our acquaintanceship it enthralled my reason and silenced my prejudices  not satisfied with posing her son before the young and unthinking as a model of refinement endowed with the intrinsic qualities of manhood his intellectual upheavals were often depicted in side talk with celebrities once with maternal discretion as fine as it was impertinent she told our latest nervously prostrated authoress who was enjoying a cup of tea in the alcove about her boys passion for old books sidneys library is his one extravagance she confided sweetly then with unblushing assurance she told how her sons intellectual indulgence had cost her an orange ranch yet owing to the extremely moral character of the fad she had grown resigned only once had she ventured a remonstrancewhen a fabulous sum was paid for an atrocious old dante too absolutely filthy for any one but a connoisseur of course she knew she was uncultivated but she preferred her books fresh and clean with attractive covers however there were compensations with every trial and sids veneration for antiquities might still prove a blessing as she herself would some day be sufficiently antique to justify his supreme devotion  thus the woman audaciously chattered advertising fearlessly the bogus literary tastes of her son  if we questioned sidneys phenomenal reticence upon subjects so near his heart for convenient reasons all appeared willing to accept the mothers version of the unexplored country where gold aboundedand still waters ran to a depth unparalleled  now that the scales have fallen from my eyes i have spare justification for this woman for so many weeks my daily companion even a mothers desperation can not excuse her conduct although it may possibly moderate its enormity in the eyes of those who have sought to shield with ornate falsehood an unworthy child with the womans clear perception she must have known more certainly than all others the fullest truth concerning her son she could not be blind to his aimless life his selfish nature his depraved illcontrolled passions yet with all her superior knowledge of the risk she deemed it her right to supplement her boys deficiencies by chimerical attractions sheltering him if possible to the end beneath the decencies and refinements of society  without his mother in the breach sidney sanderson would undoubtedly have been publicly disgraced many times for he was not a clever rogue yet only once to my knowledge did his disreputable conduct appear in print and even then the mother proved herself equal to the dastardly emergencies of the scandal  the affair occurred in one of the quickgrown western cities in which the sandersons were financially interested they lived in the place for a number of months and were soon the center of the fashionable questionable mushroom set of the town i had the story from an eye witness of the unique local travesty which together with my personal knowledge of the leading ladys adaptation for her part enabled me to readily imagine the dramatic force of the situation  it was simple to see a group of fair gossipers suspending instantly the bold assertions of the moment when the tall gracious masterful mrs sanderson appeared among them holding in her beautiful jeweled hands the daily paper still easier to fancy the incredulous expressions followed by eager devotion to fancy work when the lady deliberately seated herself in the cosy corner of the hotel corridor and read unflinchingly a long scandalous article replete with stinging invective which everyone knew applied to but one man and that man her son i could fancy the woman asking insolently at the close of her desperate performance if any one could locate the blond lothario of the sensation feeling absolutely sure that no voice would answer  such was mrs sandersons nerve such her diabolical vigor so strong were her restraining influences and so unflinching her power that none of the social squad dared to confront her with her lie it was not until weeks afterwards when both mother and son had left the town that tongues were loosened and restricted gossips happy     chapter iii   it has appeared wise to relate at once my warranted impression of mrs sanderson having failed so completely in the early part of our intimacy to penetrate her character i offer the reader an advantage and that the events which follow may be better understood i have endeavored to make plain her supreme selfishness  as previously stated it was she who first told me about the home of the del valles the year before she had gone to the ranch in quest of the exquisite drawn work done upon the finest linen for which the doña maria was famous and so charmed had the lady been with the recollection of the picturesque visit that she hastened upon her return to san gabriel to renew the acquaintance  she was surprised to find the family much less prosperous than formerly and the ranch mortgaged for almost its value the proud doña maria told her with quiet tears how all was wrong how her grandnephew arturo had gone to old mexico to renew if possible the failing fortunes of his family while upon her assisted by an idle mexican had fallen the sole responsibility of the ranch how it was impossible not to neglect many things now that arturo was gone for her aged mother was again bad with the old spells and soon must make a great care but most deplorable of all her little mariposilla was growing up in idleness caring not for the teachings of the good sisters at the convent hating persistently the drawn work trying only to be like the americans in disobedience and manners forgetting each day how once it was glorious to have been born a del valle the result of these confidences was a second visit from mrs sanderson this time accompanied by sidney who at once suggested the ranch as a home for myself and marjorie  mrs sanderson had captivated the doña maria with the rest of us and had no difficulty in persuading the unfortunate woman to receive us into her household she dilated with her usual flow upon the mutual advantages of the arrangement until i was charmed with her disinterested kindness not even now do i charge the woman with a premeditated plot if one existed then it existed for sidney alonethe shadow of a foul possibility neither do i believe that mrs sanderson cared to befriend either the doña maria del valle or myself  our residence at the ranch might prove another opportunity for enjoyment during the winter an added zest to the california sojourn picturesque situations were the chief articles in the womans creed to entertain sidney her religion  she was so supremely worldly so accustomed to her own selfishness that the possibility of harm developed by the franchise of pleasure was not considered in her schemes for entertainment she thought it natural and amusing that sid should flirt with the pretty mariposilla and soon played herself with the emotions of the unsuspicious child as a cat would have played with the life of a mouse  in a word when marjorie and i had once been established at the ranch of the doña maria del valle there would be constant opportunities for pleasure mingled with novelty if the hotel grew intolerable with an influx of stupid dissatisfied tourists the ranch might prove a haven in which one could safely linger sheltered from the interrogations of the irrepressible tenderfoot upon the shaded veranda of the old adobe fancy work could be pleasantly pursued or one could simply idle the time which in southern california seems without limit surrounded by congenial society and picturesque associations  thus it came about that believing in the generous sympathy of my new friend i went with my child to live in the old spanish home of the doña maria del valle  pervading my satisfaction was a sincere admiration for the woman who could arrange so readily tiresome details sequestering us almost immediately upon our arrival in a strange country in one of the fairest spots of the rare san gabriel valley     chapter iv   the san gabriel valley in december is pleasant to look upon not as winsome as in february when the carnival of the year is born but serenely beautiful cleansing rains have polished every ridge of the sierra madre until purple cañons shine out like treasures of amethyst while clearly defined spurs shot with softest green reflect the promises of the spring  old baldy the hoary sire of the range gleams like a high priest to the south shaggy gray back and still beyond san jacinto a lone fortress of alabaster on a turquoise sea emphasize again the boundaries of the horizon the misty veil of the long summer has lifted disclosing an unbroken line of ravishing landscape every leaf and bud in the valley breathes with fresh lungs the meadow lark tilting upon the topmost tip of the highest pine sings to the sky a jubilate in three pure syllables birds are wooing sweethearts fearlessly for now time must not be lost and home sites must be secured in the lacy pepper trees before the poppies cover the foothills or babyblueeyes and creamcups fringe the roadsides  everything is noisy with awakening life the rich earth teems with ambitions volunteer seeds are springing enthusiastically to the surface timid wild flowers are peeping forth each day to test the possibilities of an early season heralded even now by the irrepressible al filerea which runs riot in all directions unconscious of its doom when the plowman invades the land  then it is that the oranges begin to glow like gold among green shadows and naked deciduous trees to flush with the faintest pink of returning life so intoxicating is the air that the saddest invalid beams with renewed hope almost forgetting his burden beneath the delicious blue of the peaceful sky  at the foot of the sierra madre lies pasadenacrown of the valleyso named from its imperial situation an established and aristocratic nucleus for its surrounding towns few places are so rich in conditions to palliate or allay the sorrows and disappointments of the usual life  south of this beautiful town where wealth and culture have displaced the primitive ranch ordaining in its place extensive villa sites ornate with lawns of blue grass bordered by rose gardens and ornamental shrubbery stretch the fertile acres of san gabriel still utilitarian in their scheme these acres comprise ranches that radiate for miles in all directions from the old mission like spokes from an antiquated hub close to the old church are the houses and stores of the once thriving village now alas dusky with memories of the señora the captivating señorita the valiant don and the watchful padre  defenseless in its degeneracy the place now boasts a motley population of lowbred mexicans and narroweyed celestials still when the old spanish bells call to the early sabbath mass if one is observing he may find among the weatherbeaten countenances of the mexicans often marked with the high cheek bone of the indian true descendants of the early aristocracy holding aloof from the horde absorbed in prayers that alone are the same since the ranches were ruthlessly divided and railroads allowed to invade  yet the spanish homes that remain in the valley are mere echoes of former times but tiny specks upon the map of the real estate dealer which have miraculously escaped the clutches of strangers although humble a few of these homes are strikingly picturesque  on a retired road sheltered on either side by mammoth pepper trees east of the mission by several miles lived the doña maria del valle her little ranch was all that she had saved from her husbands estate and she ever scorned its importance when she told indignantly how her husbands father had once held a splendid principality comprising four thousand acres  now alas we own nothing she said resting a moment her dark hands from their incessant labor at the exquisite drawn work my child will be always poor she will grow like the americans caring not for the past it is cruel indeed that she saw not her noble father don arturo had he but lived with his learning and accomplishments his child would rejoice that she was born a del valle now she listens not patiently to the tale of former days for in the convent she has met american girls and thinks only to imitate them hoping to gain for herself a strange husband who loves not her people our dear arturo she scorns driving him far away by her wicked disobedience for when she laughed at his love he could no longer endure to behold her  unhappy indeed was the doña maria when indulging in such confidences but not often did she speak of her troubles for so poor had the family become that to support her aged mother and the pretty mariposilla she was compelled to work constantly at the drawn work learned in her youth as a pastime now alas one of her chief sources of revenue  it was owing to her reduced circumstances that the proud doña maria had received under her roof marjorie and myself for she loved not the americans but as she told me artlessly one day only the americans now have gold  once it was not so we too had gold in abundance but we loved not our gold as the americans love theirs to keep in the bank we loved gold because it gave us joy to buy land and cattle and jewels and lace  yes it was simply for our gold that marjorie and i had been received under the roof of the del valles still when once the arrangement had been entered upon the doña maria was all that we could desire as a hostess  marjorie stole each hour into the hearts of the old grandmother and the proud disappointed daughter aging so fast under stress of multiplied troubles that she needed just such an appealing interest as my delicate child to call into action the unselfish side of her noble nature before we had lived long at the ranch our lives were running together as smoothly as if we all rejoiced in the same blood  the house of the doña maria del valle was not the original ranch house but a smaller adobe built after many of the broad acres had been bartered away by the taking of imperfect securities the worthlessness of which the happygolucky owners had failed to comprehend until too late to obviate the consequences  we understood not the laws and the papers of the americans the doña maria explained as we sat one sunshiny morning upon the sheltered veranda one day we owned all the land in the valley for many miles the next day we owned not so much and at last only the little that is left  to me the fifteen remaining acres appeared most desirable for i was not then versed in the matter of fruit culture i did not understand that orange trees differ one from another in point of perfection as widely as do people  it was some time before i learned that in the early settlement of the valley disastrous experiments had been made many of the first trees planted had yielded an inferior variety of fruit not lucrative in a market each year growing more critical as the country became settled by determined agriculturists who possessed not only cash capital but brains stimulated by college education and practical experience such men soon discovered that it was unprofitable to irrigate or nurture for long a tree that was not all that a tree of its kind should be  consequently there had been frequent upheavals of earth many old orchards were regarded by the experienced as worthless the owners preferring to replant with the best varieties of budded trees even though a considerable time must elapse before a revenue would result unfortunately the orange ranch of the doña maria del valle was a poor one it was planted with a flavorless variety of seedling which yielded an income quite insufficient for the demands of the family from an æsthetic point of view the grove appeared the garden of the hesperides the staunch farreaching limbs of the old trees drooped opulently beneath the golden balls that invited the forty thieves who happening to be tenderfeet ate with wry faces and discourteous exclamations the fruit that a native would have scorned to touch for in california oranges are not ripe in december not until the late spring when the sun has used persistently his winsome inducements does the fruit consent to assume its luscious perfection  turning from the highway the ranch of the doña maria del valle was entered from between two mammoth century plants whose giant spears made formidable the approach to the long avenue leading to the house the drive was shaded by gnarled old pepper trees uniting from each side their fantastic branches to form an elfin tunnel of lacy shade on the ground thickly scattered lay dartlike leaves and scarlet berries shading from rich to pale until a long oriental rug seemed spread for the court of an expected princess  at the end of the avenue stood the low adobe covered with ivy and the famous gold of ophir rose which at easter illuminated the veranda and roof with the lights and shadows of forty thousand blooms not far from the house two giant palmshonored patriarchs of the valleyreared their trembling feathers to the sky like grim sentinels true to a trust they guarded in dumb eloquence the story of the past  before reaching the house the drive divided encircling within the arms of its curve a soft oval cushion of bermuda grass that in december is brown and unpromising but in the spring grows green remaining so through the long summer making no imperative demand for water and being at all seasons as soft to the feet as the most luxurious rug it is the grass created for the invalid he alone appreciates the thick delicious mat which hoards for his bloodless feet thousands of warm sunbeams that cheat his physician into the belief that he is eminent when he discovers his patient escaping his professional clutches  added to the tropical effect of fullgrown palms and riotous shrubbery the guardian sierra madre was ever flashing rich shadows and tender patches of light that in the clear prismatic air reflected countless expressions into the hearts of the flowers and onto the surface of the leaves  such was the home of the doña maria del valle here mariposilla had been born sixteen years before five months after the death of her father don arturo     chapter v   each year when the gold of ophir illuminates the valley with its passionate bloom i think of mariposilla under the spell of the transient radiance of the rose her beauty comes to me like a lovely dream the flashing lights and subtile shades of the marvelous flower seem to communicate a wild sensation of the childs presence for ever since i first beheld her close to the rose there has been in my mind a fancy that between these two children of the valley there existed a bond an almost supernatural kinship that betrayed itself with each quiver of the atmosphere  so impressed i became with the idea that i unconsciously sought for mariposillas mood in the changing color of the rose during the eventful weeks of which i shall write when the rose and the girl began and finished their one exciting drama bursting together into fullest perfection i found myself associating them constantly in my thoughts so essential each appeared to the other that when mariposilla stood beneath the gold of ophir she seemed to absorb its every tint while at the same time its golden sprays glowed with the effulgence of her glorious proximity their harmony appeared perfect their united beauty the personification of carnal and ethereal blending when the sun shone early with no rebuff from the occasional fog thousands of buds and blossoms bloomed upon the somber adobe and even while one looked indescribable tones of gold and pink and yellow appeared to creep from the passionate hearts of the buds onto the glorified edges of the fullblown flowers then too mariposilla dazzled her very being flashed with a phosphorescence akin to nothing human but so like the luster of the rose that each must have been created that the other might bloom both seemed children of the sun entrusted with opalescent secrets that nothing but his rays could reveal for if the day grew chill both mariposilla and the gold of ophir paled the fire left the edges of the rose petals and the blood retreated from the surface of the girls creamy flesh her great luminous eyes grew dull as she sought listlessly her neglected lace frame drawing silently the threads of the linen ignoring the whining questions of her old grandmother completely lost in the indifference of her mood  or perhaps disregarding the commands of her mother she tossed aside the lace frame and crept into a silent corner of the room to play upon her guitar wild turbulent music until the doña maria angry and impatient commanded her to finish at once the altar cloth ordered months before by the lady from pasadena at the same time she bade her mind with care to cross herself at the little jesus stitch else a curse would come upon them all  even yet i dread to think of this strange child out of the sunshine i would always have kept her under the influence of soothing warmth mariposillalittle butterflyhow well she idealized her name born of the sun and for the sun no real butterfly ever rivaled her why could i not protect her passionate capricious young heart as the flowers enfold at night the dazzling thoughtless beauties of a summers day alas destiny seemed kinder to the insect than to the child  viewing in retrospect the girls rapid and eventful development i now remember vividly each incident in her little history when she came into my life like a picturesque plaything i failed to realize that she was other than a beautiful child i was then totally ignorant from experience of the premature blooming of spanish girls from history i knew that they developed young but history is easily forgotten it was natural to expect mariposilla to pursue the same pace that once upon a time i had taken myself we are all miserable egotists without realizing the weakness and i fell at once into the fallacy of believing that all girls develop in the same way mariposilla was only sixteen and at sixteen most girls are children i recalled my own blushes as i remembered drawingroom miseries to which i was at that age subjected when my grown brothers insisted upon presenting me to college chums i flew at my earliest opportunity from the ordeal cheered by the thought of a toboggan slide with my nice boy beau yes i had a boy beau who was truly delightful it was only when he went away to college that i ceased to care for him and bestowed my smiles upon a new flame across the way who was yet a boy at sixteen i regarded men as formidable creatures to be encountered when school days were over and childhood had come to an end when i heard later that my gay freshman smoked and was engaged to a young woman of his college town six years his senior i wondered how i had ever consented to sit upon a sled with such a monster at sixteen my ideas of love were as vague as they were wholesome in my young healthiness i doubted seriously if any girl ever died for love outside of a book thus recalling my own girlhood i at first felt no misgivings in exposing mariposilla to the apparently innocent attentions of mr sidney sanderson especially as his mother and myself were always about it seemed only sensible to believe that the spanish child would receive real benefit from her new associations i did not realize the narrow boundaries of her young life nor did i then understand how she adored americans whom she regarded as models of refinement and wisdom when the doña maria told me of her grandnephews love for her daughter i felt it an outrage that so young a girl should have been spoken to about marriage  i was secretly glad that mariposilla had repulsed her second cousin and i could not cease to wonder why the doña maria so sensible in most respects should desire her only child to accept at sixteen the only man she had ever known it delighted me to believe that mariposilla found full enjoyment in the society of marjorie they were great friends and at times marjorie seemed almost as mature as the older girl each day they played with the hounds upon the bermuda grass as happy and free from responsibility as the dogs thus time slipped away peace and contentment filled our lives while my child and her spanish playmate rivaled each day in healthy beauty the roses now responding to the first welcome rains     chapter vi   as christmas approached i found myself anticipating the festal time with a restored interest as keen as the feigned enthusiasms of the previous holiday season had been unbearable but three weeks remained of the old year and already the new one seemed full of promises  as i watched marjorie and mariposilla romp like kittens upon the bermuda grass i wondered if my heart could ever ache again with the old tiresome pain the morning was glorious and i felt myself buoyed above my most ardent hopes our new life was an elixir that drove away sad thoughts while it invited pleasant memories nature had aroused once more my sluggish sympathies until i complied eagerly with all of her coaxing demands when her trees swayed their quiet motion lulled me if her birds talked i understood their pleasant assurances with the sun rose my heart when it sank slowly to rest i waited for its goodnight promise upon the mountains and when they flushed rosiest i too glowed with a rapturous trust  with marjorie asleep in my arms i heard my father calling dear names to his own little girl i felt my mother braid my hair and saw her smile at my fresh blue ribbons two handsome brothers teased me about the new lover who had driven away the other beaux and then i felt again upon my lips this lovers first true kiss when my child laughed in her sleep i laid her gently down and lived once more the short sweet romance of my life  each day i was learning to go alone gradually attaining the composure of one who has survived a shock realizing at last the odds of destiny and the necessity of making much of comfortable opportunities  i am describing my feelings not that i wish to write about myself but in order that i may be pardoned if later some may blame me for lack of perception if i was beguiled into unsuspiciousness by the peace of my new life i should be forgiven for at that time gods whole creation seemed as good as in the beginning  christmas was coming i have said and marjorie was wild with expectation i could hear her merry treble entreating mariposilla to tell how santa claus could ever come to california where there was no snow except upon the tops of the mountains  when the spanish girl failed to explain the child grew flushed and excited marjories vivid imagination was tempered by a rational appreciation of consistency and she declared indignantly that santa claus always traveled in a sleigh without snow the reindeer would have a difficult time and she was pathetically certain that her stocking would be quite empty upon christmas morning the little girl was a stubborn logician the form of her infantile dictum was often mixed but her mother generally perceived her difficulties and drew from sadlymuddled premises conclusions that were entirely satisfactory to both in the existing case she had foreseen the burst of skepticism that was now distressing the child and was well prepared to confute her troublesome doubts listen she said and i will explain  mariposilla ought to know that when santa claus comes to southern california he always lives upon the top of old baldy the beautiful valley is too warm for him so each year he builds a snow house upon the mountain and with his pipe and reindeer for company he works merrily at the toys which he so skillfully fashions for the children of the far west when his loving labor is completed he packs the wonderful presents into a huge sleigh and at twelve oclock of the night before christmas he feeds his reindeer and hitches them to the great sledge when the children of the peaceful valleys are fast asleep the dear old saint drives gaily down the steep white side of the great mountain at its foot he blows a long shrill whistle and from the many cañons of the range come the fairies the happy little people dearly love to be useful they have the greatest affection for santa claus and they tell him truthfully about all of his boys and girls reporting both good and naughty ones but most tenderly do the fairies tell of the little sick children who have come from faraway homes in the east to seek for health in the land of sunshine when the kind saint is sure that no child has been forgotten he commands the fairies to finish his loving work he can go no farther with the reindeer and so he intrusts his beautiful gifts to the willing little helpers who have swarmed at his call and now at the bidding of the fairy queen thousands of lily chariots drawn by dashing teams of bumblebees form in long lines upon the foothills the white chariots with their yellow daisy wheels are a wonderful sight in the early daylight  each one has a fairy driver dressed in a christmas suit made from the petals of a maréchal neil rose when the chariots are at last loaded to their fullest capacity with the precious toys old santa claus gives the signal to start then the happy drivers spring upon their high yellow seats in the center of the chariots gripping firmly a long lash of blue grass each little fellow waves farewell to dear santa claus who has already started up the mountain satisfied and happy that his holiday work is done not until another christmas will the valleys feel the loving presence of the kind old saint for when the sun and the birds have awakened his children he will be far away but his beautiful gifts will be hanging upon the great white rosetreesthe christmas trees of our summer land  when i had finished marjorie clapped her hands and exclaimed with delight but mariposilla said nothing she was silently eloquent for several moments until suddenly remembering that she ought to acknowledge genius she kissed me gently upon the cheek much as she would have kissed the wooden image of the virgin that stood in the doña marias bedroom looking down into my face with her great beautiful eyes she said almost reverently the señora knows much she is a great and wise americana i love her with great love  mariposilla had never before addressed me in the quaint affectionate style of her anglicized tongue and as i caught her in my arms laughing at the sweet sober compliment i told her how i would always treasure it for her sakethe most delightful praise i had ever received  i remember it was about this time that i first became aware of the girls rare beauty suddenly she seemed to have commenced to mature and her radiance startled me i wondered then if such ravishing charms were to be desired for it seemed hardly possible that she would be contented with her available destiny  i had already seen that her thoughts were not with her countryman and kinsman arturo but remote engaged with intangible dreams of she knew not what i could not refuse to see at times in her restless unsatisfied expression that she had outgrown the customs and associations of her race i saw that she was consumed with admiration for americans attempting their fashions and manners with a determination almost pathetic  when the sandersons came to the ranch and we sat upon the veranda chatting in the effervescent style of our republic mariposilla listened like a charmed bird especially if mrs sanderson chanced to relate a story replete with inimitable shades and mannerisms i am certain that the lady herself realized and exerted unduly her magnetism upon the unsophisticated girl i often noticed her regarding with complacent amusement the worshipful expression upon mariposillas face sometimes she would abruptly summon her to her side while she touched the dark head with her beautiful jeweled hand perhaps she called her a pretty name or possibly joked her about her faith in the good stories of the great americanos until the childs cheeks grew opalescent with happy embarrassment then before the lovely tints had paled she would send her away for a glass of water from the deep red olla or for a rose from a bush indicated by her fancy  i remember that upon this particular morning i was troubling indirectly about mariposilla thinking that perhaps her daily association with sidney might not be for the best i had not then dreamed of inhuman exertions on the part of the sandersons to entrap the child i simply wondered if we were wise to expose the beautiful immature girl to the constant flattering attentions of an impossible young man  i remember that i decided to tell her at my earliest opportunity that sidney was destined to marry a new york heiress however as soon as the thought had taken shape in my mind i felt indignant for imagining possibilities disagreeable enough to disturb the peace of our pleasant social conditions i said to myself that mariposilla was still a child often the satisfied playmate of marjorie it would be easy i was sure to observe the slightest vibration in the direction of a love affair  the doña maria had assured me that her child was hard of heart ever scorning the devotion of lovers altogether i felt a ridiculous prude when the gay trap of the sandersons suddenly dashed into the avenue  sidney was driving the spirited team with his mother behind him luxuriously wrapped for the december morning  at the first sound of the horses hoofs upon the driveway mariposilla vanished i could see at a glance upon her return that she had been before the little mirror in her bedroom for the betumbled appearance occasioned by her romp with marjorie had disappeared likewise she had embellished her scarlet frock with a little black velvet girdle that emphasized the costume with an irresistible touch of spain  i perceived that sidney was unmistakably pleased with the childs appearance but i could not consistently blame him for our common crime for never before had i been so impressed with the superb type of mariposillas beauty  mrs sanderson was most winning she had come she said in search of good company for a drive she was going to pasadena for two yards of yellow ribbon was it not absolutely delightful to drive eight miles for a couple of yards of ribbon such irresponsible pleasure made one scorn philanthropy why should one desire to reconcile happy hottentots to parisian costume why be perpetually annoyed with grave and difficult questions when all could be easily dismissed in a drive after ribbon she lamented that she had not come to san gabriel years ago before there was so little to prolong she was sure native californians were born without nerves it rested her more than a whole year at a sanitarium to look at mariposilla what a perfect beauty she was this minute in her red frock she must gain at once the doña marias consent and come for a drive all must make haste for it was criminal to lose one moment of the morning  mariposilla as usual had stood unconsciously enthralled by mrs sandersons wonderful personality the child had not understood the ladys ironic sallies but the invitation to drive had been plain  instantly the absent incomprehensible look fled from her eyes they seemed suddenly bathed in lambent joy while an emotional radiance enveloped her form resembling the beautiful little creature after which she had been named she appeared to dart through the sunshine then to vanish in the doorway of the somber adobe like a lost meteor her marvelous unstudied motions seemed the reflection of fickle twilight  will she come back or has she flown forever into an old legend of spain mrs sanderson demanded tragically she will return as demure as a novitiate i replied  a few moments later the truth of the statement was verified the girls first intense emotions had been forcibly quieted by her desire to be thought conventional when she reappeared prepared for the drive she walked slowly almost stifflylike a lady the sisters at the convent would have said  she had donned a black jacket that was fortunately too small and obliged to flare exposing the little velvet girdle and a dash of scarlet that emulated coquettishly the breast of a robin her hair was carefully twisted into a girlish coil while upon her head she wore a large picturesque black hat  during the drive to pasadena she was ecstatically solemn and it was only when she turned her profile to reply almost in monosyllables to the ingenious questions of sidney that i discovered how happy she was her cheeks had again assumed wonderful tints occasioned by a renewed realization of her exalted privileges and i could see that she was flattered beyond her most daring expectation sidney usually so reticent had suddenly maddened into an animated inquisitor i observed that he never allowed his eyes to leave the girls face when she replied modestly to his volley of direct questions  necessarily these recollections have now come back to me slightly embellished by the events which quickly followed this initial drive it must have been a comprehension of the common failure to note the signs of a disaster in time to obviate it which led the ecclesiastical composers to insert in the general confession of the prayer book the clause in which the sinner bewails not only his actually committed sins but his passive criminalities born of neglect  my conscience will ever ache with the knowledge of things left undone for mariposilla i know now that i should have explained more decidedly to the child the impassable width of the social gulf even at the risk of her loving me less i should have protected her against herself by showing her the truth without palliation i should have told her how fraudulent and glittering are the attentions of fashionable men and warned her against the cruel disappointments of society  doubtless the child would have disregarded my wisdom for wilful rapturous youth is slow to accept experience secondhand at the time it appeared only right and natural that mariposilla should take part in our daily pleasures while in justice to myself it did not occur to me to doubt the good intentions of the sandersons until too late to overcome the complications which arose by degrees from our general intimacy     chapter vii   it was impossible for me to resist my impulses as we dashed through the sunshine to be absolved from every responsibility as i breathed with joy the vigorous sedative aira mingled freshness of may and octoberhad intoxicated my nerves unconsciously i allowed sentiments to escape which i usually restrained when in the society of the brilliant cynic by my side  it seemed impossible that the most hardened wretch could be capable of criminality upon such a divine morning and i enthusiastically aired my moral philosophy much to the amusement of mrs sanderson who jestingly replied as we turned from a long avenue into the principal business street of pasadenaas usual my dear you have caught entirely the local spirit of your environments i am told that the millennium has already begun in pasadena and that even now there are more sanctified cranks to the acre than in any town in america  as the lady spoke a salvation army girl approached with the war cry the fresh young face peering from beneath the ugly bonnet had a demure fascination and rebellious to the scornful expression of my companion i dropped the requested nickel into the extended hand of the pretty fanatic as the young woman retired to the sidewalk mrs sanderson laughed a derisive little laugh  i am sure you will be doing something wild if you stay in this country long she said if it were not for marjorie i should feel alarmed the noticeable attentions of the sallow sanctimonious priest at the hotel may yet prove dangerous i shall feel it my duty to keep an eye upon you both  pray do i replied coldly as we left the trap and entered a drygoods store gay with christmas decorations and crowded with shoppers  wending our way to the ribbon counter we found it thronged by pretty girls chattering merrily as they selected various shades from a gay labyrinth of color that announced a sale of remnants  it was evident that but one damsel of the group had troubled herself to remember that the month was december for she alone did credit to her conventional convictions she resembled at first glance a properly rolled umbrella her tailormade gown was severe in the extreme and her hat and carriage were harmoniously stiff her companions wore cheerful girlish costumes ranging in variety from a white flannel tennis frock supplemented by fur cape and straw sailor hat to the very correct street suit of the severe young woman bright eyes and glowing cheeks showed plainly that if cotillions were a frequent occurrence in pasadena as the conversation of the lassies indicated their disastrous ravages were providentially repaired by horseback riding and tennis the year round  we had not expected to meet friends among the merry bevy but as the young woman of the tailormade turned to leave the store mrs sanderson recognized her she was miss walton the daughter of an old friend a wealthy new yorker who now lived most of his time in pasadena  the acknowledgement was instantaneous and before the ladies had exchanged a dozen sentences they were joined by a younger sister who was quite a beauty  this encounter is delightful said the younger girl extending cordially a pretty bare hand slightly browned by the sun i am so glad you have come for now we can have mr sanderson for our cotillion we were quite desperate for another man as one of our dearest onelungers has been forbidden to dance the pretty tall girl buying the pink ribbon is the unfortunate bereft of her partner she will be delighted with her luck when i tell her she is to dance with a man who will not be a responsibility  for shame ethel interrupted the tailormade miss walton what will the ladies think  the simple truth replied the irrepressible ethel the ladies have doubtless learned of the one drawback to our glorious climateits dearth of ablebodied dancing men do you wonder mrs sanderson the girl continued appealingly that we jump at the chance to dance once in a while with a man who is not delicate who has never had a hemorrhage or organic heart trouble of course she rattled on we have a few sound men but this year has been an off year for the unengaged the two dear fellows who made love collectively have gone east so you see a new man is like balm in gilead  sidney must certainly attend the cotillion his mother said much amused  of course he must the girl replied gaily he will be the belle of the ball when i tell the girls confidentially that he wont have to be saved a particle wont they dote on him you see it is simply crushing to have the responsibility of a onelunger for a whole evening delicate men are always idiotic about getting in a draught and as stubborn as mules about not putting on overcoats when healthy people are freezing it certainly is not pleasant to stop a man in the middle of a waltz when you see his wind giving out or to be blamed the next day when he is absolutely ill of course you have to be sympathetic send him dainties and take him to drive as soon as he is out again but the responsibility after a time becomes too serious to be interesting  ethel said her sister what do you mean she is really not as heartless as she appears miss walton continued turning to mrs sanderson i trust you will make due allowance for a young lady who persists in coming to town in a tennis costume but as my father has always allowed her to act like a barbarian mamma and i can do nothing  she seems delightfully hopeless mrs sanderson replied we must have the pretty barbarian at san gabriel as soon as possible sid would find your case most interesting miss ethel but perhaps you are not aware of his missionary tendencies  ethel laughed but miss walton took no pains to conceal her annoyance although she politely seconded her sisters invitation to lunch that same day at crown hill  you shall not escape us ethel said gaily as we hesitated on account of our number explaining that five hungry people were too many to usher unexpectedly upon even the most longsuffering cook not at all the girl declared wong would be in despair if no company came as he was expecting guests who at the last moment sent word that it would be impossible for them to come  her father and mother too were away and but for the delightful accident of the morning my sister and i would have been all alone she added convincingly  promising to accept the invitation at the time appointed we left the store in search of sidney and the children  looking about we perceived the team hitched across the street while those we sought had gone into a confectory close by i could see marjorie dancing in front of the door with a box of candy  the child was still too delicate for rash experiments and i hastily rushed to her rescue mrs sanderson cynically remarked that possibly marjorie might find it less easy to be good than her mother adding that if the divine climatic restraints had not proved stronger than her temptation i must be merciful i could not help feeling irritated by the sarcastic remark and replied with spirit mrs sanderson must have seen the uncomfortable flush that i felt mounting to my cheeks for in her inimitable way she apologized  dear little saint she said coaxingly forgive me if i am less sentimental than yourself it is perhaps because i have lived too long in this stupid world to believe in it very much alas i am not a poet and my blood runs cooler every day a half tragic expression the suggestion of regret darkened the womans handsome composed face in an instant it fled leaving no trace of emotion  i was much relieved to find that mariposilla had kindly restrained marjories saccharine yearnings the child was obediently awaiting permission to eat a chocolate cream  mariposilla too had a box of candy sidney gallantly handed about another which i saw was intended to insure the spanish girls individual claim to the little gift he had just made her  as we left the shop mrs sandersons eye caught sight of a window just beyond in which was displayed a choice collection of indian baskets the craze had seized the lady the year before returning with renewed vigor she laughingly owned when sidney attempted to restrain her covetous longings her son declared that it would even now be impossible to take home all the trash she had accumulated  never mind she insisted we shall look at the collection i can see at a glance that it is a fine one and it is not yet time to go to the waltons  the collection in question we learned was a private one offered for sale by a boom victim whose inflated ideas of pasadena real estate had at one time stimulated his artistic desires to ruinous extravagance at that time he had ransacked the country for miles around for rare baskets regardless of price which now he was obliged to sell  i learned later that mrs sanderson was ever upon the lookout for forced sales keenly alive to chances for procuring things at half price she was always alert for the critical moment  her enthusiasms over the existing opportunities were those of a connoisseur loaded with the offered commodity yet unable to endure the thought of a philistine invasion  she said it was wrong for her to consider the purchase of another indian basket but if the beautiful cora with the feathers was not so extravagant in price she might possibly add it to her collection  the clerk in attendance now signaled the owner of the baskets from the rear of the store the gentleman came at once and tried in vain to convince mrs sanderson that the cora with the feathers was so unusually rare that it was worth much more than the price demanded he said pathetically that his collection was very dear to him he loved each basket with a different degree of affection for he had discovered them all each had a little history  dearest of all was the beautiful cora which the lady admired and nothing but absolute necessity compelled him to part with it  mrs sanderson replied that she understood perfectly his feelings she too had always been a great collector she had even at this late day discovered baskets and knew now of a mexican settlement where valuable things were still in hiding she thought she would soon go upon a tour of discovery and perhaps she might find a cora with feathers she was sorry not to assist the gentleman in his difficulties she would be very fond of the feather basket she knew and if the price were reduced upon three larger baskets as well as upon the one she admired she might possibly take all four however she had best flee from temptation it was getting late after twelve and the waltons were expecting them at one  with her inimitable smile she bade us make haste to depart while she sympathetically hoped in the hearing of the obsequious clerk who opened the door that the feather basket might soon find a purchaser who would appreciate its beauty  as she left the store her deliberation was masterly before she had reached the sidewalk the clerk had motioned her back the four baskets were hers at half their value     chapter viii   on our way to luncheon we drove between palms and flowers the entire length of a long wellkept avenue located at its end is a group of small hills each of which has been eagerly selected for a home site because of the incomparable advantages of the situation conspicuous among these knolls is crown hill the home of the waltons unique as an island in its individual charm its gentle slopes are surrounded on all sides by traveled roads which define perfectly its boundaries while they protect from intrusion the lowgabled country house which stands in the heart of six acres cresting hospitably the hill the landscape upon all sides is strikingly beautiful from the south and west the pastoral harmony of the view is enhanced by a chain of wooded hills evading the advances of civilization as they smile serenely upon extensive gardens and picturesque homes upon other sides glorious snowcapped mountains glittering with alpine splendor intensify the rich everchanging tones of the long overlapping chain the day was so fresh and bright that as we drove to crown hill a new luster seemed upon the earth as we ascended the gentle slope ethel waved us a welcome from the broad veranda when we alighted too entranced to enter the house the elder sister appeared  is it not lovely ethel cried enthusiastically perceiving our delight at the unbroken landscape dont hurry us margaret the girl implored when miss walton began to evince a slight nervousness at our delay in entering daddy is not here to point out the unsurpassed beauties of the hill so his own girl must see that no points are overlooked even if luncheon does wait a minute you see ethel continued as we turned slowly to enter the house drawn by the persistent expression upon miss margarets apprehensive countenance this place belongs to daddy and me mamma and margaret own the house in new york every year they go back to its dingy magnificence and imagine themselves supremely happy when they sit in the middle drawingroom that looks so touchingly upon our neighbors brick sidewall their enjoyment is rare the place has to be lighted all day with electric lanterns but it matters not to these two deluded souls they are enjoying themselves in the swell room of the houseso very oriental dont you know  do be quiet ethel and show our friends in the elder sister implored margaret is an absolute tyrant the girl replied leading us beyond the wide inviting hall into a large sunny drawingroom that at once captivated us with its individuality  as we entered between the portières i noticed that mariposilla flushed with delight the child had never before been in so lovely a room its warm delicacy was a strange contrast to the gaudy halfgrotesque halfreligious apartments to which she had been accustomed ethel perceiving her pleasure smiled encouragingly  you like my room she said kindly it is all mine and to be honest i am proud of it you see how differently i have worked for my effects from the usual methods she said turning to mrs sanderson who was exclaiming over the restfulness of the furniture i am so glad that you are pleased ethel continued for i had much to combat before i was allowed to fire oppressive upholsterings in favor of lovely morris cottons  the girl had indeed caught the spirit of her semitropical climate for the room was charmingly in sympathy with the world outside of the windows the rough walls pale yellow in combination with the paneled ceiling and colonial casings painted cream had surely created a perfect background for the admirable furnishings never before had quaint chairs and deep couches looked so inviting as these in morris cottons their creamy tone relieved by soft browns and warm yellows defied the sordid observer who could never quite estimate their yard value the broad windows were curtained in simple falls of dainty lace of open texture that excluded neither sunlight nor landscape in the colonial fireplace burned a real fire of huge logs that was never allowed to die out and warmed with irresistible comfort the fresh healthful atmosphere of the room in unsuspected corners and in bold situations great satsuma jars filled with ferns and tall papyrus emphasized the possibilities of a pasadena home cheerful watercolors in plain white frames adorned the walls while above the fire an old french mirror caught from the picturewindow opposite the distant shadows and sunlit spurs of the peaceful mother mountains longstemmed roses and dear old silver candlesticks gleamed side by side upon a quaint inviting teatable which close by the glowing fire shone like a glimpse from americas most picturesque period adorned with the dainty relics of a colonial teaset  the room is superb mrs sanderson declared as she surveyed critically its artistic details the rich oriental rugs and large white angora skins thickly strewn upon the straw matting completely captivated mariposilla she timidly sank her feet into a rug lying before one of the broad couches blushing perceptibly i thought at the recollection of her own humble home  the simple child was nearly frightened by the prevalent luxury and but for the watchful attentions of ethel might have grown uncomfortable with infinite tact her pretty hostess led her about with the familiarity of a sister often coaxing her into artless bursts of enthusiasm  the library is papas success ethel explained as we sauntered reluctantly from the beautiful drawing room you see she continued papa too has made a california room excepting his books there is hardly a vestige of civilization to be found  it was even as the daughter had said a room in which literature and the odor of fragrant cigars alone suggested a modern epoch the decorations if such they could be called were all indian rare tribe blankets covered the floor and couches serving not only for portières but in parts of the room for wall hangings against these blankets were displayed an unrivaled collection of rich old baskets upon one wall was stretched a gorgeous indian genealogy the handiwork of a gifted squaw while the skin of a mammoth grizzly the huge head still intact reposed in front of the fireplace from chimney shelf to ceiling hung weapons and finery pertaining to the aboriginal chase  now said ethel when miss margaret demanded once more our immediate attendance upon luncheon we will strike for high civilizationmy sisters own kingdom upon seating ourselves about the great round table in the perfectly appointed diningroom i observed that sidney had been placed between ethel and mariposilla while marjorie and i had been assigned places opposite i could see mariposillas every motion without appearing to watch her and i confess that i was at first slightly agitated fearing the ordeal might prove embarrassing not only for the child but for ourselves  i was sure that she had never before been seated at so stylish a lunchtable in spite of its cultivated informality there was for the unsophisticated girl an unintelligible problem close at hand in the complicated appointments of her plate  while we spoke of the exquisite longstemmed pink roses that filled a cutglass punchbowl in the center of the table i could see mariposilla regarding quietly the array of silver encompassing her place if i again doubted the propriety of what we had done it was evident that but one method of escape remainedto make plain my every motion even as the idea seized me i perceived that the spanish child had hit upon the plan herself and was nervefully determined not to disgrace her friends  as luncheon proceeded i almost forgot my fears in admiration for the childs pluck her sensible observant conduct delighted me and i no longer doubted her fitness for any social position to which she might be raised  mrs sanderson as usual captivated the party with gay sallies of wit her pretty allusions to the faultless details of miss waltons table won for her at once miss margarets approval  your starched celestial fills me with reverence she declared when the impassible wong left the diningroom after depositing with majestic importance a wonderful salad  he never allows the maid to bring in the salad ethel explained mirthfully he considers a salad the culmination of his art and generally announces for the benefit of our guests heap fine salad muchey good  you tempt me to set up a house in pasadena mrs sanderson said if for no other reason than to eat as often as possible before i die a perfect salad such as this shall we not start an establishment at once sid for the joy of a wong who enjoys entertaining as much as does his mistress can you invite friends in this irresponsible way at any time the lady asked earnestly  oh yes answered ethel nothing delights wong so much as company you know a good chinese servant is quite ignorant of his spinal organism he expects to serve you well for what you pay him exonerating you delightfully from the heavy obligations often imposed in america by ambitious females who assist at cooking for a pastime  then you really dont have to hold a preliminary caucus to ascertain the state of the cooks health and temper before you can find courage to invite a few friends to dinner mrs sanderson answered interrogatively  certainly not said ethel a good chinaman has the greatest reverence for caste his respect for his mistress depends largely upon what he shrewdly determines in regard to her position in society she very hightone lady is his favorite expression for a thoroughly admired mistress he considers it an honor not only to serve her to the best of his ability but regards her friends with equal consideration  how delightfully comfortable it all sounds yet is there not a possibility of converting these same convenient heathen into a state of uselessness rather than to christianity mrs sanderson pursued i have heard the lady continued that enthusiasts are already metamorphosing some of the best cooks into poets and orators as well as firstclass laundrymen into political economists  now laughed ethel you are tramping poor margarets toes when we first came to california my sister approved warmly of the education of the downtrodden celestial but i fear that experience has withered her philanthropy one boy that we had after professing a most devout conversion which necessitated his departure to school at the most inconvenient times suddenly conceived a renewed longing for the exciting informalities of chinese new year  he told margaret as he bade her a polite good morning that he no likey be good velly long have more fun be heap bad some time good boss forgive sins all samey when you be heap solly after while even sister was crushed by the theology our next boy was a genuine heathen  i am astonished ethel said miss walton i hope you will never again repeat that blasphemous story  forgive her entreated mrs sanderson i would not have missed it for a great deal and although it seems unfortunate that our romantic philanthropy is often quenched by a downpour of common sense yet it is perhaps safest for the world after all i shall never cease to enjoy your story miss ethel when my sympathies threaten to melt my judgments i shall think of your theological heathen who rose superior to his instructors able to grasp so cleverly the pleasant features of christianity without its inconveniences  when mrs sanderson finished her irreligious sally miss waltons pained shocked expression was most apparent she concentrated her attention upon her jelly with a wellbred annoyance that was readily understood by the offender the calculating woman with no desire to anger the truly conscientious girl whose sectarian delight in the teachings of her church made it impossible for her to tolerate the semblance of skepticism gracefully shifted the conversation to the engrossing cotillion afterward bearing down with conciliatory intent upon the christmas bazar soon to be held by the guild of miss margarets church  we will all come she said as we left the table one soon loses step with events in san gabriel but the bazar will help us to catch up with the world she added mirthfully  that mrs sanderson was a scoffer of the most captivating and dangerous type can not be denied she loved to ridicule uninteresting things and commonplace people and doubtless this fact accounted for the dearth of friends answering to her own age it was to unthinking youth that the flashing sarcasms and stinging flings at established usages and sacred traditions appeared the embodiment of brilliant repartee in complete contradiction to her caustic beliefs she seemed to the young the soul of sincerity working ever the most unselfish conditions for their enjoyment  mrs sanderson disliked old people inhumanly while she courted with every possible inducement the society of the young  i have a morbid horror of growing old she would say sid wont promise to poison me so i suppose i must provide myself with a daughterinlaw my best blood is french and when the illusions are once dispelled each new wrinkle will torture on the day of the luncheon as we sauntered from the drawingroom into the library mrs sanderson declared that she had conceived an idea for old age your fathers study is an inspiration she exclaimed turning to ethel as soon as i am sixty i shall take down all the mirrors in my house and prepare a similar retiring room although more entirely barbaric there shall be no vestige of civilization in my den nothing to encourage reminiscences nothing to suggest the masterful march of time i see now that it is the certainty of ones period which crushes indian decorations mean absolutely nothing to the uninitiated wrapped in the blanket of a remote chief one could forget even his birthday there shall be nothing in my room to remind me every hour that i am a grandmother nothing to sayyou bought me thirty years ago or we are both growing threadbare together your hair is white and thin while i am quite out of style no my dears if i live to be old i shall never be tortured by relics of my own period however the cold worldly woman continued smiling irresistibly upon her young companions who failed to comprehend her heartless theories i am not sixty i have several years before i must take to a blanket so let us return to the pretty drawingroom and mariposilla will play one of her witching spanish dances  be spry sid she commanded when the spanish child obediently seated herself upon a low chair preparatory to tuning the guitar a footstool for the little feet they look so pretty upon a cushion  the ladys open flattery appeared no longer to embarrass mariposilla she was gradually growing accustomed to that but when sidney placed in front of her the footstool a richer flush intensified her beauty  she must have a mantilla for her head mrs sanderson cried as she caught from her own shoulders the rich spanish lace scarf which she wore in her drives as a throat protector she threw it lightly over the girls dark head allowing the ends to fall about her scarlet frock there is she not a divine señorita she exclaimed as she viewed her blushing plaything with critical delight is she not exquisite she continued shamelessly see how easily we have caught the loveliest butterfly in all old spain play mariposilla play  when the child obediently struck the strings of the guitar mrs sanderson declared that american women knew nothing of dress why do we not burn our bonnets that our lovers may kneel to our lace mantillas she said to ethel  as mariposilla paused in her playing all applauded with the exception of miss walton from the first she had appeared annoyed by the dramatic conditions of the afternoon as our hostess she was oppressed with suppression i could see that the literal young woman viewing all things from a narrow and conventional standpoint longed to escape from the theatrical atmosphere which mrs sanderson had so unexpectedly created  i myself may have doubted the propriety of mrs sandersons course but at the time i did not doubt the woman and was so completely bewitched by mariposillas beauty that i failed to disapprove what appeared to be only a pleasant pastime  never before had i seen any one so lovely as this young girl the rich tints had kindled beneath her cheeks while her eyes when she lifted them shone with lambent reflections of wonderful halfunderstood joy she appeared a vision from a lost century playing upon the credulity of the present  i do not wish to give the impression that mariposilla was a marvelous musician for such was not the case she only played with an original abandon which made her movements and the customary little tricks of her instrument appear more masterly than in reality they were her playing depended entirely upon her mood and that she was now happy carried far away from vexation or possible disappointment was plain for the slender brown fingers picked the strings as never before she seemed perfectly absorbed in her music and only when the long lashes lifted for a moment did her wonderful eyes proclaim the truth she was attempting to hide when the lashes again drooped soft telltale shadows quivered beneath the dark fringe that hid her impassioned joy the ridges of her small ears grew pink her lips richer the merest reflection of dimples fled and returned to the glowing cheeks as each new emotion revealed her happy secret  the day i have said had been unusually warm the sun had reached its meridian without faltering only above the mountains had the fathomless blue of the sky been broken by a few thin clouds unexpectedly the air grew chill as the sun fled behind a bank of fog which spread each moment with amazing density upon the valley  with the first dimming of the day a change appeared in mariposilla while miss walton grew at once serene unexpectedly and discordantly the spanish child ended her performance like a frightened bird she fluttered to my side her color gone her courage shaken  we must go i said turning to mrs sanderson marjorie must not be exposed to the fog i explained as we bade good bye to miss walton and ethel there appeared to be a mock significance in miss margarets thin voice when she invited us to repeat our visit ethel alone accompanied us to the door     chapter ix   never before had the unpretentious home of the doña maria del valle appeared so complete a refuge as upon our return after the eventful day in pasadena in the livingroom our kind hostess had lighted a fire of grotesque grape roots that writhed like a holocaust of mummies after the gloom without our welcome seemed perfect the ruddy flames from the fireplace flickering against the dusky walls had mercifully relieved the row of saints who in the daytime appeared to suffer persistently the throes of indigestion likewise from her frame above the chimney shelf the little spanish virgin smiled serenely upon her holy child in the firelight she seemed to forget her atrocious finery in the sweet consciousness of her maternity  the aged grandmother dozed in her accustomed chair at her feet the grayhounds pancho and pachita sprawled in longitudinal grace dead dogs to all appearances until a trespassing footstep attested their vigilance  a faint delicious odor of frijoles floated from the kitchen when the doña maria opened the door to bid us welcome home  marjorie flew to the strong arms overjoyed but mariposilla avoided her mother as she hastily retreated to her own room remaining apart until called to supper  the watchful doña maria observing that her child could eat nothing artlessly inquired the cause are not the frijoles inviting she asked in simple distress i have prepared them most fresh and the oil is from a new bottle the good woman pursued  perhaps my child is not well if so it is unfortunate that she should have gone from home for the good father and sister francisco came at noon while i served them with fruit and wine the father told much of our dear arturo expressing often great joy that so fine a youth grows rich soon to return to the friends who await him with so much affection sister francisco was grieved that the convent is no more dear to her child she requested that the days be few until a visit is paid and left with her love a little gift  as the doña maria paused she arose from the table and handed mariposilla a small religious book  the child had controlled herself with stoical determination throughout her mothers reproachful disclosures but unable to do so longer she burst into tears and fled from the room  the calm doña maria took no notice of the tempestuous departure but the grandmother appeared distressed muttering her disapproval in spanish  i confess that i felt annoyed at mariposillas conduct i could see no reason for the outburst of grief and felt myself an innocent agent in unsettling her happiness and disturbing her family  after supper when i had undressed marjorie who was soon asleep and had put on a chamber gown preparatory to writing letters a timid tap at my door told me that mariposilla was without so fond had i become of the child that i instantly forgot my recent resentment not waiting for the penitent to come to me i met her at the door drawing her to the couch i urged her to tell me quietly the cause of her unhappiness  the señora will think me unworthy of her love she cried chokingly  no dear i replied i shall always love you i have had many sorrows myself and i know how hard it is to speak of them but always when i have confided in a true friend i have felt better and sorry that i had not sought relief sooner  i will tell you she said and then you may despise me  she was very beautiful as she half drooped before me her great eyes moist her dark hair loose about her shoulders  tell me all dear child i urged as she still hesitated  i am most wicked she cried desperately i love not my people i am unhappy because i am not an american  a gush of tears terminated the confession  poor child i said drawing her to my side i am glad that you have told me your trouble for i think i can help you very soon  she lifted her face appealingly while i spoke  yes i continued i am sure that i understand your unhappiness you are not untrue to your people you only desire to be an american because you have perceived that they are more in touch with the times than your own nation who from loss of fortune and other causes are not what they once were or what they will some day be again your poor little heart and mind are starving for food you must be nourished and then you will be happy it is perfectly right that you should admire the superior attainments and polished manners of a race not your own it means no disloyalty to your people only the desire for a broader life and a higher culture  you may be sure dear child that no one is ever satisfied the yearnings of the heart after unattainable desires is common in gods wide creation the longings of the savage are only different in degree from yours or mine race puts no limits upon pure and laudable ambition  it is not necessary for you to be an american to be all that a lovely woman should be the daughter of the brave wonderful doña maria del valle can make of herself whatever she determines  mariposilla was still weeping gently  you are very beautiful dear child i continued more beautiful than any american girl i ever knew still there is a beauty which shines from the soul and from the mind that you must try daily to acquire then you will be lovely without flaw  if only you will be patient and true to your best ambitions i am sure that a great happiness will some day come into your life try to be contented be a dutiful daughter to your dear mother who has seen so much sorrow and has left only her precious child please her in all things that are possible and if you will do this i am sure that after a time you will understand how wise and unselfish she has always been  instantly the girl released herself while she faced me with a passionate despair i will never forget  i will do all she cried but marry arturo if i do not that i have done nothing the priest and my mother and the sisters at the convent will curse me if i refuse they will call me a shame and although i love not arturo they would sell me for his gold  no dear i entreated no one will compel you to marry arturo believe me you shall do as you please only you must not allow unjust suspicions to make you miserable think no more for the present of marriage try only to learn things that will fit you for life and happiness after a time if one should come whom you love you can then not only make him joyful with your great beauty but he will love and respect you because you have acquired the knowledge that makes life agreeable and comfortable long after youth and beauty have flown  the señora is most wise the child assented calmly perhaps she will teach me a little from her books that i too may learn of the great world for indeed i will be good she cried brightening with the determination  yes mariposilla i replied each day you shall have a lesson in english and soon you will be able to enjoy all that i enjoy only in return you must teach me spanish that i may also understand the language and literature of your famous race  thus the compact was sealed and each day afterward found mariposilla seated quietly in my room poring over an allotted task her stormy passions seemed stilled if the wind of destiny sometimes shrieked in my watchful ears it more frequently sighed plaintively as i devised new educational schemes for my protégée  no one was more delighted over mariposillas apparent reformation than the doña maria  not only did the lessons progress with astonishing regularity but work on the altar cloth which had been for long intervals neglected so that its various stages of completion were easily detected in the several soiled sections of the linen was resumed with steady plodding determination now but one row of the little jesus stitch remained to be done in the beautiful cloth ordered months before by a wealthy devotee  the doña maria was in ecstasies when her daughter brought the task finished two days before christmas at the same time begging permission to ride to pasadena that she might receive for her labor the great sum of thirty dollars  that same morning when mariposilla was pressing carefully the handsome piece of linen father ramirez had looked into the kitchen and praised her industry  after all she is a dear child the old priest said patting the dark head she will yet make a true woman like her dear mother before long arturo will come and the bells of old san gabriel shall ring again as they rang for the doña maria long ago  mariposilla flushed not a deadly pallor extinguished the healthy glow that the light labor had produced turning disrespectfully away she darted through the open door and was gone  it was only after the old priest had left and the sandersons had driven into the long green tunnel that color shone again beneath the surface of her cheeks     chapter x   the sandersons did not remain long at the ranch after their departure mariposilla saddled the pony and bidding us a gleeful adieu cantered away with the precious altar cloth  at parting the doña maria had given her child for a surprise a dozen exquisite doilies of her own workmanship they were bestowed as a reward for the girls recent industry and she was permitted to sell them with the altar cloth  shall i not be rich she cried brandishing in excitement a superb riding whip a remnant of former glories when i am come again the señora will go with me to los angeles there i shall buy beautiful things for you all  an instant later she was flying down the green tunnel as she passed between the mammoth century plants she waved once more her whipand was gone  dear child i said as we entered the house  yes said the mother she is good of heart if only she would listen to the advice of father ramirez and marry arturo we might all be once more joyful  yes i answered i hope it may yet be as you desire but if you will pardon me dear doña maria for speaking plainly let no priest or other person come between your child and yourself mariposilla is still so young that she is absolutely frightened at the thought of marriage let her develop gradually in her own way willful though it may appear  i am sure that after a time when arturo returns handsome and successful she will accept his proffered love  the doña marias great sad eyes filled with happy tears blessings be on you dear lady she said i shall ever be happy that it has been sweet to have given you our home  kind doña maria it was exactly what she had doneshe had given us her home generously she had taken two strangers into her great motherly heart to dwell  mrs sanderson was to come this same afternoon for a lesson in drawn work  as i dropped into my accustomed nook of the veranda the industrious doña maria hastened out to the kitchen to perform a remaining duty then before she had made the still rich dark hair tidy and perhaps said a prayer to the little wooden virgin in the corner of her bedroom her pupil had arrived mrs sanderson was driven by a groom her son was not with her  sidney had gone coursing with some people from east san gabriel who kept hounds she explained  i remember that i wondered instantly if the man had followed mariposilla  as it was impossible to know i could only appear interested in the progress of the drawn work for some unknown reason the lesson soon lagged mrs sanderson grew irritable over her indifferent success and for the first time wearied me a little  the lady was in one of her intolerant moods her captious rejoinders and censorious criticisms upon the guests of the hotel annoyed me i realized for the first time that possibly i myself might sometime become a target for my capricious friends sarcasms  marjorie wanted to go for a walk so excusing myself we departed  holding my little ones hand i tried to forget in her sweet unconscious talk the caustic brilliancy of the woman i had left every stray dog or resting bird that enlivened our walk delighted the child when we came to some anthills she grew flushed and excited as she built a fence about the thriving city to protect it against the invasion of tarantulas  ever since antonio the mexican had unearthed a tarantula one morning in the corner of the orchard marjorie had regarded the ugly yet comparatively harmless creature as californias one demon romancing in her play she slew the formidable monsters in single imaginary combat enjoying among the birds and butterflies the same enviable notoriety that st patrick attained when the snakes fled from the emerald isle  watching my child at play i scarcely realized that the short winter day was rapidly settling into twilight at once hastening home we found mrs sanderson gone and the doña maria busy preparing supper half an hour later it was dark and mariposilla had not yet come  i could see that the doña maria was uneasy for she went often to the door once as far as the turn in the driveway supper was now waiting the frijoles were in steaming readiness and yet mariposilla was absent  all were growing alarmed when the dashing of horses hoofs told me that not one but two persons had arrived in a moment i had flashed the light of the room through the open door into the night  i heard distinctly the sweet low voice of mariposilla and saw her lifted to the ground from her pony in the uncertain light the strong arms of sidney sanderson appeared to poise dangerously long the girlish form that resisted not the delay of the transit  i doubt if the doña maria saw what i believed that i saw for at the time i think she had turned to speak to the anxious grandmother then satisfied that the child had returned she left the room  the barking of the vigilant dogs had drawn me instantly to the door and i remember how positively certain i then felt that sidney had kissed mariposilla during her groundward journey  at the moment i believed entirely that he had done this thing i was filled with indignation and ready to denounce him fearlessly until mariposilla bounding to my side radiantly innocent from the uncertain darkness implored me to assist in detaining for supper the kind friend who had proved himself so invaluable during the afternoon i stood bewildered as the child proceeded to disarm my suspicions calling her mother from the kitchen she begged her to press the invitation that sidney was hesitating to accept  that mariposilla could be acting a part seemed impossible involuntarily i followed the girl from her disappearance between the century plants early in the afternoon up to the present time when she stood before me dazzling and lovely telling what to all appearance was nothing but the truth  as we seated ourselves about the supper table i knew that my suspicions were rapidly subsiding later i denounced myself humbly for allowing my imagination the absolute freedom of the night  sidney had never before appeared so manly or straightforward he seemed highly amused at mariposillas ecstasy over his apparently accidental appearance upon the scene of her disasters while he ate with innocent relish the supper which the hospitable doña maria delighted to serve  i was ruined but for mr sanderson the spanish girl explained tragically i could not have gone to los angeles with the señora and the precious things for christmas could not have been bought because i had stupidly lost the altar cloth and the gift of my mother i was returning home miserable without the money for which i had labored wild with anger when i remembered how i had gone almost to pasadena before i knew that my treasures were lost for wicked chiquita had shied in many places and many strangers had passed upon the road so i knew that to search in hope would be useless i could only weep upon the neck of my bad chiquita feeling ashamed but unable to forget my sorrow it was then that my friend saw me and restored again my treasures  was it not kind in our dear lady to send him so quickly almost as soon as i had prayed through tears one little prayer  oh it was joy to see again my things in the hand of a friend when i had believed them found by a stranger  as the child paused she looked confidingly at sidney who smiled assent to what she had been saying  yes he affirmed with unusual animation i was permitted to play for the first time in my life the exalted rôle of the good old man who comes out of the bushes just in time to save the beautiful princess from disaster  we all laughed but mariposilla sank her lovely face lower while she regarded her plate intently  suddenly she lifted her great earnest eyes fearlessly to my own they were full of light and happiness i doubted no longer that she was innocent of what i had imagined  i will call the señora early mariposilla said when sidney had gone and we were parting for the night she had been dancing about the room clicking in imitation of castanets her cherished gold pieces  is it not grand to be rich she cried how happy i am this night i shall never be so happy again  she looked strangely prophetic as she spoke she had not removed her riding habit and while dancing she caught up gracefully the insubordinate skirt which trammeled her exuberance floating about the room she appeared unconscious of everything but the delights of her awakened body her feet and arms moved in an ecstasy of unrestraint the abandoned sway of her agile frame caught naturally each modulation of the improvised castanets  come dear butterfly i said when she threw herself panting into a chair her eyes shining with excitement fly quickly to bed or the pretty wings will be weary for the hard long tomorrow  oh the beautiful tomorrow she cried rapturously i will call the señora earlythat not one moment of the precious day may be lost     chapter xi   true to the arrangement i heard the little bare feet patter across the hall to my door with the first gleam of the bright december morning  the doña maria had prepared an early breakfast but mariposilla could eat nothing in her excitement the gold pieces were carefully counted into the little purse and the deliberate antonio was soundly scolded for his delay in bringing around the pony hitched to the old buggy which i earnestly hoped would not fall to pieces short of the station  as we parted from the doña maria she requested me to select a readymade frock for mariposilla explaining that her daughter had been invited to spend a week at the east san gabriel hotel with mrs sanderson  i was so astonished at the announcement that i could hardly conceal my surprise but the doña maria not appearing to notice it i replied that i would be happy to serve her at the same time i decided to take marjorie and go myself to the hotel mrs sanderson had urged us to come repeatedly and i felt that now the invitation was imperative mariposilla should not go to the sandersons alone i had instituted myself her guardian and i would protect her not only from her inexperience but from unscrupulous attentions selfishly bestowed  i knew that mrs sanderson had secured the doña marias consent for her daughters visit to the hotel during my absence the previous afternoon and i saw at once that mariposilla had not known of the plan before however her first demonstrative joy was smothered in quiet ecstasy all the way to the city she was rapturously solemn only her telltale color and her eyes confessed the exciting dreams which were filling her innocent brain  as the purchase of the dress had now become the mainspring of our expedition we went at the termination of our short journey directly to a store announcing through show windows its distinctive claim to imported novelties upon the threshold we were met by a smiling french saleswoman possibly the only genuine importation in stock but wonderfully successful in discounting the abnormal developments of hebrew physiognomy visible in the ever watchful proprietor  it was but the work of a moment to abandon ourselves completely to the feminine joy of our undertaking once within the toils of the frenchwoman escape appeared the height of ingratitude  mariposilla was soon radiant with delight as she tried on for the first time in her uneventful life costume after costume commenting innocently upon the merits of one while she deplored the deficiencies of another after many trials she had almost decided to take a pretty rich blue serge enlivened with touches of gay plaided silk when the wily saleswoman brought out unexpectedly from a perfumed box a beautiful dress of cream cloth  the child held her breath as she begged to try on the wonderful frock with the jaunty sleeveless jacket worn over a soft creamy silk waist the entire costume daintily brightened with bands embroidered in gold thread when she stood arrayed before the long mirror regarding affectionately the stylish puff of the sleeves and the circular girlish effect of the throat outlined by a band of gold her simple vanity forgot concealment  mademoiselle is most bewitching the frenchwoman exclaimed she can not find one other costume so becoming her complexion looks most perfect so harmonious so delightful  in the mirror i could see reflected mariposillas extravagant joy she had never in her life before been so beautifully dressed instinctively she snatched from her head her hat discovering with quick perception that its somber shabbiness detracted from the general effect of the dainty costume standing for a moment unconscious of the audience she threw a kiss to her own lovely image realizing what she had done she flushed deeper and turned away  mademoiselle is an artist she perceives that she looks most beautiful the frenchwoman pursued she must certainly buy the costume there is about it an air it has just arrived and will soon be sold mademoiselle must not hesitate  for the first time the thought of the price presented a possible drawback to the inexperienced child she turned from the mirror touchingly in earnest in her inquiry how much does it cost she asked  when the saleswoman named the amount the disappointed girl began heroically to remove the jacket as she laid it aside she turned instinctively to me for sympathy  i cannot pay the price she whispered it would take all that i have and there would be nothing left to buy the shawl for my mother or the slippers for my grandmother or the doll for marjorie  a moment longer she hesitated the mist of disappointment gleaming in her eyes then with a quiet resolution that was wonderful she commanded the saleswoman to remove the coveted temptation announcing her determination to take the blue dress which she had previously fancied  i was delighted at the character she evinced i knew how bitterly disappointed she was and i was proud not only of her quiet selfcontrol but of the loving thoughtfulness she had displayed in remembering that her little store of gold must be divided with the toiling mother the old grandmother and my own little child  do up both costumes i said in undertone to the saleswoman less attentive now that she had discovered the extent of mariposillas capital impertinently folding the discarded dress she allowed mariposilla to struggle as best she could with her buttons  at my announcement she flew to assist but i commanded tartly the packing of our purchases  after we left the store i noticed several times during the day that the child still remembered covetously the denied frock but she behaved sensibly and after we had bought the shawl and the slippers and a chinese doll for marjorie and there was still money for a sailor hat and a few trifles she appeared satisfied she enjoyed with childish appetite our elaborate luncheon while she evinced the warmest interest in my selection of toys and books for marjorie when she discovered that i had bought presents for her mother and the grandmother she seemed to have dismissed entirely the disappointment of the morning  we left the city by a late afternoon train and already twilight had ceased to linger as we stepped blindly into the early winter darkness at the end of our short journey the voice of sidney sanderson sounded pleasant and assuring  you see he explained as he unburdened our farreaching arms i fancied you would need assistance antonio gratefully resigned his responsibilities and i took the liberty of coming myself with a more substantial vehicle  the escape from the uncertainties of the old buggy to say nothing of the eccentricities of the pony filled me with gratitude for our deliverer after the tiresome day it was truly delightful to find a friend in the depths of the darkness as yet i had not attained the independence exhibited by many unprotected women whom i met and sidneys unexpected courtesy so touched my heart that i meekly determined to forget forever my suspicions of the evening before  i had never quite overcome my childish dread of the dark and as we stepped from the train to the wayside platform i shall never forget the sickening wave of loneliness that deluged my courage a longing for the electric lights of the city for the first time in months fastened upon me while never before had a familiar voice sounded so welcome as did sidneys coming from the uncanny denseness of the night it was not until we had reached the long dark tunnel of peppers that i regained the composure which i felt continually from my first day with the doña maria  through the open door streamed a bright welcome checking effectually my transient discontent for midway in the flood of light danced marjoriea sprite in white flushed and joyous she watched for our return  within the grape roots had been piled high the supper table shone with unusual luster old silver and rich red roses proclaimed the night a gala one and the kind doña maria in her best black silk bade us the oldtime welcome of christmas eve  the grandmother resplendent in great gold earrings chattered garrulously in spanish while mrs sanderson smiled indulgently and regally upon all  the lady was in demievening toilet and the delicate tone of her frenchgray gown embellished with lace and caught at the half low throat by flashing jewels was to mariposilla a revelation to the simple child the handsome woman appeared a wonderful vision from which she could not withdraw her eyes for the first time she beheld mrs sanderson in her most captivating rôle the conventional habit of day exchanged for one of rare artistic beauty had given to the lady a sudden fascinating youth which was startling in the less impertinent light of evening the encroachments of time were effaced the aristocratic features and dazzling teeth belied the years of the woman whose supreme object had been their preservation the beautiful hands ablaze with jewels seemed to smite the humble room with light when the lady caressed with amused vanity the bewildered child she had so perfectly enthralled  fly butterfly she coaxed as mariposilla lingered by her side sid is starving and so are we all cast aside the old dull frock and dazzle us in the new one  i had always noticed that mrs sanderson was exuberant in the evening to her theatrical nature there was something exhilarating in the flicker of artificial lights when high noon told her unpleasant truths she forgot them the same evening amid shaded lamps and candles an open fire could warm her usually chilly sympathies until she sometimes forgot her selfishness in genuine kindness at such times occasionally she grew honest and often liberal  she had declared that misfortunes and ugly surroundings would soon make her a devil it was only when deceived by luxury and flattery that she was capable of good thoughts  i am naturally depraved before i have had my bath and my early coffee she would say jestingly to the amazement of the literal whom she delighted to shock sid the scamp knows better than to cross me before luncheon in the evening he is safe when he sees that i am in the ecstasies of dotage a perfect old egotist happy with illusions he imposes upon me shamefully  strange worldly woman that she was it was impossible to condemn her brilliancy  she had told us that her great grandmother was a frenchwoman of rank and as i regarded her this christmas eve i seemed to see the proud dame of the fallen monarchy living again in the imperious form of her descendant  i had not completed my hasty toilet when mariposilla came flying to my door breathless she held in her arms the dress of cream and gold  see she cried they have made a mistake and i must again part with the beautiful dress can i not wear it this once that my friends may see it  i had not the heart to rebuke her she was so lovely in her ignorance i could only smile indulgently as i bade her enjoy the frock which was to be her christmas present  dear kind señora she exclaimed passionately kissing my hand i will indeed be good i will indeed learn fast  very well i replied if you are good i shall always be glad that i was able to please you but come dear child i urged make haste for the doña maria is calling she will be deeply annoyed if we allow her supper to cool  it was astonishing how quickly mariposilla complied with my command her transformation appeared to occupy but a moment and never was the awakening of an actual butterfly more surprising or triumphant  her joy in her enhanced beauty was rapturous and innocent when we entered the livingroom she hugged herself with delightful vanity as she approached the astonished doña maria  am i not grand am i not beautiful she demanded is not my dress more rich than the dresses in the green chest of my grandmother be happy with me dear mother kiss thy child and give her at last the little necklace of opals see she continued coaxingly peering into a mirror see how sweetly the necklace will lie against my throat just as my beautiful aunt lola once wore it she entreated in spanish  hush foolish child the doña maria commanded sternly for at the first mention of the necklace the grandmother had shown ominous signs of dissatisfaction when mariposilla persistently mentioned the name of the dead lola the old woman screamed angrily growing each moment more excited until the patient doña maria coaxed her gently from the room  i am so sorry cried the penitent child when the door closed upon the now shrieking and unmanageable spanish woman i am so sorry that i compelled my grandmother to make a noise she approves not of joy and my mother too is often sad when i am happy for she then thinks only of my dead father and the evil fortunes which have befallen us  for answer mrs sanderson drew the unhappy girl within the charmed circle of her arms with her soft jeweled hands she clasped about her throat a pretty string of gold beads say no more about the opal necklace she said the little beads will do until you are older  when the doña maria returned mariposilla had recovered her spirits she was talking gaily with sidney unconscious of everything but the delight of the moment as her mother approached she flew to her side that she might admire the necklace she had just received with pretty entreaty she begged the doña maria to thank once more the dear friends who had given her so much joy  for a moment the mother seemed to forget everything but the touching happiness of her child a tender light shone in the great dark eyes when she thanked us in a little speech displaying the fervent characteristics of her simple nature  the supper was now steaming upon the table a great platter of chicken tamales had been prepared as none but the doña maria knew how to prepare them the fragrant coffee the dainty biscuit and the rich preserves and cream tempted us delightfully with the unconventional perfection of spanish hospitality  the only restraint upon our complete enjoyment was the consciousness of the protesting grandmother mrs sanderson i perceived was intensely annoyed  her hatred of the imbecile tyranny of age was plain when the doña maria excused herself finding it impossible to remain longer away from her unreasonable charge now protesting in methodical shrieks  be happy dear friends she said mind not the infirmities of my mother i will soon soothe herin timeto sleep when she will forget for a season the sorrows of her life make free with all that is ours and enjoy if possible the supper which i have prepared my daughter will serve and may the night be happy  dear brave doña maria how could we reverence her enough how forget in mirth the pathos of her noble unselfishness  long after the sandersons had gone long after mariposilla had ceased to rejoice over her splendid fortunes forgetting in the natural slumbers of youth the caressing pressure of the gold beads or the sweet secret of the little bracelet hugging her arm that she must not show but could kiss in solitude long after the gorgeous air castles built by the ignorant innocent young architect had crumbled for the night and i had ceased to listen to the faint noises from the adjoining room did the patient doña maria keep her vigil  as i dropped to sleep i heard her tender voice soothing like an infant the aged mother who at last sank away into a long irresistible slumber  when the clear yellow dawn of christmas morn awakened the cocks of the corral i heard the doña maria knocking at her daughters door opening my own i inquired if her mother still slept begging that i might relieve for a time her patient watch  the señora is kind she said but my mother will now sleep for many hours the señora need not fear she will scream no more she has taken the sleeping potion and now i am free to go with my child to the early celebration  mariposilla was now awake her hair had fallen over her shoulders and the little necklace still encircled her throat about her eyes lingered the rosy flush of her unbroken sleep she sat up as we entered pushing quickly beneath her nightgown sleeve a tiny rim of gold  come my child said the doña maria make haste and prepare for the early celebration our sufferer sleeps at last and we may now go together to the church and thank once more the sweet mother for the birth of the holy child  i went back to my room as mariposilla began to dress a few moments later i heard the outer door close gently and knew that the doña maria and her child had gone  a strange fear fastened upon me driving me irresistibly to the adjoining door i opened it the darkened room was a fascinating terror i entered and approached the bed of the sleeping spanish woman her stillness was terrible the old horror seized me i felt once more the power of my old enemy death seemed to be facing me again the same cruel dreadful certainty that i knew so well i staggered forward to flee i must have fainted for when i revived i was lying upon the floor in front of the little wooden virgin the blessed sunlight was peeping from the sides of the window curtains while above the head of the image there hung a golden beam  i arose and stood calmly by the bed of the spanish woman  the linen was spotless the pillow cases and nightdress of the sleeper elaborate with the drawn needlework of the doña maria the snowy whiteness of the counterpane contrasted strangely with the bronzed weatherbeaten features and large gnarled hands of the woman beneath so like a mummy that her breathing alone seemed human  yet regular and warm as an infants her breath issued through her halfopen mouth no muscle stirred no sound broke the silence until in the distance floating above the orange groves and on to the christmas day rang the bells of old san gabriel     chapter xii   a soothing peace possessed me as i listened to the ringing of the old bells i left quietly the bedside of the aged sleeper to kneel a moment later by that of my child the healthy loveliness which i beheld completed my restoration as i kissed the dainty dimpled hands and laid my cheek against the yellow curls her warm sweet breath infused my flagging circulation with the energy of love  i no longer forgot my plans for the morning hastily dressing i gathered as quickly as possible the various mysterious parcels secreted about my room glancing occasionally at marjorie to be sure that no possum slumbers hid beneath deceitful lashes satisfied that my schemes were unsuspected i fled eagerly with ladened arms from the silent house out into the crisp inspiring air of the sacred morning  the sun was now well up as it rose it touched with magical radiance the most distant reaches of the christmas landscape  reverently i lingered enthralled with the breath of judea standing beneath the old palms i listened to an anthem led by a lark and sustained by the lowing cattle who seemed to tell as at first the birth of the longexpected saviour while the rosebuds reflected from jeweled hearts his pure parables  about me the purple mountains gleamed with the fresh cool touch of the night between twin spurs resting against the bosom of the sky snow had gathered until in the distant outline a pure white lamb appeared slain for the holy festival  old baldy the high priest of the morning until now had withheld the fullness of his majesty suddenly the sun with golden shafts rent far asunder the misty veil that had enveloped his hoary summit transfigured with supernatural glory the morning seemed to pause for one still moment as if to receive his benediction  i too have been to the early celebration i said to my heart as i turned reluctantly to the pressing demands of the now inaugurated day  hastily i hid the packages in various secret nooks while i decorated a great white rose tree with cornucopias and knicknacks  hardly had the last bauble been hung upon the magnificent christmas tree when i heard the plaintive voice of my child  i hurried to the house to find the little girl upon the bed struggling bravely with her shoes and stockings  did the fairies come she demanded springing into my arms for her christmas kiss  for my answer i carried her to the window through which she beheld the white rose tree  see i said how good are the good little fairies to good little girls  may i go as soon as i am dressed and pick the tree the child besought her eyes beaming with expectation  yes i said you may go but i think the fairies would rather you would wait until our kind doña maria and mariposilla return from church the doña maria must be very weary she has not slept all night for watching at the bedside of the grandmother i think i know a little girl who might help to get breakfast so that when the doña maria returns she can refresh herself at once with some hot coffee i wonder if the little girls name is marjorie or perhaps i am mistaken i may have forgotten her name  marjorie took one long regretful look at the rosetree then from her baby heart there escaped a tragic little sigh that was half a sob please dear mamma she said bravely i will mind the fairies  fortunately for both mother and child their resolution was not long tested  it took but a few moments to prepare the toast and coffee for antonio had unexpectedly lighted the fire and filled the water kettle before our simple meal was quite ready the doña maria and mariposilla had arrived  it was amusing to witness the doña marias mortification when she perceived that i had cooked the breakfast her distress was genuine when she declared that the señora would certainly be ill i am ashamed that i should have remained so long she apologized the señora should not have arisen until our return it is ill fortune that she has not permitted me to prepare her a dainty holiday breakfast  dear doña maria i entreated why will you deplore what is already accomplished i have told you often that a simple breakfast is all that i require and our frolic has given me a fine appetite see i urged is my toast not a delicious brown make haste and enjoy the coffee or i shall be greatly disappointed  the señora is most kind the doña maria replied seating herself submissively with her dark hand she brushed away a tear we are ever happy my daughter and i that we have known one so good and gentle she added feelingly  marjorie and mariposilla had by this time declared it impossible to resist longer the fascinations of the rosetree tantalizingly visible through the open door gaining permission they scampered away followed by the hounds the dogs appeared to understand the occasion they ran forward doubling over with excitement as though expecting to find a jackrabbit suspended from a bough of the christmas tree the picture was a pretty one and none of us enjoyed it more than the doña maria who soon left the table and joined the children in their merry hunt for the hidden parcels  marjorie led her about at will compelling the sedate woman to stoop and caper as she had not done for years when the gifts had all been discovered we arranged them in rows upon the bermuda grass preparatory to the untying of strings and ribbons  marjories row was long and diversified while mariposilla declared that she had never before received so many gifts at one time  it is because we are so good marjorie explained for you know that fairies never bring presents to naughty children only just stones and mud  we all laughed as we continued our occupation each untying in turn a parcel marked with the name of the recipient and the good fairy who had been responsible for its safe delivery from the foot of old baldy  with each discovery the air was flooded with shrieks of approval marjorie rejoiced over every little treasure while mariposilla embraced us excitedly at each happy surprise  even the doña maria grew artlessly gay appearing to forget that the grandmother might soon awaken to be cared for like an infant and that christmas was now but a colorless counterfeit of years past  ah exclaimed the sympathetic mother when mariposilla held up for admiration a little silver bracelet it is almost like the happiness of the old days not the same for the spanish gave not gifts but the good cheer is most sweet i grieve she continued that the señora and my child should not have known those once glad daysnow gone forever then all went about from rancho to rancho free from sorrow always joyful in abundance but the holiday is no more what it once wasso full of mirth and sweet enjoyment for both old and young yet ever sacred for none dared forget to go to the old church when the bells rang lovingly the birth of the holy child  dear señora she continued her dark eyes intensifying with awakening memories could you have seen the beauty of the old spanish life then with thy gentle heart tears would now fall for those of us who are left  with increasing melancholy she explained that her child refused to grieve for the departed glory of her family  i am often miserable when i remember how different i once felt so full of joy and pride when i dreamed that my children would thank always the sweet mother for the nobility of their fathers name yet i blame not mariposilla for she saw not my husband don arturo her life was too late to know of his goodness and beauty i could forgive always her thoughtless indifference if only sometimes she would weep when i show her the riding jacket embroidered with gold and the botas of exceeding richness once worn by her dear father but she is cold and understands not what she has lost she would even profane the precious shawls of her grandmother urging that some be sold to envious americans for gold  poor doña maria i feared that her transient happiness had fled but she soon controlled the dash of bitterness that tinctured for a moment her reminiscences and continued to describe the wonderful days once enjoyed by her now scattered and americanized people  think not dear señora that i am ungrateful she begged sweetly it is perhaps best that my child should grow like the americans her older kinsmen will soon be gone the younger ones like herself care not to continue in the old way seeking to marry with strangers forgetting often even the religion of their childhood  i was loath to interrupt the gentle complaints of the doña maria for beneath the shadow of the venerable palms her sweet low sympathetic voice enthralled me with realistic glimpses of her picturesque past  tears dropped upon the brown cheeks when she told how she had knelt for the communion that same morning alone with her child surrounded no longer by dear familiar faces  how different it once was she explained eagerly how sad yet good to remember how once the altar rail was thronged with near relatives and loving friends to think how joyful were our hearts when we had received and could go absolved from the cold church into the warm sunshine there to speak pleasant kind words and wish to each other a merry day how beautiful to listen to the gay greetings of the young to grasp the hands of dear ones and hear upon all sides feliz noche buena  come she said rising my mother still sleeps and i will show you the silken shawls the lace mantillas and the embroidered garments of our family  gladly i followed her to the little chamber where she opened reverently a huge chest from which she drew one by one the beautiful relics of her prosperity  with loving care she took from scented wrappings gorgeous shawls of crêpe blooming on both sides with rich yet delicately wrought flowers mantillas of wonderful lace and dainty bits of spanish finery that brought to my lips repeated exclamations of wonder and delight  i am happy to have shown the señora my treasures she said flushing with pleasure as she drew from a silken bag embroidered with silver a scarf which she had reserved until the last as the most precious and beautiful heirloom in her possession  draping it pathetically about her somber figure she urged me to admire the delicate green which displayed so marvellously the butterflies embroidered in pink and gold studded with real jewels  see she cried caressing tenderly the clinging fabric is it not wonderful so bright and sparkling after all the sad years  the señora will understand how dear is the scarf of the butterflies when i relate to her its story explaining how it came from spain the gift of my husbands grandmother how i wore it to church upon our wedding day to shield from the sun the neck and arms that were once my foolish pride how when we were returning from our marriage mounted upon horses decked with roses and splendid with silver and jewels my husband desirous that all should see the magnificence of my satin gown caught away playfully the scarf throwing it about his own shoulders while he declared that all must behold the beauty of his bride after a time when our child was born my husband brought again the scarf of the butterflies commanding my mother to wrap it about our boy that he might carry him upon the veranda to be admired by our assembled household  ah señora was not my husband proud the day he went with a company to the church for the christening of our child many relatives had arrived from los angeles and from ventura so that our house was overflowing with cheer the kitchen and the court were gay with preparations from morning until evening although i could not go myself to the church my husband told me joyfully how the dear old father who had married us the year before took in his arms our boy blessing him with double certainty when he kissed his little cheek  but too beautiful to live was our baby and in one short year we gave him tearfully to the sweet mother of heaven who heard not our prayers when our little one lay ill two more sons grown almost to manhood we lost and then my brave husband who had ever grieved sorely for his boys went too  i alone remained with my mother and my unborn child who came not until her father had been five months dead  see she said wiping away the tears that suffused her great sad eyes see dear señora the little petticoats of my dead babies all now yellow with age  who will care when i am gone for the worthless garments of my little ones surely not mariposilla for she understands not why i should still grieve after the long years that have passed  she loves however the scarf of the butterflies and begs often to possess it when i am taken she may do as she desires with it for it will then be her own to treasure or to resign unto strangers  yet i pray that she may always hold sacred the gift of her fathers grandmother for she too was carried to her christening wrapped in the beautiful shawl  well do i remember how sore was my heart the day that my mother went alone to the church with my fatherless child so ill was i that i cared not even to name my little daughter entreating my mother to consult with the priest who might choose for us  but my good mother was wiser than i and when she had thought much she remembered the butterflies upon the beautiful scarf and how my husband don arturo had delighted to behold them glistening in the sunlight when i first wore the shawl to my bridal how afterwards he insisted that his children should first be shown to his household wrapped in the splendid gift of his grandmother wisely she remembered these things and when weeks after i asked her the name of my child i wept for joy when she said she is mariposilla  tenderly the dark hand folded and replaced in its embroidered bag the precious scarf of the butterflies tearfully she laid it away by the side of the sparkling ridingjacket and gorgeous botas of the dead arturo while she reverently closed the old chest relegating to its scented depths the fading remnants of her former grandeur together with the sad sweet memories of her poetic life     chapter xiii   it had been arranged that we should go to san gabriel late in the afternoon of christmas day  as the time approached for our departure i grew more reluctant to leave the ranch i was still loath to submit to the restraints of a hotel had i dared i would have abandoned the visit it irritated me to submit heroically to exile from paradise but there now seemed no alternative  the little valise had been packed for hours the precious evening frock safely folded away in its scented wrappings together with little bits of finery to be worn at the hotel mariposilla radiant and expectant counted the moments which delayed our departure  even the grandmother was now comfortably restored having awakened from her long sleep fresh and docile  no vestige of excuse remained to justify a change in our plans an ordained agreement of trifles appeared conspiring with fate  as we bade farewell to the doña maria i found it impossible to resist the unhappy presentiments which thronged our departure  when we drove away with sidney and passed between the great century plants a sudden fear seized my vacillating will i knew in an instant that i dreaded the possible consequences of what i had undertaken  in the front seat of the trap with sidney sat mariposilla transformed by excessive happiness and conventional garb into another creature never again would she be the child she had been even that same morning when she had romped upon the bermuda grass with marjorie flushed with pleasure over her christmas trifles now another flush was upon her cheeks another light shone in her eyes for even as i looked mariposilla had bidden farewell forever to the restraints of her simple beautiful childhood  had i created a scene by turning back in our journey into the world it is hardly possible that i could have obviated the difficulties of mariposillas emancipation from the life she had determined to escape  as i continued to face the responsibilities of her case i grew more tranquil i reasoned that it was perhaps best not to resist the unmistakable leadings of fate which seemed to point to a destiny for the girl different from the one desired by the doña maria her remarkable beauty the truly good blood which ran in her veins to say nothing of her laudable ambition and determination not to accept a husband dictated by the priest or her relatives justified me in the belief that she had outgrown the old life which was now each day growing more and more intolerable  with care and advantages it seemed not only credible but certain that mariposilla might eventually satisfy her ambition  the longer i thought upon the subject the more i felt it to be my duty to watch jealously the marvelous and unavoidable development of this wonderful girl  in a word i compromised with my contending emotions instituting myself the guardian of her glorious beauty our arrival at the hotel was concurrent with the usual lively glimpses of festivity always prevalent at a pleasure resort upon the approach of evening a gush of music the ripple of laughter the tripping of feet and the spontaneous rush of cherubs in white frocks to investigate our arrival constituted for mariposilla and marjorie a prime reception  mrs sanderson awaited us upon the landing of the broad staircase then led us cordially to her own apartments when she threw open the door to her sittingroom mariposilla exclaimed with pleasure as the lady drew her affectionately to the open fire  sit down little one she said i will draw some tea while sid attends to the luggage my pretty butterfly must be warmed after her drive for of course she is to outshine all beauties at the ball tonight  as mrs sanderson spoke she went to the teatable where the kettle was already singing  i could see as mariposilla received her tea from the hand of our hostess that the shelllike cup and saucer were a source of apprehension the child dreaded a catastrophe more than she would have dreaded a month previous a dire calamity in her family  covertly she watched me as i deposited upon the side of my saucer the biscuit that must not interfere with the manipulation of my spoon  but although she endeavored to follow my exact policy her first attempt at tea drinking was destined to be unfortunate  mariposilla had not yet achieved the confidence necessary for the poise and counterpoise of the treacherous spoon the girl had not yet attained the dallying point she could not yet sip tea one moment with assurance the next disregard the responsibilities of dresden or coalport china while she chatted unconsciously with her neighbor  notwithstanding her most earnest efforts to succeed in the undertaking the spoon flew at an aggravating tangent across the room in a frantic lurch to capture it she upset her cup spilling into her lap the steaming tea  in a moment mrs sanderson was by her side  dear child she said sympathetically relieving the girl at once from her costly incumbrances i alone am to blame for offering you that stupid cup sid declares each time it is used that it shall be the last  you see she added charmingly those miserable little feet that look so secure when the cup is standing upon the saucer have a malicious way of running away they are just like the profligate dish that eloped with the spoon when the cow jumped over the moon  in a moment mariposilla had forgotten her embarrassment  the lady took her at once to her bedroom where she sponged away the stains petting and reassuring the child until she glowed with happiness  soon sidney came to say that our rooms were ready urging us as we withdrew not to be late for dinner  when we had unpacked our apparel mariposilla became at once absorbed in the delights of her toilet speculating innocently while she dressed in regard to the mysteries of the cotillion which she was to witness for the first time after dinner  the cream and gold frock was joyfully assumed and if possible the girls pleasure was keener than upon the previous evening  with true womanly instinct she established the harmonious intimacy between herself and her finery which at first had been lacking she now wore her gown with composure none would have suspected that she had not always been well dressed  she had pushed above the elbow the wide puffy sleeves displaying the lower half of her rounded arms while the smile that parted her lips told plainly of satisfaction when she regarded the effect  now that her mother was absent she wore fearlessly the shining bracelet about her throat she fastened with delighted vanity the little necklace declaring with one more loving glance into the mirror that she was ready  marjorie having finished her tea had obediently retired satisfied to watch for a few moments from her bed our elaborate preparations she was deeply moved by our grand toilets pronouncing us the beautifulest peoples in the house i was the loveliest of mammas in my long neglected dwaggin dress while upon mariposilla she bestowed a profusion of compliments as pretty as they were genuine  when we had kissed the little girl good night we started at once to rejoin our friends half way down the hall we met mrs sanderson and her son coming to us  the lady wore a rich lavender evening gown while sidney for the first time appeared before mariposilla in the immaculate perfection of full dress  i saw in a moment that the spanish child was in an ecstasy of adoration ever after it would be useless for the doña maria to endeavor to interest her in the magnificence of her fathers once splendid apparel  even upon the threshold of this new experience she was captivated beyond release never again would she submit to her old life  the next moment was felicitous when mrs sanderson took caressingly her hand drawing it within her own she commanded her son to escort us to dinner     chapter xiv   as we disposed ourselves about the friendly table in the cheerful dining room i could see that mariposillas wildest desires were at last realized  she was trembling slightly i fancied as i glanced at her from my opposite position but in a moment she had controlled herself and if the ordeal of dinner had at first appeared formidable she soon forgot her fears in rapturous happiness  as upon the occasion of the waltons luncheon she watched intelligently my every move making no mistakes as she received prettily the flattering attentions of those about her  as dinner proceeded the girls excitement was manifest only in her transcendent coloring she was dropping naturally as well as gracefully into the most difficult requirements of her social novitiate as i watched her anxiously i grew tranquil with the assurance that the first step in her education had been successfully taken exulting as i reflected upon the complications of modern dining  one of my pet theories had led me to believe that i could discern correctly the character or native refinement of anyone provided i could observe unsuspected his gastronomical endeavors i had often discovered inherent resemblances to the brute or lingering traces of the savage as i watched covertly the table attainments of a person who under other ordinary conditions appeared eminently correct i felt willing to stake extensive odds that mariposillas social success would progress satisfactorily in intelligent ratio to her first unique acquirement  our coffee was served in mrs sandersons sittingroom where we were joined by a bevy of young people to whom we were introduced in anticipation of the weeks festivities  sidney and a young englishman prepared to smoke while the girls gathered about mrs sanderson like moths around a candle  have you heard of the coincidence demanded mrs wilbur a dashing blonde who thus far in the season had monopolized the attentions of the social leaders son imagine if you please a shortage of young women for our cotillion  just think of an extra man in san gabriel shouted the girls in chorus while mrs wilbur appealed confidentially to mrs sanderson to settle the impending difficulty  we were expecting six couples from pasadena and now at the last moment ethel walton sends word that the giddy widow who was to have chaperoned her party is ill obliging them to bring a maiden lady who doesnt dance she exclaimed  delightful exclaimed the girls how jolly to boast a rover and dear mr eastman at that  wont he be popular mrs wilbur added aside to mrs sanderson who was at that moment glancing interrogatively at sidney  the young man divined his mothers signal for he came to her side with unusual alacrity  the very thing the lady replied to his earnest undertone the arrangement will be quite proper and i am sure that mrs wilbur will relinquish you for mr eastman wont you my dear the lady continued turning suddenly to mrs wilbur who was now beginning to suspect that sidney was quite satisfied to obey the suggestion of his mother  it will be so interesting to watch mariposilla dance in the cotillion mrs sanderson pursued bravely dear mrs wilbur will excuse you for my sake i am sure sid she added sweetly as she turned from that somewhat ruffled young woman to the spanish child who was prettily pleading her ignorance of cotillions  never mind dear she said coaxingly to the timid girl you dance divinely and sid will take you through the figures beautifully  i saw that mrs wilbur was chagrined and angry for a hot flush had dyed her cheeks when she replied that of course mr sanderson could do as he chose as far as she was concerned she would be greatly pleased to dance with mr eastman having formerly refused him her partnership on account of an early engagement with mr sanderson  my mother appears to have solved our difficulties mr eastman certainly surpasses me as a partner and as there is no robbery in a beneficial exchange with mrs wilburs permission i will dance with miss del valle the young man responded indifferently  a suppressed titter from one of the girls had the unfortunate tendency to increase mrs wilburs pique  she answered curtly that certainly mrs sanderson had the first claim upon her son mr eastman is a delightful partner and i am exceptionally favored in the cut she added with spirit  why mrs wilbur exclaimed a girl with babyblue eyes and a sympathetic costume embellished by infant devices how dare you perpetrate a pun you are surely not ignorant of the punishment which fits such a crime  while you my dear have yet to learn of penalties arranged for young women who can not distinguish between a pun and a simile mrs wilbur replied  mrs sanderson perceiving that the air was becoming tinctured with personalities declared that there were also penalties for being disagreeable  come she said let us resist the desire to quarrel i am sure that mrs wilbur and sidney are both satisfied they have simply been misunderstood and under the circumstances it becomes a polite duty to change the subject  as the lady finished her tactful and decisive rejoinder she took from the table a package which had just arrived by express from new york  a box of chocolate creams for the one who guesses my christmas gift she said graciously holding above the throng a long narrow package that was certainly not suggestive of any particular thing  each person shall have three guesses which mrs wilbur will kindly record  go sid and fetch some paper his mother commanded turning sweetly to mrs wilbur who was evidently weighing the consequences of refusing to act as secretary  however when mr sanderson brought the writing pad and pencil she accepted them with mollified mien  mr brooke shall guess first mrs sanderson said addressing the diminutive englishman who was smoking before the fire  what do you say my package contains mr brooke the lady urged when the young man persisted in a grinning silence  weally my deah lady i am deucid poor at a fancy he at length divulged  never mind cried the aggressive baby girl say anything time is precious  as you insist the man replied i fancy the package contains mr sandersons sweetheart  that is but one guess objected mrs wilbur there are two more possibilities in store for you  three sweethearts as you bother so the englishman replied greatly elated at his wit  very well said mrs sanderson three sweethearts are surely not an impossibility to a young man are they sid  certainly not her son replied as he lit with adorable indifference a fresh cigar  now my little butterfly shall guess mrs sanderson declared turning to mariposilla who was the unconscious center of the admiring throng all listened eagerly to hear what the beautiful child would say suffused as she was with charming embarrassment  i am sure it is a gift of devotion and great affection she answered modestly gazing with touching earnestness into the face of her adored friend  how extremely pretty approved mrs sanderson  thus far the contents of the package is enchantingly abstract can not some one who is matteroffact indulge in a guess which is tangible  in accordance with the request there followed in quick succession a volley of reckless ventures each outdoing the other in substantial reality  when the guessing ceased mrs wilbur remarked the weight of the package and announced that she believed the box contained shot nothing but lead could weigh so heavily but of course as secretary i am not guessing she remarked indifferently  surely you must guess mrs sanderson urged sweetly but as mrs wilbur insisted that she preferred to keep out of the game the lady said no more but proceeded to undo the mysterious parcel  a shout of admiration burst from the expectant company when she exposed for view an elegant silver picture shrine containing three superb postures of a beautiful girl  by jove i am right lisped the rivulet gleefully did i not say three sweethearts  certainly mr brooke has won several cried at once  dont be so sure retorted mrs wilbur in an undertone did i not say the box contained shot if you doubt the fact look at the spanish girl she added censoriously to sidney who appeared not to hear  it was true that mariposilla had grown strangely pale she seemed like one smitten by a remorseless blast instinctively she vanished from mrs sandersons side while her pitiful eyes implored me to take her away  fortunately at this particular time the tallyho arrived from pasadena and to my infinite joy the situation was relieved mariposilla forgotten in the excitement soon regained her composure and later when we entered the ballroom her color was restored and her distress obliterated  i was glad that mrs wilbur and i had alone witnessed the childs jealousy the rest of the company had been too busy admiring the pictures to notice mariposillas pale countenance while mrs wilburs sarcasms had been uttered low apart from the throng as she sat by the table on which she had been writing  i felt that the poor childs secret was safe for this evening at least for i believed mrs wilbur too wily to acknowledge her rival at present the woman of the world still hoped to distance the spanish child  i could see that she was determined to drive her to a disadvantage if possible  the cotillion was not to be enjoyed until a programme of dances had been offered to all the guests of the hotel some of whom had not been favored with invitations for the cotillion  this arrangement proved fortunate for mariposilla she forgot her first slight embarrassment entirely as she glided happily among the less exclusive throng who goodnaturedly jostled her as she passed in the dance  sidney had assumed entire charge of her he had arranged her programme with great consideration interspersing his own name freely between the names of the most desirable men in the room while he reserved for himself the privilege of escorting her to the refreshment room preparatory to the cotillion  the evening from its beginning appeared auspicious for mariposilla between dances the child flitted to my side like a happy bird  it is most grand señora she whispered as sidney drew her away for a waltz  during refreshments i noticed that mrs wilbur was both fascinated and annoyed at the sensation the girl was producing where would the matter end i asked myself  even in the midst of mariposillas apparent success i felt my heart sinking with apprehension why i questioned why did i let her come  the dancers were rapidly leaving the supper room and when i looked for mariposilla she too had disappeared thinking that she had gone below into the ballroom i followed hastily but she was not there excusing myself to mrs sanderson upon the plea that i must peep at marjorie i ran hastily above hoping to find my charge in one of the reception rooms faithfully i searched the parlors and corridors and later the verandas in vain for a trace of the truants so successfully escaping me  there was yet mrs sandersons sittingroom i must pass it on the way to marjorie  i hastily ascended the stairs contemplating as i flew along the hall my chances of interrupting a têteatête  i felt indignant that sidney sanderson should abuse so soon my confidence  i realized that mariposilla already had been missed by her rival and the thought that the inexperienced child would doubtless be criticised and perhaps maligned was decidedly irritating  slackening my pace as i approached the vicinity of mrs sandersons parlor i perceived the door ajar a second more and i comprehended the absurdity of my vigilant endeavors my conscientious plans and sentimental reservations thus far were not proving superior to the wiles of cupid  i winced cruelly when i remembered the confident schemes for mariposillas gradual translation into the bosom of the conventional world  in the center of the room her profile outlined by acute emotion stood the spanish girl bending beside her sidney was evincing an ardency entirely paradoxical when i considered his indifferent temperament  mariposilla held in her hands which trembled the silver shrine containing the pictures of the beautiful girl  you love her not she repeated in an ecstasy of doubt her voice gradually rising in joy at the sweet denial she had forced from the lips of her lover  her head was still in profile but the long lashes that had lifted to disclose her rapture now dropped like a sable fringe upon her precious secret while she listened in silent contentment to the deep undertone assurances of the man by her side  i could endure the restraint no longer tapping deceitfully upon the door i began at once an animated search for my fan inwardly disgusted with my cowardice furious over my imbecile failure as a chaperone     chapter xv   mariposilla was the belle of the cotillion seated between sidney and ethel walton she knew no embarrassment when dancing she was absolutely free from selfconsciousness  i assisted mrs sanderson at the favor tables where i had every opportunity of observing the girls behavior  she was constantly called out and to my delight accepted her popularity with gracious modesty  often when she came for a favor mrs sanderson delayed her to whisper a compliment or else to lavish upon her a marked caress  from first to last the happy child was noticeably bedecked with trophies of success in her hair a number of gauzy butterflies of different hues fluttered as she danced encouraging the fancy that she was truly related to the gorgeous little creatures after which she had been named  by the side of the spanish child the other girls appeared artificial their respective claims to beauty seemed easily determined the limit of their fascinations soon estimated  i never felt so blasé in my life before ethel walton whispered as i handed her a favor later when there was an intermission in the cotillion she crossed the room and sat by my side  as i told you once i feel dreadfully blasé tonight she said picking to pieces a rose which had fallen away from her stylish gown to watch your wonderful protégée rejoicing over the sweet uncertain trophies of her first cotillion is entirely refreshing her extravagant happiness makes me feel as though i had finished my course and been decidedly beaten  did you ever see anyone so effulgent ethel continued following with her eyes the outlines of mariposillas figure no one in the room can approach her in beauty she mused amiably and yet the girl inspires no jealousy for like donatello her moral nature seems absolutely undeveloped sometimes she seems like an exquisite link between nature and the fallen angels  have you too noticed this i exclaimed  yes ethel replied i have been thinking about her ever since that first visit to crown hill if i am ever famous in the salon mariposilla shall be the theme for my picture  if you work i am sure you will succeed i replied  i hope i shall continue to work she answered but even work is an uncertain proviso sometimes i wonder why god inconveniences the ordinary mortal with an imagination why does he not reserve the allurements of art for the genius of the century alone  i so often envy my sister the girl continued it is beautiful to watch her at a high church service this one exalted caprice seems to satisfy entirely her cravings after the extraordinary she believes the tenets of her faith so implicitly that she is never beguiled into uncomfortable doubts she never reaches after unattainable things and is absolutely satisfied with the common conventions of life  then surely she is happy i replied  yes answered ethel but look at sidney sanderson certainly he is in love with mariposilla watch him a moment and see how he has forgotten his blasé part tonight all things considered i believe the match would be a good one she continued sid is carnal enough to appreciate mariposillas physical perfection and i believe he could easily dispense with moral and intellectual qualities  later when ethel bade me goodnight she whispered that i might depend upon her as my ally if mr sidney becomes too masterful let me know she said gaily as she enveloped herself in the folds of her evening cloak  long after the hotel had been hushed with the final hush which follows a ball i lay awake thinking of mariposilla and the possible intentions of sidney sanderson time after time her beautiful passionate face appeared before me tortured one moment with wild halfcivilized jealousy the next transcendent with blissful trust in the man she loved  when i awoke from my unrefreshing slumbers at the usual time aroused by marjorie who had crawled into my bed i felt that i must invent a pretext for returning mariposilla as soon as possible to the care of her mother  the morning was dull a prophetic contrast to the glorious christmas dawn of the day before the rains had been threatening at intervals for several weeks but the sun had dissipated the clouds each day leaving always the impression of a pleasant trick arranged for the bewildered tourist who contrary to the example of natives and adopted californians lugged about persistently his mackintosh and umbrella declaring each cloudy morning that rain must certainly fall before night then suddenly the gray clouds seemed to melt into the liquid blue of the sky while against the sides of the purple mountains only one long streak of vapor rested like the shroud of a giant  the week before christmas the sky had smoothed away its every trace of rain light snows had sugared the feathery outlines of the distant peaks and the delighted tourist had hung up his mackintosh and umbrella deciding that the climates of southern france and italy were not to be considered with that of southern california now the clouds had returned reënforced the range had grown richer in color almost black except when the sun shot for a moment his presence in temporary triumph against a spur that glistened responsively while the cañons scowled in dark disapproval then all at once a gloom like a halfdropped curtain settled back of the foothills defying the prophecies of the most ancient mariner of the coast  as i awoke i felt with unusual depression the absence of the sun and when i drew aside my curtains i peered in vain for streaks of gold threading the horizon the morning was lifeless and gray even the great clusters of cactus the remains of the natural wall planted by the good padres years ago for protection against the indians seemed an invasion of gray spirits not so when the sun glanced their bristling tops for then they shone like knights in full armor  my heart went out in childish homesickness to the doña maria and the little nest i had prepared for myself in her simple spanish home while i dressed myself and marjorie i turned over and over the subject which had taken possession of my thoughts how could i escape the complications of this inopportune visit how could i without offending the sandersons and noticeably meddling with the discretion of the doña maria return quietly with mariposilla to the ranch  but the problem grew more difficult as the day advanced for mariposilla was now in a seventh heaven which surpassed entirely her expectations all at once she was the pet and sensation of the hotel mrs wilbur had conquered her pique of the previous evening and for reasons clear to herself she flattered and patronized the child with unlookedfor benevolence the gay young woman seemed to have recovered her lost temper for she urged sidney and mariposilla to waltz after breakfast volunteering with sweet unselfishness to furnish the music for the aimless crowd who had congregated in the ballroom later the tennis experts insisted on a few last sets before the rain and all sauntered in the direction of the courts pairing off as they went drawn by the flirtatious affinities of the moment  however tennis soon languished and the crowd returned to the sandersons sittingroom to beguile the rest of the morning with guitars and banjos mrs wilbur professed unbounded admiration for mariposillas performances and engaged to practice with her that same afternoon when the present audience had dispersed for beauty naps  we could soon play together wonderfully well she declared the woman had evidently decided that her best game was to patronize mrs sandersons guest if she intended to regain the attentions of sidney when the girl departed yet she loved to embitter the latent apprehensions of the poor child by constant reference to the face in the silver shrine i could see that although mariposilla carried herself with unusual composure there was beneath her stifling calm a lurking tempest of doubt and jealousy she seemed horribly fascinated by the unpleasant possibilities of the beautiful face that occupied so many conspicuous situations in the room she gazed again and again at the lovely aristocratic features which haunted her to despair once she locked them passionately in their silver case quickly turning to a pile of music she tried to hide her secret but mrs sanderson had observed her  looking at my beautiful gladys again she said drawing the blushing child to her side i hope you will know her some day for gladys would love you dearly she adores everything beautiful  the color deepened beneath the spanish girls cheek as sidneys mother continued to explain the tender relations existing between herself and the new york heiress  gladys is the daughter of a school friend who died when her little one was but six years old she is my godchild and i have watched the motherless child grow up thinking always of her loss the dear girl has many lovers but refuses them all she lives only for her father who is an invalid she will never marry i am afraid during his life i had hoped to bring them both to california but instead they have gone to a sanatorium about which gladys has grown quite wild the poor girl believes that her father is going to recover and has shut herself away from society and friends only to be disappointed the lady added with calculating sympathy  perhaps her father will live many years mariposilla said eagerly to the suspicious child no providential arrangement could be more satisfactory that the father of gladys might be spared to a green old age would now become a part of her prayers she would say that very evening a double number of aves to our dear lady she would supplicate her to keep the beautiful gladys with her father in the hospital for many years then perhapsshe told her poor foolish jealous little heartthen perhaps sidney would love only herself     chapter xvi   for a brief period in the afternoon the clouds of the morning promised to disperse the wind shifted from the rain quarter and the sun made a sickly attempt to shine  patches of yellow light tantalized the sulky sides of the mountains a presumptuous rainbow started to span the sky but parted in the middle and soon disappeared in the settled gloom which quickly followed  when the sun first tried to break through the clouds shortly after luncheon mrs sanderson proposed a walk  come she said i must have the air one can not house up in california even one day indoors stifles mariposilla has arranged to practice duets with mrs wilbur sid is obliged to go to los angeles marjorie is asleep our best plan is to walk down to the mission and back  we had gone but half way to the old church when we perceived that a rain storm was now indeed coming each moment the air grew colder the wind suddenly ceased to compromise with the south changing almost immediately into the east the mountains disappeared and soon the foothills were hidden beneath a smooth veil of mist several immense drops announced the gathering downpour  come said mrs sanderson let us make haste before we are drenched  we were both famous pedestrians yet before we had reached the hotel the rain was pelting our faces with stinging persistency we barely reached the veranda when the deluge came  those who have seen a california rainstorm watching for days perhaps weeks the baffled efforts of the clouds to wipe out the landscape will understand the term no word but deluge describes adequately the steady unremitting torrent which breaks at last from the sky  as we entered the house i felt like crying i was chilly and tired and had the feeling that i had been beaten even by nature there was now no excuse for returning to the ranch until after the rain i had foolishly pleaded the danger of exposing marjorie to the drive in case of a storm and now the rain had comecome to stay for several days perhaps for a week i could not consistently depart until the downpour had ceased  when i said early in the day to mrs sanderson that the weather had become so threatening that i would very much prefer taking the children home she silenced me by reminding me that mariposilla was visiting with the full consent of the doña maria  the child would be heartbroken to lose one day of her promised week as for yourself you need a change to wake you up it is absurd for one so young to refuse the natural enjoyments of youth and i think your determination not to dance a pretty but silly affectation california is not the place to mourn in the climate is opposed to dejection the natives go to funerals in the morning and chase with the hounds in the afternoon  dont i cried peremptorily dont make me believe that you mean what you say  all the same i do she replied i am a fatalist and while i am permitted to enjoy myself i shall avoid sackcloth and ashes  perceiving that i was hurt she endeavored to appease me  never mind little dignity she said smiling her rarest smile you are always preaching me silent sermons though you dont mean to scorn me i feel your principle in the air until i am wild to shock you in return  later we went for our walk each a little uncomfortable as each began to wonder why she had chosen the other for her friend  upon our return mrs sanderson had remained in the corridor in front of the open fire attempting to dry her dress i went above at once as i passed the familiar sittingroom i saw through the open door that the room was deserted mrs wilbur and mariposilla had evidently not made a success of the practicing without stopping i went to my own rooms where i found marjorie still asleep  pushing open a communicating door i saw mariposilla upon her bed her head was buried in the pillow while long choking sobs caught and held her breath she had been so happy but a short time before flattered and pleased because mrs wilbur had invited her to practice duets that i was surprised at her condition  tell me dear child i said gently what has happened  for several moments she refused to speak but after a time she grew more composed it was clear to me at once that mrs wilbur was responsible for the girls passionate grief  never mind my unhappiness dear señora she said at last touchingly i am a poor foolish girl and must weep when i am sad just as i rejoice when i am happy it is not so with the americansthey smile always even though they are miserable  i found it impossible to insist upon a confidence  yes dear i agreed as people grow wise and worldly they generally grow deceitful i dare not advise you to cultivate insincerity but for convenience you must endeavor to control your emotions you will after a time learn that it is often best to smile even though you feel sore often a heartache or a heart hunger will go away when we have bravely concealed it  indeed i have done so she cried fiercely rising from the bed she confronted me excitedly upon her sweet face still wet with tears there was an exultant expression mingled with tragic distress  she knew not that i was unhappy she thought only to make me wretched but i wept not until i was alone she sobbed triumphantly  poor little one how my heart ached for her how readily was she acquiring the miserable experience from which i would have saved her never again could she be the mariposilla she had been before this unfortunate visit  the flame was now lighted which threatened to consume her  come dear i said you must not mind mrs wilbur she is a vain foolish woman if she has hurt your feelings she has shown herself coarse and vulgar perhaps we had better order a close carriage and go back to the dear doña maria i continued jumping at the opportunity to escape from our difficult surroundings  no no she cried passionately let us not go away i will be foolish no more i will look no more into the silver shrine if only we may stay longer  it was impossible to repulse her confidence i could not then urge her to shield her love from the probabilities of disappointment i could not add to the anguish of her afternoon i shrank from assisting mrs wilbur in her cowardly attack at present i must wait a few days at most would restore the child to the care of her mother i would then know better what course to pursue  in my inmost heart i believed that sidney sanderson would be willing to marry the beautiful spanish girl but as yet i could not interpret his mother  i was beginning to feel more and more the womans artful depth but yet i did not really doubt her  mariposilla was now quite composed the thought of our return to the ranch had silenced her at once she bathed her face and dressed for dinner with the greatest care soon appearing as if nothing had occurred to disturb her  in defiance to the pelting rain an impromptu dance was arranged for the evening  after dinner the young people flew to their rooms to improvise fancy costumes for mrs sanderson had decided that the ball should be masqué  the lady showed at once great energy in arranging the costumes to be worn by mariposilla and sidney after considerable maneuvering she succeeded in converting her son into a splendid spanish cavalier she had upon her wall a superb trophy of a sombrero ornate with silver decorations which with other trifles and a red silk scarf properly arranged completed the gallant don of the past mariposilla in her actual character of sweet señorita was enveloped in a rich mantilla of black lace coquettishly caught upon the shoulders and to the hair with pink roses a short black satin petticoat displayed the pretty little feet encased in dainty slippers that shone with jeweled buckles the girls bare arms and hands glittered with the contents of mrs sandersons jewel box  we all confessed that we had never seen anyone more beautiful the theatrical yet natural character which she assumed had driven away every vestige of her depression never before had the child appeared so gay mrs wilburs most insinuating remark had now no sting the joyous present was enough she would not believe that the future might be full of tears  i remembered long afterwards how sidney sanderson had forgotten to look bored and how both he and mariposilla had neglected everyone in the room but each other like two happy children in their devotion  not once again while we remained in the hotel did i see a shadow upon mariposillas brow in vain did mrs wilbur endeavor to excite her jealousy the child was too happy to doubt each moment she grew more beautiful maturing almost as we watched her with the ripening influences of her strong first love     chapter xvii   the breath of easter was in the air it was hard even in that last penitential week to renounce the seductive wooings of those first april days in the little episcopal chapel or in the venerable mission we acknowledged each evening our infirmities but with all our abnegation there was for some of us an heterodox satisfaction in hastening away from our prayers  we wanted to exult rather than to bemoan our manifold sins and wickedness  we were not sufficiently impressed with our depravity to smell brimstone when the air was richly purified with the scent of orange blossoms and millions of newborn roses  doubtless our lenten orthodoxy would have developed more strongly in the cutting blast of a manitoba blizzard we would have felt more contrite drawn by the persuasive chastisements of a sweet spring cyclone but in such days as the ones which followed each other like glad birds in a flock it was difficult to assume a despondency adequate to the penitential demand  the gold of ophir rose and mariposilla were now blooming together the old house was bright outside and in with light and glory  from the veranda and the crest of the roof long sprays of dazzling bloom swept voluptuously to the sky in the blushing hearts of myriads of buds and blossoms the sun whispered each day his rapturous secrets  wonderful from its first hour of triumph until its last pale dilapidated petals have fallen to the grounda moral to its transient magnificencethis rose is tragic  it seems always the glorious prototype of mariposilla who ever stole its fickle lights and shades as i watched through those eventful weeks the marvelous unfolding of bud to flower and child to maiden i was never able to separate them in my thoughts their analogy was captivating  i have already said that i learned instinctively to watch for the girls mood in the complexion of the rose when the edges of its petals burned with fire i knew that mariposilla too glowed with hope and ecstasy when the fog smote sullenly the golden heart of the ophir i felt without looking that the girl too was pale tortured with jealousy and indefinite forebodings thus for me there will always remain the fancy that between this rose and the spanish child there existed a kinshipa subtile sympathy that each unconsciously felt when the other was near  looking back over those happy days they seem fraught with no ordinary conditions unconsciously all took part in the several acts of a realistic drama  i see now as i could not then see the innumerable cues the important byplay and scenic situations which eventually led up to an inevitable climax  as the weeks glided away i no longer doubted sidney sandersons love for mariposilla had there been a sign of opposition on the part of his mother i would have warned the doña maria but to the contrary mrs sanderson increased her affection daily for her pretty plaything often alluding to the girls beneficial influence upon her son  the scamp is head and ears in love she said one day just look at him i should die of rage and jealousy if i didnt adore his sweetheart myself she confided  mariposilla and sidney were at the far end of the veranda oblivious to all but each other  the woman then went as far as to intimate that a few years in a fashionable new york school would do all that was necessary for mariposilla  beauty such as hers would be ruined by rigorous education fortunately sid hates wise women imagine mariposilla developing the occult transitions of theosophy come here you pretty butterfly she cried sid is a greedy boy to keep you away so long go fetch the guitar i am just in the humor for music  thus the woman countenanced the wooing petting and enriching with gifts the happy child while she silenced my own doubts and those of the doña maria  that mrs sanderson was selfish worldly and at times mercenary i well knew however these very attributes led me to believe that she would gratify herself and her son i knew how thoroughly she would enjoy the absolute control of mariposilla how extravagantly she would equip her with the elegancies of life exulting that sidneys wife eclipsed always the beauty of other women  beauty she worshipped  it had never occurred to her that sidney might possibly marry a plain woman  if sid should marry a homely girl i should hate her she said one day is he not splendid she would ask when her son chanced to dwarf physically his associates  and sidneys exterior was admirable he dressed perfectly and there was about him the freshness of perpetual bathing to mariposilla he was the ideal type of masculine american elegance  she scorned each day in her secret soul the careless unconventional dress of the remaining spanish men of her acquaintance feasting her eyes with childish delight upon every detail of her lovers faultless attire  yet withal sidney was not a fop he was too blasé and at times too sullen to represent the gibbering class to which his immaculate and ultrafashionable clothes might have otherwise attached him but his unbounded reticence was his greatest protection while it gave him with some a reputation for depth many believed that although not brilliant in conversation he sympathized silently with culture and was shrewd in business affairs in truth sidney had never taken an active part in his mothers financial transactions but that her son was a dummy she carefully concealed there was a laudable spirit in the womans attitude her affectionate subserviency to her boy in the eyes of their friends was admirable  i had so often seen wealthy mothers humiliate and belittle their sons that although i believed mrs sanderson to be the business brains of the family i was glad that she abstained from flaunting the fact  i think i understood the elements of mrs sandersons character at that time quite well with one exception unfortunately i stopped too soon in my analysis i innocently took it for granted that she possessed a moral side to her worldly and perhaps frivolous nature here was my fatal mistake i did not understand that the woman would unflinchingly sacrifice any one for selfish momentary enjoyment  in all cases her own pleasure was suggested by the inclinations of her son to keep him contented and passably respectable she would have ruined her dearest friend  ethel walton was arranging an entertainment to take place shortly after easter the girl was an enthusiast everything that she did called for her hearts best efforts  her present schemes were charitable the episcopal church needed an organ and ethel had determined that the necessary money should be raised her artistic and really poetic nature had found an outlet in the existing emergencies of her church and she boldly originated a grand rose pageant each day she grew more enthusiastic over her prospects of success  all the youth and beauty of pasadena had been pressed into the carnival the operahouse had been generously donated by the owner while the papers each day keyed to the highest pitch the expectations of the public by promising the most ravishing display of beauty and flowers ever gathered upon the celebrated pacific coast  even the doña maria had been beguiled into loaning treasures from the sacred green chest but best of all she had generously consented to allow mariposilla to dance when ethel explained in her pretty way that everyone was taking part for the glory of pasadena if not for the church  will you believe it she said i have had scarcely any opposition my dances are all full and i have two magnificent marches composed of beauties whose scrupulous parents cant quite go the tripping but are delighted to allow their consciences a constitutional walk  the rehearsals were of course an interesting excuse to go to pasadena and each week we drove over with mariposilla at home she was continually practicing her steps and the clicking of castanets soon grew familiar she was alive with enthusiasm and expectation while her costume to be worn upon the eventful night became a matter for our united thoughts before it was at last satisfactorily designed  it was all that the doña maria could do to restrain her restless child through the long religious hours of good friday when they knelt together in the old church mariposilla listened not to the solemn prayers sternly her mother rebuked her inattention but the girls eyes were flooded with happy dreams and she forgot over and over again the crapedraped cross the pictures of the stern gloomy saints failed to frighten her into a state of contrition only to the virgin did she sometimes lift her wandering eyes to implore protection for the lover now absent from her side  when the sun rose gloriously upon the last day of the penitential season mariposillas spirits rose too nothing could restrain her  i am most tired of prayers she cried innocently joyous in her emancipation as we went together at the request of the doña maria for lilies  like a field of snow in the sunshine the tall pure flowers bloomed in symbolic beauty for the worlds glad festival our offering to the sweet mother and the holy child was a thousandand on easter day they would make glorious the old church  for years the doña maria had dressed the ancient mission for easter and for several seasons her daughter had also assisted now for the first time the girl plead excuses  she wanted to go to pasadena with sidney and mrs sanderson as there was to be a rehearsal of her dance in the afternoon and ethel had urged them to drive over early and lunch at crown hill  sadly the doña maria turned from the basket of white roses she had just gathered  what she exclaimed does my child refuse to honor the sweet mother and the holy child never before has she thought it other than joy to arrange the holy altar  forgive mariposilla dear doña maria i said let me assist this year and later when the work is completed i will drive the child myself to the rehearsal  to this arrangement the mother agreed and in consequence we had gone for the lilies early reaching the old church in advance of other workers  as we drove through the long shaded roads of san gabriel the waysides seemed lined with devotees everyone was going to some church with flowers wagonloads of lilies and roses were soon a common though not less beautiful spectacle loveliest of all were the little children hastening eagerly upon their sweet errand with arms almost hidden beneath fragrant burdens  we met one small child carrying in proud distinction a cross of violets another bore a crown of golden poppies smiling with the light of the foothills  when we approached the mission groups of mexican children many of them in their bare feet thronged about us with funny little offerings composed of flowers whose astonishing tones were often a mad blending of orange and deep pink  the near advent of the happy festival had awakened in these humble breasts and uncultivated natures a godgiven love for the beautiful each arrangement of flowers told a touching story in every bunch was hidden the angel of the child who gathered it  when we halted with our fresh burden father ramirez who was standing in the doorway of the ancient church hastened with courtly consideration to assist us the old priest commanded the staring children in spanish to carry the flowers into the church as he gallantly hitched our horse  once free from the wagon i found it impossible to resist the picturesque old stone stairway which leads from the ground to the choir above stealing a moment from my duties i ran up the rough timeworn steps and from a little overhanging balcony caught the morning vision of the valley stretching peacefully beyond  some time i must come here in the moonlight i said as i descended and entered the chilly old church surely i would learn sweet secrets which the sun each day effaces     chapter xviii   it had been an eventful day for ethel walton now but a brief half hour remained to determine the creditable success of the rose pageant  with a sandwich in her hand she had slipped into the rear passage leading to the door of mrs sandersons box  no i cant come in she replied to her friends entreaty to enter i want just one little peep at the audience while i eat my supper i must feel particularly inspired in this last dreadful moment and the house is grand she exclaimed triumphantly delightful to the ravished sense she hummed enveloping herself gleefully in the folds of a sheltering portière  what a relief after all these weeks sister has just come from the front where they are actually speculating on the tickets it sounds too good to be true i hear the distant strains of the new organ she cried dramatically if only we can postpone the murder of the calcium light man by our bloodthirsty professor tiptoe success is ours  she flew gaily from the box to attend to the last few arrangements that prefaced the overture  pasadenas handsome opera house had been possibly the supremest blessing of the great boom at the time it was built few doubted the absolute necessity of a rival city for the south of the state fortunately for beautiful pasadena the men with visions were ruthlessly awakened to find los angeles still the acknowledged commercial center of the valley in the meantime her aristocratic suburb had an opera house and a number of other delightful conveniences that might have been delayed in the absence of a boom  the audience assembled upon the night of the pageant indicated assured prosperity the sight was an opulent surprise for the uninstructed stranger not a vacant seat was visible the upper galleries were crowded to the wall many were standing in the aisles  from our box we rejoiced for ethel in the finished brilliancy of the scene  every one in the set is here but the prince of wales mrs sanderson remarked jestingly as she surveyed with honest astonishment the elaborate equipments of the evening  extending completely around the balcony across the proscenium and encircling both upper and lower boxes bloomed a variegated band of exquisite roses four feet in width  here and there the luxurious band turned from a knot of glorious duchesse into a stretch of maréchal neil which farther on caught hold of the vivid henrietta touching close the pure french rosecolor the simple unaffected la marque lay like a field of snow between voluptuous meadowsfor next beyond almost throbbing scintillating with every change of the lights shone the gold of ophir  in its distinctive beauty it seemed to steal from the wonderful galaxy of bloom the composite glory of all  last in the wonderful band the jacqueminot imparted its dark beauty also its rich odor of highborn culture that lingers in the petals long after their color has fled  although the general scheme of the pageant had been a secret it was soon understood that the roses used in the decoration of the auditorium were sympathetic representatives of those personified upon the stage  each dance was to be an idealization of a particular rose in the audience personal preferences were quite noticeable for favorite dances were boldly championed not only in corsage bunch and boutonnières but by superb bouquets of enormous size  it is doubtful if more beautiful floral decorations were ever seen viewed from the stage the dress circle and parquet appeared a huge garden of beauty the boxes fairy bowers twined with their representative roses  those attending almost without exception were in full evening dress  gay parties of visitors from the various hotels waited eagerly for the rise of the curtain satisfied that the decorations of the house justified great expectations for the performance anon were heard surprised confessions from the provincial easterner who had for the first time discovered the existence of a civilized west  mrs wilbur laughingly owned that her only opportunity for enjoying a peep at the notorious wild and woolly was one afternoon when she had gone into los angeles to a wild and woolly show from new york the show pretended to represent the common peculiarities of the west whereas she blushed to acknowledge it an embarrassing portrayal of eastern conceit and prejudices  mariposilla was to dance in the spanish dance she was to personify the gold of ophir rosetheir subtile charms would mingle at last  it is hardly necessary to relate that our box bloomed with her chosen rose that we ourselves heralded our devotion by wearing no rose but the gold of ophir  as the overture died away the curtain lifted upon a scene at once familiar with local beauty the time of year was supposed to be november and at the foot of the protecting sierra madre whose tops stretched away in the distance we beheld the old garden of las flores the gray haze of summer still hung about the peaks for the silver harlequin the son of the mighty rain god had not come  nature was inactive as yet unable to overcome the lethargy of her annual rest  in the garden sheltered by interlacing trees and tall palms upon a couch of verdure slept the goddess floraher pagan spirit now at last purified and free after weary wanderings in regions of ice and snow  close to the goddess slumbered the golden poppies who ring always the first sweet bells of spring the poppies were dainty children whose golden heads and gowns of yellow and green told instantly the story of the foothills the music which from the first had been soft and dreamy now suddenly grew harsh its poetry was gone for stealing into the peaceful garden came the ashy breath of the torrid desert  at last he had outwitted the silver harlequin the son of the mighty rain god and his diabolical joy was horrible to behold his agile movements were wonderful as he appeared to actually float through the air one moment he leered at the unconscious goddess the next he satirized in a demoniac dance the belated harlequin then unable to control his mad fury longer he summoned from his desert kingdom an army of cacti to despoil the beautiful valley at the head of this evil legion bristling with cruel needles and grotesquely formidable in its reality the breath of the desert took formal possession of the happy valley through excited gestures he commanded the cacti to take root in the fruitful land to spear the charming plants and choke the tender flowers while he breathed upon the sleeping flora his own fiery breath that she might never again gaze into the shining face of the silver harlequin or feel the touch of the gentle maiden spring  but his conquest is short for even as he exults the silver harlequin appears glittering and strong from the realms of the rain god  in his hand is the magic sword with which he fells to the ground the now powerless cacti then in majestic anger challenges to single combat the vile usurper  a moment the irreconcilable enemies pause and then ensues a deadly fight thrilling and uncertain as the passionate music leads it on again and again each combatant strives for mastery implacable hate flashes from their burning eyes as their merciless swords strike fiercer and fiercer now wilder grows the combat wilder speaks the music until at last the fatal plunge is made the magic sword of the rain gods son has triumphed at the feet of the glittering harlequin the breath of the desert falls  the music then sank into a low sweet whisper of melody while at the same instant the precious rain was heard the veil of mist ascended from the glad mother mountains and a glorious rainbow proclaimed the advent of the gentle maiden spring who came joyfully from the magic cañon in her train danced a company of wee fairy raindrops who deluged the valley gleefully with showers from their sparkling wands  spring held in her hand the magic fern stolen from the queen of the highest waterfall of the enchanted cañon with her glittering band she descended the mountain to do obeisance before the mighty harlequin then with the wonderful fern she awoke the golden poppies and the sleeping goddess  in the second scene nature is fully aroused and gracious flora smiles again the maiden spring pulsing with joy clad in a robe of palest green adorned with sprays of maidenhair from the far cool cañon the breath of almond blossoms in her golden locks dances before the harlequin the dance of spring gliding about the garden she tells her wonderful secret with poetic grace falling at last upon her knees before her shining master who commands her to bid the poppies ring once more the glad golden bells of spring  no words are spoken all is actionpoetry in motion intensified by music  as the drop fell on each of the scenes the house grew stormy with applause the air sweet with flying bouquets while the audience turned one to another to exclaim at what they had seen and to speculate upon what was yet to come  the curtain now rose upon the carnival of the foothills  the season had advanced to the latter part of february and from field and roadside trooped the wild flowers  in a succession of charming dances and marches children and young girls personified in artistic and sympathetic costumes the wealth of wild flowers which each year adorns the southern california spring first came the poppies ringing long chimes of golden bells to the music of their dainty yellow feet while close to them marched in bewildering phalanx the delicate lavender brodiæas the brodiæas were graceful maidens in æsthetic gowns overlaid with the effective flowers that trailed from a belt like green silk cords tipped with purple tassels their pilgrim hats were solid with purple bloom their long pilgrim staves a marvel of loveliness covered with ferns and nodding lavender flowers  next came the wild daisiesdear little girls in quaint creamy gowns sprinkled with yellow field flowers on their heads demure dutch caps produced the impression of careworn gretchens as they sat upon threelegged daisy stools knitting their stint of a daisy stocking last from the foothills came the babyblueeyeswee men in blue trundling small wheelbarrows overflowing with starry blue flowers  when each group of wild flowers had in turn completed the dance or march expressing its idealized part in the carnival they together formed into a triumphant tableau as the curtain fell stormed again with enthusiastic applause  but the event of the evening was yet to come the rose pageant was about to begin and mariposilla would soon dance  thus far there had been no delay in the performance no uncertainty no halt we rejoiced momentarily for those who had worked so tirelessly  the director of the orchestra a german intense and enthusiastic had worked hand in hand with ethel to interpret to the highest degree her poetic ideas the little mans delight was visibly manifest as the performance proceeded not once did the music halt not once did the intelligent leader fail to intensify the climax of the stage  when the drop rose for the grand pageant of the season a hush was upon the house  then murmurs escaped from all  how superb exclaimed mrs sanderson her handsome critical face softening with pleasure  it was now the season of easter the rapturous valley was in its glory high up in the mountains in a wooded cañon fringed with growing ferns beneath a canopy of roses we beheld the goddess the simple outlines of her classic robe defined her nobly her charming gracious bearing was beyond expression her serene beauty the theme of all  before her knelt the silver harlequin  with dignity the smiling flora commanded him to arise and produce the pageant of roses the glory of the year now in obedience to the harlequins magic sword the spirit of easter is felt in the land mission chimes smite suddenly the air the music deepens into a grand march while the bells strike time to its solemn measures then appears a wonderful procession moving slowly to the old church for from the farreaching ranchos of the valley have assembled strong youths and sweet señoritas the snowy robes of the neophytes are embellished with symbolic stoles of white roses in their hands they carry long fronds from the date palm that wave as they march to the victorious strains of the music the girls follow wonderfully beautiful in the everchanging lights that intensify their pure robes or color with violet and green and amber the long floating veils fastened to crowns of white roses pure roses deck their throats and glistening arms while in their hands they bear tall tapers in rose candlesticks like a beautiful vision they pass and repass the waving palms and shining tapers telling a sweet story of youthful devotion to a poetic religion then the music deepens the fickle lights intensify and the old bells ring sadly and solemnly the chimes of a picturesque and dead past  as the white roses drifted away the scene suddenly changed  in a blaze of light and music the silver harlequin now called before the goddess an array of dainty color and grace stepping the faultless measures of a court quadrille came the ladies of the duchesse rose clad in empire gowns of pink garlanded with pink roses wearing huge hats from under whose roseladen brims they glanced with coquettish charm they took all hearts by storm  next in the marvelous pageant came the yellow butterflies born in the hearts of the great maréchal neil one by one they flitted with bright yellow wings from the dark hidingplaces of the garden  the sixteen glancing creatures were blondes golden hair floated about their white shoulders and golden crowns sustained the jeweled antennæ which quivered while they danced maréchal neil roses clung to their gowns and smiled into their faces as they poised and wavered in the gorgeous everchanging lights  now from the distant orient were seen approaching dark beauties clad in the purest rose color they were borne by slaves of the sultan in sumptuous sedans covered with rich henrietta roses as the beauties left their flower chairs they posed gracefully before the goddess then sped away to perform a charming tamborine dance which fully realized the now exalted expectations of the audience  hardly had the roses of the orient vanished before the garden was again brilliant the sweet jacqueminots had come in dainty aprons big kerchiefs and colonial caps industriously the pretty maidens plied the rosetwined spinning wheels of their grandmothers until the imaginary stint was spun then abandoning their picturesque wheels they joined in an oldfashioned dance upon the green  when the colonial maids had passed from sight followed by rounds of patriotic applause mrs sanderson moved nearer to the front of the box  the señoritas have discharged their spiritual duties they are coming now to dance she said smiling as she eagerly scanned the side approaches of the stage  she had but ceased to speak when from secluded spanish gardens flourishing now only in the imagination of the aliens who destroyed them came the dark happy historic señoritas  emotional fickle passionaterare personifications of their typified rosethe matchless wonderful gold of ophir a hush of surprise for a moment pervaded the house then its enthusiasm burst forth when the sixteen señoritas began to weave and glance in the intricate measures of an old spanish dance  where whispered mrs wilbur did miss walton find these marvelous creatures and how did she create such costumes  the coloring is perfect mrs sanderson declared the fickle shading is all there showing in every detail see how the ophir buds nestle in the yellow lace mantillas the effect is thrilling  fast and daintily flew the thirtytwo golden feet brilliantly flashed the jewels on the white arms swung high at the bidding of castanets then the spirit of the music changed and the señoritas vanished into the shadow of the trees to return instantly with gorgeous hoops of ophir roses dancing again they formed at last on each side of the garden  from this living phalanx of bloom extending like twin sprays of the marvelous ophir sprang mariposilla  shaming not her prototype she stood before us the vision of all that we had anticipated  for a moment she hesitated trembling like an ophir bud in the breeze then her lovely tearful eyes sought for sidney for once in his life the man forgot himself for once honest emotion swayed him  leaning unconsciously from the box enamored forgetful of the audience spellbound he snatched from his coat the rose that mariposilla had given him pressing it to his lips he flung it at the feet of the trembling child  it was enough the dancers response told passionately without words what she never could have said  her form seemed suddenly enveloped in translucent light she was oblivious to everything but the rapturous moment  clad in the fatal satin skirt of the doña marias little dead sister about her throat the coveted necklace of opals and draping her beautiful head the filmy yellow wedding lace of her mother she danced as she never danced before she seemed a marvelous apparition freed from a haunted chamber of the alhambra with every step with every movement of the palpitating figure with every droop of the deepfringed eyelids and every fling of the glancing arms the ecstatic passion of her young life was manifest  unconsciously she imparted to the dance of her nation the tragic possibilities of her nature  forgetting all restraint all method she abandoned her liberated body to the emotions of her throbbing soul  long afterward all remembered how she had swayed the great house into irresistible tumult then suddenly had floated mysteriously away lost in the dazzling retreat of the señoritas  the pageant terminated with a superb tableau symbolizing the end of the prolific rose season  at easter and for a number of weeks after nature grows prodigal then comes a lull the roses have exhausted themselves the brilliant carnival is over and a number of weeks must now elapse before the vines and bushes gather strength to flower again  with an appropriate accordance to reality the closing tableau represented with poetic significance the return of spring accompanied by wild flowers and roses to the magic cañon  from the front of the garden the brilliant procession wound upward in tiers of harmonious color until far above in the mountains the silver harlequin and spring stood close to the entrance of the magic cañon from the heart of this enchanted spot all had issueda divine secret all were again returning to sleep until nature bid them once more arouse this last magnificent spectacle was glorified by strong rose lights while from above a silent rain of variegated rose petals fell like a soothing benediction  when the curtain was at last down the artistic and financial success of the pageant was the theme of the entire community  the profits of the matinée to be given the next afternoon would more than defray expenses and the proceeds of this victorious night would be safe  ethel and her able assistants were happy with excitement upon the now demoralized stage they were receiving congratulations from throngs of friends ethel stood like a delighted child between her father and the rector when mrs sanderson approached to utter the pretty things she always said so well  at her side stood mariposilla flushed and submissive to the womans bold caresses  our little butterfly is weary after her wonderful flight the lady said turning to the rector in her inimitable way bring the little ones cloak sidney she continued addressing her son who went at once to find a rich furlined garment belonging to his mother  there she said when the young man returned with the wrap and placed it solicitously about mariposilla the dear child will now be quite safe from a cold  the running hither and thither was at last decreasing the lights were growing dim and the performers were rapidly dispersing we ourselves were just leaving the stage when ethel flew to my side and claimed mariposilla for the night  she must come home with me she declared i want to take care of her for tomorrow it is perfect nonsense for her to drive to san gabriel when she must return at noon tomorrow i am determined to have my own way tonight she cried it is the duty of all to spoil me this once she declared when sidney interfered volunteering to bring mariposilla to the opera house in good season the next day  no sir said the girl with an oracular shake of her finger mariposilla belongs to me tonight you may control her movements after tomorrow  reluctantly the child yielded to the decision of ethel as she parted from her lover she unconsciously smiled up into his face a regretful goodnight that answered touchingly his own silent renunciation     chapter xix   ethel went early to the opera house the morning after the eventful night of the pageant the flowers would need freshening and the girl was determined that the matinée should give full satisfaction to those who had been denied the excitement of the opening night she knew that many delicate persons and children would attend in the afternoon there would also be critical ones who having failed to secure tickets in time for the evening performance would come to the matinée perhaps with ungenerous spirits for these reasons ethel desired that the decorations of the house and stage should both delight and astonish as they had done upon the previous evening  afterward the girl told how she had felt almost like weeping when she entered alone the dark chilly opera house  it seemed like a great tomb with its thousands of wilting roses she said until joined by others i was filled with a horrible depression i felt as if something miserable was about to happen the flowers really looked no worse than i had expected for the gorgeous band was still effective but its first perfect freshness was gone its roses were dying and i was alone at their death of course she continued i felt better when we covered the withered places with fresh roses but i was still restless and foolishly apprehensive  yet with all the girls uneasiness she had little time for indulging nervous presentiments there was much work to be done and the time was short even when the decorations had been satisfactorily freshened her unreliable performers would have to be looked after  one girl had left a candlestick which must be retrimmed another had forgotten to take home her hoop which had to be twined with fresh gold of ophir roses last of all she must collect and sort carefully all the necessary articles that would be called for by fair irresponsibles at the very last moment  when i joined her in the green room at one oclock she looked anything but dejected as she dabbed energetically the contents of a rouge pot onto the cheeks of a procession of maidens filing in turn before her  there go in peace and dance your best she cried flinging away the ruddy rag as the last of the file passed on to the artist who was doing the eyes  everything moves anxiously today the girl said pathetically while she rested a moment against the wall i suppose i am a simpleton but i feel as if the crack of doom were at hand mariposilla is late although i told them to send her at half past twelve and the harlequins wife has forgotten his cap she said almost hysterically as she turned from my side to answer a volley of unnecessary questions  where shall we go miss walton  miss walton cant i have some paint on my cheeks  please miss walton my slipper is untied  miss walton my sister has lost her hat  go directly onto the stage and stay in readiness for your positions the girl answered distractedly  come i said hoping to take her a moment out of herself come with me into one of the flies i have something to tell you  dear me she exclaimed what can have become of mariposilla  she is safe today i answered as we entered the fly she is safe today but what will become of her tomorrow the sandersons have gone  the sandersons gone the girl repeated in excitement where have they gone  they left today at noon for new york to enable sidney to marry if possible gladys carpenter her father has just died with his death the daughter inherits three millions  the words had but escaped my lips when a commotion in the adjoining fly betokened some catastrophe in a second we had pushed through a crowd of frightened girls to bend in horror over the prostrate form of mariposilla  she is dead cried ethel she heard what we said and our words have killed her  hush i whispered she has only fainted get water quickly  ethel flew at my bidding while i unfastened the little bodice that but a moment before had heaved so lightly with the pulsations of a happy heart dear little butterfly i thought how cruelly have your poor little wings been crushed  hot indignant tears rained from my eyes as i superstitiously unclasped the opal necklace once worn by the beautiful unfortunate lola  ethel had now returned with the water and the crowd still pressing about us was creating a panic  stand back i cried dont you see you are taking every breath of the air as i spoke the excited curious theatrical throng fell away  enveloped in her mothers wedding lace that in the fall had shrouded her with prophetic significance mariposilla lay like one dead unconscious of a miserable awakening as i bent beside her i almost dreaded to see the heavy fringes lift from the beautiful eyes that i feared would never shine again with their old happy light  dear child i whispered as i applied the water what can we do to mend your poor little broken heart  while i yet spoke the delicate eyelids began to quiver and a little hand to tremble a tired sigh and then a stifled sob burst from the lips  darling be brave you have only fainted i will take you home to the dear doña maria i said as naturally as i could  mariposilla lifted her great sorrowful eyes in mute entreaty then two heavy tears rolled to her cheeks imploring me to fulfill my promise i knew that it was best to take her home while she wished it  in her weakness she had not the strength to realize her sorrow she seemed almost to have forgotten the occasion of her shock for she closed her eyes at once and submitted almost unconsciously to her transportation to the carriage tenderly we placed her on the very cushions from which she had sprung but a few hours before radiant and expectant  would she not see sidney the cruel night and the long uneventful forenoon were at last over now she could dance again for her lover when it was all over she would ride away with him in the gay trap he would tell her once more how fondly he loved her tell her how beautiful she washow much more beautiful than the cold wise gladys then she would go again to the dear bright hotel for dinner she would sit by sidney he would watch her every desire and when dinner was ended they would go to the pretty sittingroom where she would look fearlessly into the silver shrine for never again would she be jealous and weep no no not when her lover had sworn that he loved not the cold beautiful gladys that he cared not for her riches or accomplishments then after a while all would go to the ballroom sidney would lead her to dance and mrs wilbur would be unhappy but sheshe mariposilla would be joyful  poor foolish little butterfly flitting eagerly from flower to flower drinking unconsciously deadly poison with honey how cruelly different from the sweet dreams of the morning would be the realities of the evening  while she ran gaily from the carriage at noon full of sweet innocent visions the ironic interpretation of her pitiful fate was even then decided for flying from rash promises flying from the distractions of her beauty flying from the tardy entreaties of consciencesidney sanderson and his mother had gone  with every intervening mile they were outstripping her ruined love were nearing the selfish goal of the mothers ambitions nearing the desolate gladys who bowed with grief and ignorant of all would take at the entreaty of her dead mothers friend the reluctant lover who could never make her happy  poor gladys poor mariposilla  even before i allowed myself to acknowledge the perfidy of the woman with whom i had been so intimately associated i began to understand her when early in the morning a groom from the hotel brought me a note asking me to drive over at once as they were to leave that day at noon for the east  duty compels us to go mrs sanderson wrote shamelessly  the word duty aroused at once my suspicions i felt with a creeping certainty that gladys carpenter was the womans prey i believed that some unexpected turn of fortune had revived mrs sandersons ambitions  i was sure that she had at one time relinquished all hope of obtaining the heiress for her son but i felt on my way to the hotel a sudden presentiment that on account of some unlookedfor occurrence she was going to new york to revive her abandoned schemes  i felt an uncomfortable stiffness as i entered the once familiar sittingroom now in a state of wild disorder  mrs sanderson was on her knees packing the last trunk upon the floor were piles of clothing and innumerable trifles which she had torn from the wall  dear child how good of you to come she said extending her hand with brazen determination it would have broken our hearts to have left without seeing you and dear mariposilla and pet marjorie and the good doña mariahow can we ever be reconciled to leave them  why is your departure compulsory i asked coldly  the woman perceived instantly that i understood her but her control was perfect her will was diabolical yet for a moment a gleam of anger darkened her eyes then she answered naturally  dear gladys has lost her father she is perfectly crushed and has wired us to come at once  i stood like a stone while she told again of the intimate relations that had always existed between the families  gladys is just like my own child she continued turning away her face with the pretense of forcing a protruding indian basket into the trunk we are so disappointed to miss the matinée she said with her face still in profile sid begged to stay until tomorrow just to see mariposilla dance but i persuaded him that it would be brutal to neglect gladys one moment longer than the necessary time for our miserable journey  before i could reply she had crossed the room to her son who was fumbling over a finished trunk  dont touch the things in the tray she cried nervously i never saw such a boy this morning he actually packed books on top of my best teagown  i knew that the insolence of the woman had cowed me she was sublime in her villainy  i stood helplessly rooted to the spot which i had first selected upon entering the room too weak to stand unsupported i leaned against the table my perverse silence must have astonished the woman but she talked on loquaciously appearing not to notice my lack of interest  how i despised her how hard she looked today when only the night before i had thought her charming and humane  doubtless she had slept but little since she left the box in the pasadena opera house in the strong morning light she looked old and strangely haggard dark circles defined more clearly the faint network of wrinkles beneath her eyes her whole countenance was drawn with the tension of her anxious night  her aristocratic nose seemed elongated with the avaricious thinness noticeable in grayhounds when the chase is at its height even the delicate shapely hands appeared parched and old  never again would i think of the woman as beautiful  i saw her now for the first time in her true deplorable character with but one object to accomplish her masterful selfishness had taken possession of her soul closing tightly its chamber she refused to hear the entreaties of the outraged voice that plead in vain for mrs sanderson retribution was the ghost of the cowardly repentance a science to be skillfully ignored  i could endure my thoughts no longer  good bye i said coldly as i walked mechanically to the door  as i spoke the woman raised herself with decision from the floor with outstretched hands she attempted a fraudulent embrace but i anticipated the movement in time to escape  no no i cried in childish tremolo you must not touch me i will not pretend that i am sorry that i will never see you again i will never forget what you have done now i will go away despising you to the unhappy child whose life you have ruined for selfish amusement and the idle entertainment of your son  at last i had spoken and at last she recoiled before me  without waiting to hear what she would attempt to say i fled like lot from the city of destruction but fatal curiosity i had not and i cared not how the sandersons writhed in the fire of my indignation  my only desire was to get out of the house and never see them again  as i left the hotel the groom in waiting advanced to drive me home  i will walk i said curtly spurning even this last attention from the woman i had left  later in pasadena when i heard the departing shriek of the overland with its echo flung fatefully back from the mountains as the train rounded a curve i knew that the sandersons had cut loose forever from the complications of their san gabriel episode  in justice to sidney i believe him to have been the better of two bad people i believe that in his sensual selfishness he would willingly have resigned his mothers ambitions in regard to a marriage with gladys carpenter glad to enjoy for a time at least the simple fascinations and marvelous beauty of mariposilla  the man was so perfectly carnal so easily bored by the least intellectual superiority in a woman that i believe he would have remained true to his own choice had it not been for his mothers threats and positive command to marry if possible the three millions at hand  i know that the thought of the classic highbred sorrowbowed gladys must have been a cold shock after his recent associations with mariposilla he must have remembered long how the spanish girl adored him openly with all her young heart perhaps even as he went away the man held in cowardly reserve the possibilities of a refusal from the heiress  i knew without being told that the conflict between the mother and son had been bitter the mother had conquered but sidney had managed to write a parting note to his abandoned sweetheart which the poor child unfortunately received his slender promises only delayed her final despair making it hopeless for those about her to arouse her pride or to graft in her trusting heart a proper disdain for the false lover  i afterwards read his cowardly note and saw clearly its import  now that mrs sanderson had at last wearied of her infatuation the proud highborn gladys with her millions would eclipse a dozen spanish beauties soon she would laugh and jest over the affair with her new york friends describing mariposilla delightfully while she enlarged upon the poor childs passion for her son  i have since wondered if the spanish girl would have been happy had fate consented to her choice i sometimes believe that eventually the restraints and requirements of the untried life would have wearied her i also believe that with a nature so true so simple and affectionate she would have done her best to excel in the eyes of those she loved in a responsive atmosphere her proud ambition would have fulfilled her will with the cold and critical she would have lost her subtile charm away from her mountains and unconventional life she might have learned sad lessons she could never have conned them alone without an aching heart for like her rose she would have grown pale and dejected away from the sunlight of love     chapter xx   in southern california that part of the year extending from the middle of november to the middle of may virtually represents to the stranger its season  the secret of the delightful summer tempered especially in the san gabriel valley and the vicinity of santa barbara by unfailing seabreezes would astonish the infidel tourist who has flown excitedly away stubbornly denouncing the summer as unbearable perhaps he has experienced two or three warm days in may that have played a trick on the tardy trade winds if so he comprehends perfectly from a few weeks sojourn the imminent danger of climatic cremation  he believes ignorantly that he has fled from the mid tropics when he mops the damp perspiration from his gigantic brainfront in the dizzy june of an interior town devoutly thanking the kind providence that has returned him to tuckersville he proceeds to write for the tuckersville sun full particulars relating to the climate and limited resources of southern california  still contrary to the slanders of the tuckersville man the weather with the exception of a few warm days in the early spring remains delightfully cool from the middle of april until the middle of august  september is possibly less agreeable for it is then that people are apt to believe themselves tired or warm and there is a general wishing for change  in the sweet quiet summer one wishes for nothing  refreshing breezes from the broad pacific extend inland for many miles and if occasional warm days come the coast is near by always inviting for a day those who do not care to stay long by the sea or cannot afford a protracted outing  for those who desire weeks of recreation and salt bathing the pacific coast offers every advantage on the irresistible santa catalina island at the pleasant hotels that dot the coast or in the poor mans sequestered cañon close to the sea there are opportunities of rest and enjoyment for all  to the resident of the san gabriel valley who truly loves its grand natural beauty enough to enjoy the free gifts of each day there is about the summer a neverending sense of peace and rest  the winter months are restless and rushingfull of social excitement and alive with indefatigable sightseers as long as the tourist is abroad in the land his presence is a perpetual challenge his disappointments are personally felt each day by his friends  it is unfortunate that much of the picturesque hospitality of earlier days should have given way to a more laborious and less charming mode of entertaining now the marthas of pretentious country houses and elegant villas are cumbered about much serving  i had fortunately escaped both convention and routine in my life with the doña maria del valle but i had been drawn by degrees into an experience that from the beginning was an anxious strain i was now almost ill i needed a change and the sea  yet i dared not desert mariposilla for i felt daily the burden of the part i had taken in establishing her intimacy with the sandersons i was determined to restore if possible her stolen happiness the child seemed now comparatively docile and less changed than i had feared i did not expect her to resist at once her first crushing disappointment but in a few weeks i expected to take her to the seashore when i hoped to surround her with new friends and new pleasures  time alone could help her and i was full of hope  i had now fully determined to educate mariposilla to fit her with the doña marias permission for intimate contact with the dangerous world  so infatuated i became with my plans that i again misunderstood the girl while i foolishly lost sight of her race inheritances  i thought she would revive after a time as an american girl would have revived i expected her to be restored with new beauties of mind and character  as the days went by and nothing unusual happened i told myself joyfully that experience was working the cure i believed that soon a womanly scorn would heal effectually the wound which sidney sanderson had inflicted  the girl had not grown less beautiful with her trouble there had come into her face after the first wild paroxysms of grief a look that i could not interpret i know now that it was the reflection of hope a hungry superstitious expectancy that tugged hourly at her heart  sidneys parting note had inspired in the ignorant girl the faith that he would return  she had grown very gentle she went regularly to mass and arranged flowers each day in front of the little spanish virgin one day i noticed that she had wreathed the picture in ivy and ever after the grotesque little mother displayed her finery subdued by the dark cool leaves  in the childs own room was carefully treasured every trifling relic of sidneys past devotion she had decked the whitewashed walls in imitation of ethel waltons æsthetic chamber with every small sweet souvenir of the winter the favors she had received at the eventful holiday cotillion surrounded the little lookingglass above her bed hung a cane and a castoff tennis cap of sidneys while tenderly hidden from sight except when she opened the drawer each day to weep were the innumerable trinkets and gifts that her false lover had given her  every empty candybox and every withered flower had been lovingly saved  she still wore about her throat the little necklace but the bracelet she concealed pitifully beneath her sleeve  each day she dressed with unusual care expecting always the return of her lover  one day a lover came not sidney for whom her poor heart pined but arturo her kinsman  there was no scene as we had feared for the doña maria had warned the young man to restrain for the present all signs of impatient passion  speak to her not of love she said sadly when she had confided to the burning indignant youth by her side the present state of mariposillas feelings the poor foolish child yet believes that the american will return she explained be patient dear son the doña maria besought when arturo chafed under his tedious restraint the american will soon marry the choice of his mother then will my poor deluded child lie crushed yet by the will of god she will revive  tell her not yet of love only of the success and riches which you have gained treat her gently as a sister and in time all may be as we desire  it was surprising how considerate the handsome hotheaded arturo remained restrained always by the quiet persuasions of the firm quiet doña maria  the boys unexpected return had been full of comfort to the lonely spanish woman she loved her grandnephew as a son while she rejoiced daily that the young man was growing more and more like her own lost arturo whose name he bore  as the summer wore away the doña maria grew content she believed that mariposilla would outgrow her sorrow that in time arturo would be successful in his suit and that she might yet live to hold in her arms the children of her dear onesdark rich little beauties who would preserve through yet another generation the inheritance of the spanish blood  how often did i weep when i thought of my child united not with one of her own race when i saw in my dreams grandchildrenpale little ones that i could not love i cared scarcely to live she said pathetically  with the exception of the doña marias mother who was now confined to her bed our household moved as usual  arturo took a masterful charge of the neglected ranch and as the summer advanced a gradual calm pervaded both the land and the family  through the middle of the day all enjoyed the refreshing siesta and by the early afternoon the ocean breeze was stirring delightfully great baskets of luscious fruits were picked daily and placed about the veranda in the grape arbor a table held always a pitcher of cool lemonade delightfully softened with fruit flavorings  the doña maria loved to prepare pleasant drinks and now that arturo had returned and father ramirez came more often to the ranch the good woman had frequent opportunities for serving her friends  she revived the pleasant spanish custom of gathering in the arbor for light refreshments each day she grew happier and more hopeful in regard to the future of her child  the old priest also believed that mariposilla would soon recover from her childish disappointment and be but too willing to accept for a husband the handsome arturo who had now a half interest in a large quicksilver mine in old mexico  during the quiet afternoons arturo took the greatest pains to explain to father ramirez his plans and ambitions in the old summer house the young man would spread out the map of mexico tracing eagerly the new railroads while he located enthusiastically his mine  there is no country like it the younger man would declare joyfully i am impatient every moment that i remain away  of course the american hounds are stealing in just as they stole into california their cursed gold ought to buy them paradise yet in mexico they can never be the aristocracy the gates and doors of the old families will always remain barred to the pale thieves who seek to enter  be not so angry with the strangers my son replied the old priest remember that gold and brains are both necessary in the development of any undeveloped country the americans have both love of race is noble but often it dwarfs the mind the cosmopolitan will ever succeed while the narrow and revengeful will generally fail but here comes the doña maria we will contend no more the old priest exclaimed joyfully as he clasped the hand of his dear old friend  arturo is a true son of spain he said gazing into the burning face of the youth he had always loved he is unlike his generation he should have lived earlier  i had heard without attempting to listen through my open window i often caught snatches of conversation that gave me a pleasant insight into the lives of these most interesting people the warm unrestrained affection and tender social relations existing between the old priest and his parishioners were things that i had not until now understood  i often heard in quiet half undertone the name of mariposilla sometimes arturo grew passionate in spite of his discretion then the old priest would reprove him gently for he was a born jesuit restraining all those about him with calm determination  peace my son always peace he would say time alone can do for us what haste could never accomplish soon the blow will descend for the false lover will marry the heiress the poor little one will be crushed for a time and then she will revive  remember through these hard weeks of waiting only your love let not anger or revenge fill your young heart keep that ever clean and pure ready for the treasure it shall some day hold  i will try to obey father the young man replied rebelliously it is easy for you to reprove he exclaimed you who have never known the misery of a hopeless love  a strange shadow flitted across the old priests face how knowest thou my son that i never battled with unrequited affection judge not that the old father is stone he was once even as thyself but god forbid that he should think of aught now but the world beyond and poor souls trying to find it  forgive me father the young man said tenderly i will be a good son and in return for my obedience you shall one day order the chimes of old san gabriel to ring for my wedding     chapter xxi   the announcement of the marriage of sidney sanderson to gladys carpenter reached us during the latter part of june  we were indebted to mrs wilbur for the new york papers in which we read the embellished details of the strictly private nuptials the several accounts agreed in pronouncing the marriage the most noteworthy matrimonial event of the early summer the facts in brief were as follows  the beautiful bride heiress to three millions although in deep mourning for her father had laid aside only for the wedding ceremony the somber robes of her recent bereavement at the close of the impressive yet simple service she had resumed her mourning preparatory to the departure for scotland on the historic isle sequestered in a romantic castle overlooking loch lomond mr and mrs sanderson would spend their honeymoon society had unanimously agreed that a match more suitable in every way had seldom occurred the high social position of both parties the beauty and fortune of the bride combined with the popular traits of the handsome groom pointed unmistakably to social leadership  the palatial home of the late rufus carpenter would doubtless become a recognized center when his beautiful daughter again rejoined with her chosen husband the charmed circle of the three hundred  this is the substance of what we knew all that we would ever certainly know of the two lives in question  for us the history of sidney sanderson was virtually closed i alone claimed the privilege of imagining his uneventful end  a creditable career he could never have a life of indolent luxury environed by the ordinary excitements of club life would be the probable limit of his achievements  his domestic life would in time become a monotonous restraint  in dismissing him i will always believe that he thought often during the years of his aimless existence of mariposilla her beautiful dark eyes flooded with adoring love must have haunted many of the indifferent hours spent with his highly refined philosophical wife  after the first cool understanding when both the man and the woman acknowledged the disappointment that each felt in the other their lives would run on quietly and indifferently each moved by separate interests that enormous wealth made possible  their elegant home i can readily picture artistic rooms undisturbed by little meddlers silent halls in which echoed no voices of children  dark shades often drawn close before the windows of a mansion deserted for months at a time by reason of the protracted absence of both mistress and master who seldom traveled in the same direction finding as the years made plainer the remoteness of their tastes and principles that antipodal distances alone could insure for each a comparative comfort  i learned from authority that mrs sanderson escaped old age  on the verge of the dreaded boundaries of infirmity her selfish energies gave way an unexpected puff of disappointment chilled her nerve while it extinguished midway in its socket the brilliant candle that had cheered no lonely heart had illuminated no sorrowing soul  for mariposilla alone the announcement of sidneys marriage contained crushing evidences of his final desertion the poor child had always believed that her lover would return we had never been able to convince her of the hopelessness of the dream  now that the blow had at last descended we hoped for much  through all the long weeks we had done nothing but wait even now we must wait still longer we dared not show impatience at the childs terrible grief when she remained as one stunned refusing day after day our sympathy and society  it was only in the cool of the evening that she left her room to join the family upon the veranda then she would slip away by herself hiding in the darkest corner among the vines a listless shadow in white that we dared neither to comfort nor to rebuke  the summer was now at its height the days were warmer and the cool nights more welcome the haze had thickened about the mountains the sky was often without a cloud  the seaside resorts were crowded with pleasureseekers only the industrious ones of the valley remained at home to attend to the immense fruit crops ripening every hour  the hotels and villas were undergoing repairs for the ensuing winter society in a body appeared to be rusticating at santa catalina  we too would have gone to the sea but sorrow held us down with a relentless grip the once happy household of the doña maria del valle was no longer the abode of peace and joy  each day mariposilla required more care for she was now really ill she went about the house and garden as usual but we had thus far failed to arouse her from her grief each day she grew more silent and suspicious shedding fewer tears but refusing always to listen to a word of reproach against the man who had deceived her  now in addition to the anxiety for her miserable child another stroke had fallen upon the doña maria  the angel of death had entered again her homeher aged mother was dying father ramirez had administered the holy sacrament and now only the most powerful opiates could relieve temporarily the aged sufferer sinking away from a horrible disease that for years had been unsuspected  to myself fell the incessant care of mariposilla  it was seldom now that the sadeyed doña maria left her mothers chamber she had procured a mexican woman to superintend the household while she devoted herself lovingly and unceasingly to the care of the sufferer day and night she watched alone until i feared she would drop under the strain  it was astonishing how tenaciously the aged woman lingered sometimes she would revive with almost supernatural strength stimulated by the opiates she would protest desperately against remaining in bed the poor old creature seemed to think that the bed alone was responsible for her death  in her less painful moments when the opiates soothed without stupefying she talked excitedly in spanish living always far back in the days of her prosperity  she was again on the farreaching rancho riding by the side of her husband or dispensing free hospitality to a house full of guests always with her were the two little daughters maria and lola  she remembers not the sorrows which have befallen us the doña maria would say with tearful eyes that each day grew larger as the rings of sorrow deepened beneath them she mercifully believes that my dear sister and i are still little ones at home  we are continually running from her side with messages for the maids  sometimes she commanded us to stop our play and go to the old church for prayers again she coaxes our father to buy more jewels that we may outshine in beauty our neighbors at the grand wedding soon to occur upon a distant rancho where there will be for days feasting and great joy  is it not kind dear señora that the old mother should depart among pleasant memories knowing not of my poor childs humiliation  as the doña maria spoke the glory of unselfishness lit for a moment with saintly beauty her dark worn face  yes dear friend i replied it is kind and sweet that the loved one can go to rest in peace but it is wrong for you to refuse relief from the heavy strain of the sickchamber oblige me this once by allowing your place to be filled you will be ill i am sure if you take neither air nor rest  thanks dear señora she replied i am happy for your thoughtful care but i can now no longer take rest away from my mother sometimes i fall for a few moments asleep by her side but i wish always to be near that i may watch tenderly until her spirit has flown  i should grieve sorely if another closed forever the dear eyes  i saw that the devoted daughter was happiest performing alone the last few duties that after death grow measurelessly sweet and said no more a few hours later the doña maria stood at my door quiet and tearless  dear señora she said my mother is dead  what can i do i cried daring not yet to presume with sympathy under the first cold shock of the impalpable mystery i longed for a task that would check the dreadful unsatisfied questions that thronged my mind  there is little to do arturo had gone for father ramirez  if only the señora will speak to my unhappy child i shall be most thankful tell her that her grandmother is no more but restrain her from coming for a time into the chamber of death  soon i shall have done all i shall then come for my child and lead her to the dear one  as the doña maria finished speaking she vanished from my side  as i heard her close the door of her mothers room i knew that she would first pray before the shrine of the little virgin  for a moment i listened in the silence almost longing myself to entreat comfort of the image  i remembered how i had fainted christmas morning and how gladly i had regained consciousness in the protecting presence of the little mother i knew that the doña maria would gain strength and courage before the shrine of her implicit faith and my own heart hungered for a touch of palpable comfort  what if the little image was only painted wood it whispered something to the simple aching heart that a stern theology could never say  alas i knew that for myself there was nothing but blind hope and fruitless speculation i could never have knelt before a picture or a shrine but i envied none the less the spanish woman who found peace and comfort while i so often suffered in the dark unsatisfied and rebellious  when at last i heard quiet steps i knew that the doña maria had arisen from her prayers i knew that in her sorrowing heart there was a blessed faith childlike and strong that would help her to perform quietly and correctly the last sad offices for her dead     chapter xxii   i sought in vain about the house and garden for mariposilla  the child had not been away from the ranch since the news of sidneys marriage and her sudden absence alarmed me  i remembered that it was saturday perhaps mariposilla had gone to the old church for confession arturo had the pony and for a moment i was in despair  fortunately a neighbor arrived with a horse and buggy which i borrowed  i was determined not to alarm the doña maria and drove away at once in the direction of the old mission the road for the first time seemed long and uninteresting the neighbors horse was an ancient nag who discovered at once my impatience and inexperience he absolutely refused to accelerate his midsummer dogtrot the persuasions of a stranger he ignored  despairing i submitted while i vaguely questioned myself as to what i should do in case mariposilla had not gone to the church  when at last i caught sight of the long gray outline hiding among cool green peppers my heart seemed to stand still  as i turned into the main approach leading to the mission the old bells broke suddenly the oppressive silence their melancholy strokes were for the dead perhaps for the doña marias mother i thought  mechanically i counted the tolls until their number had reached sixteen then the old bells paused a moment before they again repeated the years of the youthful dead  upon approaching nearer i perceived that a funeral procession had just left the church an assistant priest and a barefooted mexican altarboy stood framed in the arch of the ancient portal  the sad little procession was now entering the old graveyard at the rear of the mission i could hear the sobs of the mourners and my heart went out to the poor mother garbed in faded mourning bowed with both grief and labor  the little coffin was borne on a bier by six swarthy young mexicans possibly one of them the lover of the dead girl  the sight was pathetic and at this particular time i felt it to be more than i could bear  a moment later i peered into the old churchit was empty  where now could i go to whom should i apply for help  father ramirez was evidently not about a strange priest had followed the funeral procession and doubtless the old friend of the del valles had gone at once with arturo  i had probably missed passing them by taking a different road having endeavored to shorten the distance by a cut through a ranch  mechanically i climbed into the buggy believing that there was no course left but to return home for assistance when in the distance i saw almost like a sign from on high the deserted hotel of east san gabriel  without stopping to consider the probable absurdity of my surmise i started the old horse upon the maddest race of his life  in my excitement the wielding of the whip was a nervous joy  the old bones of the beast seemed almost to crack as he leaped along the road  all at once i seemed to be acting without reason for when i at last entered the grounds of the deserted caravansary there were no evidences to justify my suspicions  the summers silence was intense not a human being was visible and the desolation pervading the deserted resort was sickening as well as satisfying  i felt that i had been absurd to believe for a moment that mariposilla could have wished to reënter the place and i was also convinced that in her feeble condition she could never have walked the distance from the ranch  the old horse was now resting in front of the silent hotel and my very inaction was unbearable i racked my brain to the verge of despair before i again hit upon a possible explanation for mariposillas disappearance  why had i not thought of it before why had i taken it for granted that arturo had gone alone for father ramirez the priest drove always in his own conveyance and what could be more natural than to believe that arturo had induced mariposilla to accompany him upon his errand was it not reasonable to believe that the young people had laid aside their personal feelings at such a time desiring to perform together a last trifling duty to the dead grandmother  true to the comforting inspiration i had turned the reluctant horse to leave the grounds when rushing joyfully in front of the astonished brute i beheld the hounds mariposillas grayhounds who knew where their little mistress was hiding  hastily hitching the horse to the nearest tree i reconnoitered at once the long veranda each door that i tried was locked the windows were fastened and the inside blinds closed  close at my heels followed the dogs now wildly excited  as a last resort i decided to urge them to lead me  dear pachita dear pancho i cried patting encouragingly their long beautiful heads while i entreated their almost human eyes to reply take me to mariposilla  where is mariposilla i repeated slowly your dear little mistress mariposilla  for a moment the poor brutes whined piteously the next they had darted away to the rear of the hotel  i followed hotly and at the corner of the house i perceived them wild with excitement at the foot of the escape ladder leading from the ground to the upper veranda  i needed no more to convince me of the truth  mariposilla had ascended the ladder which the dogs had not been able to scale the halffrantic girl had sought to enter again the rooms once occupied by the sandersons  i delayed no longer in a moment i was above trying in vain the doors as i approached the window of sidneys now deserted bedroom i perceived instantly that its glass had been shattered and knew at once that mariposilla was within  for a moment i stood rooted with apprehension i dared not enter a horrible dread deprived me of strength until from within a piteous sobbing more musical more welcome than any sounds which i had ever before heard told me that the child i sought was safe  thank god i cried springing into the room  there upon sidneys deserted bed upon his pillow lay mariposilla  for a moment i shrank away for the child had not heard me enter i would willingly have allowed her the full extent of her strange unusual consolation now that she was safe i would have stayed with her the remainder of the afternoon but the thought of the doña maria compelled me to speak  dear child i said approaching the bed you must come home we are in great distress your grandmother has just died  just died she repeated touchingly why can i too not die indeed kind señora i am most tired of life i would gladly go with my grandmother  no dear i answered you must not want to die it is wrong for you to remain so miserable you should remember your dear mother and try to recover your spirits to be once more our good happy child  think no more of sidney dismiss now forever from your thoughts the selfish man who has deceived you  like a young tigress wounded into fury the girl sprang from the bed  i blame him not she cried passionately it is the wicked wicked gladys who has stolen his love i knew she would coax him from me when she sent so often her beautiful face to his mother  she loved him much i was sure but he said always that he loved her not in return that she made him most tired when he must listen to her learning and long words  that he loved none but mepoor little mariposilla who knew nothing but to love him only  yes dear i said you have loved as few ever love i pity the man who has thrown lightly away your warm true heart but i know that after a time you will cease to pine you will see that sidney gave you up not because miss carpenter was more beautiful or that he loved her more but because she had millions of dollars to make his life luxurious and idle  be a brave girl i continued noticing with pleasure that the child had brightened visibly at my words be good and brave for your own sake and for the sake of the dear doña maria  come home before you are missed or your mother will be greatly distressed by your absence  obediently she followed me from the room and down the ladder as we drove away from the grounds she threw her arms about my neck and sobbed pitifully  dear kind señora she cried i will be good indeed i will be good  if sidney loves gladys only for gold he will yet come back he will yet be mine  it was impossible for me to misunderstand the girls passionate meaning i trembled at the recollection of the opportunities and temptations of the winter for the first time a terrible realization of the childs spanish inheritances seized me i felt that she would never acknowledge moral barriers to be a final restraint to her denied destiny never be able to resist the undisciplined desires of her heart  for the present i could not hope to unfold the immoral or impossible consequences of sidney sandersons return nothing but time and angelic patience would enable me to make plain to the ignorant girl the arbitrary laws of fate     chapter xxiii   the sun had departed for the day the evening had flushed and died in the cool arms of night  in the chamber of death there was now the breathless calm which follows when all has been done  before the little virgin and about the spotless bed where in purest linen slept the mother of the doña maria holy candles had been lighted still unmolested stood the small stand covered with a fine drawn linen cover upon which had rested for weeks the tumblers and bottles needed now no longer  see the doña maria said tenderly see the spoon in the potion i had prepared but a moment before the poor suffering body found peace  when i offered to remove the medicines the devoted daughter was not willing  touch not the table yet kind señora she pleaded wait until the dear body has been taken away then will i find courage to disturb the tumblers that the dear hands once held  as the doña maria spoke mariposilla entered the room bearing a little cross of white roses she laid it timidly upon the breast of her grandmother then frightened and hysterical she fled from the bed  poor child said the doña maria she fears death greatly she thinks only of the fire that must at first purify the soul not of the joys of eternity  go now señora retire at once for the night you are weary and in need of rest  i care not for company i will remain alone with my mother and our blessed lady i desire to entreat that the sufferings of the dear one may be short  surely the dear lord will have mercy upon the aged one who has already endured so much upon earth  good doña maria i plead you will surely be ill if you kneel all night in prayer tomorrow will be a sad hard day and without rest you will be unfit for its strain  no señora she replied firmly i shall not be ill after midnight i shall sleep until then i shall pray  i saw that my persuasions were in vain and left her alone with her dead  as i passed through the livingroom to reach my own i was startled by a whiterobed figure in front of the virgins picture  the full july moon streaming through the open door discovered touchingly the hopeless misery of mariposilla she was in her nightgown gazing piteously into the illuminated face of the unsympathetic doll above the chimney shelf  as i approached her she turned sadly from the picture  in the moonlight i saw great tears shining in her eyes  she loves me not she is angry and smiles no more she said despairingly  the childs lovely face expressed so perfectly the agony of desertion that i felt powerless to comfort her her firm belief in the virgins displeasure had torn from her heart its last hope for weeks she believed that the little mother would have mercy would intercede for her and restore in some miraculous way her lover but tonight the virgin would not smile she refused to pity her sorrowful child  dear mariposilla i said remembering the tactics that i sometimes employed with marjorie you must not think because the virgin refuses to smile that she is angry  we ourselves cannot smile we are sad and awed by the presence of death and surely it would be heartless for our lady to smile when those who love and trust her are in trouble  you are nervous and weary you shall room with me tonight i have already prepared you a nice bed upon my couch  i drew her gently in the direction of my room persuaded that i had quieted for a time her moody fears  no no she cried bursting away from me i can not sleep i will never sleep again  she rushed passionately through the open door into the moonlight in her bare feet clad only in her flowing nightgown she stood like a spirit among the dark vines and lacy shadows of the old veranda  her hair fell about her shoulders like a tragic veil while a sudden agony touched her young white face  you know not what i have suffered she sobbed you think i shall forget but i never shall i can not bear that he should not be mine  if only he had gone away like my grandmother i could endure never to see him again he would then be mine all mine and i could go joyfully into a convent and pray always for his soul  her voice had grown tearless and sharp  from the corner of the house a tall dark form was approaching  come in quickly i whispered arturo is listening  she obeyed me now sinking wearily as we entered my room upon the waiting couch  i was devoutly thankful when i believed her to be sleeping  she had scarcely stirred for nearly an hour and i told myself wearily that i too might perhaps catch a little rest the day had been a perpetual strain i was not expecting or intending to sleep soundly but i felt a merciful relief in lying quietly by the side of marjorie  for the night at least mariposilla was safe i could only hope that the morrow would dawn more tranquilly than the trying day now at last over  after the funeral i intended to go immediately to catalina with marjorie and mariposilla i would wait no longer the heartbroken child must leave san gabriel at once  i was arranging my plans most carefully when i fell asleep from absolute exhaustion  when i awoke the moon was no longer casting fantastic shadows my white walls were no longer softened by elfin touches  the shadow vines and pepper branches had disappeared in the honest light of the july sun  the morning was yet deliciously cool but the day was fairly begun even now brimful of sweet odors and birdmusic  the mockers who had sung all night were not yet weary but less belligerent at night they sometimes quarreled but in the morning their little disagreements were adjusted  as i delayed to open my eyes half awake but unwilling to shock too soon the last lingering desire to doze i seemed to hear a familiar rebuke from the great pepper tree beyond my window  señora señora señora called an old mocker get up get up get up screamed his neighbor from the next limb  i fancied now as i listened that the birds had tried to awaken me in the night vaguely returned an ugly dream with the ceaseless call of the persistent birds  in a moment i remembered all the dead grandmother mariposilla the midnight cry of the mockersseñora señora señora  mariposilla  where was she when had she slipped away did the birds alone know  the couch was empty each pillow bore the mark of the childs weary head  in the night while i slept my restless captive had fled  i sprang across the hall to her room it was empty and the bed undisturbed trembling i entered the death chamber the doña maria was alone her child was not with her  the good woman was again before the shrine of the virgin repeating a last prayer for her dead preparatory to the painful duties of the morning  the front window shades were closely drawn to exclude the morning sun but looking north to the great quiet mountains an open window invited the cool breath of the day  without understanding my motives i took a hasty survey of the silent room to all appearances everything was as usual  a sheet had been drawn over the face of the dead and the holy candles were burning low and pale  mariposillas little cross of white roses was still fresh where the child had placed it the table of medicines undisturbed except the tumbler containing the unused opiate  horrible discovery  the poisonous glass was gone and the dark innocentlooking bottle that remained was empty  how could i grasp the frightful suspicion how believe that the virgin had forgotten her child how bear the burden of my own selfish slumbers  why in the night had i not understood the mockingbirds when they called in vain señora señora señora                                       a few moments later arturo bore in his arms from the arbor the lifeless body of mariposilla  from her beautiful face the color had faded forever  we laid her upon her own bed still robed in the little nightgown for the long sleep that had closed at last the wakeful eyes  poor foolish beautiful little butterfly her summer was now forever ended  as i performed for the dead girl the last few loving labors i acquitted her in my inmost heart of her terrible crime she had meant only to rest to forget for a time in sleep the anguish of her cruel disappointment  when from between the great century plants the yellow edges of their spears shining like avenging swords passed the hearsesthe black one bearing the aged spanish woman the white one bearing mariposillai remembered the tragic blooming of the gold of ophir rose  i saw again the old veranda illuminated with easter glory i saw timid buds open to full roses scintillating in the spring sunshine more lustrous than all i saw a childbud burst into a maiden flower i saw its petals deepen with the kisses of the sun then i saw them pale and fall to the ground for the sun had hidden his face  i saw the greathearted doña maria bending wearily as she attempted to gather the scattered petals i saw the dark arturo kneel beside her  together they seemed to pray but in the heart of the man was born a horrible curse for those two now far away  in my misery i saw the demon of selfishness blacker than night blacker than death  i tried to praybut i could only weep   the end
