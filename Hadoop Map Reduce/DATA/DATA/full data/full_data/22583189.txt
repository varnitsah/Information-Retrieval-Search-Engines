dozen of woodenlegged warriors     may haply fall in with old pierre   on the sunshiny bench of a tavern     he sits and he prates of old wars   and moistens his pipe of tobacco     with a drink that is named after mars    the beer makes his tongue run the quicker     and as long as his tap never fails   thus over his favorite liquor     old peter will tell his old tales   says he in my lifes ninety summers     strange changes and chances ive seen   so heres to all gentlemen drummers     that ever have thumpd on a skin    brought up in the art military     for four generations we are   my ancestors drummd for king harry     the huguenot lad of navarre   and as each man in life has his station     according as fortune may fix   while condé was waving the baton     my grandsire was trolling the sticks    ah those were the days for commanders     what glories my grandfather won   ere bigots and lackeys and panders     the fortunes of france had undone   in germany flanders and holland     what foeman resisted us then   no my grandsire was ever victorious     my grandsire and monsieur turenne    he died and our noble battalions     the jade fickle fortune forsook   and at blenheim in spite of our valiance     the victory lay with malbrook   the news it was brought to king louis     corbleu how his majesty swore   when he heard they had taken my grandsire     and twelve thousand gentlemen more    at namur ramillies and malplaquet     were we posted on plain or in trench   malbrook only need to attack it     and away from him scamperd we french   cheer up tis no use to be glum boys     tis written since fighting begun   that sometimes we fight and we conquer     and sometimes we fight and we run    to fight and to run was our fate     our fortune and fame had departed   and so perishd louis the great     old lonely and half brokenhearted   his coffin they pelted with mud     his body they tried to lay hands on   and so having buried king louis     they loyally served his greatgrandson    god save the beloved king louis     for so he was nicknamed by some   and now came my father to do his     kings orders and beat on the drum   my grandsire was dead but his bones     must have shaken im certain for joy   to hear daddy drumming the english     from the meadows of famed fontenoy    so well did he drum in that battle     that the enemy showd us their backs   corbleu it was pleasant to rattle     the sticks and to follow old saxe   we next had soubise as a leader     and as luck hath its changes and fits   at rossbach in spite of dads drumming     tis said we were beaten by fritz    and now daddy crossd the atlantic     to drum for montcalm and his men   morbleu but it makes a man frantic     to think we were beaten again   my daddy he crossd the wide ocean     my mother brought me on her neck   and we came in the year fiftyseven     to guard the good town of quebec    in the year fiftynine came the britons     full well i remember the day   they knocked at our gates for admittance     their vessels were moord in our bay   says our general drive me yon redcoats     away to the sea whence they come   so we marched against wolfe and his bulldogs     we marched at the sound of the drum    i think i can see my poor mammy     with me in her hand as she waits   and our regiment slowly retreating     pours back through the citadel gates   dear mammy she looks in their faces     and asks if her husband is come   he is lying all cold on the glacis     and will never more beat on the drum    come drink tis no use to be glum boys     he died like a soldier in glory   heres a glass to the health of all drumboys     and now ill commence my own story   once more did we cross the salt ocean     we came in the year eightyone   and the wrongs of my father the drummer     were avenged by the drummer his son    in chesapeake bay we were landed     in vain strove the british to pass   rochambeau our armies commanded    our ships they were led by de grasse   morbleu how i rattled the drumsticks     the day we marchd into yorktown   ten thousand of beefeating british     their weapons we caused to lay down    then homewards returning victorious     in peace to our country we came   and were thanked for our glorious actions     by louis sixteenth of the name   what drummer on earth could be prouder     than i while i drummd at versailles   to the lovely court ladies in powder     and lappets and long satintails    the princes that day passd before us     our countrymens glory and hope   monsieur who was learned in horace     dartois who could dance the tightrope   one night we kept guard for the queen     at her majestys operabox   while the king that majestical monarch     sat filing at home at his locks    yes i drummd for the fair antoinette     and so smiling she lookd and so tender   that our officers privates and drummers     all vowd they would die to defend her   but she cared not for us honest fellows     who fought and who bled in her wars   she sneerd at our gallant rochambeau     and turned lafayette out of doors    ventrebleu then i swore a great oath     no more to such tyrants to kneel   and so just to keep up my drumming     one day i drummd down the bastille   ho landlord a stoup of fresh wine     come comrades a bumper well try   and drink to the year eightynine     and the glorious fourth of july    then bravely our cannon it thunderd     as onwards our patriots bore   our enemies were but a hundred     and we twenty thousand or more   they carried the news to king louis     he heard it as calm as you please   and like a majestical monarch     kept filing his locks and his keys    we showd our republican courage     we stormd and we broke the great gate in   and we murderd the insolent governor     for daring to keep us awaiting   lambesc and his squadrons stood by     they never stirrd finger or thumb   the saucy aristocrats trembled     as they heard the republican drum    hurrah what a storm was abrewing     the day of our vengeance was come   through scenes of what carnage and ruin     did i beat on the patriot drum   lets drink to the famed tenth of august     at midnight i beat the tattoo   and woke up the pikemen of paris     to follow the bold barbaroux    with pikes and with shouts and with torches     marchd onwards our dusty battalions   and we girt the tall castle of louis     a million of tatterdemalions   we stormd the fair gardens where towerd     the walls of his heritage splendid   ah shame on him craven and coward     that had not the heart to defend it    with the crown of his sires on his head     his nobles and knights by his side   at the foot of his ancestors palace     twere easy methinks to have died   but no when we burst through his barriers     mid heaps of the dying and dead   in vain through the chambers we sought him     he had turnd like a craven and fled                                         you all know the place de la concorde     tis hard by the tuilerie wall   mid terraces fountains and statues     there rises an obelisk tall   there rises an obelisk tall     all garnishd and gilded the base is   tis surely the gayest of all     our beautiful citys gay places    around it are gardens and flowers     and the cities of france on their thrones   each crownd with his circlet of flowers     sits watching this biggest of stones   i love to go sit in the sun there     the flowers and fountains to see   and to think of the deeds that were done there     in the glorious year ninetythree    twas here stood the altar of freedom     and though neither marble nor gilding   was used in those days to adorn     our simple republican building   corbleu but the mere guillotine     cared little for splendor or show   so you gave her an axe and a beam     and a plank and a basket or so    awful and proud and erect     here sat our republican goddess   each morning her table we deckd     with dainty aristocrats bodies   the people each day flocked around     as she sat at her meat and her wine   twas always the use of our nation     to witness the sovereign dine    young virgins with fair golden tresses     old silverhaird prelates and priests   dukes marquises barons princesses     were splendidly served at her feasts   ventrebleu but we pamperd our ogress     with the best that our nation could bring   and dainty she grew in her progress     and called for the head of a king    she called for the blood of our king     and straight from his prison we drew him   and to her with shouting we led him     and took him and bound him and slew him   the monarchs of europe against me     have plotted a godless alliance   ill fling them the head of king louis     she said as my gage of defiance    i see him as now for a moment     away from his jailers he broke   and stood at the foot of the scaffold     and lingerd and fain would have spoke   hodrummer quick silence yon capet     says santerre with a beat of your drum   lustily then did i tap it     and the son of saint louis was dumb     part ii     the glorious days of september     saw many aristocrats fall   twas then that our pikes drunk the blood     in the beautiful breast of lamballe   pardi twas a beautiful lady     i seldom have looked on her like   and i drummd for a gallant procession     that marched with her head on a pike    lets show the pale head to the queen     we saidshell remember it well   she looked from the bars of her prison     and shriekd as she saw it and fell   we set up a shout at her screaming     we laughd at the fright she had shown   at the sight of the head of her minion     how shed tremble to part with her own    we had taken the head of king capet     we called for the blood of his wife   undaunted she came to the scaffold     and bared her fair neck to the knife   as she felt the foul fingers that touchd her     she shrunk but she deigned not to speak   she lookd with a royal disdain     and died with a blush on her cheek    twas thus that our country was saved     so told us the safety committee   but psha ive the heart of a soldier     all gentleness mercy and pity   i loathed to assist at such deeds     and my drum beat its loudest of tunes   as we offered to justice offended     the blood of the bloody tribunes    away with such foul recollections     no more of the axe and the block   i saw the last fight of the sections     as they fell neath our guns at saint rock   young bonaparte led us that day     when he sought the italian frontier   i followd my gallant young captain     i followd him many a long year    we came to an army in rags     our general was but a boy   when we first saw the austrian flags     flaunt proud in the fields of savoy   in the glorious year ninetysix     we marchd to the banks of the po   i carried my drum and my sticks     and we laid the proud austrian low    in triumph we enterd milan     we seized on the mantuan keys   the troops of the emperor ran     and the pope he tell down on his knees   pierres comrades here calld a fresh bottle     and clubbing together their wealth   they drank to the army of italy     and general bonapartes health    the drummer now bared his old breast     and showd us a plenty of scars   rude presents that fortune had made him     in fifty victorious wars   this came when i followd bold kleber     twas shot by a mameluke gun   and this from an austrian sabre     when the field of marengo was won    my forehead has many deep furrows     but this is the deepest of all   a brunswicker made it at jena     beside the fair river of saal   this cross twas the emperor gave it     god bless him it covers a blow   i had it at austerlitz fight     as i beat on my drum in the snow    twas thus that we conquerd and fought     but wherefore continue the story   theres never a baby in france     but has heard of our chief and our glory   but has heard of our chief and our fame    his sorrows and triumphs can tell   how bravely napoleon conquerd     how bravely and sadly he fell    it makes my old heart to beat higher     to think of the deeds that i saw   i followd bold ney through the fire     and charged at the side of murat   and so did old peter continue     his story of twenty brave years   his audience followd with comments     rude comments of curses and tears    he told how the prussians in vain     had died in defence of their land   his audience laughd at the story     and vowd that their captain was grand   he had fought the red english he said     in many a battle of spain   they cursed the red english and prayed     to meet them and fight them again    he told them how russia was lost     had winter not driven them back   and his company cursed the quick frost     and doubly they cursed the cossack   he told how the stranger arrived     they wept at the tale of disgrace   and they longd but for one battle more     the stain of their shame to efface    our country their hordes overrun     we fled to the fields of champagne   and fought them though twenty to one     and beat them again and again   our warrior was conquerd at last    they bade him his crown to resign   to fate and his country he yielded     the rights of himself and his line    he came and among us he stood     around him we pressd in a throng   we could not regard him for weeping     who had led us and loved us so long   i have led you for twenty long years     napoleon said ere he went   wherever was honor i found you     and with you my sons am content    though europe against me was armd     your chiefs and my people are true   i still might have struggled with fortune     and baffled all europe with you    but france would have sufferd the while     tis best that i suffer alone   i go to my place of exile     to write of the deeds we have done    be true to the king that they give you     we may not embrace ere we part   but general reach me your hand     and press me i pray to your heart    he called for our battle standard     one kiss to the eagle he gave   dear eagle he said may this kiss     long sound in the hearts of the brave   twas thus that napoleon left us     our people were weeping and mute   as he passd through the lines of his guard     and our drums beat the notes of salute                                           i lookd when the drumming was oer     i lookd but our hero was gone   we were destined to see him once more     when we fought on the mount of st john   the emperor rode through our files     twas june and a fair sunday morn   the lines of our warriors for miles     stretchd wide through the waterloo corn    in thousands we stood on the plain     the redcoats were crowning the height   go scatter yon english he said     well sup lads at brussels tonight   we answered his voice with a shout     our eagles were bright in the sun   our drums and our cannon spoke out     and the thundering battle begun    one charge to another succeeds     like waves that a hurricane bears   all day do our galloping steeds     dash fierce on the enemys squares   at noon we began the fell onset     we charged up the englishmans hill   and madly we charged it at sunset     his banners were floating there still    go to i will tell you no more     you know how the battle was lost   ho fetch me a beaker of wine     and comrades ill give you a toast   ill give you a curse on all traitors     who plotted our emperors ruin   and a curse on those redcoated english     whose bayonets helpd our undoing    a curse on those british assassins     who orderd the slaughter of ney   a curse on sir hudson who tortured     the life of our hero away   a curse on all russiansi hate them     on all prussian and austrian fry   and oh but i pray we may meet them     and fight them again ere i die    twas thus old peter did conclude     his chronicle with curses fit   he spoke the tale in accents rude    in ruder verse i copied it    perhaps the tale a moral bears     all tales in time to this must come   the story of two hundred years     writ on the parchment of a drum    what peter told with drum and stick     is endless theme for poets pen   is found in endless quartos thick     enormous books by learned men    and ever since historian writ     and ever since a bard could sing   doth each exalt with all his wit     the noble art of murdering    we love to read the glorious page     how bold achilles killd his foe   and turnus felld by trojans rage     went howling to the shades below    how godfrey led his redcross knights     how mad orlando slashd and slew   theres not a single bard that writes     but doth the glorious theme renew    and while in fashion picturesque     the poet rhymes of blood and blows   the grave historian at his desk     describes the same in classic prose    go read the works of reverend cox     youll duly see recorded there   the history of the selfsame knocks     here roughly sung by drummer pierre    of battles fierce and warriors big     he writes in phrases dull and slow   and waves his cauliflower wig     and shouts saint george for marlborow    take doctor southey from the shelf     an ll da peaceful man   good lord how doth he plume himself     because we beat the corsican    from first to last his page is filled     with stirring tales how blows were struck   he shows how we the frenchmen killd     and praises god for our good luck    some hints tis true of politics     the doctors give and statesmans art   pierre only bangs his drum and sticks     and understands the bloody part    he cares not what the cause may be     he is not nice for wrong and right   but show him wheres the enemy     he only asks to drum and fight    they bid him fightperhaps he wins     and when he tells the story oer   the honest savage brags and grins     and only longs to fight once more    but luck may change and valor fail     our drummer peter meet reverse   and with a moral points his tale     the end of all such talesa curse    last year my love it was my hap     behind a grenadier to be   and but he wore a hairy cap    no taller man methinks than me    prince albert and the queen god wot     be blessings on the glorious pair   before us passed i saw them not     i only saw a cap of hair    your orthodox historian puts     in foremost rank the soldier thus   the redcoat bully in his boots     that hides the march of men from us    he puts him there in foremost rank     you wonder at his cap of hair   you hear his sabres cursed clank     his spurs are jingling everywhere    go to i hate him and his trade     who bade us so to cringe and bend   and all gods peaceful people made     to such as him subservient    tell me what find we to admire     in epaulets and scarlet coats   in men because they load and fire     and know the art of cutting throats                                          ah gentle tender lady mine     the winter wind blows cold and shrill   come fill me one more glass of wine     and give the silly fools their will    and what care we for war and wrack     how kings and heroes rise and fall   look yonder in his coffin black     there lies the greatest of them all    to pluck him down and keep him up     died many million human souls   tis twelve oclock and time to sup     bid mary heap the fire with coals    he captured many thousand guns     he wrote the great before his name   and dying only left his sons     the recollection of his shame    though more than half the world was his     he died without a rood his own   and borrowed from his enemies     six foot of ground to lie upon    he fought a thousand glorious wars     and more than half the world was his   and somewhere now in yonder stars     can tell mayhap what greatness is    1841     this ballad was written at paris at the time of the second   funeral of napoleon     abdelkader at toulon    or the caged hawk     no more thou lithe and longwinged hawk of desertlife for thee   no more across the sultry sands shalt thou go swooping free   blunt idle talons idle beak with spurning of thy chain   shatter against thy cage the wing thou neer mayst spread again    long sitting by their watchfires shall the kabyles tell the tale   of thy dash from ben halifa on the fat metidja vale   how thou sweptst the desert over bearing down the wild el riff   from eastern beni salah to western ouad shelif    how thy white burnous welit streaming like the stormrack oer the sea   when thou rodest in the vanward of the moorish chivalry   how thy razzia was a whirlwind thy onset a simoom   how thy swordsweep was the lightning dealing death from out the gloom    nor less quick to slay in battle than in peace to spare and save   of brave men wisest councillor of wise councillors most brave   how the eye that flashed destruction could beam gentleness and love   how lion in thee mated lamb how eagle mated dove    availéd not or steel or shot gainst that charmed life secure   till cunning france in last resource tossed up the golden lure   and the carrion buzzards round him stooped faithless to the cast   and the wild hawk of the desert is caught and caged at last    weep maidens of zerifah above the laden loom   scar chieftains of al elmah your cheeks in grief and gloom   sons of the beni snazam throw down the useless lance   and stoop your necks and bare your backs to yoke and scourge of france    twas not in fight they bore him down he never cried amàn   he never sank his sword before the prince of franghistan   but with traitors all around him his star upon the wane   he heard the voice of allah and he would not strive in vain    they gave him what he asked them from king to king he spake   as one that plighted word and seal not knoweth how to break   let me pass from out my deserts bet mine own choice where to go   i brook no fettered life to live a captive and a show    and they promised and he trusted them and proud and calm he came   upon his black mare riding girt with his sword of fame   good steed good sword he rendered both unto the frankish throng   he knew them false and ficklebut a princes word is strong    how have they kept their promise  turned they the vessels prow   unto acre alexandria as they have sworn een now   not so from oran northwards the white sails gleam and glance   and the wild hawk of the desert is borne away to france    where toulons whitewalled lazaret looks southward oer the wave   sits he that trusted in the word a son of

littlego and greatgo     he creditably passd   and made his years allowance     for eighteen months to last    he never owed a shilling     went never drunk to bed   he has not two ideas     within his honest head   in all respects he differs     from my second son prince ned    when tom has half his income     laid by at the years end   poor ned has neer a stiver     that rightly he may spend   but sponges on a tradesman     or borrows from a friend    while tom his legal studies     most soberly pursues   poor ned most pass his mornings     adawdling with the muse   while tom frequents his banker     young ned frequents the jews    ned drives about in buggies     tom sometimes takes a bus   ah cruel fate why made you     my children differ thus   why make of tom a dullard     and ned a genius    youll cut him with a shilling     exclaimed the man of wits   ill leave my wealth said brentford     sir lawyer as befits   and portion both their fortunes     unto their several wits    your grace knows best the lawyer said     on your commands i wait   be silent sir says brentford     a plague upon your prate   come take your pen and paper     and write as i dictate    the will as brentford spoke it     was writ and signed and closed   he bade the lawyer leave him     and turnd him round and dozed   and next week in the churchyard     the good old king reposed    tom dressed in crape and hatband     of mourners was the chief   in bitter selfupbraidings     poor edward showed his grief   tom hid his fat white countenance     in his pockethandkerchief    neds eyes were full of weeping     he falterd in his walk   tom never shed a tear     but onwards he did stalk   as pompous black and solemn     as any catafalque    and when the bones of brentford     that gentle king and just   with bell and book and candle     were duly laid in dust   now gentleman says thomas     let business be discussed    when late our sire beloved     was taken deadly ill   sir lawyer you attended him     i mean to tax your bill   and as you signed and wrote it     i prithee read the will    the lawyer wiped his spectacles     and drew the parchment out   and all the brentford family     sat eager round about   poor ned was somewhat anxious     but tom had neer a doubt    my son as i make ready     to seek my last long home   some cares i had for neddy     but none for thee my tom   sobriety and order     you neer departed from    ned hath a brilliant genius     and thou a plodding brain   on thee i think with pleasure     on him with doubt and pain   you see good ned says thomas     what he thought about us twain    though small was your allowance     you saved a little store   and those who save a little     shall get a plenty more   as the lawyer read this compliment     toms eyes were running oer    the tortoise and the hare tom     set out at each his pace   the hare it was the fleeter     the tortoise won the race   and since the worlds beginning     this ever was the case    neds genius blithe and singing     steps gayly oer the ground   as steadily you trudge it     he clears it with a bound   but dulness has stout legs tom     and wind thats wondrous sound    oer fruits and flowers alike tom     you pass with plodding feet   you heed not one nor tother     but onwards go your beat   while genius stops to loiter     with all that he may meet    and ever as he wanders     will have a pretext fine   for sleeping in the morning     or loitering to dine   or dozing in the shade     or basking in the shine    your little steady eyes tom     though not so bright as those   that restless round about him     his flashing genius throws   are excellently suited     to look before your nose    thank heaven then for the blinkers     it placed before your eyes   the stupidest are weakest     the witty are not wise   oh bless your good stupidity     it is your dearest prize    and though my lands are wide     and plenty is my gold   still better gifts from nature     my thomas do you hold   a brain thats thick and heavy     a heart thats dull and cold    too dull to feel depression     too hard to heed distress   too cold to yield to passion     or silly tenderness   march onyour road is open     to wealth tom and success    ned sinneth in extravagance     and you in greedy lust   i faith says ned our father     is less polite than just   in you son tom ive confidence     but ned i cannot trust    wherefore my lease and copyholds     my lands and tenements   my parks my farms and orchards     my houses and my rents   my dutch stock and my spanish stock     my five and three per cents    i leave to you my thomas     what all poor edward said   well well i should have spent them     and toms a prudent head   i leave to you my thomas     to you in trust for ned    the wrath and consternation     what poet eer could trace   that at this fatal passage     came oer prince tom his face   the wonder of the company     and honest neds amaze    tis surely some mistake     goodnaturedly cries ned   the lawyer answered gravely     tis even as i said   twas thus his gracious majesty     ordaind on his deathbed    see here the will is witnessd     and heres his autograph   in truth our fathers writing     says edward with a laugh   but thou shalt not be a loser tom     well share it half and half    alas my kind young gentleman     this sharing cannot be   tis written in the testament     that brentford spoke to me   i do forbid prince ned to give     prince tom a halfpenny    he hath a store of money     but neer was known to lend it   he never helpd his brother     the poor he neer befriended   he hath no need of property     who knows not how to spend it    poor edward knows but how to spend     and thrifty tom to hoard   let thomas be the steward then     and edward be the lord   and as the honest laborer     is worthy his reward    i pray prince ned my second son     and my successor dear   to pay to his intendant     five hundred pounds a year   and to think of his old father     and live and make good cheer    such was old brentfords honest testament     he did devise his moneys for the best     and lies in brentford church in peaceful rest   prince edward lived and money made and spent     but his good sire was wrong it is confessd   to say his son young thomas never lent     he did  young thomas lent at interest   and nobly took his twentyfive per cent    long time the famous reign of ned endured     oer chiswick fulham brentford putney kew   but of extravagance he neer was cured     and when both died as mortal men will do   twas commonly reported that the steward   was very much the richer of the two     the white squall     on deck beneath the awning   i dozing lay and yawning   it was the gray of dawning     ere yet the sun arose   and above the funnels roaring   and the fitful winds deploring   i heard the cabin snoring     with universal nose   i could hear the passengers snorting   i envied their disporting   vainly i was courting     the pleasure of a doze    so i lay and wondered why light   came not and watched the twilight   and the glimmer of the skylight     that shot across the deck   and the binnacle pale and steady   and the dull glimpse of the deadeye   and the sparks in fiery eddy     that whirled from the chimney neck   in our jovial floating prison   there was sleep from fore to mizzen   and never a star had risen     the hazy sky to speck    strange company we harbored   wed a hundred jews to larboard   unwashed uncombed unbarbered     jews black and brown and gray   with terror it would seize ye   and make your souls uneasy   to see those rabbis greasy     who did naught but scratch and pray   their dirty children puking   their dirty saucepans cooking   their dirty fingers hooking     their swarming fleas away    to starboard turks and greeks were   whiskered and brown their cheeks were   enormous wide their breeks were     their pipes did puff alway   each on his mat allotted   in silence smoked and squatted   whilst round their children trotted     in pretty pleasant play   he cant but smile who traces   the smiles on those brown faces   and the pretty prattling graces     of those small heathens gay    and so the hours kept tolling   and through the ocean rolling   went the brave iberia bowling     before the break of day    when a squall upon a sudden   came oer the waters scudding   and the clouds began to gather   and the sea was lashed to lather   and the lowering thunder grumbled   and the lightning jumped and tumbled   and the ship and all the ocean   woke up in wild commotion   then the wind set up a howling   and the poodle dog a yowling   and the cocks began a crowing   and the old cow raised a lowing   as she heard the tempest blowing   and fowls and geese did cackle   and the cordage and the tackle   began to shriek and crackle   and the spray dashed oer the funnels   and down the deck in runnels   and the rushing water soaks all   from the seamen in the foksal   to the stokers whose black faces   peer out of their bedplaces   and the captain he was bawling   and the sailors pulling hauling   and the quarterdeck tarpauling   was shivered in the squalling   and the passengers awaken   most pitifully shaken   and the steward jumps up and hastens   for the necessary basins    then the greeks they groaned and quivered   and they knelt and moaned and shivered   as the plunging waters met them   and splashed and overset them   and they call in their emergence   upon countless saints and virgins   and their marrowbones are bended   and they think the world is ended    and the turkish women forard   were frightened and behorrord   and shrieking and bewildering   the mothers clutched their children   the men sung allah illah   mashallah bismillah   as the warring waters doused them   and splashed them and soused them   and they called upon the prophet   and thought but little of it    then all the fleas in jewry   jumped up and bit like fury   and the progeny of jacob   did on the maindeck wake up   i wot those greasy rabbins   would never pay for cabins   and each man moaned and jabbered in   his filthy jewish gaberdine   in woe and lamentation   and howling consternation   and the splashing water drenches   their dirty brats and wenches   and they crawl from bales and benches   in a hundred thousand stenches    this was the white squall famous   which latterly oercame us   and which all will well remember   on the 28th september   when a prussian captain of lancers   those tightlaced whiskered prancers   came on the deck astonished   by that wild squall admonished   and wondering cried potztausend   wie ist der stürm jetzt brausend   and looked at captain lewis   who calmly stood and blew his   cigar in all the hustle   and scorned the tempests tussle   and oft weve thought thereafter   how he beat the storm to laughter   for well he knew his vessel   with that vain wind could wrestle   and when a wreck we thought her   and doomed ourselves to slaughter   how gayly he fought her   and through the hubbub brought her   and as the tempest caught her   cried george some brandyandwater    and when its force expended   the harmless storm was ended   and as the sunrise splendid     came blushing oer the sea   i thought as day was breaking   my little girls were waking   and smiling and making     a prayer at home for me    1844     peg of limavaddy     riding from coleraine     famed for lovely kitty   came a cockney bound     unto derry city

at the bars   and a ragged old jacket perfumed with cigars   away from the world and its toils and its cares   ive a snug little kingdom up four pair of stairs    to mount to this realm is a toil to be sure   but the fire there is bright and the air rather pure   and the view i behold on a sunshiny day   is grand through the chimneypots over the way    this snug little chamber is crammd in all nooks   with worthless old knickknacks and silly old books   and foolish old odds and foolish old ends   crackd bargains from brokers cheap keepsakes from friends    old armor prints pictures pipes china all crackd   old rickety tables and chairs brokenbacked   a twopenny treasury wondrous to see   what matter tis pleasant to you friend and me    no better divan need the sultan require   than the creaking old sofa that basks by the fire   and tis wonderful surely what music you get   from the rickety ramshackle wheezy spinet    that prayingrug came from a turcomans camp   by tiber once twinkled that brazen old lamp   a mameluke fierce yonder dagger has drawn   tis a murderous knife to toast muffins upon    long long through the hours and the night and the chimes   here we talk of old books and old friends and old times   as we sit in a fog made of rich latakie   this chamber is pleasant to you friend and me    but of all the cheap treasures that garnish my nest   theres one that i love and i cherish the best   for the finest of couches thats padded with hair   i never would change thee my canebottomd chair    tis a bandyleggd highshoulderd wormeaten seat   with a creaking old back and twisted old feet   but since the fair morning when fanny sat there   i bless thee and love thee old canebottomd chair    if chairs have but feeling in holding such charms   a thrill must have passd through your witherd old arms   i lookd and i longd and i wishd in despair   i wishd myself turnd to a canebottomd chair    it was but a moment she sat in this place   shed a scarf on her neck and a smile on her face   a smile on her face and a rose in her hair   and she sat there and bloomd in my canebottomd chair    and so i have valued my chair ever since   like the shrine of a saint or the throne of a prince   saint fanny my patroness sweet i declare   the queen of my heart and my canebottomd chair    when the candles burn low and the companys gone   in the silence of night as i sit here alone   i sit here alone but we yet are a pair   my fanny i see in my canebottomd chair    she comes from the past and revisits my room   she looks as she then did all

  i     the poet describes the city and spelling of kiow kioff or kiova    a thousand years ago or more     a city filled with burghers stout     and girt with ramparts round about   stood on the rocky dnieper shore   in armor bright by day and night     the sentries they paced to and fro   well guarded and walled was this town and called     by different names id have you to know   for if you looks in the gography books   in those dictionaries the name it varies   and they write it off kieff or kioff kiova or kiow     ii     its buildings public works and ordinances religious and civil    thus guarded without by wall and redoubt     kiova within was a place of renown   with more advantages than in those dark ages     were commonly known to belong to a town   there were places and squares and each year four fairs   and regular aldermen and regular lordmayors   and streets and alleys and a bishops palace   and a church with clocks for the orthodox   with clocks and with spires as religion desires   and beadles to whip the bad little boys   over their poor little corduroys   in servicetime when they didnt make a noise   and a chapter and dean and a cathedralgreen   with ancient trees underneath whose shades   wandered nice young nurserymaids    the poet shows how a certain priest dwelt at kioff a godly   clergyman and one that preached rare good sermons    dingdong dingdong dingdingaringding   the bells they made a merry merry ring   from the tall tall steeple and all the people   except the jews came and filled the pews     poles russians and germans     to hear the sermons   which hyacinth preached godly to those germans and poles     for the safety of their souls     iii     how this priest was short and fat of body    a worthy priest he was and a stout     youve seldom looked on such a one   for though he fasted thrice in a week   yet nevertheless his skin was sleek   his waist it spanned two yards about     and he weighed a score of stone     iv     and like unto the author of plymleys letters    a worthy priest for fasting and prayer     and mortification most deserving   and as for preaching beyond compare   hed exert his powers for three or four hours   with greater pith than sydney smith     or the reverend edward irving     v     of what convent he was prior and when the convent was built    he was the prior of saint sophia   a cockney rhyme but no better i know   of st sophia that church in kiow     built by missionaries i cant tell when   who by their discussions converted the russians     and made them christian men     vi     of saint sophia of kioff and how her statue miraculously   travelled thither    sainted sophia so the legend vows   with special favor did regard this house     and to uphold her converts new devotion   her statue needing but her legs for her ship     walks of itself across the german ocean       and of a sudden perches       in this the best of churches   whither all kiovites come and pay it grateful worship     vii     and how kioff should have been a happy city but that    thus with her patronsaints and pious preachers     recorded here in catalogue precise   a goodly city worthy magistrates   you would have thought in all the russian states   the citizens the happiest of all creatures     the town itself a perfect paradise     viii     certain wicked cossacks did besiege it    no alas this wellbuilt city     was in a perpetual fidget   for the tartars without pity     did remorselessly besiege it    tartars fierce with sword and sabres     huns and turks and such as these   envied much their peaceful neighbors     by the blue borysthenes    murdering the citizens    down they came these ruthless russians     from their steppes and woods and fens   for to levy contributions     on the peaceful citizens    winter summer spring and autumn     down they came to peaceful kioff   killed the burghers when they caught em     if their lives they would not buy off    until they agreed to pay a tribute yearly    till the city quite confounded     by the ravages they made   humbly with their chief compounded     and a yearly tribute paid    how they paid the tribute and suddenly refused it    which because their courage lax was     they discharged while they were able   tolerated thus the tax was     till it grew intolerable    to the wonder of the cossack envoy    and the calmuc envoy sent     as before to take their dues all   got to his astonishment     a unanimous refusal    of a mighty gallant speech    men of kioff thus courageous     did the stout lordmayor harangue them   wherefore pay these sneaking wages     to the hectoring russians hang them    that the lordmayor made    hark i hear the awful cry of     our forefathers in their graves   fight ye citizens of kioff     kioff was not made for slaves    exhorting the burghers to pay no longer    all too long have ye betrayed her     rouse ye men and aldermen   send the insolent invader     send him starving back again     ix     of their thanks and heroic resolves    he spoke and he sat down the people of the town     who were fired with a brave emulation   now rose with one accord and voted thanks unto the lord     mayor for his oration    they dismiss the envoy and set about drilling    the envoy they dismissed never placing in his fist     so much as a single shilling   and all with courage fired as his lordship he desired     at once set about their drilling    of the city guard viz militia dragoons and bombardiers and   their commanders    then every city ward established a guard     diurnal and nocturnal   militia volunteers light dragoons and bombardiers     with an alderman for colonel    of the majors and captains    there was muster and rollcalls and repairing city walls     and filling up of fosses   and the captains and the majors gallant and courageous     ariding about on their hosses    the fortifications and artillery    to be guarded at all hours they built themselves watchtowers     with every tower a man on   and surely and secure each from out his embrasure     looked down the iron cannon    of the conduct of the actors and the clergy    a battlesong was writ for the theatre where it     was sung with vast enérgy   and rapturous applause and besides the public cause     was supported by the clergy    the pretty ladiesmaids were pinning of cockades     and tying on of sashes   and dropping gentle tears while their lovers blusterd fierce     about gunshot and gashes    of the ladies    the ladies took the hint and all day were scraping lint     as became their softer genders   and got bandages and beds for the limbs and for the heads     of the citys brave defenders    and finally of the taylors    the men both young and old felt resolute and bold     and panted hot for glory   even the tailors gan to brag and embroidered on their flag     aut wincere aut mori     x     of the cossack chiefhis stratagem    seeing the citys resolute condition     the cossack chief too cunning to despise it   said to himself not having ammunition   wherewith to batter the place in proper form   some of these nights ill carry it by storm     and sudden escalade it or surprise it    and the burghers sillie victorie    lets see however if the cits stand firmish     he rode up to the city gates for answers   out rushed an eager troop of the town élite   and straightway did begin a gallant skirmish   the cossack hereupon did sound retreat     leaving the victory with the city lancers    what prisoners they took    they took two prisoners and as many horses     and the whole town grew quickly so elate   with this small victory of their virgin forces   that they did deem their privates and commanders   so many caesars pompeys alexanders     napoleons or fredericks the great    and how conceited they were    and puffing with inordinate conceit     they utterly despised these cossack thieves   and thought the ruffians easier to beat   than porters carpets think or ushers boys   meanwhile a sly spectator of their joys     the cossack captain giggled in his sleeves    of the cossack chiefhis orders    wheneer you meet yon stupid city hogs     he bade his troops precise this order keep   dont stand a momentrun away you dogs   twas done and when they met the town battalions   the cossacks as if frightened at their valiance     turned tail and bolted like so many sheep    and how he feigned a retreat    they fled obedient to their captains order     and now this bloodless siege a month had lasted   when viewing the country round the city warder   who like a faithful weathercock did perch   upon the steeple of st sophys church     sudden his trumpet took and a mighty blast he blasted    the warder proclayms the cossacks retreat and the citie greatly   rejoyces    his voice it might be heard through all the streets     he was a warder wondrous strong in lung   victory victory the foe retreats   the foe retreats each cries to each he meets   the foe retreats each in his turn repeats     gods how the guns did roar and how the joybells rung    arming in haste his gallant city lancers     the mayor to learn if true the news might be   a league or two out issued with his prancers     the cossacks something had given their courage a damper   hastened their flight and gan like mad to scamper     blessed be all the saints kiova town was free     xi     now puffed with pride the mayor grew vain   fought all his battles oer again   and thrice he routed all his foes and thrice he slew the slain   tis true he might amuse himself thus   and not be very murderous   for as of those who to death were done   the number was exactly none   his lordship in his souls elation   did take a bloodless recreation    the manner of the cities rejoycings    going home again he did ordain   a very splendid cold collation   for the magistrates and the corporation   likewise a grand illumination   for the amusement of the nation   that night the theatres were free   the conduits they ran malvolsie   each house that night did beam with light   and sound with mirth and jollity    and its impiety    but shame o shame not a soul in the town   now the city was safe and the cossacks flown   ever thought of the bountiful saint by whose care     the town had been rid of these terrible turks   said even a prayer to that patroness fair     for these her wondrous works    how the priest hyacinth waited at church and nobody came   thither    lord hyacinth waited the meekest of priors   he waited at church with the rest of his friars   he went there at noon and he waited till ten   expecting in vain the lordmayor and his men     he waited and waited from midday to dark   but in vainyou might search through the whole of the church   not a layman alas to the citys disgrace   from midday to dark showed his nose in the place     the pewwoman organist beadle and clerk   kept away from their work and were dancing like mad   away in the streets with the other mad people   not thinking to pray but to guzzle and tipple     wherever the drink might be had     xii     how he went forth to bid them to prayer    amidst this din and revelry throughout the city roaring   the silver moon rose silently and high in heaven soaring   prior hyacinth was fervently upon his knees adoring   towards my precious patroness this conduct sure unfair is   i cannot think i must confess what keeps the dignitaries   and our good mayor away unless some business them contraries   he puts his long white mantle on and forth the prior sallies   his pious thoughts were bent upon good deeds and not on malice   heavens how the banquet lights they shone about the mayors palace    how the grooms and lackeys jeered him    about the hall the scullions ran with meats both and fresh and     potted   the pages came with cup and can all for the guests allotted   ah how they jeered that good fat man as up the stairs he trotted    he entered in the anterooms where sat the mayors court in   he found a pack of drunken grooms adicing and asporting   the horrid wine and bacco fumes they set the prior asnorting   the prior thought hed speak about their sins before he went hence   and lustily began to shout of sin and of repentance   the rogues they kicked the prior out before hed done a sentence    and having got no portion small of buffeting and tussling   at last he reached the banquethall where sat the mayor     aguzzling   and by his side his lady tall dressed out in white sprig muslin    and the mayor mayoress and aldermen being tipsie refused to go   church    around the table in a ring the guests were drinking heavy   theyd drunk the church and drunk the king and the army and the     navy   in fact theyd toasted everything  the prior said god save ye    the mayor cried bring a silver cuptheres one upon the beaufét   and prior have the venison upits capital rechauffé   and so sir priest youve come to sup  and pray you hows saint     sophy   the priors face quite red was grown with horror and with anger   he flung the proffered goblet downit made a hideous clangor   and gan apreaching with a frownhe was a fierce haranguer    he tried the mayor and aldermenthey all set up ajeering   he tried the commoncouncilmenthey too began asneering   he turned towards the mayress then and hoped to get a hearing   he knelt and seized her dinnerdress made of the muslin snowy   to church to church my sweet mistress he cried the way ill     show ye   alas the ladymayoress fell back as drunk as chloe     xiii     how the prior went back alone    out from this dissolute and drunken court     went the good prior his eyes with weeping dim   he tried the people of a meaner sort   they too alas were bent upon their sport     and not a single soul would follow him   but all were swigging schnaps and guzzling beer    he found the cits their daughters sons and spouses   spending the livelong night in fierce carouses     alas unthinking of the danger near   one or two sentinels the ramparts guarded     the rest were sharing in the general feast   god wot our tipsy town is poorly warded     sweet saint sophia help us cried the priest    alone he entered the cathedral gate     careful he locked the mighty oaken door   within his company of monks did wait     a dozen poor old pious menno more     oh but it grieved the gentle prior sore   to think of those lost souls given up to drink and fate    and shut himself into saint sophias chapel with his brethren    the mighty outer gate well barred and fast     the poor old friars stirred their poor old bones     and pattering swiftly on the damp cold stones   they through the solitary chancel passed   the chancel walls looked black and dim and vast     and rendered ghostlike melancholy tones    onward the fathers sped till coming nigh a     small iron gate the which they entered quick at     they locked and doublelocked the inner wicket   and stood within the chapel of sophia   vain were it to describe this sainted place     vain to describe that celebrated trophy     the venerable statue of saint sophy   which formed its chiefest ornament and grace    here the good prior his personal griefs and sorrows     in his extreme devotion quickly merging   at once began to pray with voice sonorous   the other friars joined in pious chorus     and passed the night in singing praying scourging     in honor of sophia that sweet virgin     xiv     the episode of sneezoff and katinka    leaving thus the pious priest in     humble penitence and prayer   and the greedy cits afeasting     let us to the walls repair    walking by the sentryboxes     underneath the silver moon   lo the sentry boldly cocks his     boldly cocks his musketoon    sneezoff was his designation     fairhaired boy for ever pitied   for to take his cruel station     he but now katinka quitted    poor in purse were both but rich in

this here fortified town    how the sentrie sneezoff was surprised and slayn    shouted thus the watchful sneezoff     but ere any one replied   wretched youth he fired his piece off     started staggered groaned and died     xv     how the cossacks rushed in suddenly and took the citie    ah full well might the sentinel cry who goes there   but echo was frightened too much to declare   who goes there who goes there  can any one swear   to the number of sands sur les bords de la mer   or the whiskers of dorsay count down to a hair   as well might you tell of the sands the amount   or number each hair in each curl of the count   as ever proclaim the number and name   of the hundreds and thousands that up the wall came    of the cossack troops    down down the knaves poured with fire and with sword   there were thieves from the danube and rogues from the don   there were turks and wallacks and shouting cossacks   of all nations and regions and tongues and religions   jew christian idolater frank mussulman   ah horrible sight was kioff that night    and of their manner of burning murdering and ravishing    the gates were all takenno chance een of flight   and with torch and with axe the bloody cossacks   went hither and thither ahunting in packs   they slashed and they slew both christian and jew   women and children they slaughtered them too   some saving their throats plunged into the moats   or the riverbut oh they had burned all the boats                                               how they burned the whole citie down save the church    but here let us pausefor i cant pursue further   this scene of rack ravishment ruin and murther   too well did the cunning old cossack succeed   his plan of attack was successful indeed   the night was his ownthe town it was gone   twas a heap still aburning of timber and stone    whereof the bells began to ring    one building alone had escaped from the fires   saint sophys fair church with its steeples and spires     calm stately and white     it stood in the light   and as if twould defy all the conquerors power     as if nought had occurred     might clearly be heard   the chimes ringing soberly every halfhour     xvi     the city was defunctsilence succeeded     unto its last fierce agonizing yell   and then it was the conqueror first heeded     the sound of these calm bells    how the cossack chief bade them burn the church too    furious towards his aidesdecamp he turns     and speaking as if byrons works he knew   villains he fiercely cries the city burns     why not the temple too   burn me yon church and murder all within    how they stormed it and of hyacinth his anger thereat    the cossacks thundered at the outer door   and father hyacinth who heard the din   and thought himself and brethren in distress   deserted by their lady patroness     did to her statue turn and thus his woes outpour     xvii     his prayer to the saint sophia    and is it thus o falsest of the saints       thou hearest our complaints   tell me did ever my attachment falter       to serve thy altar   was not thy name ere ever i did sleep       the last upon my lip   was not thy name the very first that broke       from me when i awoke   have i not tried with fasting flogging penance       and mortified counténance   for to find favor sophy in thy sight       and lo this night   forgetful of my prayers and thine own promise       thou turnest from us   lettest the heathen enter in our city       and without pity   murder out burghers seize upon their spouses       burn down their houses   is such a breach of faith to be endured       see what a lurid   light from the insolent invaders torches       shines on your porches   een now with thundering batteringram and hammer       and hideous clamor   with axemen swordsmen pikemen billmen bowmen       the conquering foemen   o sophy beat your gate about your ears       alas and heres   a humble company of pious men       like muttons in a pen   whose souls shall quickly from their bodies be thrusted       because in you they trusted   do you not know the calmuc chiefs desires       kill all the friars   and you of all the saints most false and fickle       leave us in this abominable pickle    the statue suddenlie speaks    rash hyacinthus     here to the astonishment of all her backers   saint sophy opening wide her wooden jaws     like to a pair of german walnutcrackers   began i did not think you had been thus   o monk of little faith  is it because   a rascal scum of filthy cossack heathen   besiege our town that you distrust in me then   thinkst thou that i who in a former day   did walk across the sea of marmora   not mentioning for shortness other seas   that i who skimmed the broad borysthenes   without so much as wetting of my toes   am frightened at a set of men like those   i have a mind to leave you to your fate   such cowardice as this my scorn inspires    but is interrupted by the breaking in of the cossacks    saint sophy was here     cut short in her words   for at this very moment in tumbled the gate   and with a wild cheer     and a clashing of swords   swift through the church porches   with a waving of torches   and a shriek and a yell   like the devils of hell   with pike and with axe   in rushed the cossacks   in rushed the cossacks crying   murder the friars    of hyacinth his outrageous address    ah what a thrill felt hyacinth     when he heard that villanous shout calmuc   now thought he my trial beginneth     saints o give me courage and pluck   courage boys tis useless to funk     thus unto the friars he began   never let it be said that a monk     is not likewise a gentleman   though the patron saint of the church     spite of all that weve done and weve prayd   leaves us wickedly here in the lurch     hang it gentlemen whos afraid    and preparation for dying    as thus the gallant hyacinthus spoke     he with an air as easy and as free as   if the quickcoming murder were a joke   folded his robes around his sides and took   place under sainted sophys legs of oak     like caesar at the statue of pompeius   the monks no leisure had about to look   each being absorbed in his particular case   else had they seen with what celestial race   a wooden smile stole oer the saints mahogany face    saint sophia her speech    well done well done hyacinthus my son     thus spoke the sainted statue   though you doubted me in the hour of need   and spoke of me very rude indeed   you deserve good luck for showing such pluck     and i wont be angry at you    she gets on the priors shoulder straddleback    the monks bystanding one and all     of this wondrous scene beholders     to this kind promise listened content     and couldnt contain their astonishment     when saint sophia moved and went   down from her wooden pedestal     and twisted her legs sure as eggs is eggs       round hyacinthuss shoulders    and bids him run    ho forwards cried sophy theres no time for waiting   the cossacks are breaking the very last gate in   see the glare of their torches shines red through the grating     weve still the back door and two minutes or more   now boys now or never we must make for the river     for we only are safe on the opposite shore   run swiftly today lads if ever you ran   put out your best leg hyacinthus my man   and ill lay five to two that you carry us through     only scamper as fast as you can     xviii     he runneth    away went the priest through the little back door   and light on his shoulders the image he bore     the honest old priest was not punished the least   though the image was eight feet and he measured four   away went the prior and the monks at his tail   went snorting and puffing and panting full sail     and just as the last at the back door had passed   in furious hunt behold at the front   the tartars so fierce with their terrible cheers   with axes and halberts and muskets and spears   with torches aflaming the chapel now came in   they tore up the massbook they stamped on the psalter   they pulled the gold crucifix down from the altar   the vestments they burned with their blasphemous fires   and many cried curse on them where are the friars   when loaded with plunder yet seeking for more   one chanced to fling open the little back door   spied out the friars white robes and long shadows   in the moon scampering over the meadows   and stopped the cossacks in the midst of their arsons   by crying out lustily there go the parsons    and the tartars after him    with a whoop and a yell and a scream and a shout   at once the whole murderous body turned out   and swift as the hawk pounces down on the pigeon   pursued the poor shortwinded men of religion    how the friars sweated    when the sound of that cheering came to the monks hearing     o heaven how the poor fellows panted and blew   at fighting not cunning unaccustomed to running     when the tartars came up what the deuce should they do   theyll make us all martyrs those bloodthirsty tartars     quoth fat father peter to fat father hugh   the shouts they came clearer the foe they drew nearer     oh how the bolts whistled and how the lights shone   i cannot get further this running is murther     come carry me some one cried big father john   and even the statue grew frightened od rat you     it cried mr prior i wish youd get on   on tugged the good friar but nigher and nigher   appeared the fierce russians with sword and with fire   on tugged the good prior at saint sophys desire   a scramble through bramble through mud and through mire   the swift arrows whizziness causing a dizziness   nigh done his business fit to expire    and the pursuers fixed arrows into their tayles    father hyacinth tugged and the monks they tugged after   the foemen pursued with a horrible laughter   and hurld their long spears round the poor brethrens ears   so true that next day in the coats of each priest   though never a wound was given there were found   a dozen arrows at least    how at the last gasp    now the chase seemed at its worst   prior and monks were fit to burst   scarce you knew the which was first     or pursuers or pursued   when the statue by heavens grace   suddenly did change the face   of this interesting race     as a saint sure only could    for as the jockey who at epsom rides     when that his steed is spent and punished sore   diggeth his heels into the coursers sides     and thereby makes him run one or two furlongs more     even thus betwixt the eighth rib and the ninth   the saint rebuked the prior that weary creeper     fresh strength into his limbs her kicks imparted   one bound he made as gay as when he started    the friars won and jumped into borysthenes fluvius    yes with his brethren clinging at his cloak     the statue on his shouldersfit to choke     one most tremendous bound made hyacinth   and soused friars statue and all slapdash into the dnieper     xix     and how the russians saw    and when the russians in a fiery rank     panting and fierce drew up along the shore     for here the vain pursuing they forbore   nor cared they to surpass the rivers bank   then looking from the rocks and rushes dank     a sight they witnessed never seen before   and which with its accompaniments glorious   is writ i the golden book or liber aureus    the statue get off hyacinth his back and sit down with the friars   on hyacinth his cloak    plump in the dnieper flounced the friar and friends     they dangling round his neck he fit to choke     when suddenly his most miraculous cloak   over the billowy waves itself extends   down from his shoulders quietly descends     the venerable sophys statue of oak   which sitting down upon the cloak so ample   bids all the brethren follow its example    how in this manner of boat they sayled away    each at her bidding sat and sat at ease     the statue gan a gracious conversation     and waving to the foe a salutation   saild with her wondering happy protégés   gayly adown the wide borysthenes     until they came unto some friendly nation   and when the heathen had at length grown shy of   their conquest she one day came back again to kioff     xx     finis or the end    think not o reader that were laughing at you   you may go to kioff now and see the

ungrateful who had served her this vay   mrs roney heard nothink for a long year and a day   till last thursday in lambeth ven whom should she see   but this mary as had acted so ungrateful to she    she was leaning on the helbo of a worthy young man   they were going to be married and were walkin hand in hand   and the church bells was a ringing for mary and he   and the parson was ready and a

hundred sterling pound    he by counsel and attorney there at guildford does appear   asking damage of the villain who seduced his lady dear   but i cant help asking though the ladys guilt was all too clear   and though guilty the defendant wasnt the plaintiff rather queer    first the ladys mother spoke and said shed seen her daughter cry   but a fortnight after marriage early times for piping eye   six months after things were worse and the piping eye was black   and this gallant british husband caned his wife upon the back    three months after they were married husband pushed her to the door   told her to be off and leave him for he wanted her no more   as she would not go why he went thrice he left his lady dear   left her too without a penny for more than a quarter of a year    mrs frances duncan knew the parties very well indeed   she had seen him pull his ladys nose and make her lip to bleed   if he chanced to sit at home not a single word he said   once she saw him throw the cover of a dish at his ladys head    sarah green another witness clear did to the jury note   how she saw this honest fellow seize his lady by the throat   how he cursed her and abused her beating her

melt   not that she had erred as yet crime was not developed in her   but being left without a penny mrs owers supplied her dinner   god be merciful to mrs owers who was merciful to this sinner    caroline naylor was their servant said they led a wretched life   saw this most distinguished briton fling a teacup at his wife   he went out to balls and pleasures and never once in ten months     space   sat with his wife or spoke her kindly  this was the defendants     case    pollock cb charged the jury said the womans guilt was clear   that was not the point however which the jury came to hear   but the damage to determine which as it should true appear   this most tenderhearted husband who so used his lady dear    beat her kicked her caned her cursed her left her starving     year by year   flung her from him parted from her wrung her neck and boxed her     ear   what the reasonable damage this afflicted man could claim   by the loss of the affections of this guilty graceless dame

love and mirth     as fits the solemn christmastide   as fits the holy christmas birth     be this good friends our carol still   be peace on earth be peace on earth     to men of gentle will

text is one i love to treat on   this life of ours he said is sheer     mataiotes mataioteton    o student of this gilded book     declare while musing on its pages   if truer words were ever spoke     by ancient or by modern sages    the various authors names but note     french spanish english russians germans   and in the volume polyglot     sure you may read a hundred sermons    what histories of life are here     more wild than all romancers stories   what wondrous transformations queer     what homilies on human glories    what theme for sorrow or for scorn     what chronicle of fates surprises   of adverse fortune nobly borne     of chances changes ruins rises    of thrones upset and sceptres broke     how strange a record here is written   of honors dealt as if in joke     of brave desert unkindly smitten    how low men were and how they rise     how high they were and how they tumble   o vanity of vanities     o laughable pathetic jumble    here between honest janins joke     and his turk excellencys firman   i write my name upon the book     i write my nameand end my sermon                   o vanity of vanities     how wayward the decrees of fate are   how very weak the very wise     how very small the very great are    what mean these stale moralities     sir preacher from your desk you mumble   why rail against the great and wise     and tire us with your ceaseless grumble    pray choose us out another text     o man morose and narrowminded   come turn the pagei read the next     and then the next and still i find it    read here how wealth aside was thrust     and folly set in place exalted   how princes footed in the dust     while lackeys in the saddle vaulted    though thrice a thousand years are past     since davids son the sad and splendid   the weary king ecclesiast     upon his awful tablets penned it    methinks the text is never stale     and life is every day renewing   fresh comments on the old old tale     of folly fortune glory ruin    hark to the preacher preaching still     he lifts his voice and cries his sermon   here at st peters of cornhill     as yonder on the mount of hermon    for you and me to heart to take     o dear beloved brother readers   today as when the good king spake     beneath the solemn syrian cedars      between a page by jules janin and a poem by the turkish   ambassador in madame de rs album
