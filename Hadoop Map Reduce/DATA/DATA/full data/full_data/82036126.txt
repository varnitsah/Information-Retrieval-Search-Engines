tried statistical value of the measurements the experiments carried on during several successive generations nature of the relationship of the plants in the later generations uniformity of the conditions to which the plants were subjected some apparent and some real causes of error amount of pollen employed arrangement of the work importance of the conclusions  there is weighty and abundant evidence that the flowers of most kinds of plants are constructed so as to be occasionally or habitually crossfertilised by pollen from another flower produced either by the same plant or generally as we shall hereafter see reason to believe by a distinct plant crossfertilisation is sometimes ensured by the sexes being separated and in a large number of cases by the pollen and stigma of the same flower being matured at different times such plants are called dichogamous and have been divided into two subclasses proterandrous species in which the pollen is mature before the stigma and proterogynous species in which the reverse occurs this latter form of dichogamy not being nearly so common as the other crossfertilisation is also ensured in many cases by mechanical contrivances of wonderful beauty preventing the impregnation of the flowers by their own pollen there is a small class of plants which i have called dimorphic and trimorphic but to which hildebrand has given the more appropriate name of heterostyled this class consists of plants presenting two or three distinct forms adapted for reciprocal fertilisation so that like plants with separate sexes they can hardly fail to be intercrossed in each generation the male and female organs of some flowers are irritable and the insects which touch them get dusted with pollen which is thus transported to other flowers again there is a class in which the ovules absolutely refuse to be fertilised by pollen from the same plant but can be fertilised by pollen from any other individual of the same species there are also very many species which are partially sterile with their own pollen lastly there is a large class in which the flowers present no apparent obstacle of any kind to selffertilisation nevertheless these plants are frequently intercrossed owing to the prepotency of pollen from another individual or variety over the plants own pollen  as plants are adapted by such diversified and effective means for crossfertilisation it might have been inferred from this fact alone that they derived some great advantage from the process and it is the object of the present work to show the nature and importance of the benefits thus derived there are however some exceptions to the rule of plants being constructed so as to allow of or to favour crossfertilisation for some few plants seem to be invariably selffertilised yet even these retain traces of having been formerly adapted for crossfertilisation these exceptions need not make us doubt the truth of the above rule any more than the existence of some few plants which produce flowers and yet never set seed should make us doubt that flowers are adapted for the production of seed and the propagation of the species  we should always keep in mind the obvious fact that the production of seed is the chief end of the act of fertilisation and that this end can be gained by hermaphrodite plants with incomparably greater certainty by selffertilisation than by the union of the sexual elements belonging to two distinct flowers or plants yet it is as unmistakably plain that innumerable flowers are adapted for crossfertilisation as that the teeth and talons of a carnivorous animal are adapted for catching prey or that the plumes wings and hooks of a seed are adapted for its dissemination flowers therefore are constructed so as to gain two objects which are to a certain extent antagonistic and this explains many apparent anomalies in their structure the close proximity of the anthers to the stigma in a multitude of species favours and often leads to selffertilisation but this end could have been gained far more safely if the flowers had been completely closed for then the pollen would not have been injured by the rain or devoured by insects as often happens moreover in this case a very small quantity of pollen would have been sufficient for fertilisation instead of millions of grains being produced but the openness of the flower and the production of a great and apparently wasteful amount of pollen are necessary for crossfertilisation these remarks are well illustrated by the plants called cleistogene which bear on the same stock two kinds of flowers the flowers of the one kind are minute and completely closed so that they cannot possibly be crossed but they are abundantly fertile although producing an extremely small quantity of pollen the flowers of the other kind produce much pollen and are open and these can be and often are crossfertilised hermann muller has also made the remarkable discovery that there are some plants which exist under two forms that is produce on distinct stocks two kinds of hermaphrodite flowers the one form bears small flowers constructed for selffertilisation whilst the other bears larger and much more conspicuous flowers plainly constructed for crossfertilisation by the aid of insects and without their aid these produce no seed  the adaptation of flowers for crossfertilisation is a subject which has interested me for the last thirtyseven years and i have collected a large mass of observations but these are now rendered superfluous by the many excellent works which have been lately published in the year 1857 i wrote a short paper on the fertilisation of the kidney bean 11 gardeners chronicle 1857 page 725 and 1858 pages 824 and 844 annals and magazine of natural history 3rd series volume 2 1858 page 462 and in 1862 my work on the contrivances by which british and foreign orchids are fertilised by insects appeared it seemed to me a better plan to work out one group of plants as carefully as i could rather than to publish many miscellaneous and imperfect observations my present work is the complement of that on orchids in which it was shown how admirably these plants are constructed so as to permit of or to favour or to necessitate crossfertilisation the adaptations for crossfertilisation are perhaps more obvious in the orchideae than in any other group of plants but it is an error to speak of them as some authors have done as an exceptional case the leverlike action of the stamens of salvia described by hildebrand dr w ogle and others by which the anthers are depressed and rubbed on the backs of bees shows as perfect a structure as can be found in any orchid papilionaceous flowers as described by various authorsfor instance by mr th farreroffer innumerable curious adaptations for crossfertilisation the case of posoqueria fragrans one of the rubiaceae is as wonderful as that of the most wonderful orchid the stamens according to fritz muller are irritable so that as soon as a moth visits a flower the anthers explode and cover the insect with pollen one of the filaments which is broader than the others then moves and closes the flower for about twelve hours after which time it resumes its original position 12 botanische zeitung 1866 page 129 thus the stigma cannot be fertilised by pollen from the same flower but only by that brought by a moth from some other flower endless other beautiful contrivances for this same purpose could be specified  long before i had attended to the fertilisation of flowers a remarkable book appeared in 1793 in germany das entdeckte geheimniss der natur by ck sprengel in which he clearly proved by innumerable observations how essential a part insects play in the fertilisation of many plants but he was in advance of his age and his discoveries were for a long time neglected since the appearance of my book on orchids many excellent works on the fertilisation of flowers such as those by hildebrand delpino axell and hermann muller and numerous shorter papers have been published 13 sir john lubbock has given an interesting summary of the whole subject in his british wild flowers considered in relation to insects 1875 hermann mullers work die befruchtung der blumen durch insekten 1873 contains an immense number of original observations and generalisations it is moreover invaluable as a repertory with references to almost everything which has been published on the subject his work differs from that of all others in specifying what kinds of insects as far as known visit the flowers of each species he likewise enters on new ground by showing not only that flowers are adapted for their own good to the visits of certain insects but that the insects themselves are excellently adapted for procuring nectar or pollen from certain flowers the value of h mullers work can hardly be overestimated and it is much to be desired that it should be translated into english severin axells work is written in swedish so that i have not been able to read it a list would occupy several pages and this is not the proper place to give their titles as we are not here concerned with the means but with the results of crossfertilisation no one who feels interest in the mechanism by which nature effects her ends can read these books and memoirs without the most lively interest  from my own observations on plants guided to a certain extent by the experience of the breeders of animals i became convinced many years ago that it is a general law of nature that flowers are adapted to be crossed at least occasionally by pollen from a distinct plant sprengel at times foresaw this law but only partially for it does not appear that he was aware that there was any difference in power between pollen from the same plant and from a distinct plant in the introduction to his book page 4 he says as the sexes are separated in so many flowers and as so many other flowers are dichogamous it appears that nature has not willed that any one flower should be fertilised by its own pollen nevertheless he was far from keeping this conclusion always before his mind or he did not see its full importance as may be perceived by anyone who will read his observations carefully and he consequently mistook the meaning of various structures but his discoveries are so numerous and his work so excellent that he can well afford to bear a small amount of blame a most capable judge h muller likewise says it is remarkable in how very many cases sprengel rightly perceived that pollen is necessarily transported to the stigmas of other flowers of the same species by the insects which visit them and yet did not imagine that this transportation was of any service to the plants themselves 14 die befruchtung der blumen 1873 page 4 his words are es ist merkwurdig in wie zahlreichen fallen sprengel richtig erkannte dass durch die besuchenden insekten der bluthenstaub mit nothwendigkeit auf die narben anderer bluthen derselben art ubertragen wird ohne auf die vermuthung zu kommen dass in dieser wirkung der nutzen des insektenbesuches fur die pflanzen selbst gesucht werden musse  andrew knight saw the truth much more clearly for he remarks nature intended that a sexual intercourse should take place between neighbouring plants of the same species 15 philosophical transactions 1799 page 202 after alluding to the various means by which pollen is transported from flower to flower as far as was then imperfectly known he adds nature has something more in view than that its own proper males would fecundate each blossom in 1811 kolreuter plainly hinted at the same law as did afterwards another famous hybridiser of plants herbert 16 kolreuter mem de lacad de st petersbourg tome 3 1809 published 1811 page 197 after showing how well the malvaceae are adapted for crossfertilisation he asks an id aliquid in recessu habeat quod hujuscemodi flores nunquam proprio suo pulvere sed semper eo aliarum suae speciei impregnentur merito quaeritur certe natura nil facit frustra herbert amaryllidaceae with a treatise on crossbred vegetables 1837 but none of these distinguished observers appear to have been sufficiently impressed with the truth and generality of the law so as to insist on it and impress their beliefs on others  in 1862 i summed up my observations on orchids by saying that nature abhors perpetual selffertilisation if the word perpetual had been omitted the aphorism would have been false as it stands i believe that it is true though perhaps rather too strongly expressed and i should have added the selfevident proposition that the propagation of the species whether by selffertilisation or by crossfertilisation or asexually by buds stolons etc is of paramount importance hermann muller has done excellent service by insisting repeatedly on this latter point  it often occurred to me that it would be advisable to try whether seedlings from crossfertilised flowers were in any way superior to those from selffertilised flowers but as no instance was known with animals of any evil appearing in a single generation from the closest possible interbreeding that is between brothers and sisters i thought that the same rule would hold good with plants and that it would be necessary at the sacrifice of too much time to selffertilise and intercross plants during several successive generations in order to arrive at any result i ought to have reflected that such elaborate provisions favouring crossfertilisation as we see in innumerable plants would not have been acquired for the sake of gaining a distant and slight advantage or of avoiding a distant and slight evil moreover the fertilisation of a flower by its own pollen corresponds to a closer form of interbreeding than is possible with ordinary bisexual animals so that an earlier result might have been expected  i was at last led to make the experiments recorded in the present volume from the following circumstance for the sake of determining certain points with respect to inheritance and without any thought of the effects of close interbreeding i raised close together two large beds of selffertilised and crossed seedlings from the same plant of linaria vulgaris to my surprise the crossed plants when fully grown were plainly taller and more vigorous than the selffertilised ones bees incessantly visit the flowers of this linaria and carry pollen from one to the other and if insects are excluded the flowers produce extremely few seeds so that the wild plants from which my seedlings were raised must have been intercrossed during all previous generations it seemed therefore quite incredible that the difference between the two beds of seedlings could have been due to a single act of selffertilisation and i attributed the result to the selffertilised seeds not having been well ripened improbable as it was that all should have been in this state or to some other accidental and inexplicable cause during the next year i raised for the same purpose as before two large beds close together of selffertilised and crossed seedlings from the carnation dianthus caryophyllus this plant like the linaria is almost sterile if insects are excluded and we may draw the same inference as before namely that the parentplants must have been intercrossed during every or almost every previous generation nevertheless the selffertilised seedlings were plainly inferior in height and vigour to the crossed  my attention was now thoroughly aroused for i could hardly doubt that the difference between the two beds was due to the one set being the offspring of crossed and the other of selffertilised flowers accordingly i selected almost by hazard two other plants which happened to be in flower in the greenhouse namely mimulus luteus and ipomoea purpurea both of which unlike the linaria and dianthus are highly selffertile if insects are excluded some flowers on a single plant of both species were fertilised with their own pollen and others were crossed with pollen from a distinct individual both plants being protected by a net from insects the crossed and selffertilised seeds thus produced were sown on opposite sides of the same pots and treated in all respects alike and the plants when fully grown were measured and compared with both species as in the cases of the linaria and dianthus the crossed seedlings were conspicuously superior in height and in other ways to the selffertilised i therefore determined to begin a long series of experiments with various plants and these were continued for the following eleven years and we shall see that in a large majority of cases the crossed beat the selffertilised plants several of the exceptional cases moreover in which the crossed plants were not victorious can be explained  it should be observed that i have spoken for the sake of brevity and shall continue to do so of crossed and selffertilised seeds seedlings or plants these terms implying that they are the product of crossed or selffertilised flowers crossfertilisation always means a cross between distinct plants which were raised from seeds and not from cuttings or buds selffertilisation always implies that the flowers in question were impregnated with their own pollen  my experiments were tried in the following manner a single plant if it produced a sufficiency of flowers or two or three plants were placed under a net stretched on a frame and large enough to cover the plant together with the pot when one was used without touching it this latter point is important for if the flowers touch the net they may be crossfertilised by bees as i have known to happen and when the net is wet the pollen may be injured i used at first white cotton net with very fine meshes but afterwards a kind of net with meshes onetenth of an inch in diameter and this i found by experience effectually excluded all insects excepting thrips which no net will exclude on the plants thus protected several flowers were marked and were fertilised with their own pollen and an equal number on the same plants marked in a different manner were at the same time crossed with pollen from a distinct plant the crossed flowers were never castrated in order to make the experiments as like as possible to what occurs under nature with plants fertilised by the aid of insects therefore some of the flowers which were crossed may have failed to be thus fertilised and afterwards have been selffertilised but this and some other sources of error will presently be discussed in some few cases of spontaneously selffertile species the flowers were allowed to fertilise themselves under the net and in still fewer cases uncovered plants were allowed to be freely crossed by the insects which incessantly visited them there are some great advantages and some disadvantages in my having occasionally varied my method of proceeding but when there was any difference in the treatment it is always so stated under the head of each species  care was taken that the seeds were thoroughly ripened before being gathered afterwards the crossed and selffertilised seeds were in most cases placed on damp sand on opposite sides of a glass tumbler covered by a glass plate with a partition between the two lots and the glass was placed on the chimneypiece in a warm room i could thus observe the germination of the seeds sometimes a few would germinate on one side before any on the other and these were thrown away but as often as a pair germinated at the same time they were planted on opposite sides of a pot with a superficial partition between the two and i thus proceeded until from halfadozen to a score or more seedlings of exactly the same age were planted on the opposite sides of several pots if one of the young seedlings became sickly or was in any way injured it was pulled up and thrown away as well as its antagonist on the opposite side of the same pot  as a large number of seeds were placed on the sand to germinate many remained after the pairs had been selected some of which were in a state of germination and others not so and these were sown crowded together on the opposite sides of one or two rather larger pots or sometimes in two long rows out of doors in these cases there was the most severe struggle for life among the crossed seedlings on one side of the pot and the selffertilised seedlings on the other side and between the two lots which grew in competition in the same pot a vast number soon perished and the tallest of the survivors on both sides when fully grown were measured plants treated in this manner were subjected to nearly the same conditions as those growing in a state of nature which have to struggle to maturity in the midst of a host of competitors  on other occasions from the want of time the seeds instead of being allowed to germinate on damp sand were sown on the opposite sides of pots and the fully grown plants measured but this plan is less accurate as the seeds sometimes germinated more quickly on one side than on the other it was however necessary to act in this manner with some few species as certain kinds of seeds would not germinate well when exposed to the light though the glasses containing them were kept on the chimneypiece on one side of a room and some way from the two windows which faced the northeast 17 this occurred in the plainest manner with the seeds of papaver vagum and delphinium consolida and less plainly with those of adonis aestivalis and ononis minutissima rarely more than one or two of the seeds of these four species germinated on the bare sand though left there for some weeks but when these same seeds were placed on earth in pots and covered with a thin layer of sand they germinated immediately in large numbers  the soil in the pots in which the seedlings were planted or the seeds sown was well mixed so as to be uniform in composition the plants on the two sides were always watered at the same time and as equally as possible and even if this had not been done the water would have spread almost equally to both sides as the pots were not large the crossed and selffertilised plants were separated by a superficial partition which was always kept directed towards the chief source of the light so that the plants on both sides were equally illuminated i do not believe it possible that two sets of plants could have been subjected to more closely similar conditions than were my crossed and selffertilised seedlings as grown in the above described manner  in comparing the two sets the eye alone was never trusted generally the height of every plant on both sides was carefully measured often more than once namely whilst young sometimes again when older and finally when fully or almost fully grown but in some cases which are always specified owing to the want of time only one or two of the tallest plants on each side were measured this plan which is not a good one was never followed except with the crowded plants raised from the seeds remaining after the pairs had been planted unless the tallest plants on each side seemed fairly to represent the average difference between those on both sides it has however some great advantages as sickly or accidentally injured plants or the offspring of illripened seeds are thus eliminated when the tallest plants alone on each side were measured their average height of course exceeds that of all the plants on the same side taken together but in the case of the much crowded plants raised from the remaining seeds the average height of the tallest plants was less than that of the plants in pairs owing to the unfavourable conditions to which they were subjected from being greatly crowded for our purpose however of the comparison of the crossed and selffertilised plants their absolute height signifies little  as the plants were measured by an ordinary english standard divided into inches and eighths of an inch i have not thought it worth while to change the fractions into decimals the average or mean heights were calculated in the ordinary rough method by adding up the measurements of all and dividing the product by the number of plants measured the result being here given in inches and decimals as the different species grow to various heights i have always for the sake of easy comparison given in addition the average height of the crossed plants of each species taken as 100 and have calculated the average height of the selffertilised plant in relation to this standard with respect to the crowded plants raised from the seeds remaining after the pairs had been planted and of which only some of the tallest on each side were measured i have not thought it worth while to complicate the results by giving separate averages for them and for the pairs but have added up all their heights and thus obtained a single average  i long doubted whether it was worth while to give the measurements of each separate plant but have decided to do so in order that it may be seen that the superiority of the crossed plants over the selffertilised does not commonly depend on the presence of two or three extra fine plants on the one side or of a few very poor plants on the other side although several observers have insisted in general terms on the offspring from intercrossed varieties being superior to either parentform no precise measurements have been given 18 a summary of these statements with references may be found in my variation of animals and plants under domestication chapter 17 2nd edition 1875 volume 2 page 109 and i have met with no observations on the effects of crossing and selffertilising the individuals of the same variety moreover experiments of this kind require so much timemine having been continued during eleven yearsthat they are not likely soon to be repeated  as only a moderate number of crossed and selffertilised plants were measured it was of great importance to me to learn how far the averages were trustworthy i therefore asked mr galton who has had much experience in statistical researches to examine some of my tables of measurements seven in number namely those of ipomoea digitalis reseda lutea viola limnanthes petunia and zea i may premise that if we took by chance a dozen or score of men belonging to two nations and measured them it would i presume be very rash to form any judgment from such small numbers on their average heights but the case is somewhat different with my crossed and selffertilised plants as they were of exactly the same age were subjected from first to last to the same conditions and were descended from the same parents when only from two to six pairs of plants were measured the results are manifestly of little or no value except in so far as they confirm and are confirmed by experiments made on a larger scale with other species i will now give the report on the seven tables of measurements which mr galton has had the great kindness to draw up for me  i have examined the measurements of the plants with care and by many statistical methods to find out how far the means of the several sets represent constant realities such as would come out the same so long as the general conditions of growth remained unaltered the principal methods that were adopted are easily explained by selecting one of the shorter series of plants say of zea mays for an example  table 11 zea mays young plants mr galton

we arrange them the in order of their magnitudes as in columns 4 and 5 the case is materially altered we now see with few exceptions that the largest plant on the crossed side in each pot exceeds the largest plant on the selffertilised side that the second exceeds the second the third the third and so on out of the fifteen cases in the table there are only two exceptions to this rule we may therefore confidently affirm that a crossed series will always be found to exceed a selffertilised series within the range of the conditions under which the present experiment has been made  table 12

next as regards the numerical estimate of this excess the mean values of the several groups are so discordant as is shown in table 12 that a fairly precise numerical estimate seems impossible but the consideration arises whether the difference between pot and pot may not be of much the same order of importance as that of the other conditions upon which the growth of the plants has been modified if so and only on that condition it would follow that when all the measurements either of the crossed or the selffertilised plants were combined into a single series that series would be statistically regular the experiment is tried in table 11 columns 7 and 8 where the regularity is abundantly clear and justifies us in considering its mean as perfectly reliable i have protracted these measurements and revised them in the usual way by drawing a curve through them with a free hand but the revision barely modifies the means derived from the original observations in the present and in nearly all the other cases the difference between the original and revised means is under 2 per cent of their value it is a very remarkable coincidence that in the seven kinds of plants whose measurements i have examined the ratio between the heights of the crossed and of the selffertilised ranges in five cases within very narrow limits in zea mays it is as 100 to 84 and in the others it ranges between 100 to 76 and 100 to 86  the determination of the variability measured by what is technically called the probable error is a problem of more delicacy than that of determining the means and i doubt after making many trials whether it is possible to derive useful conclusions from these few observations we ought to have measurements of at least fifty plants in each case in order to be in a position to deduce fair results one fact however bearing on variability is very evident in most cases though not in zea mays namely that the selffertilised plants include the larger number of exceptionally small specimens while the crossed are more generally full grown  those groups of cases in which measurements have been made of a few of the tallest plants that grew in rows each of which contained a multitude of plants show very clearly that the crossed plants exceed the selffertilised in height but they do not tell by inference anything about their respective mean values if it should happen that a series is known to follow the law of error or any other law and if the number of individuals in the series is known it would be always possible to reconstruct the whole series when a fragment of it has been given but i find no such method to be applicable in the present case the doubt as to the number of plants in each row is of minor importance the real difficulty lies in our ignorance of the precise law followed by the series the experience of the plants in pots does not help us to determine that law because the observations of such plants are too few to enable us to lay down more than the middle terms of the series to which they belong with any sort of accuracy whereas the cases we are now considering refer to one of its extremities there are other special difficulties which need not be gone into as the one already mentioned is a complete bar  mr galton sent me at the same time graphical representations which he had made of the measurements and they evidently form fairly regular curves he appends the words very good to those of zea and limnanthes he also calculated the average height of the crossed and selffertilised plants in the seven tables by a more correct method than that followed by me namely by including the heights as estimated in accordance with statistical rules of a few plants which died before they were measured whereas i merely added up the heights of the survivors and divided the sum by their number the difference in our results is in one way highly satisfactory for the average heights of the selffertilised plants as deduced by mr galton is less than mine in all the cases excepting one in which our averages are the same and this shows that i have by no means exaggerated the superiority of the crossed over the selffertilised plants  after the heights of the crossed and selffertilised plants had been taken they were sometimes cut down close to the ground and an equal number of both weighed this method of comparison gives very striking results and i wish that it had been oftener followed finally a record was often kept of any marked difference in the rate of germination of the crossed and selffertilised seedsof the relative periods of flowering of the plants raised from themand of their productiveness that is of the number of seedcapsules which they produced and of the average number of seeds which each capsule contained  when i began my experiments i did not intend to raise crossed and selffertilised plants for more than a single generation but as soon as the plants of the first generation were in flower i thought that i would raise one more generation and acted in the following manner several flowers on one or more of the selffertilised plants were again selffertilised and several flowers on one or more of the crossed plants were fertilised with pollen from another crossed plant of the same lot having thus once begun the same method was followed for as many as ten successive generations with some of the species the seeds and seedlings were always treated in exactly the same manner as already described the selffertilised plants whether originally descended from one or two motherplants were thus in each generation as closely interbred as was possible and i could not have improved on my plan but instead of crossing one of the crossed plants with another crossed plant i ought to have crossed the selffertilised plants of each generation with pollen taken from a nonrelated plantthat is one belonging to a distinct family or stock of the same species and variety this was done in several cases as an additional experiment and gave very striking results but the plan usually followed was to put into competition and compare intercrossed plants which were almost always the offspring of more or less closely related plants with the selffertilised plants of each succeeding generationall having been grown under closely similar conditions i have however learnt more by this method of proceeding which was begun by an oversight and then necessarily followed than if i had always crossed the selffertilised plants of each succeeding generation with pollen from a fresh stock  i have said that the crossed plants of the successive generations were almost always interrelated when the flowers on an hermaphrodite plant are crossed with pollen taken from a distinct plant the seedlings thus raised may be considered as hermaphrodite brothers or sisters those raised from the same capsule being as close as twins or animals of the same litter but in one sense the flowers on the same plant are distinct individuals and as several flowers on the motherplant were crossed by pollen taken from several flowers on the fatherplant such seedlings would be in one sense halfbrothers or sisters but more closely related than are the halfbrothers and sisters of ordinary animals the flowers on the motherplant were however commonly crossed by pollen taken from two or more distinct plants and in these cases the seedlings might be called with more truth halfbrothers or sisters when two or three motherplants were crossed as often happened by pollen taken from two or three fatherplants the seeds being all intermingled some of the seedlings of the first generation would be in no way related whilst many others would be whole or halfbrothers and sisters in the second generation a large number of the seedlings would be what may be called whole or half firstcousins mingled with whole and halfbrothers and sisters and with some plants not at all related so it would be in the succeeding generations but there would also be many cousins of the second and more remote degrees the relationship will thus have become more and more inextricably complex in the later generations with most of the plants in some degree and many of them closely related  i have only one other point to notice but this is one of the highest importance namely that the crossed and selffertilised plants were subjected in the same generation to as nearly similar and uniform conditions as was possible in the successive generations they were exposed to slightly different conditions as the seasons varied and they were raised at different periods but in other respects all were treated alike being grown in pots in the same artificially prepared soil being watered at the same time and kept close together in the same greenhouse or hothouse they were therefore not exposed during successive years to such great vicissitudes of climate as are plants growing out of doors  on some apparent and real causes of error in my experiments  it has been objected to such experiments as mine that covering plants with a net although only for a short time whilst in flower may affect their health and fertility i have seen no such effect except in one instance with a myosotis and the covering may not then have been the real cause of injury but even if the net were slightly injurious and certainly it was not so in any high degree as i could judge by the appearance of the plants and by comparing their fertility with that of neighbouring uncovered plants it would not have vitiated my experiments for in all the more important cases the flowers were crossed as well as selffertilised under a net so that they were treated in this respect exactly alike  as it is impossible to exclude such minute pollencarrying insects as thrips flowers which it was intended to fertilise with their own pollen may sometimes have been afterwards crossed with pollen brought by these insects from another flower on the same plant but as we shall hereafter see a cross of this kind does not produce any effect or at most only a slight one when two or more plants were placed near one another under the same net as was often done there is some real though not great danger of the flowers which were believed to be selffertilised being afterwards crossed with pollen brought by thrips from a distinct plant i have said that the danger is not great because i have often found that plants which are selfsterile unless aided by insects remained sterile when several plants of the same species were placed under the same net if however the flowers which had been presumably selffertilised by me were in any case afterwards crossed by thrips with pollen brought from a distinct plant crossed seedlings would have been included amongst the selffertilised but it should be especially observed that this occurrence would tend to diminish and not to increase any superiority in average height fertility etc of the crossed over the selffertilised plants  as the flowers which were crossed were never castrated it is probable or even almost certain that i sometimes failed to crossfertilise them effectually and that they were afterwards spontaneously selffertilised this would have been most likely to occur with dichogamous species for without much care it is not easy to perceive whether their stigmas are ready to be fertilised when the anthers open but in all cases as the flowers were protected from wind rain and the access of insects any pollen placed by me on the stigmatic surface whilst it was immature would generally have remained there until the stigma was mature and the flowers would then have been crossed as was intended nevertheless it is highly probable that selffertilised seedlings have sometimes by this means got included amongst the crossed seedlings the effect would be as in the former case not to exaggerate but to diminish any average superiority of the crossed over the selffertilised plants  errors arising from the two causes just named and from otherssuch as some of the seeds not having been thoroughly ripened though care was taken to avoid this errorthe sickness or unperceived injury of any of the plantswill have been to a large extent eliminated in those cases in which many crossed and selffertilised plants were measured and an average struck some of these causes of error will also have been eliminated by the seeds having been allowed to germinate on bare damp sand and being planted in pairs for it is not likely that illmatured and wellmatured or diseased and healthy seeds would germinate at exactly the same time the same result will have been gained in the several cases in which only a few of the tallest finest and healthiest plants on each side of the pots were measured  kolreuter and gartner have proved that with some plants several even as many as from fifty to sixty pollengrains are necessary for the fertilisation of all the ovules in the ovarium 19 kentniss der befruchtung 1844 page 345 naudin nouvelles archives du museum tome 1 page 27 naudin also found in the case of mirabilis that if only one or two of its very large pollengrains were placed on the stigma the plants raised from such seeds were dwarfed i was therefore careful to give an amply sufficient supply of pollen and generally covered the stigma with it but i did not take any special pains to place exactly the same amount on the stigmas of the selffertilised and crossed flowers after having acted in this manner during two seasons i remembered that gartner thought though without any direct evidence that an excess of pollen was perhaps injurious and it has been proved by spallanzani quatrefages and newport that with various animals an excess of the seminal fluid entirely prevents fertilisation 110 transactions of the philosophical society 1853 pages 253258 it was therefore necessary to ascertain whether the fertility of the flowers was affected by applying a rather small and an extremely large quantity of pollen to the stigma accordingly a very small mass of pollengrains was placed on one side of the large stigma in sixtyfour flowers of ipomoea purpurea and a great mass of pollen over the whole surface of the stigma in sixtyfour other flowers in order to vary the experiment half the flowers of both lots were on plants produced from selffertilised seeds and the other half on plants from crossed seeds the sixtyfour flowers with an excess of pollen yielded sixtyone capsules and excluding four capsules each of which contained only a single poor seed the remainder contained on an average 507 seeds per capsule the sixtyfour flowers with only a little pollen placed on one side of the stigma yielded sixtythree capsules and excluding one from the same cause as before the remainder contained on an average 5129 seeds so that the flowers fertilised with little pollen yielded rather more capsules and seeds than did those fertilised with an excess but the difference is too slight to be of any significance on the other hand the seeds produced by the flowers with an excess of pollen were a little heavier of the two for 170 of them weighed 7967 grains whilst 170 seeds from the flowers with very little pollen weighed 7920 grains both lots of seeds having been placed on damp sand presented no difference in their rate of germination we may therefore conclude that my experiments were not affected by any slight difference in the amount of pollen used a sufficiency having been employed in all cases  the order in which our subject will be treated in the present volume is as follows a long series of experiments will first be given in chapters 2 to 6 tables will afterwards be appended showing in a condensed form the relative heights weights and fertility of the offspring of the various crossed and selffertilised species another table exhibits the striking results from fertilising plants which during several generations had either been selffertilised or had been crossed with plants kept all the time under closely similar conditions with pollen taken from plants of a distinct stock and which had been exposed to different conditions in the concluding chapters various related points and questions of general interest will be discussed  anyone not specially interested in the subject need not attempt to read all the details marked  though they possess i think some value and cannot be all summarised but i would suggest to the reader to take as an example the experiments on ipomoea in chapter 2 to which may be added those on digitalis origanum viola or the common cabbage as in all these cases the crossed plants are superior to the selffertilised in a marked degree but not in quite the same manner as instances of selffertilised plants being equal or superior to the crossed the experiments on bartonia canna and the common pea ought to be read but in the last case and probably in that of canna the want of any superiority in the crossed plants can be explained  species were selected for experiment belonging to widely distinct families inhabiting various countries in some few cases several genera belonging to the same family were tried and these are grouped together but the families themselves have been arranged not in any natural order but in that which was the most convenient for my purpose the experiments have been fully given as the results appear to me of sufficient value to justify the details plants bearing hermaphrodite flowers can be interbred more closely than is possible with bisexual animals and are therefore wellfitted to throw light on the nature and extent of the good effects of crossing and on the evil effects of close interbreeding or selffertilisation the most important conclusion at which i have arrived is that the mere act of crossing by itself does no good the good depends on the individuals which are crossed differing slightly in constitution owing to their progenitors having been subjected during several generations to slightly different conditions or to what we call in our ignorance spontaneous variation this conclusion as we shall hereafter see is closely connected with various important physiological problems such as the benefit derived from slight changes in the conditions of life and this stands in the closest connection with life itself it throws light on the origin of the two sexes and on their separation or union in the same individual and lastly on the whole subject of hybridism which is one of the greatest obstacles to the general acceptance and progress of the great principle of evolution  in order to avoid misapprehension i beg leave to repeat that throughout this volume a crossed plant seedling or seed means one of crossed parentage that is one derived from a flower fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant of the same species and that a selffertilised plant seedling or seed means one of selffertilised parentage that is one derived from a flower fertilised with pollen from the same flower or sometimes when thus stated from another flower on the same plant    chapter ii  convolvulaceae  ipomoea

sterility of their firstproduced flowers uniform colour of the flowers produced by the selffertilised plants the advantage from a cross between two distinct plants depends on their differing in constitution  a plant of ipomoea purpurea or as it is often called in england the convolvulus major a native of south america grew in my greenhouse ten flowers on this plant were fertilised with pollen from the same flower and ten other flowers on the same plant were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant the fertilisation of the flowers with their own pollen was superfluous as this convolvulus is highly selffertile but i acted in this manner to make the experiments correspond in all respects whilst the flowers are young the stigma projects beyond the anthers and it might have been thought that it could not be fertilised without the aid of humblebees which often visit the flowers but as the flower grows older the stamens increase in length and their anthers brush against the stigma which thus receives some pollen the number of seeds produced by the crossed and selffertilised flowers differed very little  crossed and selffertilised seeds obtained in the above manner were allowed to germinate on damp sand and as often as pairs germinated at the same time they were planted in the manner described in the introduction chapter 1 on the opposite sides of two pots five pairs were thus planted and all the remaining seeds whether or not in a state of germination were planted on the opposite sides of a third pot so that the young plants on both sides were here greatly crowded and exposed to very severe competition rods of iron or wood of equal diameter were given to all the plants to twine up and as soon as one of each pair reached the summit both were measured a single rod was placed on each side of the crowded pot number 3 and only the tallest plant on each side was measured  table 21 ipomoea purpurea first generation  heights of plants in inches  column 1

selffertilised plants is only 6566 inches so that the crossed plants are to the selffertilised in height as 100 to 76 it should be observed that this difference is not due to a few of the crossed plants being extremely tall or to a few of the selffertilised being extremely short but to all the crossed plants attaining a greater height than their antagonists the three pairs in pot 1 were measured at two earlier periods and the difference was sometimes greater and sometimes less than that at the final measuring but it is an interesting fact of which i have seen several other instances that one of the selffertilised plants when nearly a foot in height was half an inch taller than the crossed plant and again when two feet high it was 1 38 of an inch taller but during the ten subsequent days the crossed plant began to gain on its antagonist and ever afterward asserted its supremacy until it exceeded its selffertilised opponent by 16 inches  the five crossed plants in pots 1 and 2 were covered with a net and produced 121 capsules the five selffertilised plants produced eightyfour capsules so that the numbers of capsules were as 100 to 69 of the 121 capsules on the crossed plants sixtyfive were the product of flowers crossed with pollen from a distinct plant and these contained on an average 523 seeds per capsule the remaining fiftysix capsules were spontaneously selffertilised of the eightyfour capsules on the selffertilised plants all the product of renewed selffertilisation fiftyfive which were alone examined contained on an average 485 seeds per capsule therefore the crossfertilised capsules compared with the selffertilised capsules yielded seeds in the proportion of 100 to 93 the crossed seeds were relatively heavier than the selffertilised seeds combining the above data ie number of capsules and average number of contained seeds the crossed plants compared with the selffertilised yielded seeds in the ratio of 100 to 64  these crossed plants produced as already stated fiftysix spontaneously selffertilised capsules and the selffertilised plants produced twentynine such capsules the former contained on an average in comparison with the latter seeds in the proportion of 100 to 99  in pot 3 on the opposite sides of which a large number of crossed and selffertilised seeds had been sown and the seedlings allowed to struggle together the crossed plants had at first no great advantage at one time the tallest crossed was 25 18 inches high and the tallest selffertilised plants 21 38 but the difference afterwards became much greater the plants on both sides from being so crowded were poor specimens the flowers were allowed to fertilise themselves spontaneously under a net the crossed plants produced thirtyseven capsules the selffertilised plants only eighteen or as 100 to 47 the former contained on an average 362 seeds per capsule and the latter 338 seeds or as 100 to 93 combining these data ie number of capsules and average number of seeds the crowded crossed plants produced seeds compared with the selffertilised as 100 to 45 these latter seeds however were decidedly heavier a hundred weighing 4164 grains than those from the capsules on the crossed plants of which a hundred weighed 3679 grains and this probably was due to the fewer capsules borne by the selffertilised plants having been better nourished we thus see that the crossed plants in this the first generation when grown under favourable conditions and when grown under unfavourable conditions from being much crowded greatly exceeded in height and in the number of capsules produced and slightly in the number of seeds per capsule the selffertilised plants  crossed and selffertilised plants of the second generation  flowers on the crossed plants of the last generation table 21 were crossed by pollen from distinct plants of the same generation and flowers on the selffertilised plants were fertilised by pollen from the same flower the seeds thus produced were treated in every respect as before and we have in table 22 the result  table 22 ipomoea purpurea second generation  heights of plants in inches  column 1

a long time taller than the opposed crossed plant though at last beaten by it the average height of the six crossed plants is 8416 inches whilst that of the six selffertilised plants is 6633 inches or as 100 to 79  crossed and selffertilised plants of the third generation  seeds from the crossed plants of the last generation table 22 again crossed and from the selffertilised plants again selffertilised were treated in all respects exactly as before with the following result  table 23 ipomoea purpurea third generation  heights of plants in inches  column 1 number name of pot  column 2

all the crossed plants are higher than their antagonists their average height is 7741 inches whereas that of the selffertilised is 5283 inches or as 100 to 68  i attended closely to the fertility of the plants of this third generation thirty flowers on the crossed plants were crossed with pollen from other crossed plants of the same generation and the twentysix capsules thus produced contained on an average 473 seeds whilst thirty flowers on the selffertilised plants fertilised with the pollen from the same flower produced twentythree capsules each containing 443 seeds thus the average number of seeds in the crossed capsules was to that in the selffertilised capsules as 100 to 94 a hundred of the crossed seeds weighed 4327 grains whilst a hundred of the selffertilised seeds weighed only 3763 grains many of these lighter selffertilised seeds placed on damp sand germinated before the crossed thus thirtysix of the former germinated whilst only thirteen of the latter or crossed seeds germinated in pot 1 the three crossed plants produced spontaneously under the net besides the twentysix artificially crossfertilised capsules seventyseven selffertilised capsules containing on an average 441 seeds whilst the three selffertilised plants produced spontaneously besides the twentythree artificially selffertilised capsules only twentynine selffertilised capsules containing on an average 414 seeds therefore the average number of seeds in the two lots of spontaneously selffertilised capsules was as 100 to 94 taking into consideration the number of capsules together with the average number of seeds the crossed plants spontaneously selffertilised produced seeds in comparison with the selffertilised plants spontaneously selffertilised in the proportion of 100 to 35 by whatever method the fertility of these plants is compared the crossed are more fertile than the selffertilised plants  i tried in several ways the comparative vigour and powers of growth of the crossed and selffertilised plants of this third generation thus four selffertilised seeds which had just germinated were planted on one side of a pot and after an interval of fortyeight hours four crossed seeds in the same state of germination were planted on the opposite side and the pot was kept in the hothouse i thought that the advantage thus given to the selffertilised seedlings would have been so great that they would never have been beaten by the crossed ones they were not beaten until all had grown to a height of 18 inches and the degree to which they were finally beaten is shown in table 24 we here see that the average height of the four crossed plants is 7662 and of the four selffertilised plants 6587 inches or as 100 to 86 therefore less than when both sides started fair

sown out of doors late in the summer and therefore under unfavourable conditions and a single stick was given to each lot of plants to twine up the two lots were sufficiently separate so as not to interfere with each others growth and the ground was clear of weeds as soon as they were killed by the first frost and there was no difference in their hardiness the two tallest crossed plants were found to be 245 and 225 inches whilst the two tallest selffertilised plants were only 15 and 125 inches in height or as 100 to 59  i likewise sowed at the same time two lots of the same seeds in a part of the garden which was shady and covered with weeds the crossed seedlings from the first looked the most healthy but they twined up a stick only to a height of 7 14 inches whilst the selffertilised were not able to twine at all and the tallest of them was only 3 12 inches in height  lastly two lots of the same seeds were sown in the midst of a bed of candytuft iberis growing vigorously the seedlings came up but all the selffertilised ones soon died excepting one which never twined and grew to a height of only 4 inches many of the crossed seedlings on the other hand survived and some twined up the stems of the iberis to the height of 11 inches these cases prove that the crossed seedlings have an immense advantage over the selffertilised both when growing isolated under very unfavourable conditions and when put into competition with each other or with other plants as would happen in a state of nature  crossed and selffertilised plants of the fourth generation  seedlings raised as before from the crossed and selffertilised plants of the third generation in table 23 gave results as follows  table 25 ipomoea purpurea fourth generation  heights of plants in

or as 100 to 86 this smaller difference relatively to that in the former generations may be attributed to the plants having been raised during the depth of winter and consequently to their not having grown vigorously as was shown by their general appearance and from several of them never reaching the summits of the rods in pot 2 one of the selffertilised plants was for a long time taller by two inches than its opponent but was ultimately beaten by it so that all the crossed plants exceeded their opponents in height of twentyeight capsules produced by the crossed plants fertilised by pollen from a distinct plant each contained on an average 475 seeds of twentyseven selffertilised capsules on the selffertilised plants each contained on an average 447 seeds so that the proportion of seeds in the crossed and selffertilised capsules was as 100 to 94  some of the same seeds from which the plants in table 25 had been raised were planted after they had germinated on damp sand in a square tub in which a large brugmansia had long been growing the soil was extremely poor and full of roots six crossed seeds were planted in one corner and six selffertilised seeds in the opposite corner all the seedlings from the latter soon died excepting one and this grew to the height of only 1 12 inches of the crossed plants three survived and they grew to the height of 2 12 inches but were not able to twine round a stick nevertheless to my surprise they produced some small miserable flowers the crossed plants thus had a decided advantage over the selffertilised plants under this extremity of bad conditions  crossed and selffertilised plants of the fifth generation  these were raised in the same manner as before and when measured gave the following results  table 26 ipomoea purpurea fifth

inches or as 100 to 75 every crossed plant exceeded its antagonist in height in pot 1 the middle plant on the crossed side was slightly injured whilst young by a blow and was for a time beaten by its opponent but ultimately recovered the usual superiority the crossed plants produced spontaneously a vast number more capsules than did the selffertilised plants and the capsules of the former contained on an average 337 seeds whilst those of the latter contained only 30 per capsule or as 100 to 89 but looking only to the artificially fertilised capsules those on the crossed plants again crossed contained on an average 446 seeds whilst those on the selffertilised plants again selffertilised contained 477 seeds so that the selffertilised capsules were the more fertile of the two and of this unusual fact i can offer no explanation  crossed and selffertilised plants of the sixth generation  these were raised in the usual manner with the following result i should state that there were originally eight plants on each side but as two of the selffertilised became extremely unhealthy and never grew to near their full height these as well as their opponents have been struck out of the list if they had been retained they would have made the average height of the crossed plants unfairly greater than that of the selffertilised i have acted in the same manner in a few other instances when one of a pair plainly became very unhealthy  table 27  ipomoea purpurea sixth generation  heights of plants in inches  column 1 number name of pot  column 2 crossed plants  column 3

crossed plants is here 875 and of the six selffertilised plants 6316 or as 100 to 72 this large difference was chiefly due to most of the plants especially the selffertilised ones having become unhealthy towards the close of their growth and they were severely attacked by aphides from this cause nothing can be inferred with respect to their relative fertility in this generation we have the first instance of a selffertilised plant in pot 2 exceeding though only by half an inch its crossed opponent this victory was fairly won after a long struggle at first the selffertilised plant was several inches taller than its opponent but when the latter was 4 12 feet high it had grown equal it then grew a little taller than the selffertilised plant but was ultimately beaten by it to the extent of half an inch as shown in table 27 i was so much surprised at this case that i saved the selffertilised seeds of this plant which i will call the hero and experimented on its descendants as will hereafter be described  besides the plants included in table 27 nine crossed and nine selffertilised plants of the same lot were raised in two other pots 4 and 5 these pots had been kept in the hothouse but from want of room were whilst the plants were young suddenly moved during very cold weather into the coldest part of the greenhouse they all suffered greatly and never quite recovered after a fortnight only two of the nine selffertilised seedlings were alive whilst seven of the crossed survived the tallest of these latter plants when measured was 47 inches in height whilst the tallest of the two surviving selffertilised plants was only 32 inches here again we see how much more vigorous the crossed plants are than the selffertilised  crossed and selffertilised plants of the seventh generation  these were raised as heretofore with the following result  table 28 ipomoea purpurea seventh generation  heights of plants in inches  column 1 number name of pot  column 2 crossed

inch their average height is 8394 inches and that of the selffertilised plants 6825 or as 100 to 81 these plants after growing to their full height became very unhealthy and infested with aphides just when the seeds were setting so that many of the capsules failed and nothing can be said on their relative fertility  crossed and selffertilised plants of the eighth generation  as just stated the plants of the last generation from which the present ones were raised were very unhealthy and their seeds of unusually small size and this probably accounts for the two lots behaving differently to what they did in any of the previous or succeeding generations many of the selffertilised seeds germinated before the crossed ones and these were of course rejected when the crossed seedlings in table 29 had grown to a height of between 1 and 2 feet they were all or almost all shorter than their selffertilised opponents but were not then measured when they had acquired an average height of 3228 inches that of the selffertilised plants was 4068 or as 100 to 122 moreover every one of the selffertilised plants with a single exception exceeded its crossed opponent when however the crossed plants had grown to an average height of 7756 inches they just exceeded namely by 7 of an inch the average height of the selffertilised plants but two of the latter were still taller than their crossed opponents i was so much astonished at this whole case that i tied string to the summits of the rods the plants being thus allowed to continue climbing upwards when their growth was complete they were untwined stretched straight and measured the crossed plants had now almost regained their accustomed superiority as may be seen in table 29  the average height of the eight crossed plants is here 11325 inches and that of the selffertilised plants 9665 or as 100 to 85 nevertheless two of the selffertilised plants as may be seen in table 29 were still higher than their crossed opponents the latter manifestly had much thicker stems and many more lateral branches and looked altogether more vigorous than the selffertilised plants and generally flowered before them the earlier flowers produced by these selffertilised plants did not set any capsules and their anthers contained only a small amount of pollen but to this subject i shall return nevertheless capsules produced by two other selffertilised plants of the same lot not included in table 29 which had been highly favoured by being grown in separate pots contained the large average number of 51 seeds per capsule  table 29

generation  the plants of this generation were raised in the same manner as before with the result shown in table 210  the fourteen crossed plants average in height 8139 inches and the fourteen selffertilised plants 6407 or as 100 to 79 one selffertilised plant in pot 3 exceeded and one in pot 4 equalled in height its opponent the selffertilised plants showed no sign of inheriting the precocious growth of their parents this having been due as it would appear to the abnormal state of the seeds from the unhealthiness of their parents the fourteen selffertilised plants yielded only forty spontaneously selffertilised capsules to which must be added seven the product of ten flowers artificially selffertilised on the other hand the fourteen crossed plants yielded 152 spontaneously selffertilised capsules but thirtysix flowers on these plants were crossed yielding thirtythree capsules and these flowers would probably have produced about thirty spontaneously selffertilised capsules therefore an equal number of the crossed and selffertilised plants would have produced capsules in the proportion of about 182 to 47 or as 100 to 26 another phenomenon was well pronounced in this generation but i believe had occurred previously to a slight extent namely that most of the flowers on the selffertilised plants were somewhat monstrous the monstrosity consisted in the corolla being irregularly split so that it did not open properly with one or two of the stamens slightly foliaceous coloured and firmly coherent to the corolla i observed this monstrosity in only one flower on the crossed plants the selffertilised plants if well nourished would almost certainly in a few more generations have produced double flowers for they had already become in some degree sterile 21

table 210 again intercrossed and from the selffertilised again selffertilised as one of the crossed plants in pot 1 in table 211 became much diseased having crumpled leaves and producing hardly any capsules it and its opponent have been struck out of the table  table 211 ipomoea purpurea tenth generation  heights of plants in inches  column 1 number name of pot  column 2 crossed plants  column 3

average 937 inches and the five selffertilised only 504 or as 100 to 54 this difference however is so great that it must be looked at as in part accidental the six crossed plants the diseased one here included yielded spontaneously 101 capsules and the six selffertilised plants 88 the latter being chiefly produced by one of the plants but as the diseased plant which yielded hardly any seed is here included the ratio of 101 to 88 does not fairly give the relative fertility of the two lots the stems of the six crossed plants looked so much finer than those of the six selffertilised plants that after the capsules had been gathered and most of the leaves had fallen off they were weighed those of the crossed plants weighed 2693 grains whilst those of the selffertilised plants weighed only 1173 grains or as 100 to 44 but as the diseased and dwarfed crossed plant is here included the superiority of the former in weight was really greater  the effects on the offspring of crossing different flowers on the same plant instead of crossing distinct individuals  in all the foregoing experiments seedlings from flowers crossed by pollen from a distinct plant though in the later generations more or less closely related were put into competition with and almost invariably proved markedly superior in height to the offspring from selffertilised flowers i wished therefore to ascertain whether a cross between two flowers on the same plant would give to the offspring any superiority over the offspring from flowers fertilised with their own pollen i procured some fresh seed and raised two plants which were covered with a net and several of their flowers were crossed with pollen from a distinct flower on the same plant twentynine capsules thus produced contained on an average 486 seeds per capsule and 100 of these seeds weighed 3677 grains several other flowers were fertilised with their own pollen and twentysix capsules thus produced contained on an average 442 seeds per capsule 100 of which weighed 4261 grains so that a cross of this kind appears to have increased slightly the number of seeds per capsule in the ratio of 100 to 91 but these crossed seeds were lighter than the selffertilised in the ratio of 86 to 100 i doubt however from other observations whether these results are fully trustworthy the two lots of seeds after germinating on sand were planted in pairs on the opposite sides of nine pots and were treated in every respect like the plants in the previous experiments the remaining seeds some in a state of germination and some not so were sown on the opposite sides of a large pot number 10 and the four tallest plants on each side of this pot were measured the result is shown in table 212  table 212 ipomoea purpurea  heights of plants in inches

selffertilised plants 7741 inches or as 100 to 106 looking to each pair it may be seen that only thirteen of the crossed plants whilst eighteen of the selffertilised plants exceed their opponents a record was kept with respect to the plant which flowered first in each pot and only two of the crossed flowered before one of the selffertilised in the same pot whilst eight of the selffertilised flowered first it thus appears that the crossed plants are slightly inferior in height and in earliness of flowering to the selffertilised but the inferiority in height is so small namely as 100 to 106 that i should have felt very doubtful on this head had i not cut down all the plants except those in the crowded pot number 10 close to the ground and weighed them the twentyseven crossed plants weighed 16 12 ounces and the twentyseven selffertilised plants 20 12 ounces and this gives a ratio of 100 to 124  a selffertilised plant of the same parentage as those in table 212 had been raised in a separate pot for a distinct purpose and it proved partially sterile the anthers containing very little pollen several flowers on this plant were crossed with the little pollen which could be obtained from the other flowers on the same plant and other flowers were selffertilised from the seeds thus produced four crossed and four selffertilised plants were raised which were planted in the usual manner on the opposite sides of two pots all these four crossed plants were inferior in height to their opponents they averaged 7818 inches whilst the four selffertilised plants averaged 848 inches or as 100 to 108 22 from one of these selffertilised plants spontaneously selffertilised i gathered twentyfour capsules and they contained on an average only 32 seeds per capsule so that this plant had apparently inherited some of the sterility of its parent this case therefore confirms the last taking all the evidence together we must conclude that these strictly selffertilised plants grew a little taller were heavier and generally flowered before those derived from a cross between two flowers on the same plant these latter plants thus present a wonderful contrast with those derived from a cross between two distinct individuals  the effects on the offspring of a cross with a distinct or fresh stock belonging to the same variety  from the two foregoing series of experiments we see firstly the good effects during several successive generations of a cross between distinct plants although these were in some degree interrelated and had been grown under nearly the same conditions and secondly the absence of all such good effects from a cross between flowers on the same plant the comparison in both cases being made with the offspring of flowers fertilised with their own pollen the experiments now to be given show how powerfully and beneficially plants which have been intercrossed during many successive generations having been kept all the time under nearly uniform conditions are affected by a cross with another plant belonging to the same variety but to a distinct family or stock which had grown under different conditions  several flowers on the crossed plants of the ninth generation in table 210 were crossed with pollen from another crossed plant of the same lot the seedlings thus raised formed the tenth intercrossed generation and i will call them the intercrossed plants several other flowers on the same crossed plants of the ninth generation were fertilised not having been castrated with pollen taken from plants of the same variety but belonging to a distinct family which had been grown in a distant garden at colchester and therefore under somewhat different conditions the capsules produced by this cross contained to my surprise fewer and lighter seeds than did the capsules of the intercrossed plants but this i think must have been accidental the seedlings raised from them i will call the colchestercrossed the two lots of seeds after germinating on sand were planted in the usual manner on the opposite sides of five pots and the remaining seeds whether or not in a state of germination were thickly sown on the opposite sides of a very large pot number 6 in table 213 in three of the six pots after the young plants had twined a short way up their sticks one of the colchestercrossed plants was much taller than any one of the intercrossed plants on the opposite side of the same pot and in the three other pots somewhat taller i should state that two of the colchestercrossed plants in pot 4 when about twothirds grown became much diseased and were together with their intercrossed opponents rejected the remaining nineteen plants when almost fully grown were measured with the following result  table 213 ipomoea

opponent the average height of the colchestercrossed is 8403 inches and that of the intercrossed 6578 inches or as 100 to 78 with respect to the fertility of the two lots it was too troublesome to collect and count the capsules on all the plants so i selected two of the best pots 5 and 6 and in these the colchestercrossed produced 269 mature and halfmature capsules whilst an equal number of the intercrossed plants produced only 154 capsules or as 100 to 57 by weight the capsules from the colchestercrossed plants were to those from the intercrossed plants as 100 to 51 so that the former probably contained a somewhat larger average number of seeds  we learn from this important experiment that plants in some degree related which had been intercrossed during the nine previous generations when they were fertilised with pollen from a fresh stock yielded seedlings as superior to the seedlings of the tenth intercrossed generation as these latter were to the selffertilised plants of the corresponding generation for if we look to the plants of the ninth generation in table 210 and these offer in most respects the fairest standard of comparison we find that the intercrossed plants were in height to the selffertilised as 100 to 79 and in fertility as 100 to 26 whilst the colchestercrossed plants are in height to the intercrossed as 100 to 78 and in fertility as 100 to 51  the descendants of the selffertilised plant named hero which appeared in the sixth selffertilised generation  in the five generations before the sixth the crossed plant of each pair was taller than its selffertilised opponent but in the sixth generation table 27 pot 2 the hero appeared which after a long and dubious struggle conquered its crossed opponent though by only half an inch i was so much surprised at this fact that i resolved to ascertain whether this plant would transmit its powers of growth to its seedlings several flowers on hero were therefore fertilised with their own pollen and the seedlings thus raised were put into competition with selffertilised and intercrossed plants of the corresponding generation the three lots of seedlings thus all belong to the seventh generation their relative heights are shown in tables 214 and 215  table 214 ipomoea purpurea  heights of plants in inches  column 1 number name of pot  column 2 selffertilised plants of the

2   74 28   38  total  44725   37550  the average height of the six selffertilised children of hero is 7454 inches whilst that of the ordinary selffertilised plants of the corresponding generation is only 6258 inches or as 100 to 84  table 215 ipomoea purpurea  heights of plants in inches  column 1 number name of pot  column 2 selffertilised plants of the seventh generation children of hero

children of hero is 8891 inches whilst that of the intercrossed plants is 8416 or as 100 to 95 we thus see that the selffertilised children of hero certainly inherit the powers of growth of their parents for they greatly exceed in height the selffertilised offspring of the other selffertilised plants and even exceed by a trifle the intercrossed plantsall of the corresponding generation  several flowers on the selffertilised children of hero in table 214 were fertilised with pollen from the same flower and from the seeds thus produced selffertilised plants of the eighth generation grandchildren of hero were raised several other flowers on the same plants were crossed with pollen from the other children of hero the seedlings raised from this cross may be considered as the offspring of the union of brothers and sisters the result of the competition between these two sets of seedlings namely selffertilised and the offspring of brothers and sisters is given in table 216

 total  103700    97316  the average height of the thirteen selffertilised grandchildren of hero is 7976 inches and that of the grandchildren from a cross between the selffertilised children is 7485 or as 100 to 94 but in pot 4 one of the crossed plants grew only to a height of 15 12 inches and if this plant and its opponent are struck out as would be the fairest plan the average height of the crossed plants exceeds only by a fraction of an inch that of the selffertilised plants it is therefore clear that a cross between the selffertilised children of hero did not produce any beneficial effect worth notice and it is very doubtful whether this negative result can be attributed merely to the fact of brothers and sisters having been united for the ordinary intercrossed plants of the several successive generations must often have been derived from the union of brothers and sisters as shown in chapter 1 and yet all of them were greatly superior to the selffertilised plants we are therefore driven to the suspicion which we shall soon see strengthened that hero transmitted to its offspring a peculiar constitution adapted for selffertilisation  it would appear that the selffertilised descendants of hero have not only inherited from hero a power of growth equal to that of the ordinary intercrossed plants but have become more fertile when selffertilised than is usual with the plants of the present species the flowers on the selffertilised grandchildren of hero in table 216 the eighth generation of selffertilised plants were fertilised with their own pollen and produced plenty of capsules ten of which though this is too few a number for a safe average contained 52 seeds per capsulea higher average than was observed in any other case with the selffertilised plants the anthers produced by these selffertilised grandchildren were also as well developed and contained as much pollen as those on the intercrossed plants of the corresponding generation whereas this was not the case with the ordinary selffertilised plants of the later generations nevertheless some few of the flowers produced by the grandchildren of hero were slightly monstrous like those of the ordinary selffertilised plants of the later generations in order not to recur to the subject of fertility i may add that twentyone selffertilised capsules spontaneously produced by the greatgrandchildren of hero forming the ninth generation of selffertilised plants contained on an average 447 seeds and this is as high an average as the selffertilised flowers of any generation usually yielded  several flowers on the selffertilised grandchildren of hero in table 216 were fertilised with pollen from the same flower and the seedlings raised from them greatgrandchildren of hero formed the ninth selffertilised generation several other flowers were crossed with pollen from another grandchild so that they may be considered as the offspring of brothers and sisters and the seedlings thus raised may be called the intercrossed greatgrandchildren and lastly other flowers were fertilised with pollen from a distinct stock and the seedlings thus raised may be called the colchestercrossed greatgrandchildren in my anxiety to see what the result would be i unfortunately planted the three lots of seeds after they had germinated on sand in the hothouse in the middle of winter and in consequence of this the seedlings twenty in number of each kind became very unhealthy some growing only a few inches in height and very few to their proper height the result therefore cannot be fully trusted and it would be useless to give the measurements in detail in order to strike as fair an average as possible i first excluded all the plants under 50 inches in height thus rejecting all the most unhealthy plants the six selffertilised thus left were on an average 6686 inches high the eight intercrossed plants 632 high and the seven colchestercrossed 6537 high so that there was not much difference between the three sets the selffertilised plants having a slight advantage nor was there any great difference when only the plants under 36 inches in height were excluded nor again when all the plants however much dwarfed and unhealthy were included in this latter case the colchestercrossed gave the lowest average of all and if these plants had been in any marked manner superior to the other two lots as from my former experience i fully expected they would have been i cannot but think that some vestige of such superiority would have been evident notwithstanding the very unhealthy condition of most of the plants no advantage as far as we can judge was derived from intercrossing two of the grandchildren of hero any more than when two of the children were crossed it appears therefore that hero and its descendants have varied from the common type not only in acquiring great power of growth and increased fertility when subjected to selffertilisation but in not profiting from a cross with a distinct stock and this latter fact if trustworthy is a unique case as far as i have observed in all my experiments  summary on the growth

crossed plants being taken as 100 on the right hand the mean heights of the crossed and selffertilised plants of all the generations taken together are shown as eleven pairs of unequal vertical lines  the mean height of the selffertilised plants in each of the ten generations is also shown in the diagram 21 that of the intercrossed plants being taken at 100 and on the right side we see the relative heights of the seventythree intercrossed plants and of the seventythree selffertilised plants the difference in height between the crossed and selffertilised plants will perhaps be best appreciated by an illustration if all the men in a country were on an average 6 feet high and there were some families which had been long and closely interbred these would be almost dwarfs their average height during ten generations being only 4 feet 8 14 inches  it should be especially observed that the average difference between the crossed and selffertilised plants is not due to a few of the former having grown to an extraordinary height or to a few of the selffertilised being extremely short but to all the crossed plants having surpassed their selffertilised opponents with the few following exceptions the first occurred in the sixth generation in which the plant named hero appeared two in the eighth generation but the selffertilised plants in this generation were in an anomalous condition as they grew at first at an unusual rate and conquered for a time the opposed crossed plants and two exceptions in the ninth generation though one of these plants only equalled its crossed opponent therefore of the seventythree crossed plants sixtyeight grew to a greater height than the selffertilised plants to which they were opposed  in the righthand column of figures the difference in height between the crossed and selffertilised plants in the successive generations is seen to fluctuate much as might indeed have been expected from the small number of plants measured in each generation being insufficient to give a fair average it should be remembered that the absolute height of the plants goes for nothing as each pair was measured as soon as one of them had twined up to the summit of its rod the great difference in the tenth generation namely 100 to 54 no doubt was partly accidental though when these plants were weighed the difference was even greater namely 100 to 44 the smallest amount of difference occurred in the fourth and the eighth generations and this was apparently due to both the crossed and selffertilised plants having become unhealthy which prevented the former attaining their usual degree of superiority this was an unfortunate circumstance but my experiments were not thus vitiated as both lots of plants were exposed to the same conditions whether favourable or unfavourable  there is reason to believe that the flowers of this ipomoea when growing out of doors are habitually crossed by insects so that the first seedlings which i raised from purchased seeds were probably the offspring of a cross i infer that this is the case firstly from humblebees often visiting the flowers and from the quantity of pollen left by them on the stigmas of such flowers and secondly from the plants raised from the same lot of seed varying greatly in the colour of their flowers for as we shall hereafter see this indicates much intercrossing 23 verlot says sur la production des variétés 1865 page 66 that certain varieties of a closely allied plant the convolvulus tricolor cannot be kept pure unless grown at a distance from all other varieties it is therefore remarkable that the plants raised by me from flowers which were in all probability selffertilised for the first time after many generations of crossing should have been so markedly inferior in height to the intercrossed plants as they were namely as 76 to 100 as the plants which were selffertilised in each succeeding generation necessarily became much more closely interbred in the later than in the earlier generations it might have been expected that the difference in height between them and the crossed plants would have gone on increasing but so far is this from being the case that the difference between the two sets of plants in the seventh eighth and ninth generations taken together is less than in the first and second generations together when however we remember that the selffertilised and crossed plants are all descended from the same motherplant that many of the crossed plants in each generation were related often closely related and that all were exposed to the same conditions which as we shall hereafter find is a very important circumstance it is not at all surprising that the difference between them should have somewhat decreased in the later generations it is on the contrary an astonishing fact that the crossed plants should have been victorious even to a slight degree over the selffertilised plants of the later generations  the much greater constitutional vigour of the crossed than of the selffertilised plants was proved on five occasions in various ways namely by exposing them while young to a low temperature or to a sudden change of temperature or by growing them under very unfavourable conditions in competition with fullgrown plants of other kinds  with respect to the productiveness of the crossed and selffertilised plants of the successive generations my observations unfortunately were not made on any uniform plan partly from the want of time and partly from not having at first intended to observe more than a single generation a summary of the results is here given in a tabulated form the fertility of the crossed plants being taken as 100  table 218 ratio of productiveness of crossed and selffertilised plants ipomoea purpurea  first generation of crossed and selffertilised plants growing in competition with one another  sixtyfive capsules produced from flowers on five crossed plants fertilised by pollen from a distinct plant and fiftyfive capsules produced from flowers on five selffertilised plants fertilised by their own pollen contained seeds in the proportion of  100 to 93  fiftysix spontaneously selffertilised capsules on the above five crossed plants and twentyfive spontaneously selffertilised capsules on the above five selffertilised plants yielded seeds in the proportion of  100 to 99  combining the total number of capsules produced by these plants and the average number of seeds in each the above crossed and selffertilised plants yielded seeds in the proportion of  100 to 64  other plants of this first generation grown under unfavourable conditions and spontaneously selffertilised yielded seeds in the proportion of  100 to 45  third generation of crossed and selffertilised plants  crossed capsules compared with selffertilised capsules contained seeds in the ratio of  100 to 94  an equal number of crossed and selffertilised plants both spontaneously selffertilised produced capsules in the ratio of  100 to 38  and these capsules contained seeds in the ratio of  100 to 94  combining these data the productiveness of the crossed to the selffertilised plants both spontaneously selffertilised was as  100 to 35  fourth generation of crossed and selffertilised plants  capsules from flowers on the crossed plants fertilised by pollen from another plant and capsules from flowers on the selffertilised plants fertilised with their own pollen contained seeds in the proportion of  100 to 94  fifth generation of crossed and selffertilised plants  the crossed plants produced spontaneously a vast number more pods not actually counted than the selffertilised and these contained seeds in the proportion of  100 to 89  ninth generation of crossed and selffertilised plants  fourteen crossed plants spontaneously selffertilised and fourteen selffertilised plants spontaneously selffertilised yielded capsules the average number of seeds per capsule not having been ascertained in the proportion of  100 to 26  plants derived from a crossed with a fresh stock compared with intercrossed plants  the offspring of intercrossed plants of the ninth generation crossed by a fresh stock compared with plants of the same stock intercrossed during ten generations both sets of plants left uncovered and naturally fertilised produced capsules by weight as  100 to 51  we see in this table that the crossed plants are always in some degree more productive than the selffertilised plants by whatever standard they are compared the degree differs greatly but this depends chiefly on whether an average was taken of the seeds alone or of the capsules alone or of both combined the relative superiority of the crossed plants is chiefly due to their producing a much greater number of capsules and not to each capsule containing a larger average number of seeds for instance in the third generation the crossed and selffertilised plants produced capsules in the ratio of 100 to 38 whilst the seeds in the capsules on the crossed plants were to those on the selffertilised plants only as 100 to 94 in the eighth generation the capsules on two selffertilised plants not included in table 218 grown in separate pots and thus not subjected to any competition yielded the large average of 51 seeds the smaller number of capsules produced by the selffertilised plants may be in part but not altogether attributed to their lessened size or height this being chiefly due to their lessened constitutional vigour so that they were not able to compete with the crossed plants growing in the same pots the seeds produced by the crossed flowers on the crossed plants were not always heavier than the selffertilised seeds on the selffertilised plants the lighter seeds whether produced from crossed or selffertilised flowers generally germinated before the heavier seeds i may add that the crossed plants with very few exceptions flowered before their selffertilised opponents as might have been expected from their greater height and vigour  the impaired fertility of the selffertilised plants was shown in another way namely by their anthers being smaller than those in the flowers on the crossed plants this was first observed in the seventh generation but may have occurred earlier several anthers from flowers on the crossed and selffertilised plants of the eighth generation were compared under the microscope and those from the former were generally longer and plainly broader than the anthers of the selffertilised plants the quantity of pollen contained in one of the latter was as far as could be judged by the eye about half of that contained in one from a crossed plant the impaired fertility of the selffertilised plants of the eighth generation was also shown in another manner which may often be observed in hybridsnamely by the firstformed flowers being sterile for instance the fifteen first flowers on a selffertilised plant of one of the later generations were carefully fertilised with their own pollen and eight of them dropped off at the same time fifteen flowers on a crossed plant growing in the same pot were selffertilised and only one dropped off on two other crossed plants of the same generation several of the earliest flowers were observed to fertilise themselves and to produce capsules in the plants of the ninth and i believe of some previous generations very many of the flowers as already stated were slightly monstrous and this probably was connected with their lessened fertility  all the selffertilised plants of the seventh generation and i believe of one or two previous generations produced flowers of exactly the same tint namely of a rich dark purple so did all the plants without any exception in the three succeeding generations of selffertilised plants and very many were raised on account of other experiments in progress not here recorded my attention was first called to this fact by my gardener remarking that there was no occasion to label the selffertilised plants as they could always be known by their colour the flowers were as uniform in tint as those of a wild species growing in a state of nature whether the same tint occurred as is probable in the earlier generations neither my gardener nor self could recollect the flowers on the plants which were first raised from purchased seed as well as during the first few generations varied much in the depth of the purple tint many were more or less pink and occasionally a white variety appeared the crossed plants continued to the tenth generation to vary in the same manner as before but to a much less degree owing probably to their having become more or less closely interrelated we must therefore attribute the extraordinary uniformity of colour in the flowers on the plants of the seventh and succeeding selffertilised generations to inheritance not having been interfered with by crosses during several preceding generations in combination with the conditions of life having been very uniform  a plant appeared in the sixth selffertilised generation named the hero which exceeded by a little in height its crossed antagonist and which transmitted its powers of growth and increased selffertility to its children and grandchildren a cross between the children of hero did not give to the grandchildren any advantage over the selffertilised grandchildren raised from the selffertilised children and as far as my observations can be trusted which were made on very unhealthy plants the greatgrandchildren raised from intercrossing the grandchildren had no advantage over the seedlings from the grandchildren the product of continued selffertilisation and what is far more remarkable the greatgrandchildren raised by crossing the grandchildren with a fresh stock had no advantage over either the intercrossed or selffertilised greatgrandchildren it thus appears that hero and its descendants differed in constitution in an extraordinary manner from ordinary plants of the present species  although the plants raised during ten successive generations from crosses between distinct yet interrelated plants almost invariably exceeded in height constitutional vigour and fertility their selffertilised opponents it has been proved that seedlings raised by intercrossing flowers on the same plant are by no means superior on the contrary are somewhat inferior in height and weight to seedlings raised from flowers fertilised with their own pollen this is a remarkable fact which seems to indicate that selffertilisation is in some manner more advantageous than crossing unless the cross brings with it as is generally the case some decided and preponderant advantage but to this subject i shall recur in a future chapter  the benefits which so generally follow from a cross between two plants apparently depend on the two differing somewhat in constitution or character this is shown by the seedlings from the intercrossed plants of the ninth generation when crossed with pollen from a fresh stock being as superior in height and almost as superior in fertility to the again intercrossed plants as these latter were to seedlings from selffertilised plants of the corresponding generation we thus learn the important fact that the mere act of crossing two distinct plants which are in some degree interrelated and which have been long subjected to nearly the same conditions does little good as compared with that from a cross between plants belonging to different stocks or families and which have been subjected to somewhat different conditions we may attribute the good derived from the crossing of the intercrossed plants during the ten successive generations to their still differing somewhat in constitution or character as was indeed proved by their flowers still differing somewhat in colour but the several conclusions which may be deduced from the experiments on ipomoea will be more fully considered in the final chapters after all my other observations have been given    chapter iii  scrophulariaceae gesneriaceae labiatae etc  mimulus luteus height vigour and fertility of

luteus  the plants which i raised from purchased seed varied greatly in the colour of their flowers so that hardly two individuals were quite alike the corolla being of all shades of yellow with the most diversified blotches of purple crimson orange and coppery brown but these plants differed in no other respect 31 i sent several specimens with variously coloured flowers to kew and dr hooker informs me that they all consisted of mimulus luteus the flowers with much red have been named by horticulturists as var youngiana the flowers are evidently well adapted for fertilisation by the agency of insects and in the case of a closely allied species mimulus rosea i have watched bees entering the flowers thus getting their backs well dusted with pollen and when they entered another flower the pollen was licked off their backs by the twolipped stigma the lips of which are irritable and close like a forceps on the pollengrains if no pollen is enclosed between the lips these open again after a time mr kitchener has ingeniously explained the use of these movements namely to prevent the selffertilisation of the flower 32 a years botany 1874 page 118 if a bee with no pollen on its back enters a flower it touches the stigma which quickly closes and when the bee retires dusted with pollen it can leave none on the stigma of the same flower but as soon as it enters any other flower plenty of pollen is left on the stigma which will be thus crossfertilised nevertheless if insects are excluded the flowers fertilise themselves perfectly and produce plenty of seed but i did not ascertain whether this is effected by the stamens increasing in length with advancing age or by the bending down of the pistil the chief interest in my experiments on the present species lies in the appearance in the fourth selffertilised generation of a variety which bore large peculiarlycoloured flowers and grew to a greater height than the other varieties it likewise became more highly selffertile so that this variety resembles the plant named hero which appeared in the sixth selffertilised generation of ipomoea  some flowers on one of the plants raised from the purchased seeds were fertilised with their own pollen and others on the same plant were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant the seeds from twelve capsules thus produced were placed in separate watchglasses for comparison and those from the six crossed capsules appeared to the eye hardly more numerous than those from the six selffertilised capsules but when the seeds were weighed those from the crossed capsules amounted to 102 grain whilst those from the selffertilised capsules were only 81 grain so that the former were either heavier or more numerous than the latter in the ratio of 100 to 79  crossed and selffertilised plants of the first generation  having ascertained by leaving crossed and selffertilised seed on damp sand that they germinated simultaneously both kinds were thickly sown on opposite sides of a broad and rather shallow pan so that the two sets of seedlings which came up at the same time were subjected to the same unfavourable conditions this was a bad method of treatment but this species was one of the first on which i experimented when the crossed seedlings were on an average half an inch high the selffertilised ones were only a quarter of an inch high when grown to their full height under the above unfavourable conditions the four tallest crossed plants averaged 762 and the four tallest selffertilised 587 inches in height or as 100 to 77 ten flowers on the crossed plants were fully expanded before one on the selffertilised plants a few of these plants of both lots were transplanted into a large pot with plenty of good earth and the selffertilised plants not now being subjected to severe competition grew during the following year as tall as the crossed plants but from a case which follows it is doubtful whether they would have long continued equal some flowers on the crossed plants were crossed with pollen from another plant and the capsules thus produced contained a rather greater weight of seed than those on the selffertilised plants again selffertilised  crossed and selffertilised plants of the second generation  seeds from the foregoing plants fertilised in the manner just stated were sown on the opposite sides of a small pot 1 and came up crowded the four tallest crossed seedlings at the time of flowering averaged 8 inches in height whilst the four tallest selffertilised plants averaged only 4 inches crossed seeds were sown by themselves in a second small pot and selffertilised seeds were sown by themselves in a third small pot so that there was no competition whatever between these two lots nevertheless the crossed plants grew from 1 to 2 inches higher on an average than the selffertilised both lots looked equally vigorous but the crossed plants flowered earlier and more profusely than the selffertilised in pot 1 in which the two lots competed with each other the crossed plants flowered first and produced a large number of capsules whilst the selffertilised produced only nineteen the contents of twelve capsules from the crossed flowers on the crossed plants and of twelve capsules from selffertilised flowers on the selffertilised plants were placed in separate watchglasses for comparison and the crossed seeds seemed more numerous by half than the selffertilised  the plants on both sides of pot 1 after they had seeded were cut down and transplanted into a large pot with plenty of good earth and on the following spring when they had grown to a height of between 5 and 6 inches the two lots were equal as occurred in a similar experiment in the last generation but after some weeks the crossed plants exceeded the selffertilised ones on the opposite side of the same pot though not nearly to so great a degree as before when they were subjected to very severe competition  crossed and selffertilised plants of the third generation  crossed seeds from the crossed plants and selffertilised seeds from the selffertilised plants of the last generation were sown thickly on opposite sides of a small pot number 1 the two tallest plants on each side were measured after they had flowered and the two crossed ones were 12 and 7 12 inches and the two selffertilised ones 8 and 5 12 inches in height that is in the ratio of 100 to 69 twenty flowers on the crossed plants were again crossed and produced twenty capsules ten of which contained 133 grain weight of seeds thirty flowers on the selffertilised plants were again selffertilised and produced twentysix capsules ten of the best of which many being very poor contained only 87 grain weight of seeds that is in the ratio of 100 to 65 by weight  the superiority of the crossed over the selffertilised plants was proved in various ways selffertilised seeds were sown on one side of a pot and two days afterwards crossed seeds on the opposite side the two lots of seedlings were equal until they were above half an inch high but when fully grown the two tallest crossed plants attained a height of 12 12 and 8 34 inches whilst the two tallest selffertilised plants were only 8 and 5 12 inches high  in a third pot crossed seeds were sown four days after the selffertilised and the seedlings from the latter had at first as might have been expected an advantage but when the two lots were between 5 and 6 inches in height they were equal and ultimately the three tallest crossed plants were 11 10 and 8 inches whilst the three tallest selffertilised were 12 8 12 and 7 12 inches in height so that there was not much difference between them the crossed plants having an average advantage of only the third of an inch the plants were cut down and without being disturbed were transplanted into a larger pot thus the two lots started fair on the following spring and now the crossed plants showed their inherent superiority for the two tallest were 13 inches whilst the two tallest selffertilised plants were only 11 and 8 12 inches in height or as 100 to 75 the two lots were allowed to fertilise themselves spontaneously the crossed plants produced a large number of capsules whilst the selffertilised produced very few and poor ones the seeds from eight of the capsules on the crossed plants weighed 65 grain whilst those from eight of the capsules on the selffertilised plants weighed only 22 grain or as 100 to 34  the crossed plants in the above three pots as in almost all the previous experiments flowered before the selffertilised this occurred even in the third pot in which the crossed seeds were sown four days after the selffertilised seeds  lastly seeds of both lots were sown on opposite sides of a large pot in which a fuchsia had long been growing so that the earth was full of roots both lots grew miserably but the crossed seedlings had an advantage at all times and ultimately attained to a height of 3 12 inches whilst the selffertilised seedlings never exceeded 1 inch the several foregoing experiments prove in a decisive manner the superiority in constitutional vigour of the crossed over the selffertilised plants  in the three generations now described and taken together the average height of the ten tallest crossed plants was 819 inches and that of the ten tallest selffertilised plants 529 inches the plants having been grown in small pots or as 100 to 65  in the next or fourth selffertilised generation several plants of a new and tall variety appeared which increased in the later selffertilised generations owing to its great selffertility to the complete exclusion of the original kinds the same variety also appeared amongst the crossed plants but as it was not at first regarded with any particular attention i know not how far it was used for raising the intercrossed plants and in the later crossed generations it was rarely present owing to the appearance of this tall variety the comparison of the crossed and selffertilised plants of the fifth and succeeding generations was rendered unfair as all the selffertilised and only a few or none of the crossed plants consisted of it nevertheless the results of the later experiments are in some respects well worth giving   crossed and selffertilised plants of the fourth generation  seeds of the two kinds produced in the usual way from the two sets of plants of the third generation were sown on opposite sides of two pots 1 and 2 but the seedlings were not thinned enough and did not grow well many of the selffertilised plants especially in one of the pots consisted of the new and tall variety above referred to which bore large and almost white flowers marked with crimson blotches i will call it the white variety i believe that it first appeared amongst both the crossed and selffertilised plants of the last generation but neither my gardener nor myself could remember any such variety in the seedlings raised from the purchased seed it must therefore have arisen either through ordinary variation or judging from its appearance amongst both the crossed and selffertilised plants more probably through reversion to a formerly existing variety  in pot 1 the tallest crossed plant was 8 12 inches and the tallest selffertilised 5 inches in height in pot 2 the tallest crossed plant was 6 12 inches and the tallest selffertilised plant which consisted of the white variety 7 inches in height and this was the first instance in my experiments on mimulus in which the tallest selffertilised plant exceeded the tallest crossed nevertheless the two tallest crossed plants taken together were to the two tallest selffertilised plants in height as 100 to 80 as yet the crossed plants were superior to the selffertilised in fertility for twelve flowers on the crossed plants were crossed and yielded ten capsules the seeds of which weighed 171 grain twenty flowers on the selffertilised plants were selffertilised and produced fifteen capsules all appearing poor and the seeds from ten of them weighed only 68 grain so that from an equal number of capsules the crossed seeds were to the selffertilised in weight as 100 to 40  crossed and selffertilised plants of the fifth generation  seeds from both lots of the fourth generation fertilised in the usual manner were sown on opposite sides of three pots when the seedlings flowered most of the selffertilised plants were found to consist of the tall white variety several of the crossed plants in pot 1 likewise belonged to this variety as did a very few in pots 2 and 3 the tallest crossed plant in pot 1 was 7 inches and the tallest selffertilised plant on the opposite side 8 inches in pots 2 and 3 the tallest crossed were 4 12 and 5 12 and the tallest selffertilised 7 and 6 12 inches in height so that the average height of the tallest plants in the two lots was as 100 for the crossed to 126 for the selffertilised and thus we have a complete reversal of what occurred in the four previous generations nevertheless in all three pots the crossed plants retained their habit of flowering before the selffertilised the plants were unhealthy from being crowded and from the extreme heat of the season and were in consequence more or less sterile but the crossed plants were somewhat less sterile than the selffertilised plants  crossed and selffertilised plants of the sixth generation  seeds from plants of the fifth generation crossed and selffertilised in the usual manner were sown on opposite sides of several pots on the selffertilised side every single plant belonged to the tall white variety on the crossed side some plants belonged to this variety but the greater number approached in character to the old and shorter kinds with smaller yellowish flowers blotched with coppery brown when the plants on both sides were from 2 to 3 inches in height they were equal but when fully grown the selffertilised were decidedly the tallest and finest plants but from want of time they were not actually measured in half the pots the first plant which flowered was a selffertilised one and in the other half a crossed one and now another remarkable change was clearly perceived namely that the selffertilised plants had become more selffertile than the crossed the pots were all put under a net to exclude insects and the crossed plants produced spontaneously only fiftyfive capsules whilst the selffertilised plants produced eightyone capsules or as 100 to 147 the seeds from nine capsules of both lots were placed in separate watchglasses for comparison and the selffertilised appeared rather the more numerous besides these spontaneously selffertilised capsules twenty flowers on the crossed plants again crossed yielded sixteen capsules twentyfive flowers on the selffertilised plants again selffertilised yielded seventeen capsules and this is a larger proportional number of capsules than was produced by the selffertilised flowers on the selffertilised plants in the previous generations the contents of ten capsules of both these lots were compared in separate watchglasses and the seeds from the selffertilised appeared decidedly more numerous than those from the crossed plants  crossed and selffertilised plants of the seventh generation  crossed and selffertilised seeds from the crossed and selffertilised plants of the sixth generation were sown in the usual manner on opposite sides of three pots and the seedlings were well and equally thinned every one of the selffertilised plants and many were raised in this as well as in the eighth and ninth generations belonged to the tall white variety their uniformity of character in comparison with the seedlings first raised from the purchased seed was quite remarkable on the other hand the crossed plants differed much in the tints of their flowers but not i think to so great a degree as those first raised i determined this time to measure the plants on both sides carefully the selffertilised seedlings came up rather before the crossed but both lots were for a time of equal height when first measured the average height of the six tallest crossed plants in the three pots was 702 and that of the six tallest selffertilised plants 897 inches or as 100 to 128 when fully grown the same plants were again measured with the result shown in table 318  table 318 mimulus luteus seventh generation  heights of plants in inches  column 1 number name of pot  column 2 crossed plants  column 3 selffertilised plants  pot 1  11 28  19 18

selffertilised 1564 or as 100 to 137  as it is now evident that the tall white variety transmitted its characters faithfully and as the selffertilised plants consisted exclusively of this variety it was manifest that they would always exceed in height the crossed plants which belonged chiefly to the original shorter varieties this line of experiment was therefore discontinued and i tried whether intercrossing two selffertilised plants of the sixth generation growing in distinct pots would give their offspring any advantage over the offspring of flowers on one of the same plants fertilised with their own pollen these latter seedlings formed the seventh generation of selffertilised plants like those in the right hand column in table 318 the crossed plants were the product of six previous selffertilised generations with an intercross in the last generation the seeds were allowed to germinate on sand and were planted in pairs on opposite sides of four pots all the remaining seeds being sown crowded on opposite sides of pot 5 in table 319 the three tallest on each side in this latter pot being alone measured all the plants were twice measuredthe first time whilst young and the average height of the crossed plants to that of the selffertilised was then as 100 to 122 when fully grown they were again measured as in table 319  table 319 mimulus luteus  heights of plants in

intercrossed plants is here 996 inches and that of the sixteen selffertilised plants 1096 or as 100 to 110 so that the intercrossed plants the progenitors of which had been selffertilised for the six previous generations and had been exposed during the whole time to remarkably uniform conditions were somewhat inferior in height to the plants of the seventh selffertilised generation but as we shall presently see that a similar experiment made after two additional generations of selffertilisation gave a different result i know not how far to trust the present one in three of the five pots in table 319 a selffertilised plant flowered first and in the other two a crossed plant these selffertilised plants were remarkably fertile for twenty flowers fertilised with their own pollen produced no less than nineteen very fine capsules  the effects of a cross with a distinct stock  some flowers on the selffertilised plants in pot 4 in table 319 were fertilised with their own pollen and plants of the eighth selffertilised generation were thus raised merely to serve as parents in the following experiment several flowers on these plants were allowed to fertilise themselves spontaneously insects being of course excluded and the plants raised from these seeds formed the ninth selffertilised generation they consisted wholly of the tall white variety with crimson blotches other flowers on the same plants of the eighth selffertilised generation were crossed with pollen taken from another plant of the same lot so that the seedlings thus raised were the offspring of eight previous generations of selffertilisation with an intercross in the last generation these i will call the intercrossed plants lastly other flowers on the same plants of the eighth selffertilised generation were crossed with pollen taken from plants which had been raised from seed procured from a garden at chelsea the chelsea plants bore yellow flowers blotched with red but differed in no other respect they had been grown out of doors whilst mine had been cultivated in pots in the greenhouse for the last eight generations and in a different kind of soil the seedlings raised from this cross with a wholly different stock may be called the chelseacrossed the three lots of seeds thus obtained were allowed to germinate on bare sand and whenever a seed in all three lots or in only two germinated at the same time they were planted in pots superficially divided into three or two compartments the remaining seeds whether or not in a state of germination were thickly sown in three divisions in a large pot 10 in table 320 when the plants had grown to their full height they were measured as shown in table 320 but only the three tallest plants in each of the three divisions in pot 10 were measured  table 320

2162 inches that of the twentyseven intercrossed plants 122 and that of the nineteen selffertilised 1044 but with respect to the latter it will be the fairest plan to strike out two dwarfed ones only 4 inches in height so as not to exaggerate the inferiority of the selffertilised plants and this will raise the average height of the seventeen remaining selffertilised plants to 112 inches therefore the chelseacrossed are to the intercrossed in height as 100 to 56 the chelseacrossed to the selffertilised as 100 to 52 and the intercrossed to the selffertilised as 100 to 92 we thus see how immensely superior in height the chelseacrossed are to the intercrossed and to the selffertilised plants they began to show their superiority when only one inch high they were also when fully grown much more branched with larger leaves and somewhat larger flowers than the plants of the other two lots so that if they had been weighed the ratio would certainly have been much higher than that of 100 to 56 and 52  the intercrossed plants are here to the selffertilised in height as 100 to 92 whereas in the analogous experiment given in table 319 the intercrossed plants from the selffertilised plants of the sixth generation were inferior in height to the selffertilised plants in the ratio of 100 to 110 i doubt whether this discordance in the results of the two experiments can be explained by the selffertilised plants in the present case having been raised from spontaneously selffertilised seeds whereas in the former case they were raised from artificially selffertilised seeds nor by the present plants having been selffertilised during two additional generations though this is a more probable explanation  with respect to fertility the twentyeight chelseacrossed plants produced 272 capsules the twentyseven intercrossed plants produced 24 and the seventeen selffertilised plants 17 capsules all the plants were left uncovered so as to be naturally fertilised and empty capsules were rejected  therefore 20 chelseacrossed plants would have produced 19429 capsules  therefore 20 intercrossed plants would have produced 1777 capsules  therefore 20 selffertilised plants would have produced 2000 capsules  the seeds contained in 8 capsules from the chelseacrossed plants weighed 11 grains  the seeds contained in 8 capsules from the intercrossed plants weighed 051 grains  the seeds contained in 8 capsules from the selffertilised plants weighed 033 grains  if we combine the number of capsules produced together with the average weight of contained seeds we get the following extraordinary ratios  weight of seed produced by the same number of chelseacrossed and intercrossed plants as 100 to 4  weight of seed produced by the same number of chelseacrossed and selffertilised plants as 100 to 3  weight of seeds produced by the same number of intercrossed and selffertilised plants as 100 to 73  it is also a remarkable fact that the chelseacrossed plants exceeded the two other lots in hardiness as greatly as they did in height luxuriance and fertility in the early autumn most of the pots were bedded out in the open ground and this always injures plants which have been long kept in a warm greenhouse all three lots consequently suffered greatly but the chelseacrossed plants much less than the other two lots on the 3rd of october the chelseacrossed plants began to flower again and continued to do so for some time whilst not a single flower was produced by the plants of the other two lots the stems of which were cut almost down to the ground and seemed half dead early in december there was a sharp frost and the stems of chelseacrossed were now cut down but on the 23rd of december they began to shoot up again from the roots whilst all the plants of the other two lots were quite dead  although several of the selffertilised seeds from which the plants in the right hand column in table 320 were raised germinated and were of course rejected before any of those of the other two lots yet in only one of the ten pots did a selffertilised plant flower before the chelseacrossed or the intercrossed plants growing in the same pots the plants of these two latter lots flowered at the same time though the chelseacrossed grew so much taller and more vigorously than the intercrossed  as already stated the flowers of the plants originally raised from the chelsea seeds were yellow and it deserves notice that every one of the twentyeight seedlings raised from the tall white variety fertilised without being castrated with pollen from the chelsea plants produced yellow flowers and this shows how prepotent this colour which is the natural one of the species is over the white colour  the effects on the offspring of intercrossing flowers on the same plant instead of crossing distinct individuals  in all the foregoing experiments the crossed plants were the product of a cross between distinct plants i now selected a very vigorous plant in table 320 raised by fertilising a plant of the eighth selffertilised generation with pollen from the chelsea stock several flowers on this plant were crossed with pollen from other flowers on the same plant and several other flowers were fertilised with their own pollen the seed thus produced was allowed to germinate on bare sand and the seedlings were planted in the usual manner on the opposite sides of six pots all the remaining seeds whether or not in a state of germination were sown thickly in pot 7 the three tallest plants on each side of this latter pot being alone measured as i was in a hurry to learn the result some of these seeds were sown late in the autumn but the plants grew so irregularly during the winter that one crossed plant was 28 12 inches and two others only 4 or less than 4 inches in height as may be seen in table 321 under such circumstances as i have observed in many other cases the result is not in the least trustworthy nevertheless i feel bound to give the

crowded  total   37088   35363  here the average height of the twentytwo crossed plants is 1685 and that of the twentytwo selffertilised plants 1607 or as 100 to 95 but if four of the plants in pot 7 which are much shorter than any of the others are struck out and this would be the fairest plan the twentyone crossed are to the nineteen selffertilised plants in height as 100 to 1006that is are equal all the plants except the crowded ones in pot 8 after being measured were cut down and the eighteen crossed plants weighed 10 ounces whilst the same number of selffertilised plants weighed 10 14 ounces or as 100 to 1025 but if the dwarfed plants in pot 7 had been excluded the selffertilised would have exceeded the crossed in weight in a higher ratio in all the previous experiments in which seedlings were raised from a cross between distinct plants and were put into competition with selffertilised plants the former generally flowered first but in the present case in seven out of the eight pots a selffertilised plant flowered before a crossed one on the opposite side considering all the evidence with respect to the plants in table3 22 a cross between two flowers on the same plant seems to give no advantage to the offspring thus produced the selffertilised plants being in weight superior but this conclusion cannot be absolutely trusted owing to the measurements given in table 321 though these latter from the cause already assigned are very much less trustworthy than the present ones  summary of observations on mimulus luteus  in the three first generations of crossed and selffertilised plants the tallest plants alone on each side of the several pots were measured and the average height of the ten crossed to that of the ten selffertilised plants was as 100 to 64 the crossed were also much more fertile than the selffertilised and so much more vigorous that they exceeded them in height even when sown on the opposite side of the same pot after an interval of four days the same superiority was likewise shown in a remarkable manner when both kinds of seeds were sown on the opposite sides of a pot with very poor earth full of the roots of another plant in one instance crossed and selffertilised seedlings grown in rich soil and not put into competition with each other attained to an equal height when we come to the fourth generation the two tallest crossed plants taken together exceeded by only a little the two tallest selffertilised plants and one of the latter beat its crossed opponenta circumstance which had not occurred in the previous generations this victorious selffertilised plant consisted of a new whiteflowered variety which grew taller than the old yellowish varieties from the first it seemed to be rather more fertile when selffertilised than the old varieties and in the succeeding selffertilised generations became more and more selffertile in the sixth generation the selffertilised plants of this variety compared with the crossed plants produced capsules in the proportion of 147 to 100 both lots being allowed to fertilise themselves spontaneously in the seventh generation twenty flowers on one of these plants artificially selffertilised yielded no less than nineteen very fine capsules  this variety transmitted its characters so faithfully to all the succeeding selffertilised generations up to the last or ninth that all the many plants which were raised presented a complete uniformity of character thus offering a remarkable contrast with the seedlings raised from the purchased seeds yet this variety retained to the last a latent tendency to produce yellow flowers for when a plant of the eighth selffertilised generation was crossed with pollen from a yellowflowered plant of the chelsea stock every single seedling bore yellow flowers a similar variety at least in the colour of its flowers also appeared amongst the crossed plants of the third generation no attention was at first paid to it and i know not how far it was at first used either for crossing or selffertilisation in the fifth generation most of the selffertilised plants and in the sixth and all the succeeding generations every single plant consisted of this variety and this no doubt was partly due to its great and increasing selffertility on the other hand it disappeared from amongst the crossed plants in the later generations and this was probably due to the continued intercrossing of the several plants from the tallness of this variety the selffertilised plants exceeded the crossed plants in height in all the generations from the fifth to the seventh inclusive and no doubt would have done so in the later generations had they been grown in competition with one another in the fifth generation the crossed plants were in height to the selffertilised as 100 to 126 in the sixth as 100 to 147 and in the seventh generation as 100 to 137 this excess of height may be attributed not only to this variety naturally growing taller than the other plants but to its possessing a peculiar constitution so that it did not suffer from continued selffertilisation  this variety presents a strikingly analogous case to that of the plant called the hero which appeared in the sixth selffertilised generation of ipomoea if the seeds produced by hero had been as greatly in excess of those produced by the other plants as was the case with mimulus and if all the seeds had been mingled together the offspring of hero would have increased to the entire exclusion of the ordinary plants in the later selffertilised generations and from naturally growing taller would have exceeded the crossed plants in height in each succeeding generation  some of the selffertilised plants of the sixth generation were intercrossed as were some in the eighth generation and the seedlings from these crosses were grown in competition with selffertilised plants of the two corresponding generations in the first trial the intercrossed plants were less fertile than the selffertilised and less tall in the ratio of 100 to 110 in the second trial the intercrossed plants were more fertile than the selffertilised in the ratio of 100 to 73 and taller in the ratio of 100 to 92 notwithstanding that the selffertilised plants in the second trial were the product of two additional generations of selffertilisation i cannot understand this discordance in the results of the two analogous experiments  the most important of all the experiments on mimulus are those in which flowers on plants of the eighth selffertilised generation were again selffertilised other flowers on distinct plants of the same lot were intercrossed and others were crossed with a new stock of plants from chelsea the chelseacrossed seedlings were to the intercrossed in height as 100 to 56 and in fertility as 100 to 4 and they were to the selffertilised plants in height as 100 to 52 and in fertility as 100 to 3 these chelseacrossed plants were also much more hardy than the plants of the other two lots so that altogether the gain from the cross with a fresh stock was wonderfully great  lastly seedlings raised from a cross between flowers on the same plant were not superior to those from flowers fertilised with their own pollen but this result cannot be absolutely trusted owing to some previous observations which however were made under very unfavourable circumstances  digitalis purpurea  the flowers of the common foxglove are proterandrous that is the pollen is mature and mostly shed before the stigma of the same flower is ready for fertilisation this is effected by the larger humblebees which whilst in search of nectar carry pollen from flower to flower the two upper and longer stamens shed their pollen before the two lower and shorter ones the meaning of this fact probably is as dr ogle remarks that the anthers of the longer stamens stand near to the stigma so that they would be the most likely to fertilise it 33 popular science review january 1870 page 50 and as it is an advantage to avoid selffertilisation they shed their pollen first thus lessening the chance there is however but little danger of selffertilisation until the bifid stigma opens for hildebrand found that pollen placed on the stigma before it had opened produced no effect 34 geschlechtervertheilung bei den pflanzen 1867 page 20 the anthers which are large stand at first transversely with respect to the tubular corolla and if they were to dehisce in this position they would as dr ogle also remarks smear with pollen the whole back and sides of an entering humblebee in a useless manner but the anthers twist round and place themselves longitudinally before they dehisce the lower and inner side of the mouth of the corolla is thickly clothed with hairs and these collect so much of the fallen pollen that i have seen the under surface of a humblebee thickly dusted with it but this can never be applied to the stigma as the bees in retreating do not turn their under surfaces upwards i was therefore puzzled whether these hairs were of any use but mr belt has i think explained their use the smaller kinds of bees are not fitted to fertilise the flowers and if they were allowed to enter easily they would steal much nectar and fewer large bees would haunt the flowers humblebees can crawl into the dependent flowers with the greatest ease using the hairs as footholds while sucking the honey but the smaller bees are impeded by them and when having at length struggled through them they reach the slippery precipice above they are completely baffled mr belt says that he watched many flowers during a whole season in north wales and only once saw a small bee reach the nectary though many were seen trying in vain to do so 35 the naturalist in nicaragua 1874 page 132 but it appears from h muller die befruchtung der blumen 1873 page 285 that small insects sometimes succeed in entering the flowers  i covered a plant growing in its native soil in north wales with a net and fertilised six flowers each with its own pollen and six others with pollen from a distinct plant growing within the distance of a few feet the covered plant was occasionally shaken with violence so as to imitate the effects of a gale of wind and thus to facilitate as far as possible selffertilisation it bore ninetytwo flowers besides the dozen artificially fertilised and of these only twentyfour produced capsules whereas almost all the flowers on the surrounding uncovered plants were fruitful of the twentyfour spontaneously selffertilised capsules only two contained their full complement of seed six contained a moderate supply and the remaining sixteen extremely few seeds a little pollen adhering to the anthers after they had dehisced and accidentally falling on the stigma when mature must have been the means by which the above twentyfour flowers were partially selffertilised for the margins of the corolla in withering do not curl inwards nor do the flowers in dropping off turn round on their axes so as to bring the pollencovered hairs with which the lower surface is clothed into contact with the stigmaby either of which means selffertilisation might be effected  seeds from the above crossed and selffertilised capsules after germinating on bare sand were planted in pairs on the opposite sides of five moderatelysized pots which were kept in the greenhouse the plants after a time appeared starved and were therefore without being disturbed turned out of their pots and planted in the open ground in two close parallel rows they were thus subjected to tolerably severe competition with one another but not nearly so severe as if they had been left in the pots at the time when they were turned out their leaves were between 5 and 8 inches in length and the longest leaf on the finest plant on each side of each pot was measured with the result that the leaves of the crossed plants exceeded on an average those of the selffertilised plants by 4 of an inch

28700  the average height of the flowerstems of the sixteen crossed plants is here 5133 inches and that of the eight selffertilised plants 3587 or as 100 to 70 but this difference in height does not give at all a fair idea of the vast superiority of the crossed plants these latter produced altogether sixtyfour flowerstems each plant producing on an average exactly four flowerstems whereas the eight selffertilised plants produced only fifteen flowerstems each producing an average only of 187 stems and these had a less luxuriant appearance we may put the result in another way the number of flowerstems on the crossed plants was to those on an equal number of selffertilised plants as 100 to 48  three crossed seeds in a state of germination were also planted in three separate pots and three selffertilised seeds in the same state in three other pots these plants were therefore at first exposed to no competition with one another and when turned out of their pots into the open ground they were planted at a moderate distance apart so that they were exposed to much less severe competition than in the last case the longest leaves on the three crossed plants when turned out exceeded those on the selffertilised plants by a mere trifle namely on an average by 17 of an inch when fully grown the three crossed plants produced twentysix flowerstems the two tallest of which on each plant were on an average 5404 inches in height the three selffertilised plants produced twentythree flowerstems the two tallest of which on each plant had an average height of 4618 inches so that the difference between these two lots which hardly competed together is much less than in the last case when there was moderately severe competition namely as 100 to 85 instead of as 100 to 70  the effects on the offspring of intercrossing different flowers on the same plant instead of crossing distinct individuals  a fine plant growing in my garden one of the foregoing seedlings was covered with a net and six flowers were crossed with pollen from another flower on the same plant and six others were fertilised with their own pollen all produced good capsules the seeds from each were placed in separate watchglasses and no difference could be perceived by the eye between the two lots of seeds and when they were weighed there was no difference of any significance as the seeds from the selffertilised capsules weighed 765 grains whilst those from the crossed capsules weighed 77 grains therefore the sterility of the present species when insects are excluded is not due to the impotence of pollen on the stigma of the same flower both lots of seeds and seedlings were treated in exactly the same manner as in table 323 excepting that after the pairs of germinating seeds had been planted on the opposite sides of eight pots all the remaining seeds were thickly sown on the opposite sides of pots 9 and 10 in table 324 the young plants during the following spring were turned out of their pots without being disturbed and planted in the open ground in two rows not very close together so that they were subjected to only moderately severe competition with one another very

the plants raised from the thickly sown seed in pots 9 and 10 which were subjected to very severe mutual competition were taken by themselves and the average height of the nine crossed plants is 3986 and that of the nine selffertilised plants 3588 or as 100 to 90 the plants in these two latter pots 9 and 10 after being measured were cut down close to the ground and weighed the nine crossed plants weighed 5766 ounces and the nine selffertilised plants 4525 ounces or as 100 to 78 on the whole we may conclude especially from the evidence of weight that seedlings from a cross between flowers on the same plant have a decided though not great advantage over those from flowers fertilised with their own pollen more especially in the case of the plants subjected to severe mutual competition but the advantage is much less than that exhibited by the crossed offspring of distinct plants for these exceeded the selffertilised plants in height as 100 to 70 and in the number of flowerstems as 100

1873 page 277 and mr anderson remarks that extreme care is necessary to exclude insects in order to preserve any kind true 37 gardeners chronicle 1853 page 534 he adds the interesting statement that when the corolla is cut quite away insects as far as he has seen never discover or visit the flowers this plant is however selffertile if insects are excluded so few experiments were made by me that they are hardly worth giving crossed and selffertilised seeds were sown on opposite sides of a pot and after a time the crossed seedlings slightly exceeded the selffertilised in height when a little further grown the longest leaves on the former were very nearly 3 inches in length whilst those on the selffertilised plants were only 2 inches owing to an accident and to the pot being too small only one plant on each side grew up and flowered the crossed plant was 19 12 inches in height and the selffertilised one 15 inches or as 100 to 77  linaria vulgaris  it has been mentioned in the introductory chapter that two large beds of this plant were raised by me many years ago from crossed and selffertilised seeds and that there was a conspicuous difference in height and general appearance between the two lots the trial was afterwards repeated with more care but as this was one of the first plants experimented on my usual method was not followed seeds were taken from wild plants growing in this neighbourhood and sown in poor soil in my garden five plants were covered with a net the others being left exposed to the bees which incessantly visit the flowers of this species and which according to h muller are the exclusive fertilisers this excellent observer remarks that as the stigma lies between the anthers and is mature at the same time with them selffertilisation is possible 38 die befruchtung etc page 279 but so few seeds are produced by protected plants that the pollen and stigma of the same flower seem to have little power of mutual interaction the exposed plants bore numerous capsules forming solid spikes five of these capsules were examined and appeared to contain an equal number of seeds and these being counted in one capsule were found to be 166 the five protected plants produced altogether only twentyfive capsules of which five were much finer than all the others and these contained an average of 236 seeds with a maximum in one capsule of fiftyfive so that the number of seeds in the capsules on the exposed plants to the average number in the finest capsules on the protected plants was as 100 to 14  some of the spontaneously selffertilised seeds from under the net and some seeds from the uncovered plants naturally fertilised and almost certainly intercrossed by the bees were sown separately in two large pots of the same size so that the two lots of seedlings were not subjected to any mutual competition three of the crossed plants when in full flower were measured but no care was taken to select the tallest plants their heights were 7 48 7 28 and 6 48 inches averaging 708 in height the three tallest of all the selffertilised plants were then carefully selected and their heights were 6 38 5 58 and 5 28 averaging 575 in height so that the naturally crossed plants were to the spontaneously selffertilised plants in height at least as much as 100 to 81  verbascum thapsus  the flowers of this plant are frequented by various insects chiefly by bees for the sake of the pollen hermann muller however has shown die befruchtung etc page 277 that v nigrum secretes minute drops of nectar the arrangement of the reproductive organs though not at all complex favours crossfertilisation and even distinct species are often crossed for a greater number of naturally produced hybrids have been observed in

volume 10 page 451 nevertheless the present species is perfectly selffertile if insects are excluded for a plant protected by a net was as thickly loaded with fine capsules as the surrounding uncovered plants verbascum lychnitis is rather less selffertile for some protected plants did not yield quite so many capsules as the adjoining uncovered plants  plants of verbascum thapsus had been raised for a distinct purpose from selffertilised seeds and some flowers on these plants were again selffertilised yielding seed of the second selffertilised generation and other flowers were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant the seeds thus produced were sown on the opposite sides of four large pots they germinated however so irregularly the crossed seedlings generally coming up first that i was able to save only six pairs of equal age these when in full flower were measured as in table 325  table 325 verbascum thapsus  heights of plants measured in inches  column 1 number name of pot

flowers 310 the convenient term of cleistogene was proposed by kuhn in an article on the present genus in bot zeitung 1867 page 65 the latter are extremely small imperfectly developed and never expand yet yield plenty of seeds the perfect and open flowers are also small of a white colour with purple marks they generally produce seed although the contrary has been asserted and they do so even if protected from insects they have a rather complicated structure and appear to be adapted for crossfertilisation but were not carefully examined by me they are not easy to fertilise artificially and it is possible that some of the flowers which i thought that i had succeeded in crossing were afterwards spontaneously selffertilised under the net sixteen capsules from the crossed perfect flowers contained on an average ninetythree seeds with a maximum in one capsule of 137 and thirteen capsules from the selffertilised perfect flowers contained sixtytwo seeds with a maximum in one capsule of 135 or as 100 to 67 but i suspect that this considerable excess was accidental as on one occasion nine crossed capsules were compared with seven selffertilised capsules both included in the above number and they contained almost exactly the same average number of seed i may add that fifteen capsules from selffertilised cleistogene flowers contained on an average sixtyfour seeds with a maximum in one of eightyseven  crossed and selffertilised seeds from the perfect flowers and other seeds from the selffertilised cleistogene flowers were sown in five pots each divided superficially into three compartments the seedlings were thinned at an early age so that twenty plants were left in each of the three divisions the crossed plants when in full flower averaged 43 inches and the selffertilised plants from the perfect flowers 427 inches in height or as 100 to 99 the selffertilised plants from the cleistogene flowers averaged 406 inches in height so that the crossed were in height to these latter plants as 100 to 94  i determined to compare again the growth of plants raised from crossed and selffertilised perfect flowers and obtained two fresh lots of seeds these were sown on opposite sides of five pots but they were not sufficiently thinned so that they grew rather crowded when fully grown all those above 2 inches in height were selected all below this standard being rejected the former consisted of fortyseven crossed and fortyone selffertilised plants thus a greater number of the crossed than of the selffertilised plants grew to a height of above 2 inches of the crossed plants the twentyfour tallest were on an average 36 inches in height whilst the twentyfour tallest selffertilised plants were 338 inches in average height or as 100 to 94 all these plants were then cut down close to the ground and the fortyseven crossed plants weighed 10903 grains and the fortyone selffertilised plants weighed 8874 grains therefore an equal number of crossed and selffertilised would have been to each other in weight as 100 to 97 from these several facts we may conclude that the crossed plants had some real though very slight advantage in height and weight over the selffertilised plants when grown in competition with one another  the crossed plants were however inferior in fertility to the selffertilised six of the finest plants were selected out of the fortyseven crossed plants and six out of the fortyone selffertilised plants and the former produced 598 capsules whilst the latter or selffertilised plants produced 752 capsules all these capsules were the product of cleistogene flowers for the plants did not bear during the whole of this season any perfect flowers the seeds were counted in ten cleistogene capsules produced by crossed plants and their average number was 464 per capsule whilst the number in ten cleistogene capsules produced by the selffertilised plants was 494 or as 100 to 106  3 gesneriaceaegesneria pendulina  in gesneria

mechanical adaptations in this genus for favouring or ensuring crossfertilisation have been fully described by sprengel hildebrand delpino h muller ogle and others in their several works  this species unlike most of the others in the same genus yields a good many seeds when insects are excluded i gathered ninetyeight capsules produced by flowers spontaneously selffertilised under a net and they contained on an average 145 seeds whilst flowers artificially fertilised with their own pollen in which case the stigma will have received plenty of pollen yielded on an average 33 seeds or more than twice as many twenty flowers were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant and twentysix were selffertilised there was no great difference in the proportional number of flowers which produced capsules by these two processes or in the number of the contained seeds or in the weight of an equal number of seeds  seeds of both kinds were sown rather thickly on opposite sides of three pots when the seedlings were about 3 inches in height the crossed showed a slight advantage over the selffertilised when twothirds grown the two tallest plants on each side of each pot were measured the crossed averaged 1637 inches and the selffertilised 1175 in height or as 100 to 71 when the plants were fully grown and had done flowering the two tallest plants on each side were again measured with the

exceeds in height its selffertilised opponent the former averaged 2785 inches whilst the six tallest selffertilised plants averaged 2116 inches or as 100 to 76 in all three pots the first plant which flowered was a crossed one all the crossed plants together produced 409 flowers whilst all the selffertilised together produced only 232 flowers or as 100 to 57 so that the crossed plants in this respect were far more productive than the selffertilised  origanum vulgare  this plant exists according to h muller under two forms one hermaphrodite and strongly proterandrous so that it is almost certain to be fertilised by pollen from another flower the other form is exclusively female has a smaller corolla and must of course be fertilised by pollen from a distinct plant in order to yield any seeds the plants on which i experimented were hermaphrodites they had been cultivated for a long period as a potherb in my kitchen garden and were like so many longcultivated plants extremely sterile as i felt doubtful about the specific name i sent specimens to kew and was assured that the species was origanum vulgare my plants formed one great clump and had evidently spread from a single root by stolons in a strict sense therefore they all belonged to the same individual my object in experimenting on them was firstly to ascertain whether crossing flowers borne by plants having distinct roots but all derived asexually from the same individual would be in any respect more advantageous than selffertilisation and secondly to raise for future trial seedlings which would constitute really distinct individuals several plants in the above clump were covered by a net and about two dozen seeds many of which however were small and withered were obtained from the flowers thus spontaneously selffertilised the remainder of the plants were left uncovered and were incessantly visited by bees so that they were doubtless crossed by them these exposed plants yielded rather more and finer seed but still very few than did the covered plants the two lots of seeds thus obtained were sown on opposite sides of two pots the seedlings were carefully observed from their first growth to maturity but they did not differ at any period in height or in vigour the importance of which latter observation we shall presently see when fully grown the tallest crossed plant in one pot was a very little taller than the tallest selffertilised plant on the opposite side and in the other pot exactly the reverse occurred so that the two lots were in fact equal and a cross of this kind did no more good than crossing two flowers on the same plant of ipomoea or mimulus  the plants were turned out of the two pots without being disturbed and planted in the open ground in order that they might grow more vigorously in the following summer all the selffertilised and some of the quasicrossed plants were covered by a net many flowers on the latter were crossed by me with pollen from a distinct plant and others were left to be crossed by the bees these quasicrossed plants produced rather more seed than did the original ones in the great clump when left to the action of the bees many flowers on the selffertilised plants were artificially selffertilised and others were allowed to fertilise themselves spontaneously under the net but they yielded altogether very few seeds these two lots of seedsthe product of a cross between distinct seedlings instead of as in the last case between plants multiplied by stolons and the product of selffertilised flowerswere allowed to germinate on bare sand and several equal pairs were planted on opposite sides of two large pots at a very early age the crossed plants showed some superiority over the selffertilised which was ever afterwards retained when the plants were fully grown the two tallest crossed and the two tallest selffertilised plants in each pot were measured as shown in table 328 i regret that from want of time i did not measure all the pairs but the tallest on each side seemed fairly to represent the average difference between the two lots  table 328 origanum vulgare  heights of plants measured in inches  column 1 number name of pot

average height of the crossed plants is here 20 inches and that of the selffertilised 1712 or as 100 to 86 but this excess of height by no means gives a fair idea of the vast superiority in vigour of the crossed over the selffertilised plants the crossed flowered first and produced thirty flowerstems whilst the selffertilised produced only fifteen or half the number the pots were then bedded out and the roots probably came out of the holes at the bottom and thus aided their growth early in the following summer the superiority of the crossed plants owing to their increase by stolons over the selffertilised plants was truly wonderful in pot 1 and it should be remembered that very large pots had been used the oval clump of crossed plants was 10 by 4 12 inches across with the tallest stem as yet young 5 12 inches in height whilst the clump of selffertilised plants on the opposite side of the same pot was only 3 12 by 2 12 inches across with the tallest young stem 4 inches in height in pot 2 the clump of crossed plants was 18 by 9 inches across with the tallest young stem 8 12 inches in height whilst the clump of selffertilised plants on the opposite side of the same pot was 12 by 4 12 inches across with the tallest young stem 6 inches in height the crossed plants during this season as during the last flowered first both the crossed and selffertilised plants being left freely exposed to the visits of bees manifestly produced much more seed than their grandparentsthe plants of the original clump still growing close by in the same garden and equally left to the action of the bees  5 acanthaceaethunbergia alata  it appears from hildebrands description botanische zeitung 1867 page 285 that the conspicuous flowers of this plant are adapted for crossfertilisation seedlings were twice raised from purchased seed but during the early summer when first experimented on they were extremely sterile many of the anthers containing hardly any pollen nevertheless during the autumn these same plants spontaneously produced a good many seeds twentysix flowers during the two years were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant but they yielded only eleven capsules and these contained very few seeds twentyeight flowers were fertilised with pollen from the same flower and these yielded only ten capsules which however contained rather more seed than the crossed capsules eight pairs of germinating seeds were planted on opposite sides of five pots and exactly half the crossed and half the selffertilised plants exceeded their opponents in height two of the selffertilised plants died young before they were measured and their crossed opponents were thrown away the six remaining pairs of these grew very unequally some both of the crossed and selffertilised plants being more than twice as tall as the others the average height of the crossed plants was 60 inches and that of the selffertilised plants 65 inches or as 100 to 108 a cross therefore between distinct individuals here appears to do no good but this result deduced from so few plants in a very sterile condition and growing very unequally obviously cannot be trusted    chapter iv  cruciferae

page 139 it is well known that the varieties are crossed so largely by insects that it is impossible to raise pure kinds in the same garden if more than one kind is in flower at the same time cabbages in one respect were not well fitted for my experiments as after they had formed heads they were often difficult to measure the flowerstems also differ much in height and a poor plant will sometimes throw up a higher stem than that of a fine plant in the later experiments the fullygrown plants were cut down and weighed and then the immense advantage from a cross became manifest  a single plant of the above variety was covered with a net just before flowering and was crossed with pollen from another plant of the same variety growing close by and the seven capsules thus produced contained on an average 163 seeds with a maximum of twenty in one capsule some flowers were artificially selffertilised but their capsules did not contain so many seeds as those from flowers spontaneously selffertilised under the net of which a considerable number were produced fourteen of these latter capsules contained on an average 41 seeds with a maximum in one of ten seeds so that the seeds in the crossed capsules were in number to those in the selffertilised capsules as 100 to 25 the selffertilised seeds fiftyeight of which weighed 388 grains were however a little finer than those from the crossed capsules fiftyeight of which weighed 376 grains when few seeds are produced these seem often to be better nourished and to be heavier than when many are produced  the two lots of seeds in an equal state of germination were planted some on opposite sides of a single pot and some in the open ground the young crossed plants in the pot at first exceeded by a little in height the selffertilised then equalled them were then beaten and lastly were again victorious the plants without being disturbed were turned out of the pot and planted in the open ground and after growing for some time the crossed plants which were all of nearly the same height exceeded the selffertilised ones by 2 inches when they flowered the flowerstems of the tallest crossed plant exceeded that of the tallest selffertilised plant by 6 inches the other seedlings which were planted in the open ground stood separate so that they did not compete with one another nevertheless the crossed plants certainly grew to a rather greater height than the selffertilised but no measurements were made the crossed plants which had been raised in the pot and those planted in the open ground all flowered a little before the selffertilised plants  crossed and selffertilised plants of the second generation  some flowers on the crossed plants of the last generation were again crossed with pollen from another crossed plant and produced fine capsules the flowers on the selffertilised plants of the last generation were allowed to fertilise themselves spontaneously under a net and they produced some remarkably fine capsules the two lots of seeds thus produced germinated on sand and eight pairs were planted on opposite sides of four pots these plants were measured to the tips of their leaves on the 20th of october of the same year and the eight crossed plants averaged in height 84 inches whilst the selffertilised averaged 853 inches so that the crossed were a little inferior in height as 100

802 inches in height whilst the selffertilised averaged 731 inches or as 100 to 91 the plants were then turned out of their pots and planted undisturbed in the open ground by the 5th of august their heads were fully formed but several had grown so crooked that their heights could hardly be measured with accuracy the crossed plants however were on the whole considerably taller than the selffertilised in the following year they flowered the crossed plants flowering before the selffertilised in three of the pots and at the same time in pot 2 the flowerstems were now measured as shown

crossed over the selffertilised plants both lots including the two plants in pot 4 which did not flower were now cut down close to the ground and weighed but those in pot 2 were excluded for they had been accidentally injured by a fall during transplantation and one was almost killed the eight crossed plants weighed 219 ounces whilst the eight selffertilised plants weighed only 82 ounces or as 100

measured to the tips of their leaves the thirteen crossed plants averaged 1316 inches in height and the twelve for one had died selffertilised plants averaged 137 inches or as 100 to 104 so that the

august the greater number had formed fine heads but several grew extremely crooked from having been drawn up to the light whilst in the greenhouse as it was scarcely possible to measure their heights the finest plant on each side of each pot was cut down close to the ground and weighed in table 430 we have the result  the six finest crossed plants average 10816 ounces whilst the six finest selffertilised plants average only 237 ounces or as 100 to 22 this difference shows in the clearest manner the enormous benefit which these plants derived from a cross with another plant belonging to the same subvariety but to a fresh stock and grown during at least the three previous generations under somewhat different conditions  the offspring from a cutleaved curled and variegated whitegreen cabbage crossed with a cutleaved curled and variegated crimsongreen cabbage compared with the selffertilised offspring from the two varieties  these trials were made not for the sake of comparing the growth of the crossed and selffertilised seedlings but because i had seen it stated that these varieties would not naturally intercross when growing uncovered and near one another this statement proved quite erroneous but the whitegreen variety was in some degree sterile in my garden producing little pollen and few seeds it was therefore no wonder that seedlings raised from the selffertilised flowers of this variety were greatly exceeded in height by seedlings from a cross between it and the more vigorous crimsongreen variety and nothing more need be said about this experiment  the seedlings from the reciprocal cross that is from the crimsongreen variety fertilised with pollen from the whitegreen variety offer a somewhat more curious case a few of these crossed seedlings reverted to a pure green variety with their leaves less cut and curled so that they were altogether in a much more natural state and these plants grew more vigorously and taller than any of the others now it is a strange fact that a much larger number of the selffertilised seedlings from the crimsongreen variety than of the crossed seedlings thus reverted and as a consequence the selffertilised seedlings grew taller by 2 12 inches on an average than the crossed seedlings with which they were put into competition at first however the crossed seedlings exceeded the selffertilised by an average of a quarter of an inch we thus see that reversion to a more natural condition acted more powerfully in favouring the ultimate growth of these plants than did a cross but it should be remembered that the cross was with a semisterile variety having a feeble constitution  iberis umbellata  var kermesiana  this variety produced plenty of spontaneously selffertilised seed under a net other plants in pots in the greenhouse were left uncovered and as i saw small flies visiting the flowers it seemed probable that they would be intercrossed consequently seeds supposed to have been thus crossed and spontaneously selffertilised seeds were sown on opposite sides of a pot the selffertilised seedlings grew from the first quicker than the supposed crossed seedlings and when both lots were in full flower the former were from 5 to 6 inches higher than the crossed i record in my notes that the selffertilised seeds from which these selffertilised plants were raised were not so well ripened as the crossed and this may possibly have caused the great difference in their growth in a somewhat analogous manner as occurred with the selffertilised plants of the eighth generation of ipomoea raised from unhealthy parents it is a curious circumstance that two other lots of the above seeds were sown in pure sand mixed with burnt earth and therefore without any organic matter and here the supposed crossed seedlings grew to double the height of the selffertilised before both lots died as necessarily occurred at an early period we shall hereafter meet with another case apparently analogous to this of iberis in the third generation of petunia  the above selffertilised plants were allowed to fertilise themselves again under a net yielding selffertilised plants of the second generation and the supposed crossed plants were crossed by pollen of a distinct plant but from want of time this was done in a careless manner namely by smearing one head of expanded flowers over another i should have thought that this would have succeeded and perhaps it did so but the fact of 108 of the selffertilised seeds weighing 487 grains whilst the same number of the supposed crossed seeds weighed only 357 grains does not look like it five seedlings from each lot of seeds were raised and the selffertilised plants when fully grown exceeded in average height by a trifle namely 4 of an inch the five probably crossed plants i have thought it right to give this case and the last because had the supposed crossed plants proved superior to the selffertilised in height i should have assumed without doubt that the former had really been crossed as it is i do not know what to conclude  being much surprised at the two foregoing trials i determined to make another in which there should be no doubt about the crossing i therefore fertilised with great care but as usual without castration twentyfour flowers on the supposed crossed plants of the last generation with pollen from distinct plants and thus obtained twentyone capsules the selffertilised plants of the last generation were allowed to fertilise themselves again under a net and the seedlings reared from these seeds formed the third selffertilised generation both lots of seeds after germinating on bare sand were planted in pairs on the opposite sides of two pots all the remaining seeds were sown crowded on opposite sides of a third pot but as all the selffertilised seedlings in this latter pot died before they grew to any considerable height they were not measured the plants in pots 1 and 2 were measured when between 7 and 8 inches in height and the crossed exceeded the selffertilised in average height by 157 inches when fully grown they were again measured to the summits of their flowerheads with the following result

average height of the seven crossed plants is here 1912 inches and that of the seven selffertilised plants 1639 or as 100 to 86 but as the plants on the selffertilised side grew very unequally this ratio cannot be fully trusted and is probably too high in both pots a crossed plant flowered before any one of the selffertilised these plants were left uncovered in the greenhouse but from being too much crowded they were not very productive the seeds from all seven plants of both lots were counted the crossed produced 206 and the selffertilised 154 or as 100 to 75  cross by a fresh stock  from the doubts caused by the two first trials in which it was not known with certainty that the plants had been crossed and from the crossed plants in the last experiment having been put into competition with plants selffertilised for three generations which moreover grew very unequally i resolved to repeat the trial on a larger scale and in a rather different manner i obtained seeds of the same crimson variety of iberis umbellata from another nursery garden and raised plants from them some of these plants were allowed to fertilise themselves spontaneously under a net others were crossed by pollen taken from plants raised from seed sent me by dr durando from algiers where the parentplants had been cultivated for some generations these latter plants differed in having pale pink instead of crimson flowers but in no other respect that the cross had been effective though the flowers on the crimson motherplant had not been castrated was well shown when the thirty crossed seedlings flowered for twentyfour of them produced pale pink flowers exactly like those of their father the six others having crimson flowers exactly like those of their mother and like those of all the selffertilised seedlings this case offers a good instance of a result which not rarely follows from crossing varieties having differently coloured flowers namely that the colours do not blend but resemble perfectly those either of the father or mother plant the seeds of both lots after germinating on sand were planted on opposite sides of eight pots when fully grown the plants were measured to the summits of the

difference did not prove somewhat greater considering that in the last experiment it was as 100 to 86 but this latter ratio as before explained was probably too great it should however be observed that in the last experiment table 431 the crossed plants competed with plants of the third selffertilised generation whilst in the present case plants derived from a cross with a fresh stock competed with selffertilised plants of the first generation  the crossed plants in the present case as in the last were more fertile than the selffertilised both lots being left uncovered in the greenhouse the thirty crossed plants produced 103 seedbearing flowersheads as well as some heads which yielded no seeds whereas the twentynine selffertilised plants produced only 81 seedbearing heads therefore thirty such plants would have produced 837 heads we thus get the ratio of 100 to 81 for the number of seedbearing flowerheads produced by the crossed and selffertilised plants moreover a number of seedbearing heads from the crossed plants compared with the same number from the selffertilised yielded seeds by weight in the ratio of 100 to 92 combining these two elements namely the number of seedbearing heads and the weight of seeds in each head the productiveness of the crossed to the selffertilised plants was as 100 to 75  the crossed and selffertilised seeds which remained after the above pairs had been planted some in a state of germination and some not so were sown early in the year out of doors in two rows many of the selffertilised seedlings suffered greatly and a much larger number of them perished than of the crossed in the autumn the surviving selffertilised plants were plainly less wellgrown than the crossed plants  7 papaveraceaepapaver vagum  a subspecies of papaver dubium from the south of france  the poppy does not secrete nectar but the flowers are highly conspicuous and are visited by many pollencollecting bees flies and beetles the anthers shed their pollen very early and in the case of papaver rhoeas it falls on the circumference of the radiating stigmas so that this species must often be selffertilised but with papaver dubium the same result does not follow according to h muller die befruchtung page 128 owing to the shortness of the stamens unless the flower happens to stand inclined the present species therefore does not seem so well fitted for selffertilisation as most of the others nevertheless papaver vagum produced plenty of capsules in my garden when insects were excluded but only late in the season i may here add that papaver somniferum produces an abundance of spontaneously selffertilised capsules as professor h hoffmann likewise found to be the case 42 zur speciesfrage 1875 page 53 some species of papaver cross freely when growing in the same garden as i have known to be the case with papaver bracteatum and orientale  plants of papaver vagum were raised from seeds sent me from antibes through the kindness of dr bornet some little time after the flowers had expanded several were fertilised with their own pollen and others not castrated with pollen from a distinct individual but i have reason to believe from observations subsequently made that these flowers had been already fertilised by their own pollen as this process seems to take place soon after their expansion 43 mr j scott found report on the experimental culture of the opium poppy calcutta 1874 page 47 in the case of papaver somniferum that if he cut away the stigmatic surface before the flower had expanded no seeds were produced but if this was done on the second day or even a few hours after the expansion of the flower on the first day a partial fertilisation had already been effected and a few good seeds were almost invariably produced this proves at how early a period fertilisation takes place i raised however a few seedlings of both lots and the selffertilised rather exceeded the crossed plants in height  early in the following year i acted differently and fertilised seven flowers very soon after their expansion with pollen from another plant and obtained six capsules from counting the seeds in a mediumsized one i estimated that the average number in each was at least 120 four out of twelve capsules spontaneously selffertilised at the same time were found to contain no good seeds and the remaining eight contained on an average 66 seeds per capsule but it should be observed that later in the season the same plants produced under a net plenty of very fine spontaneously selffertilised capsules  the above two lots of seeds after germinating on sand were planted in pairs on opposite sides of five pots the two lots of seedlings when half an inch in height and again when 6 inches high were measured

selffertilised plants 1954 inches in height or as 100 to 89 these plants did not differ in fertility as far as could be judged by the number of capsules produced for there were seventyfive on the crossed side and seventyfour on the selffertilised side  eschscholtzia californica  this plant is remarkable from the crossed seedlings not exceeding in height or vigour the selffertilised on the other hand a cross greatly increases the productiveness of the flowers on the parentplant and is indeed sometimes necessary in order that they should produce any seed moreover plants thus derived are themselves much more fertile than those raised from selffertilised flowers so that the whole advantage of a cross is confined to the reproductive system it will be necessary for me to give this singular case in considerable detail  twelve flowers on some plants in my flowergarden were fertilised with pollen from distinct plants and produced twelve capsules but one of these contained no good seed the seeds of the eleven good capsules weighed 174 grains eighteen flowers on the same plants were fertilised with their own pollen and produced twelve good capsules which contained 1361 grains weight of seed therefore an equal number of crossed and selffertilised capsules would have yielded seed by weight as 100 to 71 44 professor hildebrand experimented on plants in germany on a larger scale than i did and found them much more selffertile eighteen capsules produced by crossfertilisation contained on an average eightyfive seeds whilst fourteen capsules from selffertilised flowers contained on an average only nine seeds that is as 100 to 11 jahrb fur wissen botanik b 7 page 467 if we take into account of the fact that a much greater proportion of flowers produced capsules when crossed than when selffertilised the relative fertility of the crossed to the selffertilised flowers was as 100 to 52 nevertheless these plants whilst still protected by the net spontaneously produced a considerable number of selffertilised capsules  the seeds of the two lots after germinating on sand were planted in pairs on the opposite sides of four large pots at first there was no difference in their growth but ultimately the crossed seedlings exceeded the selffertilised considerably in height as shown in table 434 but i believe from the cases which follow that this result was accidental owing to only a few plants having been measured and to one of the selffertilised plants having grown only to a height of 15 inches the plants had been kept in the greenhouse and from being drawn up to the light had to be tied to sticks in this and the following trials they were measured to the summits of their flowerstems  table 434 eschscholtzia californica  heights of plants to the summits of

22       15  total   11875   10225  the four crossed plants here average 2968 inches and the four selffertilised 2556 in height or as 100 to 86 the remaining seeds were sown in a large pot in which a cineraria had long been growing and in this case again the two crossed plants on the one side greatly exceeded in height the two selffertilised plants on the opposite side the plants in the above four pots from having been kept in the greenhouse did not produce on this or any other similar occasion many capsules but the flowers on the crossed plants when again crossed were much more productive than the flowers on the selffertilised plants when again selffertilised these plants after seeding were cut down and kept in the greenhouse and in the following year when grown again their relative heights were reversed as the selffertilised plants in three out of the four pots were now taller than and flowered before the crossed plants  crossed and selffertilised plants of the second generation  the fact just given with respect to the growth of the cutdown plants made me doubtful about my first trial so i determined to make another on a larger scale with crossed and selffertilised seedlings raised from the crossed and selffertilised plants of the last generation eleven pairs were raised and grown in competition in the usual manner and now the result was different for the two lots were nearly equal during their whole growth it would therefore be superfluous to give a table of their heights when fully grown and measured the crossed averaged 3247 and the selffertilised 3281 inches in height or as 100 to 101 there was no great difference in the number of flowers and capsules produced by the two lots when both were left freely exposed to the visits of insects  plants raised from brazilian seed  fritz muller sent me from south brazil seeds of plants which were there absolutely sterile when fertilised with pollen from the same plant but were perfectly fertile when fertilised with pollen from any other plant the plants raised by me in england from these seeds were examined by professor asa gray and pronounced to belong to e californica with which they were identical in general appearance two of these plants were covered by a net and were found not to be so completely selfsterile as in brazil but i shall recur to this subject in another part of this work here it will suffice to state that eight flowers on these two plants fertilised with pollen from another plant under the net produced eight fine capsules each containing on an average about eighty seeds eight flowers on these same plants fertilised with their own pollen produced seven capsules which contained on an average only twelve seeds with a maximum in one of sixteen seeds therefore the crossfertilised capsules compared with the selffertilised yielded seeds in the ratio of about 100 to 15 these plants of brazilian parentage differed also in a marked manner from the english plants in producing extremely few spontaneously selffertilised capsules under a net  crossed and selffertilised seeds from the above plants after germinating on bare sand were planted in pairs on the opposite sides of five large pots the seedlings thus raised were the grandchildren of the plants which grew in brazil the parents having been grown in england as the grandparents in brazil absolutely require crossfertilisation in order to yield any seeds i expected that selffertilisation would have proved very injurious to these seedlings and that the crossed ones would have been greatly superior in height and vigour to those raised from selffertilised flowers but the result showed that my anticipation was erroneous for as in the last experiment with plants of the english stock so in the present one the selffertilised plants exceeded the crossed by a little in height it will be sufficient to state that the fourteen crossed plants averaged 4464 and the fourteen selffertilised 4512 inches in height or as 100 to 101  the effects of a cross with a fresh stock  i now tried a different experiment eight flowers on the selffertilised plants of the last experiment ie grandchildren of the plants which grew in brazil were again fertilised with pollen from the same plant and produced five capsules containing on an average 274 seeds with a maximum in one of fortytwo seeds the seedlings raised from these seeds formed the second selffertilised generation of the brazilian stock  eight flowers on one of the crossed plants of the last experiment were crossed with pollen from another grandchild and produced five capsules these contained on an average 316 seeds with a maximum in one of fortynine seeds the seedlings raised from these seeds may be called the intercrossed  lastly eight other flowers on the crossed plants of the last experiment were fertilised with pollen from a plant of the english stock growing in my garden and which must have been exposed during many previous generations to very different conditions from those to which the brazilian progenitors of the motherplant had been subjected these eight flowers produced only four capsules containing on an average 632 seeds with a maximum in one of ninety the plants raised from these seeds may be called the englishcrossed as far as the above averages can be trusted from so few capsules the englishcrossed capsules contained twice as many seeds as the intercrossed and rather more than twice as many as the selffertilised capsules the plants which yielded these capsules were grown in pots in the greenhouse so that their absolute productiveness must not be compared with that of plants growing out of doors  the above three lots of seeds namely the selffertilised intercrossed and englishcrossed were planted in an equal state of germination having been as usual sown on bare sand in nine large pots each divided into three parts by superficial partitions many of the selffertilised seeds germinated before those of the two crossed lots and these were of course rejected the seedlings thus raised are the greatgrandchildren of the plants which grew in brazil when they were from 2 to 4 inches in height the three lots were equal they were measured when fourfifths grown and again when fully grown and as their relative heights were almost exactly the same at these two ages i will give only the last measurements the average height of the nineteen englishcrossed plants was 4592 inches that of the eighteen intercrossed plants for one died 4338 and that of the nineteen selffertilised plants 503 inches so that we have the following ratios in height  the englishcrossed to the selffertilised plants as 100 to 109  the englishcrossed to the intercrossed plants as 100 to 94  the intercrossed to the selffertilised plants as 100 to 116  after the seedcapsules had been gathered all these plants were cut down close to the ground and weighed the nineteen english crossed plants weighed 1825 ounces the intercrossed plants with their weight calculated as if there had been nineteen weighed 182 ounces and the nineteen selffertilised plants 215 ounces we have therefore for the weights of the three lots of plants the following ratios  the englishcrossed to the selffertilised plants as 100 to 118  the englishcrossed to the intercrossed plants as 100 to 100  the intercrossed to the selffertilised plants as 100 to 118  we thus see that in weight as in height the selffertilised plants had a decided advantage over the englishcrossed and intercrossed plants  the remaining seeds of the three kinds whether or not in a state of germination were sown in three long parallel rows in the open ground and here again the selffertilised seedlings exceeded in height by between 2 and 3 inches the seedlings in the two other rows which were of nearly equal heights the three rows were left unprotected throughout the winter and all the plants were killed with the exception of two of the selffertilised so that as far as this little bit of evidence goes some of the selffertilised plants were more hardy than any of the crossed plants of either lot  we thus see that the selffertilised plants which were grown in the nine pots were superior in height as 116 to 100 and in weight as 118 to 100 and apparently in hardiness to the intercrossed plants derived from a cross between the grandchildren of the brazilian stock the superiority is here much more strongly marked than in the second trial with the plants of the english stock in which the selffertilised were to the crossed in height as 101 to 100 it is a far more remarkable factif we bear in mind the effects of crossing plants with pollen from a fresh stock in the cases of ipomoea mimulus brassica and iberisthat the selffertilised plants exceeded in height as 109 to 100 and in weight as 118 to 100 the offspring of the brazilian stock crossed by the english stock the two stocks having been long subjected to widely different conditions  if we now turn to the fertility of the three lots of plants we find a very different result i may premise that in five out of the nine pots the first plant which flowered was one of the englishcrossed in four of the pots it was a selffertilised plant and in not one did an intercrossed plant flower first so that these latter plants were beaten in this respect as in so many other ways the three closely adjoining rows of plants growing in the open ground flowered profusely and the flowers were incessantly visited by bees and certainly thus intercrossed the manner in which several plants in the previous experiments continued to be almost sterile as long as they were covered by a net but set a multitude of capsules immediately that they were uncovered proves how effectually the bees carry pollen from plant to plant my gardener gathered at three successive times an equal number of ripe capsules from the plants of the three lots until he had collected fortyfive from each lot it is not possible to judge from external appearance whether or not a capsule contains any good seeds so that i opened all the capsules of the fortyfive from the englishcrossed plants four were empty of those from the intercrossed five were empty and of those from the selffertilised nine were empty the seeds were counted in twentyone capsules taken by chance out of each lot and the average number of seeds in the capsules from the englishcrossed plants was 67 from the intercrossed 56 and from the selffertilised 4852 it therefore follows that  the fortyfive capsules the four empty ones included from the englishcrossed plants contained 2747 seeds  the fortyfive capsules the five empty ones included from the intercrossed plants contained 2240 seeds  the fortyfive capsules the nine empty ones included from the selffertilised plants contained 17467 seeds  the reader should remember that these capsules are the product of crossfertilisation effected by the bees and that the difference in the number of the contained seeds must depend on the constitution of the plantsthat is on whether they were derived from a cross with a distinct stock or from a cross between plants of the same stock or from selffertilisation from the above facts we obtain the following ratios  number of seeds contained in an equal number of naturally fertilised capsules produced  by the englishcrossed and selffertilised plants as 100 to 63  by the englishcrossed and intercrossed plants as 100 to 81  by the intercrossed and selffertilised plants as 100 to 78  but to have ascertained the productiveness of the three lots of plants it would have been necessary to know how many capsules were produced by the same number of plants the three long rows however were not of quite equal lengths and the plants were much crowded so that it would have been extremely difficult to have ascertained how many capsules were produced by them even if i had been willing to undertake so laborious a task as to collect and count all the capsules but this was feasible with the plants grown in pots in the greenhouse and although these were much less fertile than those growing out of doors their relative fertility appeared after carefully observing them to be the same the nineteen plants of the englishcrossed stock in the pots produced altogether 240 capsules the intercrossed plants calculated as nineteen produced 13722 capsules and the nineteen selffertilised plants 152 capsules now knowing the number of seeds contained in fortyfive capsules of each lot it is easy to calculate the relative numbers of seeds produced by an equal number of the plants of the three lots  number of seeds produced by an equal number of naturallyfertilised plants  plants of englishcrossed and selffertilised parentage as 100 to 40 seeds  plants of englishcrossed and intercrossed parentage as 100 to 45 seeds  plants of intercrossed and selffertilised parentage as 100 to 89 seeds  the superiority in productiveness of the intercrossed plants that is the product of a cross between the grandchildren of the plants which grew in brazil over the selffertilised small as it is is wholly due to the larger average number of seeds contained in the capsules for the intercrossed plants produced fewer capsules in the greenhouse than did the selffertilised plants the great superiority in productiveness of the englishcrossed over the selffertilised plants is shown by the larger number of capsules produced the larger average number of contained seeds and the smaller number of empty capsules as the englishcrossed and intercrossed plants were the offspring of crosses in every previous generation as must have been the case from the flowers being sterile with their own pollen we may conclude that the great superiority in productiveness of the englishcrossed over the intercrossed plants is due to the two parents of the former having been long subjected to different conditions  the englishcrossed plants though so superior in productiveness were as we have seen decidedly inferior in height and weight to the selffertilised and only equal to or hardly superior to the intercrossed plants therefore the whole advantage of a cross with a distinct stock is here confined to productiveness and i have met with no similar case  8 resedaceaereseda lutea  seeds collected from wild plants growing in this neighbourhood were sown in the kitchengarden and several of the seedlings thus raised were covered with a net of these some were found as will hereafter be more fully described to be absolutely sterile when left to fertilise themselves spontaneously although plenty of pollen fell on their stigmas and they were equally sterile when artificially and repeatedly fertilised with their own pollen whilst other plants produced a few spontaneously selffertilised capsules the remaining plants were left uncovered and as pollen was carried from plant to plant by the hive and humblebees which incessantly visit the flowers they produced an abundance of capsules of the necessity of pollen being carried from one plant to another i had ample evidence in the case of this species and of r odorata for those plants which set no seeds or very few as long as they were protected from insects became loaded with capsules immediately that they were uncovered  seeds from the flowers

of the same two lots were also sown in two adjoining rows in the open ground there were twenty crossed plants in the one row and thirtytwo selffertilised plants in the other row so that the experiment was not quite fair but not so unfair as it at first appears for the plants in the same row were not crowded so much as seriously to interfere with each others growth and the ground was bare on the outside of both rows these plants were better nourished than those in the pots and grew to a greater height the eight tallest plants in each row were measured in the same manner as before with the

the average height of the crossed plants whilst in full flower was here 2809 and that of the selffertilised 2314 inches or as 100 to 82 it is a singular fact that the tallest plant in the two rows was one of the selffertilised the selffertilised plants had smaller and paler green leaves than the crossed all the plants in the two rows were afterwards cut down and weighed the twenty crossed plants weighed 65 ounces and twenty selffertilised by calculation from the actual weight of the thirtytwo selffertilised plants weighed 2625 ounces or as 100 to 40 therefore the crossed plants did not exceed in weight the selffertilised plants in nearly so great a degree as those growing in the pots owing probably to the latter having been subjected to more severe mutual competition on the other hand they exceeded the selffertilised in height in a slightly greater degree  reseda odorata  plants of the common mignonette were raised from purchased seed and several of them were placed under separate nets of these some became loaded with spontaneously selffertilised capsules others produced a few and others not a single one it must not be supposed that these latter plants produced no seed because their stigmas did not receive any pollen for they were repeatedly fertilised with pollen from the same plant with no effect but they were perfectly fertile with pollen from any other plant spontaneously selffertilised seeds were saved from one of the highly selffertile plants and other seeds were collected from the plants growing outside the nets which had been crossed by the bees these seeds after

in number were gathered from one of the semiselfsterile plants under a net and as several flowers on this same plant had been fertilised with pollen from a distinct individual crossed seeds were thus obtained i expected that the seedlings from this semiselfsterile plant would have profited in a higher degree from a cross than did the seedlings from the fully selffertile plants but my anticipation was quite wrong for they profited in a less degree an analogous result followed in the case of eschscholtzia in which the offspring of the plants of brazilian parentage which were partially

heartsease are young the anthers shed their pollen into a little semicylindrical passage formed by the basal portion of the lower petal and surrounded by papillae the pollen thus collected lies close beneath the stigma but can seldom gain access into its cavity except by the aid of insects which pass their proboscides down this passage into the nectary 45 the flowers of this plant have been fully described by sprengel hildebrand delpino and h muller the latter author sums up all the previous observations in his befruchtung der blumen and in nature november 20 1873 page 44 see also mr aw bennett in nature may 15 1873 page 50 and some remarks by mr kitchener ibid page 143 the facts which follow on the effects of covering up a plant of v tricolor have been quoted by sir j lubbock in his british wild flowers etc page 62 consequently when i covered up a large plant of a cultivated variety it set only eighteen capsules and most of these contained very few good seedsseveral from only one to three whereas an equally fine uncovered plant of the same variety growing close by produced 105 fine capsules the few flowers which produce capsules when insects are excluded are perhaps fertilised by the curling inwards of the petals as their wither for by this means pollengrains adhering to the papillae might be inserted into the cavity of the stigma but it is more probable that their fertilisation is effected as mr bennett suggests by thrips and certain minute beetles which haunt the flowers and which cannot be excluded by any net humblebees are the usual fertilisers but i have more than once seen flies rhingia rostrata at work with the under sides of their bodies heads and legs dusted with pollen and having marked the flowers which they visited i found them after a few days fertilised 46 i should add that this fly apparently did not suck the nectar but was attracted by the papillae which surround the stigma hermann muller also saw a small bee an andrena which could not reach the nectar repeatedly inserting its proboscis beneath the stigma where the papillae are situated so that these papillae must be in some way attractive to insects a writer asserts zoologist volume 34 page 1225 that a moth plusia frequently visits the flowers of the pansy hivebees do not ordinarily visit them but a case has been recorded gardeners chronicle 1844 page 374 of these bees doing so hermann muller has also seen the hivebee at work but only on the wild smallflowered form he gives a list nature 1873 page 45 of all the insects which he has seen visiting both the large and smallflowered forms from his account i suspect that the flowers of plants in a state of nature are visited more frequently by insects than those of the cultivated varieties he has seen several butterflies sucking the flowers of wild plants and this i have never observed in gardens though i have watched the flowers during many years it is curious for how long a time the flowers of the heartsease and of some other plants may be watched without an insect being seen to visit them during the summer of 1841 i observed many times daily for more than a fortnight some large clumps of heartsease growing in my garden before i saw a single humblebee at work during another summer i did the same but at last saw some darkcoloured humblebees visiting on three successive days almost every flower in several clumps and almost all these flowers quickly withered and produced fine capsules i presume that a certain state of the atmosphere is necessary for the secretion of nectar and that as soon as this occurs the insects discover the fact by the odour emitted and immediately frequent the flowers  as the flowers require the aid of insects for their complete fertilisation and as they are not visited by insects nearly so often as most other nectarsecreting flowers we can understand the remarkable fact discovered by h muller and described by him in nature namely that this species exists under two forms one of these bears conspicuous flowers which as we have seen require the aid of insects and are adapted to be crossfertilised by them whilst the other form has much smaller and less conspicuously coloured flowers which are constructed on a slightly different plan favouring selffertilisation and are thus adapted to ensure the propagation of the species the selffertile form however is occasionally visited and may be crossed by insects though this is rather doubtful  in my first experiments on viola tricolor i was unsuccessful in raising seedlings and obtained only one fullgrown crossed and selffertilised plant the former was 12 12 inches and the latter 8 inches in height on the following year several flowers on a fresh plant were crossed with pollen from another plant which was known to be a distinct seedling and to this point it is important to attend several other flowers on the same plant were fertilised with their own pollen the average number of seeds in the ten crossed capsules was 187 and in the twelve selffertilised capsules 1283 or as 100 to 69 these seeds after germinating on bare sand were planted in pairs on the opposite sides of five pots they were first measured when about a third of their full size and the crossed plants then averaged 387 inches and the selffertilised only 200 inches in height or as 100 to 52 they were kept in the greenhouse

any one of the selffertilised as likewise occurred with the pair raised during the previous year these plants without being disturbed were now turned out of their pots and planted in the open ground so as to form five separate clumps early in the following summer 1869 they flowered profusely and being visited by humblebees set many capsules which were carefully collected from all the plants on both sides the crossed plants produced 167 capsules and the selffertilised only 17 or as 100 to 10 so that the crossed plants were more than twice the height of the selffertilised generally flowered first and produced ten times as many naturally fertilised capsules  by the early part of the summer of 1870 the crossed plants in all the five clumps had grown and spread so much more than the selffertilised that any comparison between them was superfluous the crossed plants were covered with a sheet of bloom whilst only a single selffertilised plant which was much finer than any of its brethren flowered the crossed and selffertilised plants had now grown all matted together on the respective sides of the superficial partitions still separating them and in the clump which included the finest selffertilised plant i estimated that the surface covered by the crossed plants was about nine times as large as that covered by the selffertilised plants the extraordinary superiority of the crossed over the selffertilised plants in all five clumps was no doubt due to the crossed plants at first having had a decided advantage over the selffertilised and then robbing them more and more of their food during the succeeding seasons but we should remember that the same result would follow in a state of nature even to a greater degree for my plants grew in ground kept clear of weeds so that the selffertilised had to compete only with the crossed plants whereas the whole surface of the ground is naturally covered with various kinds of plants all of which have to struggle together for existence  the ensuing winter was very severe and in the following spring 1871 the plants were again examined all the selffertilised were now dead with the exception of a single branch on one plant which bore on its summit a minute rosette of leaves about as large as a pea on the other hand all the crossed plants without exception were growing vigorously so that the selffertilised plants besides their inferiority in other respects were more tender  another experiment was now tried for the sake of ascertaining how far the superiority of the crossed plants or to speak more correctly the inferiority of the selffertilised plants would be transmitted to their offspring the one crossed and one selffertilised plant which were first raised had been turned out of their pot and planted in the open ground both produced an abundance of very fine capsules from which fact we may safely conclude that they had been crossfertilised by insects seeds from both after germinating on sand were planted in pairs on the opposite sides of three pots the naturally crossed seedlings derived from the crossed plants flowered in all three pots before the naturally crossed seedlings derived from the selffertilised plants when both lots were in full flower the two tallest plants on each side of each pot were measured and the result is shown in table 442  table 442 viola tricolor seedlings from

offspring from crossed and selffertilised flowers this difference must be attributed to the latter set of plants having inherited a weak constitution from their parents the offspring of selffertilised flowers notwithstanding that the parents themselves had been freely intercrossed with other plants by the aid of insects  10 ranunculaceaeadonis aestivalis  the results of my experiments on this plant are hardly worth giving as i remark in my notes made at the time seedlings from some unknown cause all miserably unhealthy nor did they ever become healthy yet i feel bound to give the present case as it is opposed to the general results at which i have arrived fifteen flowers were crossed and all produced fruit containing on an average 325 seeds nineteen flowers were fertilised with their own pollen and they likewise all yielded fruit containing a rather larger average of 345 seeds or as 100 to 106 seedlings were raised from these seeds in one of the pots all the selffertilised plants died

it yields plenty of seeds when protected from insects  delphinium consolida  it has been said in the case of this plant as of so many others that the flowers are fertilised in the bud and that distinct plants or varieties can never naturally intercross 48 decaisne comptesrendus july 1863 page 5 but this is an error as we may infer firstly from the flowers being proterandrousthe mature stamens bending up one after the other into the passage which leads to the nectary and afterwards the mature pistils bending in the same direction secondly from the number of humblebees which visit the flowers 49 their structure is described by h muller befruchtung etc page 122 and thirdly from the greater fertility of the flowers when crossed with pollen from a distinct plant than when spontaneously selffertilised in the year 1863 i enclosed a large branch in a net and crossed five flowers with pollen from a distinct plant these yielded capsules containing on an average 352 very fine seeds with a maximum of fortytwo in one capsule thirtytwo other flowers on the same branch produced twentyeight spontaneously selffertilised capsules containing on an average 172 seeds with a maximum in one of thirtysix seeds but six of these capsules were very poor yielding only from one to five seeds if these are excluded the remaining twentytwo capsules give an average of 209 seeds though many of these seeds were small the fairest ratio therefore for the number of seeds produced by a cross and by spontaneous selffertilisation is as 100 to 59 these seeds were not sown as i had too many other experiments in progress  in the summer of 1867 which was a very unfavourable one i again crossed several flowers under a net with pollen from a distinct plant and fertilised other flowers on the same plant with their own pollen the former yielded a much larger proportion of capsules than the latter and many of the seeds in the selffertilised capsules though numerous were so poor that an equal number of seeds from the crossed and selffertilised capsules were in weight as 100 to 45 the two lots were allowed to germinate on sand and pairs were planted on the opposite sides

crossed plants here average 1495 and the six selffertilised 1250 inches in height or as 100 to 84 when fully grown they were again measured but from want of time only a single plant on each side was measured so that i have thought it best to give the earlier measurements at the later period the three tallest crossed plants still exceeded considerably in height the three tallest selffertilised but not in quite so great a degree as before the pots were left uncovered in the greenhouse but whether the flowers were intercrossed by bees or selffertilised i do not know the six crossed plants produced 282 mature and immature capsules whilst the six selffertilised plants produced only 159 or as 100 to 56 so that the crossed plants were very much more productive than the selffertilised  11 caryophyllaceaeviscaria oculata  twelve flowers were crossed with pollen from another plant and yielded ten capsules containing by weight 577 grains of seeds eighteen flowers were fertilised with their own pollen and yielded twelve capsules containing by weight 263 grains therefore the seeds from an equal number of crossed and selffertilised flowers would have been in weight as 100 to 38 i had previously selected a mediumsized capsule from each lot and counted the seeds in both the crossed one contained 284 and the selffertilised one 126 seeds or as 100 to 44 these seeds were sown on opposite sides of three pots and several seedlings raised but only the tallest flowerstem of one plant on each side was measured the three on the crossed side averaged 325 inches and the three on the selffertilised side 34 inches in height or as 100 to 104 but this trial was on much too small a scale to be trusted the plants also grew so unequally that one of the three flowerstems on the crossed plants was very nearly twice as tall as that on one of the others and one of the three flowerstems on the selffertilised plants exceeded in an equal degree one of the others  in the following year the experiment was repeated on a larger scale ten flowers were crossed on a new set of plants and yielded ten capsules containing by weight 654 grains of seed eighteen spontaneously selffertilised capsules were gathered of which two contained no seed the other sixteen contained by weight 607 grains of seed therefore the weight of seed from an equal number of crossed and spontaneously selffertilised flowers instead of artificially fertilised as in the previous case was as 100 to 58  the seeds after germinating on sand were planted in pairs on the opposite sides of four pots with all the remaining seeds sown crowded in the opposite sides of a fifth pot in this latter pot only the tallest plant on each side was measured until the seedlings had grown about 5 inches in height no difference could be perceived in the two lots both lots flowered at nearly the same time when they had almost done flowering the tallest flowerstem on each plant was measured as shown in table 445

selffertilised 3355 inches in height or as 100 to 97 so that the excess of height of the crossed plants is quite insignificant in productiveness however the difference was much more plainly marked all the capsules were gathered from both lots of plants except from the crowded and unproductive ones in pot 5 and at the close of the season the few remaining flowers were added in the fourteen crossed plants produced 381 whilst the fourteen selffertilised plants produced only 293 capsules and flowers or as 100 to 77  dianthus caryophyllus  the common carnation is strongly proterandrous and therefore depends to a large extent upon insects for fertilisation i have seen only humblebees visiting the flowers but i dare say other insects likewise do so it is notorious that if pure seed is desired the greatest care is necessary to prevent the varieties which grow in the same garden from intercrossing 410 gardeners chronicle 1847 page 268 the pollen is generally shed and lost before the two stigmas in the same flower diverge and are ready to be fertilised i was therefore often forced to use for selffertilisation pollen from the same plant instead of from the same flower but on two occasions when i attended to this point i was not able to detect any marked difference in the number of seeds produced by these two forms of selffertilisation  several singleflowered carnations were planted in good soil and were all covered with a net eight flowers were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant and yielded six capsules containing on an average 886 seeds with a maximum in one of 112 seeds eight other flowers were selffertilised in the manner above described and yielded seven capsules containing on an average 82 seeds with a maximum in one of 112 seeds so that there was very little difference in the number of seeds produced by crossfertilisation and selffertilisation namely as 100 to 92 as these plants were covered by a net they produced spontaneously only a few capsules containing any seeds and these few may perhaps be attributed to the action of thrips and other minute insects which haunt the flowers a large majority of the spontaneously selffertilised capsules produced by several plants contained no seeds or only a single one excluding these latter capsules i counted the seeds in eighteen of the finest ones and these contained on an average 18 seeds one of the plants was spontaneously selffertile in a higher degree than any of the others on another occasion a single coveredup plant produced spontaneously eighteen capsules but only two of these contained any seed namely 10 and 15  crossed and selffertilised plants of the first generation  the many seeds obtained from the above crossed and artificially selffertilised flowers were sown out of doors and two large beds of seedlings closely adjoining one another thus raised this was the first plant on which i experimented and i had not then formed any regular scheme of operation when the two lots were in full flower i measured roughly a large number of plants but record only that the crossed were on an average fully 4 inches taller than the selffertilised judging from subsequent measurements we may assume that the crossed plants were about 28 inches and the selffertilised about 24 inches in height and this will give us a ratio of 100 to 86 out of a large number of plants four of the crossed ones flowered before any one of the selffertilised plants  thirty flowers on these crossed plants of the first generation were again crossed with pollen from a distinct plant of the same lot and yielded twentynine capsules containing on an average 5562 seeds with a maximum in one of 110 seeds  thirty flowers on the selffertilised plants were again selffertilised eight of them with pollen from the same flower and the remainder with pollen from another flower on the same plant and these produced twentytwo capsules containing on an average 3595 seeds with a maximum in one of sixtyone seeds we thus see judging by the number of seeds per capsule that the crossed plants again crossed were more productive than the selffertilised again selffertilised in the ratio of 100 to 65 both the crossed and selffertilised plants from having grown much crowded in the two beds produced less fine capsules and fewer seeds than did their parents  crossed and selffertilised plants of the second generation  the crossed and selffertilised seeds from the crossed and selffertilised plants of the last generation were sown on opposite sides of two pots but the seedlings were not thinned enough so that both lots grew very irregularly and most of the selffertilised plants after a time died from being smothered my measurements were therefore very incomplete from the first the crossed seedlings appeared the finest and when they were on an average by estimation 5 inches high the selffertilised plants were only 4 inches in both pots the crossed plants flowered first the two tallest flowerstems on the crossed plants in the two pots were 17 and 16 12 inches in height and the two tallest flowerstems on the selffertilised plants 10 12 and 9 inches so that their heights were as 100 to 58 but this ratio deduced from only two pairs obviously is not in the least trustworthy and would not have been given had it not been otherwise supported i state in my notes that the crossed plants were very much more luxuriant than their opponents and seemed to be twice as bulky this latter estimate may be believed from the ascertained weights of the two lots in the next generation some flowers on these crossed plants were again crossed with pollen from another plant of the same lot and some flowers on the selffertilised plants again selffertilised and from the seeds thus obtained the plants of the next generation were raised  crossed and selffertilised plants of the third generation  the seeds just alluded to were allowed to germinate on bare sand and were planted in pairs on the opposite sides of four pots when the seedlings were in full flower the tallest stem on each plant was measured to the base of the calyx the measurements are given in table 446 in pot 1 the crossed and selffertilised plants flowered at the same time but in the other three pots the crossed flowered first these latter plants also continued flowering much later in the autumn than the selffertilised  table 446

of the eight crossed plants is here 2839 inches and of the eight selffertilised 2821 or as 100 to 99 so that there was no difference in height worth speaking of but in general vigour and luxuriance there was an astonishing difference as shown by their weights after the seedcapsules had been gathered the eight crossed and the eight selffertilised plants were cut down and weighed the former weighed 43 ounces and the latter only 21 ounces or as 100 to 49  these plants were all kept under a net so that the capsules which they produced must have been all spontaneously selffertilised the eight crossed plants produced twentyone such capsules of which only twelve contained any seed averaging 85 per capsule on the other hand the eight selffertilised plants produced no less than thirtysix capsules of which i examined twentyfive and with the exception of three all contained seeds averaging 1063 seeds per capsule thus the proportional number of seeds per capsule produced by the plants of crossed origin to those produced by the plants of selffertilised origin both lots being spontaneously selffertilised was as 100 to 125 this anomalous result is probably due to some of the selffertilised plants having varied so as to mature their pollen and stigmas more nearly at the same time than is proper to the species and we have already seen that some plants in the first experiment differed from the others in being slightly more selffertile  the effects of a cross with a fresh stock  twenty flowers on the selffertilised plants of the last or third generation in table 446 were fertilised with their own pollen but taken from other flowers on the same plants these produced fifteen capsules which contained omitting two with only three and six seeds on an average 4723 seeds with a maximum of seventy in one the selffertilised capsules from the selffertilised plants of the first generation yielded the much lower average of 3595 seeds but as these latter plants grew extremely crowded nothing can be inferred with respect to this difference in their selffertility the seedlings raised from the above seeds constitute the plants of the fourth selffertilised generation in table 447  twelve flowers on the same plants of the third selffertilised generation in table 446 were crossed with pollen from the crossed plants in the same table these crossed plants had been intercrossed for the three previous generations and many of them no doubt were more or less closely interrelated but not so closely as in some of the experiments with other species for several carnation plants had been raised and crossed in the earlier generations they were not related or only in a distant degree to the selffertilised plants the parents of both the selffertilised and crossed plants had been subjected to as nearly as possible the same conditions during the three previous generations the above twelve flowers produced ten capsules containing on an average 4866 seeds with a maximum in one of seventytwo seeds the plants raised from these seeds may be called the intercrossed  lastly twelve flowers on the same selffertilised plants of the third generation were crossed with pollen from plants which had been raised from seeds purchased in london it is almost certain that the plants which produced these seeds had grown under very different conditions to those to which my selffertilised and crossed plants had been subjected and they were in no degree related the above twelve flowers thus crossed all produced capsules but these contained the low average of 3741 seeds per capsule with a maximum in one of sixtyfour seeds it is surprising that this cross with a fresh stock did not give a much higher average number of seeds for as we shall immediately see the plants raised from these seeds which may be called the londoncrossed benefited greatly by the cross both in growth and fertility  the above three lots of seeds were allowed to germinate on bare sand many of the londoncrossed germinated before the others and were rejected and many of the intercrossed later than those of the other two lots the seeds after thus germinating were planted in ten pots made tripartite by superficial divisions but when only two kinds of seeds germinated at the same time they were planted on the opposite sides of other pots and this is indicated by blank spaces in one of the three columns in table 447 a 0 in the table signifies that the seedling died before it was measured and a  signifies that the plant did not produce a flowerstem and therefore was not measured it deserves notice that no less than eight out of the eighteen selffertilised plants either died or did not flower whereas only three out of the eighteen intercrossed and four out of the twenty londoncrossed plants were in this predicament the selffertilised plants had a decidedly less vigorous appearance than the plants of the other two lots their leaves being smaller and narrower in only one pot did a selffertilised plant flower before one of the two kinds of crossed plants between which there was no marked difference in the period of flowering the plants were measured to the base of the calyx after they had completed their growth late in the autumn  table 447 dianthus caryophyllus  heights of plants to the base of the calyx measured in inches  column 1 number name of pot

in table 447 is 3282 inches that of the fifteen intercrossed plants 28 inches and that of the ten selffertilised plants 2655  so that in height we have the following ratios  the londoncrossed to the selffertilised as 100 to 81  the londoncrossed to the intercrossed as 100 to 85  the intercrossed to the selffertilised as 100 to 95  these three lots of plants which it should be remembered were all derived on the motherside from plants of the third selffertilised generation fertilised in three different ways were left exposed to the visits of insects and their flowers were freely crossed by them as the capsules of each lot became ripe they were gathered and kept separate the empty or bad ones being thrown away but towards the middle of october when the capsules could no longer ripen all were gathered and were counted whether good or bad the capsules were then crushed and the seed cleaned by sieves and weighed for the sake of uniformity the results are given from calculation as if there had been twenty plants in each lot  the sixteen londoncrossed plants actually produced 286 capsules therefore twenty such plants would have produced 3575 capsules and from the actual weight of the seeds the twenty plants would have yielded 462 grains weight of seeds  the fifteen intercrossed plants actually produced 157 capsules therefore twenty of them would have produced 2093 capsules and the seeds would have weighed 20848 grains  the ten selffertilised plants actually produced 70 capsules therefore twenty of them would have produced 140 capsules and the seeds would have weighed 1532 grains  from these data we get the following ratios  number of capsules produced by an equal number of plants of the three lots  number of capsules  the londoncrossed to the selffertilised as 100 to 39  the londoncrossed to the intercrossed as 100 to 45  the intercrossed to the selffertilised as 100 to 67  weight of seeds produced by an equal number of plants of the three lots  weight of seed  the londoncrossed to the selffertilised as 100 to 33  the londoncrossed to the intercrossed as 100 to 45  the intercrossed to the selffertilised as 100 to 73  we thus see how greatly the offspring from the selffertilised plants of the third generation crossed by a fresh stock had their fertility increased whether tested by the number of capsules produced or by the weight of the contained seeds this latter being the more trustworthy method even the offspring from the selffertilised plants crossed by one of the crossed plants of the same stock notwithstanding that both lots had been long subjected to the same conditions had their fertility considerably increased as tested by the same two methods  in conclusion it may be well to repeat in reference to the fertility of these three lots of plants that their flowers were left freely exposed to the visits of insects and were undoubtedly crossed by them as may be inferred from the large number of good capsules produced these plants were all the offspring of the same motherplants and the strongly marked difference in their fertility must be attributed to the nature of the pollen employed in fertilising their parents and the difference in the nature of the pollen must be attributed to the different treatment to which the pollenbearing parents had been subjected during several previous generations  colour of the flowers  the flowers produced by the selffertilised plants of the last or fourth generation were as uniform in tint as those of a wild species being of a pale pink or rose colour analogous cases with mimulus and ipomoea after several generations of selffertilisation have been already given the flowers of the intercrossed plants of the fourth generation were likewise nearly uniform in colour on the other hand the flowers of the londoncrossed plants or those raised from a cross with the fresh stock which bore dark crimson flowers varied extremely in colour as might have been expected and as is the general rule with seedling carnations it deserves notice that only two or three of the londoncrossed plants produced dark crimson flowers like those of their fathers and only a very few of a pale pink like those of their mothers the great majority had their petals longitudinally and variously striped with the two coloursthe groundwork tint being however in some cases darker than that of the motherplants  12 malvaceaehibiscus africanus  many flowers on this hibiscus were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant and many others were selffertilised a rather larger proportional number of the crossed than of the selffertilised flowers yielded capsules and the crossed capsules contained rather more seeds the selffertilised seeds were a little heavier than an equal number of the crossed seeds but they germinated badly and i raised only four plants of each lot in three out of the four pots the crossed plants flowered first  table 448 hibiscus africanus  heights of plants measured in inches  column 1

and is therefore adapted for crossfertilisation by the aid of insects 51 mr j denny a great raiser of new varieties of pelargoniums after stating that this species is proterandrous adds the florist and pomologist january 1872 page 11 there are some varieties especially those with petals of a pink colour or which possess a weakly constitution where the pistil expands as soon as or even before the pollenbag bursts and in which also the pistil is frequently short so when it expands it is smothered as it were by the bursting anthers these varieties are great seeders each pip being fertilised by its own pollen i would instance christine as an example of this fact we have here an interesting case of variability in an important functional point some flowers on a common scarlet variety were selffertilised and other flowers were crossed with pollen from another plant but no sooner had i done so than i remembered that these plants had been propagated by cuttings from the same stock and were therefore parts in a strict sense of the same individual nevertheless having made the cross i resolved to save the seeds which after germinating on sand were planted on the opposite sides of three pots in one pot the quasicrossed plant was very soon and ever afterwards taller and finer than the selffertilised in the two other pots the seedlings on both sides were for a time exactly equal but when the selffertilised plants were about 10 inches in height they surpassed their antagonists by a little and ever afterwards showed a more decided and increasing advantage so that the selffertilised plants taken altogether were somewhat superior to the quasicrossed plants in this case as in that of the origanum if individuals which have been asexually propagated from the same stock and which have been long subjected to the same conditions are crossed no advantage whatever is gained  several flowers on another plant of the same variety were fertilised with pollen from the younger flowers on the same plant so as to avoid using the old and longshed pollen from the same flower as i thought that this latter might be less efficient than fresh pollen other flowers on the same plant were crossed with fresh pollen from a plant which although closely similar was known to have arisen as a distinct seedling the selffertilised seeds germinated rather before the others but as soon as i got equal pairs they were planted on the opposite sides of four pots  table 549 pelargonium zonale  heights of plants measured in inches  column 1 number name of pot  column 2 crossed plants  column 3

height they were measured to the tips of their uppermost leaves the crossed averaged 1346 and the selffertilised 1107 inches in height or as 100 to 82 five months later they were again measured in the same manner and the results are given in table 549  the seven crossed plants now averaged 2235 and the seven selffertilised 1662 inches in height or as 100 to 74 but from the great inequality of the several plants the result is less trustworthy than in most other cases in pot 2 the two selffertilised plants always had an advantage except whilst quite young over the two crossed plants  as i wished to ascertain how these plants would behave during a second growth they were cut down close to the ground whilst growing freely the crossed plants now showed their superiority in another way for only one out of the seven was killed by the operation whilst three of the selffertilised plants never recovered there was therefore no use in keeping any of the plants excepting those in pots 1 and 3 and in the following year the crossed plants in these two pots showed during their second growth nearly the same relative superiority over the selffertilised plants as before  tropaeolum minus  the flowers are proterandrous and are manifestly adapted for crossfertilisation by insects as shown by sprengel and delpino twelve flowers on some plants growing out of doors were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant and produced eleven capsules containing altogether twentyfour good seeds eighteen flowers were fertilised with their own pollen and produced only eleven capsules containing twentytwo good seeds so that a much larger proportion of the crossed than of the selffertilised flowers produced capsules and the crossed capsules contained rather more seed than the selffertilised in the ratio of 100 to 92 the seeds from the selffertilised capsules were however the heavier of the two in the ratio of 100 to 87  seeds in an equal state of germination were planted on the opposite sides of four

their fertility  14 leguminosae  in this family i experimented on the following six genera lupinus phaseolus lathyrus pisum sarothamnus and ononis  lupinus luteus 52 the structure of the flowers of this plant and their manner of fertilisation have been described by h muller befruchtung etc page 243 the flowers do not secrete free nectar and bees generally visit them for their pollen mr farrer however remarks nature 1872 page 499 that there is a cavity at the back and base of the vexillum in which i have not been able to find nectar but the bees which constantly visit these flowers certainly go to this cavity for what they want and not to the staminal tube  a few flowers were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant but owing to the unfavourable season only two crossed seeds were produced nine seeds were saved from flowers spontaneously selffertilised under a net on the same plant which yielded the two crossed seeds one of these crossed seeds was sown in a pot with two selffertilised seeds on the opposite side the latter came up between two and three days before the crossed seed the second crossed seed was sown in like manner with two selffertilised seeds on the opposite side these latter also came up about a day before the crossed one in both pots therefore the crossed seedlings from germinating later were at first completely beaten by the selffertilised nevertheless this state of things was afterwards completely reversed the seeds were sown late in the autumn and the pots which were much too small were kept in the greenhouse the plants in consequence grew badly and the selffertilised suffered most in both pots the two crossed plants when in flower during the following spring were 9 inches in height one of the selffertilised plants was 8 and the three others only 3 inches in height being thus mere dwarfs the two crossed plants produced thirteen pods whilst the four selffertilised plants produced only a single one some other selffertilised plants which had been raised separately in larger pots produced several spontaneously selffertilised pods under a net and seeds from these were used in the following experiment  crossed and selffertilised plants of the second generation  the spontaneously selffertilised seeds just mentioned and crossed seeds obtained by intercrossing the two crossed plants of the last generation after germinating on sand were planted in pairs on the opposite sides of three large pots when the seedlings were only 4 inches in height the crossed had a slight advantage over their opponents when grown to their full height every one of the crossed plants exceeded its opponent in height nevertheless the selffertilised plants in all three pots flowered before the crossed the measurements are given in

3078 and the eight selffertilised 2521 inches in height or as 100 to 82 these plants were left uncovered in the greenhouse to set their pods but they produced very few good ones perhaps in part owing to few bees visiting them the crossed plants produced nine pods containing on an average 34 seeds and the selffertilised plants seven pods containing on an average 3 seeds so that the seeds from an equal number of plants were as 100 to 88  two other crossed seedlings each with two selffertilised seedlings on the opposite sides of the same large pot were turned out of their pots early in the season without being disturbed into open ground of good quality they were thus subjected to but little competition with one another in comparison with the plants in the above three pots in the autumn the two crossed plants were about 3 inches taller than the four selffertilised plants they looked also more vigorous and produced many more pods  two other crossed and selffertilised seeds of the same lot after germinating on sand were planted on the opposite sides of a large pot in which a calceolaria had long been growing and were therefore exposed to unfavourable conditions the two crossed plants ultimately attained a height of 20 12 and 20 inches whilst the two selffertilised were only 18 and 9 12 inches high  lupinus pilosus  from a series of accidents i was again unfortunate in obtaining a sufficient number of crossed seedlings and the following results would not be worth giving did they not strictly accord with those just given with respect to lupinus luteus i raised at first only a single crossed seedling which was placed in competition with two selffertilised ones on the opposite side of the same pot these plants without being disturbed were soon afterwards turned into the open ground by the autumn the crossed plant had grown to so large a size that it almost smothered the two selffertilised plants which were mere dwarfs and the latter died without maturing a single pod several selffertilised seeds had been planted at the same time separately in the open ground and the two tallest of these were 33 and 32 inches whereas the one crossed plant was 38 inches in height this latter plant also produced many more pods than did any one of the selffertilised plants although growing separately a few flowers on the one crossed plant were crossed with pollen from one of the selffertilised plants for i had no other crossed plant from which to obtain pollen one of the selffertilised plants having been covered by a net produced plenty of spontaneously selffertilised pods  crossed and selffertilised plants of the second generation  from crossed and selffertilised seeds obtained in the manner just described i succeeded in raising to maturity only a pair of plants which were kept in a pot in the greenhouse the crossed plant grew to a height of 33 inches and the selffertilised to that of 26 12 inches the former produced whilst still kept in the greenhouse eight pods containing on an average 277 seeds and the latter only two pods containing on an average 25 seeds the average height of the two crossed plants of the two generations taken together was 355 and that of the three selffertilised plants of the same two generations 305 or as 100 to 86 53 we here see that both lupinus luteus and pilosus seed freely when insects are excluded but mr swale of christchurch in new zealand informs me gardeners chronicle 1858 page 828 that the garden varieties of the lupine are not there visited by any bees and that they seed less freely than any other introduced leguminous plant with the exception of red clover he adds i have for amusement during the summer released the stamens with a pin and a pod of seed has always rewarded me for my trouble the adjoining flowers not so served having all proved blind i do not know to what species this statement refers  phaseolus multiflorus  this plant the scarletrunner of english gardeners and the phaseolus coccineus of lamarck originally came from mexico as i am informed by mr bentham the flowers are so constructed that hive and humblebees which visit them incessantly almost always alight on the left wingpetal as they can best suck the nectar from this side their weight and movements depress the petal and this causes the stigma to protrude from the spirallywound keel and a brush of hairs round the stigma pushes out the pollen before it the pollen adheres to the head or proboscis of the bee which is at work and is thus placed either on the stigma of the same flower or is carried to another flower 54 the flowers have been described by delpino and in an admirable manner by mr farrer in the annals and magazine of natural history volume 2 4th series october 1868 page 256 my son francis has explained nature january 8 1874 page 189 the use of one peculiarity in their structure namely a little vertical projection on the single free stamen near its base which seems placed as if to guard the entrance into the two nectarholes in the staminal sheath he shows that this projection prevents the bees reaching the nectar unless they go to the left side of the flower and it is absolutely necessary for crossfertilisation that they should alight on the left wingpetal several years ago i covered some plants under a large net and these produced on one occasion about onethird and on another occasion about oneeighth of the number of pods which the same number of uncovered plants growing close alongside produced 55 gardeners chronicle 1857 page 725 and more especially ibid 1858 page 828 also annals and magazine of natural history 3rd series volume 2 1858 page 462 this lessened fertility was not caused by any injury from the net as i moved the wingpetals of several protected flowers in the same manner as bees do and these produced remarkably fine pods when the net was taken off the flowers were immediately visited by bees and it was interesting to observe how quickly the plants became covered with young pods as the flowers are much frequented by thrips the selffertilisation of most of the flowers under the net may have been due to the action of these minute insects dr ogle likewise covered up a large portion of a plant and out of a vast number of blossoms thus protected not a single one produced a pod while the unprotected blossoms were for the most part fruitful mr belt gives a more curious case this plant grows well and flowers in nicaragua but as none of the native bees visit the flowers not a single pod is ever produced 56 dr ogle popular science review 1870 page 168 mr belt the naturalist in nicaragua 1874 page 70 the latter author gives a case nature 1875 page 26 of a late crop of phaseolus multiflorus near london which was rendered barren by the humblebees cutting as they frequently do holes at the bases of the flowers instead of entering them in the proper manner  from the facts now given we may feel nearly sure that individuals of the same variety or of different varieties if growing near each other and in flower at the same time would intercross but i cannot myself advance any direct evidence of such an occurrence as only a single variety is commonly cultivated in england i have however received an account from the reverend wa leighton that plants raised by him from ordinary seed produced seeds differing in an extraordinary manner in colour and shape leading to the belief that their parents must have been crossed in france m fermond more than once planted close together varieties which ordinarily come true and which bear differently coloured flowers and seeds and the offspring thus raised varied so greatly that there could hardly be a doubt that they had intercrossed 57 fécondation chez les végétaux 1859 pages 3440 he adds that m villiers has described a spontaneous hybrid which he calls phaseolus coccineus hybridus in the annales de la soc r de horticulture june 1844 on the other hand professor h hoffman does not believe in the natural crossing of the varieties for although seedlings raised from two varieties growing close together produced plants which yielded seeds of a mixed character he found that this likewise occurred with plants separated by a space of from 40 to 150 paces from any other variety he therefore attributes the mixed character of the seed to spontaneous variability 58 bestimmung des werthes von species und varietat 1869 pages 4772 but the above distance would be very far from sufficient to prevent intercrossing cabbages have been known to cross at several times this distance and the careful gartner gives many instances of plants growing at from 600 to 800 yards apart fertilising one another 59 kenntnis der befruchtung 1844 pages 573 577 professor hoffman even maintains that the flowers of the kidneybean are specially adapted for selffertilisation he enclosed several flowers in bags and as the buds often dropped off he attributes the partial sterility of these flowers to the injurious effects of the bags and not to the exclusion of insects but the only safe method of experimenting is to cover up a whole plant which then never suffers  selffertilised seeds were obtained by moving up and down in the same manner as bees do the wingpetals of flowers protected by a net and crossed seeds were obtained by crossing two of the plants under the same net the seeds after germinating on sand were planted on the opposite sides of two large pots and equalsized sticks were given them to twine up when 8 inches in height the plants on the two sides were equal the crossed plants flowered before the selffertilised in both pots as soon as one of each pair had grown to the summit of its stick both were measured  table 553 phaseolus

there was little or no difference in the fertility of the two lots therefore as far as these few observations serve the advantage gained by a cross is very small  phaseolus vulgaris  with respect to this species i merely ascertained that the flowers were highly fertile when insects were excluded as indeed must be the case for the plants are often forced during the winter when no insects are present some plants of two varieties namely canterbury and fulmers forcing bean were covered with a net and they seemed to produce as many pods containing as many beans as some uncovered plants growing alongside but neither the pods nor the beans were actually counted this difference in selffertility between phaseolus vulgaris and multifloris is remarkable as these two species are so closely related that linnaeus thought that they formed one when the varieties of phaseolus vulgaris grow near one another in the open ground they sometimes cross largely notwithstanding their capacity for selffertilisation mr coe has given me a remarkable instance of this fact with respect to the negro and a whiteseeded and a brownseeded variety which were all grown together the diversity of character in the seedlings of the second generation raised by me from his plants was wonderful i could add other analogous cases and the fact is wellknown to gardeners 510 i have given mr coes case in the gardeners chronicle 1858 page 829 see also for another case ibid page 845  lathyrus odoratus  almost everyone who has studied the structure of papilionaceous flowers has been convinced that they are specially adapted for crossfertilisation although many of the species are likewise capable of selffertilisation the case therefore of lathyrus odoratus or the sweetpea is curious for in this country it seems invariably to fertilise itself i conclude that this is so as five varieties differing greatly in the colour of their flowers but in no other respect are commonly sold and come true yet on inquiry from two great raisers of seed for sale i find that they take no precautions to insure puritythe five varieties being habitually grown close together 511 see mr w earley in nature 1872 page 242 to the same effect he once however saw bees visiting the flowers and supposed that on this occasion they would have been intercrossed i have myself purposely made similar trials with the same result although the varieties always come true yet as we shall presently see one of the five wellknown varieties occasionally gives birth to another which exhibits all its usual characters owing to this curious fact and to the darkercoloured varieties being the most productive these increase to the exclusion of the others as i was informed by the late mr masters if there be no selection  in order to ascertain what would be the effect of crossing two varieties some flowers on the purple sweetpea which has a dark reddishpurple standardpetal with violetcoloured wingpetals and keel were castrated whilst very young and were fertilised with pollen of the painted lady this latter variety has a pale cherrycoloured standard with almost white wings and keel on two occasions i raised from a flower thus crossed plants perfectly resembling both parentforms but the greater number resembled the paternal variety so perfect was the resemblance that i should have suspected some mistake in the label had not the plants which were at first identical in appearance with the father or painted lady later in the season produced flowers blotched and streaked with dark purple this is an interesting example of partial reversion in the same individual plant as it grows older the purpleflowered plants were thrown away as they might possibly have been the product of the accidental selffertilisation of the motherplant owing to the castration not having been effectual but the plants which resembled in the colour of their flowers the paternal variety or painted lady were preserved and their seeds saved next summer many plants were raised from these seeds and they generally resembled their grandfather the painted lady but most of them had their wingpetals streaked and stained with dark pink and a few had pale purple wings with the standard of a darker crimson than is natural to the painted lady so that they formed a new subvariety amongst these plants a single one appeared having purple flowers like those of the grandmother but with the petals slightly streaked with a paler tint this was thrown away seeds were again saved from the foregoing plants and the seedlings thus raised still resembled the painted lady or greatgrandfather but they now varied much the standard petal varying from pale to dark red in a few instances with blotches of white and the wingpetals varied from nearly white to purple the keel being in all nearly white  as no variability of this kind can be detected in plants raised from seeds the parents of which have grown during many successive generations in close proximity we may infer that they cannot have intercrossed what does occasionally occur is that in a row of plants raised from seeds of one variety another variety true of its kind appears for instance in a long row of scarlets the seeds of which had been carefully gathered from scarlets for the sake of this experiment two purples and one painted lady appeared seeds from these three aberrant plants were saved and sown in separate beds the seedlings from both the purples were chiefly purples but with some painted ladies and some scarlets the seedlings from the aberrant painted lady were chiefly painted ladies with some scarlets each variety whatever its parentage may have been retained all its characters perfect and there was no streaking or blotching of the colours as in the foregoing plants of crossed origin another variety however is often sold which is striped and blotched with dark purple and this is probably of crossed origin for i found as well as mr masters that it did not transmit its characters at all truly  from the evidence now given we may conclude that the varieties of the sweetpea rarely or never intercross in this country and this is a highly remarkable fact considering firstly the general structure of the flowers secondly the large quantity of pollen produced far more than is requisite for selffertilisation and thirdly the occasional visit of insects that insects should sometimes fail to crossfertilise the flowers is intelligible for i have thrice seen humblebees of two kinds as well as hivebees sucking the nectar and they did not depress the keelpetals so as to expose the anthers and stigma they were therefore quite inefficient for fertilising the flowers one of these bees namely bombus lapidarius stood on one side at the base of the standard and inserted its proboscis beneath the single separate stamen as i afterwards ascertained by opening the flower and finding this stamen prised up bees are forced to act in this manner from the slit in the staminal tube being closely covered by the broad membranous margin of the single stamen and from the tube not being perforated by nectarpassages on the other hand in the three british species of lathyrus which i have examined and in the allied genus vicia two nectarpassages are present therefore british bees might well be puzzled how to act in the case of the sweetpea i may add that the staminal tube of another exotic species lathyrus grandiflorus is not perforated by nectarpassages and this species has rarely set any pods in my garden unless the wingpetals were moved up and down in the same manner as bees ought to do and then pods were generally formed but from some cause often dropped off afterwards one of my sons caught an elephant sphinxmoth whilst visiting the flowers of the sweetpea but this insect would not depress the wingpetals and keel on the other hand i have seen on one occasion hivebees and two or three occasions the megachile willughbiella in the act of depressing the keel and these bees had the under sides of their bodies thickly covered with pollen and could not thus fail to carry pollen from one flower to the stigma of another why then do not the varieties occasionally intercross though this would not often happen as insects so rarely act in an efficient manner the fact cannot as it appears be explained by the flowers being selffertilised at a very early age for although nectar is sometimes secreted and pollen adheres to the viscid stigma before the flowers are fully expanded yet in five young flowers which were examined by me the pollentubes were not exserted whatever the cause may be we may conclude that in england the varieties never or very rarely intercross but it does not follow from this that they would not be cross by the aid of other and larger insects in their native country which in botanical works is said to be the south of europe and the east indies accordingly i wrote to professor delpino in florence and he informs me that it is the fixed opinion of gardeners there that the varieties do intercross and that they cannot be preserved pure unless they are sown separately  it follows also from the foregoing facts that the several varieties of the sweetpea must have propagated themselves in england by selffertilisation for very many generations since the time when each new variety first appeared from the analogy of the plants of mimulus and ipomoea which had been selffertilised for several generations and from trials previously made with the common pea which is in nearly the same state as the sweetpea it appeared to me very improbable that a cross between the individuals of the same variety would benefit the offspring a cross of this kind was therefore not tried which i now regret but some flowers of the painted lady castrated at an early age were fertilised with pollen from the purple sweetpea and it should be remembered that these varieties differ in nothing except in the colour of their flowers the cross was manifestly effectual though only two seeds were obtained as was shown by the two seedlings when they flowered closely resembling their father the purple pea excepting that they were a little lighter coloured with their keels slightly streaked with pale purple seeds from flowers spontaneously selffertilised under a net were at the same time saved from the same motherplant the painted lady these seeds unfortunately did not germinate on sand at the same time with the crossed seeds so that they could not be planted simultaneously one of the two crossed seeds in a state of germination was planted in a pot number 1 in which a selffertilised seed in the same state had been planted four days before so that this latter seedling had a great advantage over the crossed one in pot 2 the other crossed seed was planted two days before a selffertilised one so that here the crossed seedling had a considerable advantage over the selffertilised one but this crossed seedling had its summit gnawed off by a slug and was in consequence for a time quite beaten by the selffertilised plant nevertheless i allowed it to remain and so great was its constitutional vigour that it ultimately beat its uninjured selffertilised rival when all four plants were almost fully grown they were measured as here shown  table 554 lathyrus odoratus  heights of plants measured in

7925 and the two selffertilised 6375 inches in height or as 100 to 80 six flowers on these two crossed plants were reciprocally crossed with pollen from the other plant and the six pods thus produced contained on an average six peas with a maximum in one of seven eighteen spontaneously selffertilised pods from the painted lady which as already stated had no doubt been selffertilised for many previous generations contained on an average only 393 peas with a maximum in one of five peas so that the number of peas in the crossed and selffertilised pods was as 100 to 65 the selffertilised peas were however quite as heavy as those from the crossed pods from these two lots of seeds the plants of the next generation were raised  plants of the second generation  many of the selffertilised peas just referred to germinated on sand before any of the crossed ones and were rejected as soon as i got equal pairs they were planted on the opposite sides of two large pots which were kept in the greenhouse the seedlings thus raised were the grandchildren of the painted lady which was first crossed by the purple variety when the two lots were from 4 to 6 inches in height there was no difference between them nor was there any marked difference in the period of their flowering when fully grown they were measured as follows  table 555 lathyrus odoratus second generation  heights of

greenhouse thirtyfive pods and the selffertilised thirtytwo pods  seeds were saved from the selffertilised flowers on these two lots of plants for the sake of ascertaining whether the seedlings thus raised would inherit any difference in growth or vigour it must therefore be understood that both lots in the following trial are plants of selffertilised parentage but that in the one lot the plants were the children of plants which had been crossed during two previous generations having been before that selffertilised for many generations and that in the other lot they were the children of plants which had not been crossed for very many previous generations the seeds germinated on sand and were planted in pairs on the opposite sides of four pots they were measured when fully grown with

501      452  the average height of the seven selffertilised plants the offspring of crossed plants is 7157 and that of the seven selffertilised plants the offspring of selffertilised plants is 6457 or as 100 to 90 the selffertilised plants from the selffertilised produced rather more podsnamely thirtysixthan the selffertilised plants from the crossed for these produced only thirtyone pods  a few seeds of the same two lots were sown in the opposite corners of a large box in which a brugmansia had long been growing and in which the soil was so exhausted that seeds of ipomoea purpurea would hardly vegetate yet the two plants of the sweetpea which were raised flourished well for a long time the selffertilised plant from the selffertilised beat the selffertilised plant from the crossed plant the former flowered first and was at one time 77 12 inches whilst the latter was only 68 12 in height but ultimately the plant from the previous cross showed its superiority and attained a height of 108 12 inches whilst the other was only 95 inches i also sowed some of the same two lots of seeds in poor soil in a shady place in a shrubbery here again the selffertilised plants from the selffertilised for a long time exceeded considerably in height those from the previously crossed plants and this may probably be attributed in the present as in the last case to these seeds having germinated rather sooner than those from the crossed plants but at the close of the season the tallest of the selffertilised plants from the crossed plants was 30 inches whilst the tallest of the selffertilised from the selffertilised was 29 38 inches in height  from the various facts now given we see that plants derived from a cross between two varieties of the sweetpea which differ in no respect except in the colour of their flowers exceed considerably in height the offspring from selffertilised plants both in the first and second generations the crossed plants also transmit their superiority in height and vigour to their selffertilised offspring  pisum sativum  the common pea is perfectly fertile when its flowers are protected from the visits of insects i ascertained this with two or three different varieties as did dr ogle with another but the flowers are likewise adapted for crossfertilisation mr farrer specifies the following points namely the open blossom displaying itself in the most attractive and convenient position for insects the conspicuous vexillum the wings forming an alighting place the attachment of the wings to the keel by which any body pressing on the former must press down the latter the staminal tube enclosing nectar and affording by means of its partially free stamen with apertures on each side of its base an open passage to an insect seeking the nectar the moist and sticky pollen placed just where it will be swept out of the apex of the keel against the entering insect the stiff elastic style so placed that on a pressure being applied to the keel it will be pushed upwards out of the keel the hairs on the style placed on that side of the style only on which there is space for the pollen and in such a direction as to sweep it out and the stigma so placed as to meet an entering insectall these become correlated parts of one elaborate mechanism if we suppose that the fertilisation of these flowers is effected by the carriage of pollen from one to the other 512 nature october 10 1872 page 479 hermann muller gives an elaborate description of the flowers befruchtung etc page 247 notwithstanding these manifest provisions for crossfertilisation varieties which have been cultivated for very many successive generations in close proximity although flowering at the same time remain pure i have elsewhere given evidence on this head and if required could give more 513 variation of animals and plants under domestication chapter 9 2nd edition volume 1 page 348 there can hardly be a doubt that some of knights varieties which were originally produced by an artificial cross and were very vigorous lasted for at least sixty years and during all these years were selffertilised for had it been otherwise they would not have kept true as the several varieties are generally grown near together most of the varieties however endure for a shorter period and this may be in part due to their weakness of constitution from longcontinued selffertilisation  it is remarkable considering that the flowers secrete much nectar and afford much pollen how seldom they are visited by insects either in england or as h muller remarks in north germany i have observed the flowers for the last thirty years and in all this time have only thrice seen bees of the proper kind at work one of them being bombus muscorum such as were sufficiently powerful to depress the keel so as to get the undersides of their bodies dusted with pollen these bees visited several flowers and could hardly have failed to crossfertilise them hivebees and other small kinds sometimes collect pollen from old and already fertilised flowers but this is of no account the rarity of the visits of efficient bees to this exotic plant is i believe the chief cause of the varieties so seldom intercrossing that a cross does occasionally take place as might be expected from what has just been stated is certain from the recorded cases of the direct action of the pollen of one variety on the seedcoats of another 514 variation of animals and plants under domestication chapter 11 2nd edition volume 1 page 428 the late mr masters who particularly attended to the raising of new varieties of peas was convinced that some of them had originated from accidental crosses but as such crosses are rare the old varieties would not often be thus deteriorated more especially as plants departing from the proper type are generally rejected by those who collect seed for sale there is another cause which probably tends to render crossfertilisation rare namely the early age at which the pollentubes are exserted eight flowers not fully expanded were examined and in seven of these the pollentubes were in this state but they had not as yet penetrated the stigma although so few insects visit the flowers of the pea in this country or in north germany and although the anthers seem here to open abnormally soon it does not follow that the species in its native country would be thus circumstanced  owing to the varieties having been selffertilised for many generations and to their having been subjected in each generation to nearly the same conditions as will be explained in a future chapter i did not expect that a cross between two such plants would benefit the offspring and so it proved on trial in 1867 i covered up several plants of the early emperor pea which was not then a very new variety so that it must already have been propagated by selffertilisation for at least a dozen generations some flowers were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant growing in the same row and others were allowed to fertilise themselves under a net the two lots of seeds thus obtained were sown on opposite sides of two large pots but only four pairs came up at the same time the pots were kept in the greenhouse the seedlings of both lots when between 6 and 7 inches in height were equal when nearly fullgrown they were measured as in table 557  table 557 pisum sativum  heights of plants measured in inches  column 1 number name of pot  column 2 crossed plants  column 3 selffertilised plants  pot 1    35       29 68  pot 2    31 48   51 pot 2    35       45 pot 2    37       33  total   13850   15875  the average height of the four crossed plants is here 3462 and that of the four selffertilised plants 3968 or as 100 to 115 so that the crossed plants far from beating the selffertilised were completely beaten by them  there can be no doubt that the result would have been widely different if any two varieties out of the numberless ones which exist had been crossed notwithstanding that both had been selffertilised for many previous generations each would almost certainly have possessed its own peculiar constitution and this degree of differentiation would have been sufficient to make a cross highly beneficial i have spoken thus confidently of the benefit which would have been derived from crossing any two varieties of the pea from the following facts andrew knight in speaking of the results of crossing reciprocally very tall and short varieties says i had in this experiment a striking instance of the stimulative effects of crossing the breeds for the smallest variety whose height rarely exceeded 2 feet was increased to 6 feet whilst the height of the large and luxuriant kind was very little diminished 515 philosophical transactions 1799 page 200 recently mr laxton has made numerous crosses and everyone had been astonished at the vigour and luxuriance of the new varieties which he has thus raised and afterwards fixed by selection he gave me seedpeas produced from crosses between four distinct kinds and the plants thus raised were extraordinarily vigorous being in each case from 1 to 2 or even 3 feet taller than the parentforms which were raised at the same time close alongside but as i did not measure their actual height i cannot give the exact ratio but it must have been at least as 100 to 75 a similar trial was subsequently made with two other peas from a different cross and the result was nearly the same for instance a crossed seedling between the maple and purplepodded pea was planted in poor soil and grew to the extraordinary height of 116 inches whereas the tallest plant of either parent variety namely a purplepodded pea was only 70 inches in height or as 100 to 60  sarothamnus scoparius  bees incessantly visit the flowers of the common broom and these are adapted by a curious mechanism for crossfertilisation when a bee alights on the wingpetals of a young flower the keel is slightly opened and the short stamens spring out which rub their pollen against the abdomen of the bee if a rather older flower is visited for the first time or if the bee exerts great force on a younger flower the keel opens along its whole length and the longer as well as the shorter stamens together with the much elongated curved pistil spring forth with violence the flattened spoonlike extremity of the pistil rests for a time on the back of the bee and leaves on it the load of pollen with which it is charged as soon as the bee flies away the pistil instantly curls round so that the stigmatic surface is now upturned and occupies a position in which it would be rubbed against the abdomen of another bee visiting the same flower thus when the pistil first escapes from the keel the stigma is rubbed against the back of the bee dusted with pollen from the longer stamens either of the same or another flower and afterwards against the lower surface of the bee dusted with pollen from the shorter stamens which is often shed a day or two before that from the longer stamens 516 these observations have been quoted in an abbreviated form by the reverend g henslow in the journal of linnean society botany volume 9 1866 page 358 hermann muller has since published a full and excellent account of the flower in his befruchtung etc page 240 by this mechanism crossfertilisation is rendered almost inevitable and we shall immediately see that pollen from a distinct plant is more effective than that from the same flower i need only add that according to h muller the flowers do not secrete nectar and he thinks that bees insert their proboscides only in the hope of finding nectar but they act in this manner so frequently and for so long a time that i cannot avoid the belief that they obtain something palatable within the flowers  if the visits of bees are prevented and if the flowers are not dashed by the wind against any object the keel never opens so that the stamens and pistil remain enclosed plants thus protected yield very few pods in comparison with those produced by neighbouring uncovered bushes and sometimes none at all i fertilised a few flowers on a plant growing almost in a state of nature with pollen from another plant close alongside and the four crossed capsules contained on an average 92 seeds this large number no doubt was due to the bush being covered up and thus not exhausted by producing many pods for fifty pods gathered from an adjoining plant the flowers of which had been fertilised by the bees contained an average of only 714 seeds ninetythree pods spontaneously selffertilised on a large bush which had been covered up but had been much agitated by the wind contained an average of 293 seeds ten of the finest of these ninetythree capsules yielded an average of 430 seeds that is less than half the average number in the four artificially crossed capsules the ratio of 714 to 293 or as 100 to 41 is probably the fairest for the number of seeds per pod yielded by naturallycrossed and spontaneously selffertilised flowers the crossed seeds compared with an equal number of the spontaneously selffertilised seeds were heavier in the ratio of 100 to 88 we thus see that besides the mechanical adaptations for crossfertilisation the flowers are much more productive with pollen from a distinct plant than with their own pollen  eight pairs of the above crossed and selffertilised seeds after they had germinated on sand were planted 1867 on the opposite sides of two large pots when several of the seedlings were an inch and a half in height there was no marked difference between the two lots but even at this early age the leaves of the selffertilised seedlings were smaller and of not so bright a green as those of the crossed seedlings the pots were kept in the greenhouse and as the plants on the following spring 1868 looked unhealthy and had grown but little they were plunged still in their pots into the open ground the plants all suffered much from the sudden change especially the selffertilised and two of the latter died the remainder were measured and i give the measurements in table 558 because i have not seen in any other species so great a difference between the crossed and selffertilised seedlings at so early an age  table 558 sarothamnus scoparius very young plants  heights of plants measured in inches  column 1 number name

spring of the succeeding year 1869 the three crossed plants in pot 1 had all grown to nearly a foot in height and they had smothered the three little selffertilised plants so completely that two were dead and the third only an inch and a half in height was dying it should be remembered that these plants had been bedded out in their pots so that they were subjected to very severe competition this pot was now thrown away  the six plants in pot 2 were all alive one of the selffertilised was an inch and a quarter taller than any one of the crossed plants but the other two selffertilised plants were in a very poor condition i therefore resolved to leave these plants to struggle together for some years by the autumn of the same year 1869 the selffertilised plant which had been victorious was

1891 and the three selffertilised 1183 inches in height or as 100 to 63 the three crossed plants in pot 1 as already shown had beaten the three selffertilised plants so completely that any comparison between them was superfluous  the winter of 18701871 was severe in the spring the three crossed plants in pot 2 had not even the tips of their shoots in the least injured whereas all three selffertilised plants were killed halfway down to the ground and this shows how much more tender they were in consequence not one of these latter plants bore a single flower during the ensuing summer of 1871 whilst all three crossed plants flowered  ononis minutissima  this plant of which seeds were sent me from north italy produces besides the ordinary papilionaceous flowers minute imperfect closed or cleistogene flowers which can never be crossfertilised but are highly selffertile some of the perfect flowers were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant and six capsules thus produced yielded on an average 366 seeds with a maximum of five in one twelve perfect flowers were marked and allowed to fertilise themselves spontaneously under a net and they yielded eight capsules containing on an average 238 seeds with a maximum of three seeds in one so that the crossed and selffertilised capsules from the perfect flowers yielded seeds in the proportion of 100 to 65 fiftythree capsules produced by the cleistogene flowers contained on an average 41 seeds so that these were the most productive of all and the seeds themselves looked finer even than those from the crossed perfect flowers  the seeds from the crossed perfect flowers and from the selffertilised cleistogene flowers were allowed to germinate on sand but unfortunately only two pairs germinated at the same time these were planted on the opposite sides of the same pot which was kept in the greenhouse in the summer of the same year when the seedlings were about 4 12 inches in height the two lots were equal in the autumn of the following year 1868 the two crossed plants were of exactly the same height namely 11 48 inches and the two selffertilised plants 12 68 and 7 28 inches so that one of the selffertilised exceeded considerably in height all the others by the autumn of 1869 the two crossed plants had acquired the supremacy their height being 16 48 and 15 18 whilst that of the two selffertilised plants was 14 58 and 11 48 inches  by the autumn of 1870 the heights were as follows  table 561 ononis minutissima  heights of plants measured in inches  column 1 crossed plants  column

or as 100 to 88 it should be remembered that the two lots were at first equal in height that one of the selffertilised plants then had the advantage the two crossed plants being at last victorious  summary on the leguminosae  six genera in this family were experimented on and the results are in some respects remarkable the crossed plants of the two species of lupinus were conspicuously superior to the selffertilised plants in height and fertility and when grown under very unfavourable conditions in vigour the scarletrunner phaseolus multiflorus is partially sterile if the visits of bees are prevented and there is reason to believe that varieties growing near one another intercross the five crossed plants however exceeded in height the five selffertilised only by a little phaseolus vulgaris is perfectly selfsterile nevertheless varieties growing in the same garden sometimes intercross largely the varieties of lathyrus odoratus on the other hand appear never to intercross in this country and though the flowers are not often visited by efficient insects i cannot account for this fact more especially as the varieties are believed to intercross in north italy plants raised from a cross between two varieties differing only in the colour of their flowers grew much taller and were under unfavourable conditions more vigorous than the selffertilised plants they also transmitted when selffertilised their superiority to their offspring the many varieties of the common pea pisum sativum though growing in close proximity very seldom intercross and this seems due to the rarity in this country of the visits of bees sufficiently powerful to effect crossfertilisation a cross between the selffertilised individuals of the same variety does no good whatever to the offspring whilst a cross between distinct varieties though closely allied does great good of which we have excellent evidence the flowers of the broom sarothamnus are almost sterile if they are not disturbed and if insects are excluded the pollen from a distinct plant is more effective than that from the same flower in producing seeds the crossed seedlings have an enormous advantage over the selffertilised when grown together in close competition lastly only four plants of the ononis minutissima were raised but as these were observed during their whole growth the advantage of the crossed over the selffertilised plants may i think be fully trusted  15 onagraceaeclarkia elegans  owing to the season being very unfavourable 1867 few of the flowers which i fertilised formed capsules twelve crossed flowers produced only four and eighteen selffertilised flowers yielded only one capsule the seeds after germinating on sand were planted in three pots but all the selffertilised plants died in one of them when the two lots were between 4 and 5 inches in height the crossed began to show a slight superiority over the selffertilised when in full flower they were measured with the following result

some flowers were crossed and selffertilised in the usual manner during two seasons but as i reared on the first occasion only two pairs the results are given together on both occasions the crossed capsules contained slightly more seeds than the selffertilised during the first year when the plants were about 7 inches in height the selffertilised were the tallest and in the second year the crossed were the tallest when the two lots were in full flower they were measured as in table 563  table 563 bartonia aurea  heights of plants measured in inches  column 1 number name of pot  column 2

selffertilised had a decided advantage over the crossed but the plants from some cause never grew well and finally became so unhealthy that only three crossed and three selffertilised plants survived to set any capsules and these were few in number the two lots seemed to be about equally unproductive  17 passifloraceaepassiflora gracilis  this annual species produces spontaneously numerous fruits

umbelliferaeapium petroselinum  the umbelliferae are proterandrous and can hardly fail to be crossfertilised by the many flies and small hymenoptera which visit the flowers 518 hermann muller

covered by a net and it apparently produced as many and as fine spontaneously selffertilised fruits or seeds as the adjoining uncovered plants the flowers on the latter were visited by so many insects that they must have received pollen from one another some of these two lots of seeds were left on sand but nearly all the selffertilised seeds germinated before the others so that i was forced to throw all away the remaining seeds were then sown on the opposite sides of four pots at first the selffertilised seedlings were a little taller in most of the pots than the naturally crossed seedlings and this no doubt was due to the selffertilised seeds having germinated first but in the autumn all the plants were so equal that it did not seem worth while to measure them in two of the pots they were absolutely equal in a third if there was any difference it was in favour of the crossed plants and in a somewhat plainer manner in the fourth pot but neither side had any substantial advantage over the other so that in height they may be said to be as 100 to 100  19 dipsaceaescabiosa atropurpurea  the flowers which are proterandrous were fertilised during the unfavourable season of 1867 so that i got few seeds especially from the selffertilised heads which were extremely sterile the crossed and selffertilised plants raised from these seeds were measured before they were in full flower

now averaged in height 3283 and the selffertilised 3016 inches or as 100 to 92  20 compositaelactuca sativa 519 the compositae are welladapted for crossfertilisation but a nurseryman on whom i can rely told me that he had been in the habit of sowing several kinds of lettuce near together for the sake of seed and had never observed that they became crossed it is very improbable that all the varieties which were thus cultivated near together flowered at different times but two which i selected by hazard and sowed near each other did not flower at the same time and my trial failed  three plants of lettuce great london cos var grew close together in my garden one was covered by a net and produced selffertilised seeds the other two were allowed to be naturally crossed by insects but the season 1867 was unfavourable and i did not obtain many seeds only one crossed and one selffertilised plant were raised in pot 1 and their measurements are given in table 566 the flowers on this one selffertilised plant were again selffertilised under a net not with pollen from the same floret but from other florets on the same head the flowers on the two crossed plants were left to be crossed by insects but the process was aided by some pollen being occasionally transported by me from plant to plant these two lots of seeds after germinating on sand were planted in pairs on the opposite sides of pots 2 and 3 which were at first kept in the greenhouse and then turned out of doors the plants were measured when in full flower table 566 therefore includes plants belonging to two generations when the seedlings of the two lots were only 5 or 6 inches in height they were equal in pot 3 one of the selffertilised plants died before flowering as has occurred in so many other cases  table 566

in the closely allied genus campanula in which specularia was formerly included the anthers shed at an early period their pollen and this adheres to the collecting hairs which surround the pistil beneath the stigma so that without some mechanical aid the flowers cannot be fertilised for instance i covered up a plant of campanula carpathica and it did not produce a single capsule whilst the surrounding uncovered plants seeded profusely on the other hand the present species of specularia appears to set almost as many capsules when covered up as when left to the visits of the diptera which as far as i have seen are the only insects that frequent the flowers 520 it has long been known that another species of the genus specularia perfoliata produces cleistogene as well as perfect flowers and the former are of course selffertile i did not ascertain whether the naturally crossed and spontaneously selffertilised capsules contained an equal number of seeds but a comparison of artificially crossed and selffertilised flowers showed that the former were probably the most productive it appears that this plant is capable of producing a large number of selffertilised capsules owing to the petals closing at night as well as during cold weather in the act of closing the margins of the petals become reflexed and their inwardly projecting midribs then pass between the clefts of the stigma and in doing so push the pollen from the outside of the pistil on to the stigmatic surfaces 521 mr meehan has lately shown proceedings of the academy of natural science philadelphia may 16 1876 page 84 that the closing of the flowers of claytonia virginica and ranunculus bulbosus during the night causes their selffertilisation  twenty flowers were fertilised by me with their own pollen but owing to the bad season only six capsules were produced they contained on an average 217 seeds with a maximum of fortyeight in one fourteen flowers were crossed with pollen from another plant and these produced twelve capsules containing on an average 30 seeds with a maximum in one of fiftyseven seeds so that the crossed seeds were to the selffertilised from an equal number of capsules as 100 to 72 the former were also heavier than an equal number of selffertilised seeds in the ratio of 100 to 86 thus whether we judge by the number of capsules produced from an equal number of flowers or by the average number of the contained seeds or the maximum number in any one capsule or by their weight crossing does great good in comparison with selffertilisation the two lots of seeds were sown on the opposite sides of four pots but the seedlings were not sufficiently thinned only the tallest plant on each side was measured when fully grown the measurements are given in table 567 in all four pots the crossed plants flowered first when the seedlings were only about an inch and a half in height both lots were equal  table 567 specularia speculum  heights of plants measured in inches  column 1

between the two lots in height though other great advantages are derived as we have seen from crossfertilisation from being grown in pots and kept in the greenhouse none of the plants produced any capsules  lobelia ramosa 522 i have adopted the name given to this plant in the gardeners chronicle 1866 professor t dyer however informs me that it probably is a white variety of l tenuior of r brown from w australia  var snowflake  the welladapted means by which crossfertilisation is ensured in this genus have been described by several authors 523 see the works of hildebrand and delpino mr farrer also has given a remarkably clear description of the mechanism by which crossfertilisation is effected in this genus in the annals and magazine of natural history volume 2 4th series 1868 page 260 in the allied genus isotoma the curious spike which projects rectangularly from the anthers and which when shaken causes the pollen to fall on the back of an entering insect seems to have been developed from a bristle like one of those which spring from the anthers in some of or all the species of lobelia as described by mr farrer the pistil as it slowly increases in length pushes the pollen out of the conjoined anthers by the aid of a ring of bristles the two lobes of the stigma being at this time closed and incapable of fertilisation the extrusion of the pollen is also aided by insects which rub against the little bristles that project from the anthers the pollen thus pushed out is carried by insects to the older flowers in which the stigma of the now freely projecting pistil is open and ready to be fertilised i proved the importance of the gailycoloured corolla by cutting off the large flowers of lobelia erinus and these flowers were neglected by the hivebees which were incessantly visiting the other flowers  a capsule was obtained by crossing a flower of l ramosa with pollen from another plant and two other capsules from artificially selffertilised flowers the contained seeds were sown on the opposite sides of four pots some of the crossed seedlings which came up before the others had to be pulled up and thrown away whilst the plants were very small there was not much difference in height between the two lots but in pot 3 the selffertilised were for a time the tallest when in full flower the tallest plant on each side of each pot was measured and the result is shown in table 568 in all four pots a crossed plant flowered before any one of its opponents  table 568 lobelia ramosa first generation  heights of plants measured in inches  column 1 number name of

   735  the four tallest crossed plants averaged 2225 and the four tallest selffertilised 1837 inches in height or as 100 to 82 i was surprised to find that the anthers of a good many of these selffertilised plants did not cohere and did not contain any pollen and the anthers even of a very few of the crossed plants were in the same condition some flowers on the crossed plants were again crossed four capsules being thus obtained and some flowers on the selffertilised plants were again selffertilised seven capsules being thus obtained the seeds from both lots were weighed and it was calculated that an equal number of capsules would have yielded seed in the proportion by weight of 100 for the crossed to 60 for the selffertilised capsules so that the flowers on the crossed plants again crossed were much more fertile than those on the selffertilised plants again selffertilised  plants of the second generation  the above two lots of seeds were placed on damp sand and many of the crossed seeds germinated as on the last occasion before the selffertilised and were rejected three or four pairs in the same state of germination were planted on the opposite sides of two pots a single pair in a third pot and all the remaining seeds were sown crowded in a fourth pot when the seedlings were about one and a half inches in height they were equal on both sides of the three first pots but in pot 4 in which they grew crowded and were thus exposed to severe competition the crossed were about a third taller than the selffertilised in this latter pot when the crossed averaged 5

the tallest plant on each side was measured but before this time the single crossed plant in pot 3 which was taller than its antagonist had died and was not measured so that only the tallest plant on each side of three pots was measured as in table 569  table 569 lobelia ramosa second generation  heights of plants measured in inches  column 1 number name of pot  column 2 tallest crossed plant in

crossed plants is here 2333 and that of the tallest selffertilised 19 inches or as 100 to 81 besides this difference in height the crossed plants were much more vigorous and more branched than the selffertilised plants and it is unfortunate that they were not weighed  lobelia fulgens  this species offers a somewhat perplexing case in the first generation the selffertilised plants though few in number greatly exceeded the crossed in height whilst in the second generation when the trial was made on a much larger scale the crossed beat the selffertilised plants as this species is generally propagated by offsets some seedlings were first raised in order to have distinct plants on one of these plants several flowers were fertilised with their own pollen and as the pollen is mature and shed long before the stigma of the same flower is ready for fertilisation it was necessary to number each flower and keep its pollen in paper with a corresponding number by this means wellmatured pollen was used for selffertilisation several flowers on the same plant were crossed with pollen from a distinct individual and to obtain this the conjoined anthers of young flowers were roughly squeezed and as it is naturally protruded very slowly by the growth of the pistil it is probable that the pollen used by me was hardly mature certainly less mature than that employed for selffertilisation i did not at the time think of this source of error but i now suspect that the growth of the crossed plants was thus injured anyhow the trial was not perfectly fair opposed to the belief that the pollen used in crossing was not in so good a state as that used for selffertilisation is the fact that a greater proportional number of the crossed than of the selffertilised flowers produced capsules but there was no marked difference in the amount of seed contained in the capsules of the two lots 524 gartner has shown that certain plants of lobelia fulgens are quite sterile with pollen from the same plant though this pollen is efficient on any other individual but none of the plants on which i experimented which were kept in the greenhouse were in this peculiar condition  as the seeds obtained by the above two methods would not germinate when left on bare sand they were sown on the opposite sides of four pots but i succeeded in raising only a single pair of seedlings of the same age in each pot the selffertilised seedlings when only a few inches in height were in most of the pots taller than their opponents and they flowered so much earlier in all the pots that the height of the flowerstems could be fairly compared only in pots 1 and 2  table 570 lobelia fulgens first generation  heights of flowerstems measured in inches  column 1 number name of pot  column 2

the selffertilised plants in pots 3 and 4 were in every respect very much finer than the crossed plants  i was so much surprised at this great superiority of the selffertilised over the crossed plants that i determined to try how they would behave in one of the pots during a second growth the two plants therefore in pot 1 were cut down and repotted without being disturbed in a much larger pot in the following year the selffertilised plant showed even a greater superiority than before for the two tallest flowerstems produced by the one crossed plant were only 29 48 and 30 18 inches in height whereas the two tallest stems on the one selffertilised plant were 49 48 and 49 68 inches and this gives a ratio of 100 to 167 considering all the evidence there can be no doubt that these selffertilised plants had a great superiority over the crossed plants  crossed and selffertilised plants of the second generation  table 571 lobelia fulgens second generation  heights of flowerstems

pollen of not quite equal maturity for crossing and selffertilisation so that i squeezed pollen out of the conjoined anthers of young flowers for both operations several flowers on the crossed plant in pot 1 in table 570 were again crossed with pollen from a distinct plant several other flowers on the selffertilised plant in the same pot were again selffertilised with pollen from the anthers of other flowers on the same plant therefore the degree of selffertilisation was not quite so close as in the last generation in which pollen from the same flower kept in paper was used these two lots of seeds were thinly sown on opposite sides of nine pots and the young seedlings were thinned an equal number of nearly as possible the same age being left on the two sides in the spring of the following year 1870 when the seedlings had grown to a considerable size they were measured to the tips of their leaves and the twentythree crossed plants averaged 1404 inches in height whilst the twentythree selffertilised seedlings were 1354 inches or as 100 to 96  in the summer of the same year several of these plants flowered the crossed and selffertilised plants flowering almost simultaneously and all the flowerstems were measured those produced by eleven of the crossed plants averaged 3071 inches and those by nine of the selffertilised plants 2943 inches in height or as 100 to 96  the plants in these nine pots after they had flowered were repotted without being disturbed in much larger pots and in the following year 1871 all flowered freely but they had grown into such an entangled mass that the separate plants on each side could no longer be distinguished accordingly three or four of the tallest flowerstems on each side of each pot were measured and the measurements in table 571 are i think more trustworthy than the previous ones from being more numerous and from the plants being well established and growing vigorously  the average height of the thirtyfour tallest flowerstems on the twentythree crossed plants is 2982 inches and that of the same number of flowerstems on the same number of selffertilised plants is 2710 inches or as 100 to 91 so that the crossed plants now showed a decided advantage over their selffertilised opponents  22 polemoniaceaenemophila insignis  twelve flowers were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant but produced only six capsules containing on an average 183 seeds eighteen flowers were fertilised with their own pollen and produced ten capsules containing on an average 127 seeds so that the seeds per capsule were as 100 to 69 525 several species of polemoniaceae are known to be proterandrous but i did not attend to this point in nemophila verlot says des variétés 1865 page 66 that varieties growing near one another spontaneously intercross the crossed seeds weighed a little less than an equal number of selffertilised seeds in the proportion of 100 to 105 but this was clearly due to some of the selffertilised capsules containing very few seeds and these were much bulkier than the others from having been better nourished a subsequent comparison of the number of seeds in a few capsules did not show so great a superiority on the side of the crossed capsules as in the present case  the seeds were placed on sand and after germinating were planted in pairs on the opposite sides of five pots which were kept in the greenhouse when the seedlings were from 2 to 3 inches in height most of the crossed had a slight advantage over the selffertilised the plants were trained up sticks and thus grew to a considerable height in four out of the five pots a crossed plant flowered before any one of the selffertilised the plants were first measured to the tips of their leaves before they had flowered and when the crossed were under a foot in height the twelve crossed plants averaged 111 inches in height whilst the twelve selffertilised were less than half of this height namely 545 or as 100 to 49 before the plants had grown to their full height two of the selffertilised died and as i feared that this might happen with others they were again measured to the tops of their stems as shown in table

so that they differed somewhat less than before  the plants in pots 3 and 5 were placed under a net in the greenhouse two of the crossed plants in the latter pot being pulled up on account of the death of two of the selffertilised so that altogether six crossed and six selffertilised plants were left to fertilise themselves spontaneously the pots were rather small and the plants did not produce many capsules the small size of the selffertilised plants will largely account for the fewness of the capsules which they produced the six crossed plants bore 105 and the six selffertilised only 30 capsules or as 100 to 29  the selffertilised seeds thus obtained from the crossed and selffertilised plants after germinating on sand were planted on the opposite sides of four small pots and treated as before but many of the plants were unhealthy and their heights were so unequalsome on both sides being five times as tall as the othersthat the averages deduced from the measurements in table 573 are not in the least trustworthy nevertheless i have felt bound to give them as they are opposed to my general conclusions  the seven selffertilised plants from the crossed plants here

and the flowers can hardly fail to be crossfertilised but should this not occur they are capable of selffertilisation to a limited extent as some pollen long remains within the anthers and is apt to fall on the mature stigma in the year 1863 i covered up a plant and examined thirtyfive flowers of which only twelve yielded any seeds whereas of thirtyfive flowers on an exposed plant growing close by all with the exception of two yielded seeds the coveredup plant however produced altogether twentyfive spontaneously selffertilised seeds the exposed plant producing fiftyfive seeds the product no doubt of crossfertilisation  in the year 1868 eighteen flowers on a protected plant were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant but only seven of these produced fruit and i suspect that i applied pollen to many of the stigmas before they were mature these fruits contained on an average 2 seeds with a maximum in one of three seeds twentyfour spontaneously selffertilised fruits were produced by the same plant and these contained on an average 12 seeds with a maximum of two in one fruit so that the fruits from the artificially crossed flowers yielded seeds compared with those from the spontaneously selffertilised flowers in the ratio of 100 to 60 but the selffertilised seeds as often occurs when few are produced were heavier than the crossed seeds in the ratio of 100 to 90  these two lots of seeds were sown on opposite sides of two large pots but i succeeded in raising only four pairs of equal age when the seedlings on both sides were about 8 inches in height they were equal

of the four selffertilised 2118 inches or as 100 to 102 the selffertilised plants thus exceeded the crossed in height by a little but this was entirely due to the tallness of one of the selffertilised the crossed plants in both pots flowered before the selffertilised therefore i believe if more plants had been raised the result would have been different i regret that i did not attend to the fertility of the two lots  24 nolanaceaenolana prostrata  in some of the flowers the stamens are considerably shorter than the pistil in others equal to it in length i suspected therefore but erroneously as it proved that this plant was dimorphic like primula linum etc and in the year 1862 twelve plants covered by a net in the greenhouse were subjected to trial the spontaneously selffertilised flowers yielded 64 grains weight of seeds but the product of fourteen artificially crossed flowers is here included which falsely increases the weight of the selffertilised seeds nine uncovered plants the flowers of which were eagerly visited by bees for their pollen and were no doubt intercrossed by them produced 79 grains weight of seeds therefore twelve plants thus treated would have yielded 105 grains thus the seeds produced by the flowers on an equal number of plants when crossed by bees and spontaneously selffertilised the product of fourteen artificially crossed flowers being however included in the latter were in weight as 100 to 61  in the summer of 1867 the trial was repeated thirty flowers were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant and produced twentyseven capsules each containing five seeds thirtytwo flowers were fertilised with their own pollen and produced only six capsules each with five seeds so that the crossed and selffertilised capsules contained the same number of seeds though many more capsules were produced by the crossfertilised than by the selffertilised flowers in the ratio of 100 to 21  an equal number of seeds of both lots were weighed and the crossed seeds were to the selffertilised in weight as 100 to 82 therefore a cross increases the number of capsules produced and the weight of the seeds but not the number of seeds in each capsule  these two lots of seeds after germinating on sand were planted on the opposite sides of three pots the seedlings when from 6 to 7 inches in height were equal the plants were measured

naudin after castrating a large number of flowers whilst in bud left them exposed to the visits of insects and about a quarter produced capsules 62 annales des sc nat 4th series bot tome 9 cah 5 but i am convinced that a much larger proportion of flowers in my garden are crossfertilised by insects for protected flowers with their own pollen placed on the stigma never yielded nearly a full complement of seed whilst those left uncovered produced fine capsules showing that pollen from other plants must have been brought to them probably by moths plants growing vigorously and flowering in pots in the greenhouse never yielded a single capsule and this may be attributed at least in chief part to the exclusion of moths  six flowers on a plant covered by a net were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant and produced six capsules containing by weight 444 grains of seed six other flowers were fertilised with their own pollen and produced only three capsules containing only 149 grains weight of seed from this it follows that an equal number of crossed and selffertilised capsules would have contained seeds by weight as 100 to 67 i should not have thought the proportional contents of so few capsules worth giving had not nearly the same result been confirmed by several subsequent trials  seeds of the two lots were placed on sand and many of the selffertilised seeds germinated

life beat the crossed and at one time were nearly double their height at first the case appeared like that of mimulus in which after the third generation a tall and highly selffertile variety appeared but as in the two succeeding generations the crossed plants resumed their former superiority over the selffertilised the case must be looked at as an anomaly the sole conjecture which i can form is that the crossed seeds had not been sufficiently ripened and thus produced weakly plants as occurred with iberis when the crossed plants were between 3 and 4 inches in height the six finest in four of the pots were measured to the summits of their stems and at the same time the six finest of the selffertilised plants the measurements are given in table 678 and it may be here seen that all the selffertilised plants exceed their opponents in height whereas when subsequently measured the excess of the selffertilised depended chiefly on the unusual tallness of two of the plants in pot 2 the

eight selffertilised plants 5387 inches in height or as 100 to 131 and this excess chiefly depended as already stated on the unusual tallness of two of the selffertilised plants in pot 2 the selffertilised had therefore lost some of their former great superiority over the crossed plants in three of the pots the selffertilised plants flowered first but in pot 3 at the same time with the crossed  the case is rendered the more strange because the crossed plants in the fifth pot not included in the two last tables in which all the remaining seeds had been thickly sown were from the first finer plants than the selffertilised and had larger leaves at the period when the two tallest crossed plants in this pot were 6 48 and 4 58 inches high the two tallest selffertilised were only 4 inches when the two crossed plants were 12 and 10 inches high the two selffertilised were only 8 inches these latter plants as well as many others on the same side of this pot never grew any higher whereas several of the crossed plants grew to the height of two feet on account of this great superiority of the crossed plants the plants on neither side of this pot have been included in the two last tables  thirty flowers on the crossed plants in pots 1 and 4 table 679 were again crossed and produced seventeen capsules thirty flowers on the selffertilised plants in the same two pots were again selffertilised but produced only seven capsules the contents of each capsule of both lots were placed in separate watchglasses and the seeds from the crossed appeared to the eye to be at least double the number of those from the selffertilised capsules  in order to ascertain whether the fertility of the selffertilised plants had been lessened by the plants having been selffertilised for the three previous generations thirty flowers on the crossed plants were fertilised with their own pollen these yielded only five capsules and their seeds being placed in separate watchglasses did not seem more numerous than those from the capsules on the selffertilised plants selffertilised for the fourth time so that as far as can be judged from so few capsules the selffertility of the selffertilised plants had not decreased in comparison with that of the plants which had been intercrossed during the three previous generations it should however be remembered that both lots of plants had been subjected in each generation to almost exactly similar conditions  seeds from the crossed plants again crossed and from the selffertilised again selffertilised produced by the plants in pot 1

selffertilised plants 2687 inches in height or as 100 to 60 the crossed parents of these were much taller relatively to the selffertilised parents than in the last case and apparently they transmitted some of this superiority to their crossed offspring it is unfortunate that i did not turn these plants out of doors so as to observe their relative fertility for i compared the pollen from some of the crossed and selffertilised plants in pot 1 table 681 and there was a marked difference in its state that of the crossed plants contained hardly any bad and empty grains whilst such abounded in the pollen of the selffertilised plants  the effects of a cross with a fresh stock  i procured from a garden in westerham whence my plants originally came a fresh plant differing in no respect from mine except in the colour of the flowers which was a fine purple but this plant must have been exposed during at least four generations to very different conditions from those to which my plants had been subjected as these had been grown in pots in the greenhouse eight flowers on the selffertilised plants in table 681 of the last or fourth selffertilised generation were fertilised with pollen from this fresh stock all eight produced capsules containing together by weight 501 grains of seeds the plants raised from these seeds may be called the westerhamcrossed  eight flowers on the crossed plants of the last or fourth generation in table 681 were again crossed with pollen from one of the other crossed plants and produced five capsules containing by weight 207 grains of seeds the plants raised from these seeds may be called the intercrossed and these form the fifth intercrossed generation  eight flowers on the selffertilised plants of the same generation in table 681 were again selffertilised and produced seven capsules containing by weight 21 grains of seeds the selffertilised plants raised from these seeds form the fifth selffertilised generation these latter plants and the intercrossed are comparable in all respects with the crossed and selffertilised plants of the four previous generations  from the foregoing data it is easy to calculate that  ten westerhamcrossed capsules would have contained 626 grains weight of seed  ten intercrossed capsules would have contained 414 grains weight of seed  ten selffertilised capsules would have contained 300 grains weight of seed  we thus get the following ratios  seeds from the westerhamcrossed capsules to those from the capsules of the fifth selffertilised generation in weight as 100 to 48  seeds from the westerhamcrossed capsules to those from the capsules of the fifth intercrossed generation in weight as 100 to 66  seeds from the intercrossed capsules to those from the selffertilised capsules in weight as 100 to 72  so that a cross with pollen from a fresh stock greatly increased the productiveness of the flowers on plants which had been selffertilised for the four previous generations in comparison not only with the flowers on the same plants selffertilised for the fifth time but with the flowers on the crossed plants crossed with pollen from another plant of the same old stock for the fifth time  these three lots of seeds were placed on sand and were planted in an equal state of germination in seven pots each made tripartite by three superficial partitions some of the remaining seeds whether or not in a state of germination were thickly sown in an eighth pot the pots were kept in the greenhouse and the plants trained up sticks they were first measured to the tops of their stems when coming into flower and the twentytwo westerhamcrossed plants then averaged 2551 inches the twentythree intercrossed plants 3038 and the twentythree selffertilised plants 2340 inches in height we thus get the following ratios  the westerhamcrossed plants in height to the selffertilised as 100 to 91  the westerhamcrossed plants in height to the intercrossed as 100 to 119  the intercrossed plants in height to the selffertilised as 100 to 77  these plants were again measured when their growth appeared on a casual inspection to be complete but in this i was mistaken for after cutting them down i found that the summits of the stems of the westerhamcrossed plants were still growing vigorously whilst the intercrossed had almost and the selffertilised had quite completed their growth therefore i do not doubt if the three lots had been left to grow for another month that the ratios would have been somewhat different from those deduced from the measurements in table 682

westerhamcrossed plants now averaged 5005 inches the twentytwo intercrossed plants 5411 inches and the twentyone selffertilised plants 3323 inches in height we thus get the following ratios  the westerhamcrossed plants in height to the selffertilised as 100 to 66  the westerhamcrossed plants in height to the intercrossed as 100 to 108  the intercrossed plants in height to the selffertilised as 100 to 61  we here see that the westerhamcrossed the offspring of plants selffertilised for four generations and then crossed with a fresh stock have gained greatly in height since they were first measured relatively to the plants selffertilised for five generations they were then as 100 to 91 and now as 100 to 66 in height the intercrossed plants ie those which had been intercrossed for the last five generations likewise exceed in height the selffertilised plants as occurred in all the previous generations with the exception of the abnormal plants of the third generation on the other hand the westerhamcrossed plants are exceeded in height by the intercrossed and this is a surprising fact judging from most of the other strictly analogous cases but as the westerhamcrossed plants were still growing vigorously while the intercrossed had almost ceased to grow there can hardly be a doubt that if left to grow for another month they would have beaten the intercrossed in height that they were gaining on them is clear as when measured before they were as 100 to 119 and now as only 100 to 108 in height the westerhamcrossed plants had also leaves of a darker green and looked altogether more vigorous than the intercrossed and what is much more important they produced as we shall presently see much heavier seedcapsules so that in fact the offspring from the selffertilised plants of the fourth generation crossed by a fresh stock were superior to the intercrossed as well as to the selffertilised plants of the fifth generationof which latter fact there could not be the least doubt  these three lots of plants were cut down close to the ground and weighed the twentyone westerhamcrossed plants weighed 32 ounces the twentytwo intercrossed plants 34 ounces and the twentyone selffertilised plants 7 14 ounces the following ratios are calculated for an equal number of plants of each kind but as the selffertilised plants were just beginning to wither their relative weight is here slightly too small and as the westerhamcrossed were still growing vigorously their relative weight with time allowed would no doubt have greatly increased  the westerhamcrossed plants in weight to the selffertilised as 100 to 22  the westerhamcrossed plants in weight to the intercrossed as 100 to 101  the intercrossed plants in weight to the selffertilised as 100 to 223  we here see judging by weight instead of as before by height that the westerhamcrossed and the intercrossed have an immense advantage over the selffertilised the westerhamcrossed are inferior to the intercrossed by a mere trifle but it is almost certain that if they had been allowed to go on growing for another month the former would have completely beaten the latter  as i had an abundance of seeds of the same three lots from which the foregoing plants had been raised these were sown in three long parallel and adjoining rows in the open ground so as to ascertain whether under these circumstances the results would be nearly the same as before late in the autumn november 13 the ten tallest plants were carefully selected out of each row and their heights measured with the following result  table 683 petunia violacea plants growing in the open ground  heights of plants measured in inches  column 1 westerhamcrossed plants from selffertilised plants of the fourth generation crossed

selffertilised 2331 inches these three lots of plants were also weighed the westerhamcrossed plants weighed 28 ounces the intercrossed plants 41 ounces and the selffertilised 1475 ounces we thus get the following ratios  the westerhamcrossed plants in height to the selffertilised as 100 to 63  the westerhamcrossed plants in weight to the selffertilised as 100 to 53  the westerhamcrossed plants in height to the intercrossed as 100 to 104  the westerhamcrossed plants in weight to the intercrossed as 100 to 146  the intercrossed plants in height to the selffertilised as 100 to 61  the intercrossed plants in weight to the selffertilised as 100 to 36  here the relative heights of the three lots are nearly the same within three or four per cent as with the plants in the pots in weight there is a much greater difference the westerhamcrossed exceed the selffertilised by much less than they did before but the selffertilised plants in the pots had become slightly withered as before stated and were in consequence unfairly light the westerhamcrossed plants are here inferior in weight to the intercrossed plants in a much higher degree than in the pots and this appeared due to their being much less branched owing to their having germinated in greater numbers and consequently being much crowded their leaves were of a brighter green than those of the intercrossed and selffertilised plants  relative fertility of the three lots of plants  none of the plants in pots in the greenhouse ever produced a capsule and this may be attributed in chief part to the exclusion of moths therefore the fertility of the three lots could be judged of only by that of the plants growing out of doors which from being left uncovered were probably crossfertilised the plants in the three rows were exactly of the same age and had been subjected to closely similar conditions so that any difference in their fertility must be attributed to their different origin namely to the one lot being derived from plants selffertilised for four generations and then crossed with a fresh stock to the second lot being derived from plants of the same old stock intercrossed for five generations and to the third lot being derived from plants selffertilised for five generations all the capsules some nearly mature and some only halfgrown were gathered counted and weighed from the ten finest plants in each of the three rows of which the measurements and weights have already been given the intercrossed plants as we have seen were taller and considerably heavier than the plants of the other two lots and they produced a greater number of capsules than did even the westerhamcrossed plants and this may be attributed to the latter having grown more crowded and being in consequence less branched therefore the average weight of an equal number of capsules from each lot of plants seems to be the fairest standard of comparison as their weights will have been determined chiefly by the number of the included seeds as the intercrossed plants were taller and heavier than the plants of the other two lots it might have been expected that they would have produced the finest or heaviest capsules but this was very far from being the case  the ten tallest westerhamcrossed plants produced 111 ripe and unripe capsules weighing 1212 grains therefore 100 of such capsules would have weighed 10918 grains  the ten tallest intercrossed plants produced 129 capsules weighing 7645 grains therefore 100 of these capsules would have weighed 5926 grains  the ten tallest selffertilised plants produced only 44 capsules weighing 2235 grains therefore 100 of these capsules would have weighed 5079 grains  from these data we get the following ratios for the fertility of the three lots as deduced from the relative weights of an equal number of capsules from the finest plants in each lot  westerhamcrossed plants to selffertilised plants as 100 to 46  westerhamcrossed plants to intercrossed plants as 100 to 54  intercrossed plants to selffertilised plants as 100 to 86  we here see how potent the influence of a cross with pollen from a fresh stock has been on the fertility of plants selffertilised for four generations in comparison with plants of the old stock when either intercrossed or selffertilised for five generations the flowers on all these plants having been left to be freely crossed by insects or to fertilise themselves the westerhamcrossed plants were also much taller and heavier plants than the selffertilised both in the pots and open ground but they were less tall and heavy than the intercrossed plants this latter result however would almost certainly have been reversed if the plants had been allowed to grow for another month as the westerhamcrossed were still growing vigorously whilst the intercrossed had almost ceased to grow this case reminds us of the somewhat analogous one of eschscholtzia in which plants raised from a cross with a fresh stock did not grow higher than the selffertilised or intercrossed plants but produced a greater number of seedcapsules which contained a far larger average number of seeds  colour of the flowers on the above three lots of plants  the original motherplant from which the five successive selffertilised generations were raised bore dingy purple flowers at no time was any selection practised and the plants were subjected in each generation to extremely uniform conditions the result was as in some previous cases that the flowers on all the selffertilised plants both in the pots and open ground were absolutely uniform in tint this being a dull rather peculiar flesh colour this uniformity was very striking in the long row of plants growing in the open ground and these first attracted my attention i did not notice in which generation the original colour began to change and to become uniform but i have every reason to believe that the change was gradual the flowers on the intercrossed plants were mostly of the same tint but not nearly so uniform as those on the selffertilised plants and many of them were pale approaching almost to white the flowers on the plants from the cross with the purpleflowered westerham stock were as might have been expected much more purple and not nearly so uniform in tint the selffertilised plants were also remarkably uniform in height as judged by the eye the intercrossed less so whilst the westerhamcrossed plants varied much in height  nicotiana tabacum  this plant offers a curious case out of six trials with crossed and selffertilised plants belonging to three successive generations in one alone did the crossed show any marked superiority in height over the selffertilised in four of the trials they were approximately equal and in one ie in the first generation the selffertilised plants were greatly superior to the crossed in no case did the capsules from flowers fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant yield many more and sometimes they yielded much fewer seeds than the capsules from selffertilised flowers but when the flowers of one variety were crossed with pollen from a slightly different variety which had grown under somewhat different conditionsthat is by a fresh stockthe seedlings derived from this cross exceeded in height and weight those from the selffertilised flowers in an extraordinary degree  twelve flowers on some plants of the common tobacco raised from purchased seeds were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant of the same lot and these produced ten capsules twelve flowers on the same plants were fertilised with their own pollen and produced eleven capsules the seeds in the ten crossed capsules weighed 317 grains whilst those in ten of the selffertilised capsules weighed 4767 grains or as 100 to 150 the much greater productiveness of the selffertilised than of the crossed capsules can hardly be attributed to chance as all the capsules of both lots were very fine and healthy ones  the seeds were placed on sand and several pairs in an equal state of germination were planted on the opposite sides of three pots the remaining seeds were thickly sown on the two sides of pot 4 so that the plants in this pot were much crowded the tallest plant on each side of each pot was measured whilst the plants were quite young the four tallest crossed plants averaged 787 inches and the four tallest selffertilised 1487 inches in height or as 100 to 189 the heights at this age are given in the two left columns of table 684  when in full flower the tallest plants on each side were again measured see the two right hand columns in table 684 but i should state that the pots were not large enough and the plants never grew to their proper height the four tallest crossed plants now averaged 185 and the four tallest selffertilised plants 3275 inches in height or as 100 to 178 in all four pots a selffertilised plant flowered before any one of the crossed  in pot 4 in which the plants were extremely crowded the two lots were at first equal and ultimately the tallest crossed plant exceeded by a trifle the tallest selffertilised plant this recalled to my mind an analogous case in the one generation of petunia in which the selffertilised plants were throughout their growth taller than the crossed in all the pots except in the crowded one accordingly another trial was made and some of the same crossed and selffertilised seeds of tobacco were sown thickly on opposite sides of two additional pots the plants being left to grow up much crowded when they were between 13 and 14 inches in height there was no difference between the two sides nor was there any marked difference when the plants had grown as tall as they could for in one pot the tallest crossed plant was 26 12 inches in height and exceeded by 2 inches the tallest selffertilised plant whilst in the other pot the tallest crossed plant was shorter by 3 12 inches than the tallest selffertilised plant which was 22 inches in height  table 684

selffertilised plants were raised from the same seed and were planted in pairs on the opposite sides of four very large pots containing rich soil so that they were not exposed to at all severe mutual competition when these plants were in flower i neglected to measure them but record in my notes that all four selffertilised plants exceeded in height the four crossed plants by 2 or 3 inches we have seen that the flowers on the original or parentplants which were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant yielded much fewer seeds than those fertilised with their own pollen and the trial just given as well as that in table 684 show us clearly that the plants raised from the crossed seeds were inferior in height to those from the selffertilised seeds but only when not greatly crowded when crowded and thus subjected to very severe competition the crossed and selffertilised plants were nearly equal in height  crossed and selffertilised plants of the second generation  twelve flowers on the crossed plants of the last generation growing in the four large pots just mentioned were crossed with pollen from a crossed plant growing in one of the other pots and twelve flowers on the selffertilised plants were fertilised with their own pollen all these flowers of both lots produced fine capsules ten of the crossed capsules contained by weight 3892 grains of seeds and ten of the selffertilised capsules 3774 grains or as 100 to 97 some of these seeds in an equal state of germination were planted in pairs on the opposite sides of five large pots a good many of the crossed seeds germinated before the selffertilised and were of course rejected the plants thus raised were measured when several of them were in full flower  table 685 nicotiana tabacum second generation  heights

selffertilised plants of the last generation which greatly exceeded in height their crossed opponents would transmit the same tendency to their offspring and secondly whether they possessed the same sexual constitution i selected for experiment the two selffertilised plants marked a and b in pot 3 in table 685 as these two were of nearly equal height and were greatly superior to their crossed opponents four flowers on each plant were fertilised with their own pollen and four others on the same plants were crossed with pollen from one of the crossed plants growing in another pot this plan differs from that before followed in which seedlings from crossed plants again crossed have been compared with seedlings from selffertilised plants again selffertilised the seeds from the crossed and selffertilised capsules of the above two plants were placed in separate watchglasses and compared but were not weighed and in both cases those from the crossed capsules seemed to be rather less numerous than those from the selffertilised capsules these seeds were planted in the usual manner and the heights of the crossed and selffertilised seedlings when fully grown are given in tables 686

inches and the nine selffertilised plants 713 inches in height or as 100 to barely 101 in four out of these five pots a selffertilised plant flowered before any one of the crossed plants so that differently from the last case the selffertilised plants are in some respects slightly superior to the crossed  if we now consider the crossed and selffertilised plants of the three generations we find an extraordinary diversity in their relative heights in the first generation the crossed plants were inferior to the selffertilised as 100 to 178 and the flowers on the original parentplants which were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant yielded much fewer seeds than the selffertilised flowers in the proportion of 100 to 150 but it is a strange fact that the selffertilised plants which were subjected to very severe competition with the crossed had on two occasions no advantage over them the inferiority of the crossed plants of this first generation cannot be attributed to the immaturity of the seeds for i carefully examined them nor to the seeds being diseased or in any way injured in some one capsule for the contents of the ten crossed capsules were mingled together and a few taken by chance for sowing in the second generation the crossed and selffertilised plants were nearly equal in height in the third generation crossed and selffertilised seeds were obtained from two plants of the previous generation and the seedlings raised from them differed remarkably in constitution the crossed in the one case exceeded the selffertilised in height in the ratio of 100 to 83 and in the other case were almost equal this difference between the two lots raised at the same time from two plants growing in the same pot and treated in every respect alike as well as the extraordinary superiority of the selffertilised over the crossed plants in the first generation considered together make me believe that some individuals of the present species differ to a certain extent from others in their sexual affinities to use the term employed by gartner like closely allied species of the same genus consequently if two plants which thus differ are crossed the seedlings suffer and are beaten by those from the selffertilised flowers in which the sexual elements are of the same nature it is known that with our domestic animals certain individuals are sexually incompatible and will not produce offspring although fertile with other individuals 63 i have given evidence on this head in my variation of animals and plants under domestication chapter 18 2nd edition volume 2 page 146 but kolreuter has recorded a case which bears more closely on our present one as it shows that in the genus nicotiana the varieties differ in their sexual affinities 64 das geschlecht der pflanzen zweite fortsetzung 1764 pages 5560 he experimented on five varieties of the common tobacco and proved that they were varieties by showing that they were perfectly fertile when reciprocally crossed but one of these varieties if used either as the father or the mother was more fertile than any of the others when crossed with a widely distinct species n glutinosa as the different varieties thus differ in their sexual affinities there is nothing surprising in the individuals of the same variety differing in a like manner to a slight degree  taking the plants of the three generations altogether the crossed show no superiority over the selffertilised and i can account for this fact only by supposing that with this species which is perfectly selffertile without insect aid most of the individuals are in the same condition as those of the same variety of the common pea and of a few other exotic plants which have been selffertilised for many generations in such cases a cross between two individuals does no good nor does it in any case unless the individuals differ in general constitution either from socalled spontaneous variation or from their progenitors having been subjected to different conditions i believe that this is the true explanation in the present instance because as we shall immediately see the offspring of plants which did not profit at all by being crossed with a plant of the same stock profited to an extraordinary degree by a cross with a slightly different subvariety  the effects of a cross with a fresh stock  i procured some seed of n tabacum from kew and raised some plants which formed a slightly different subvariety from my former plants as the flowers were a shade pinker the leaves a little more pointed and the plants not quite so tall therefore the advantage in height which the seedlings gained by this cross cannot be attributed to direct inheritance two of the plants of the third selffertilised generation growing in pots 2 and 5 in table 687 which exceeded in height their crossed opponents as did their parents in a still higher degree were fertilised with pollen from the kew plants that is by a fresh stock the seedlings thus raised may be called the kewcrossed some other flowers on the same two plants were fertilised with their own pollen and the seedlings thus raised from the fourth selffertilised generation the crossed capsules produced by the plant in pot 2 table 687 were plainly less fine than the selffertilised capsules on the same plant in pot 5 the one finest capsule was also a selffertilised one but the seeds produced by the two crossed capsules together exceeded in number those produced by the two selffertilised capsules on the same plant therefore as far as the flowers on the parentplants are concerned a cross with pollen from a fresh stock did little or no good and i did not expect that the offspring would have received any benefit but in this i was completely mistaken  the crossed and selffertilised seeds from the two plants were placed on bare sand and very many of the crossed seeds of both sets germinated before the selffertilised seeds and protruded their radicles at a quicker rate hence many of the crossed seeds had to be rejected before pairs in an equal state of germination were obtained for planting on the opposite sides of sixteen large pots the two series of seedlings raised from the parentplants in the two pots 2 and 5 were kept separate and when fully grown were measured to the tips of their highest leaves as shown in table 688 but as there was no uniform difference in height between the crossed and selffertilised seedlings raised from the two plants their heights have been added together in calculating the averages i should state that by the accidental fall of a large bush in the greenhouse several plants in both the series were much injured these were at once measured together with their opponents and afterwards thrown away the others were left to grow to their full height and were measured when in flower this accident accounts for the small height of some of the pairs but as all the pairs whether only partly or fully grown were measured at the same time the measurements are fair  the average height of the twentysix crossed plants in the sixteen pots of the two series is 6329 and that of the twentysix selffertilised plants is 4167 inches or as 100 to 66 the superiority of the crossed plants was shown in another way for in every one of the sixteen pots a crossed plant flowered before a selffertilised one with the exception of pot 6 of the second series in which the plants on the two sides flowered simultaneously  table 688 nicotiana tabacum plants raised from two plants of the third

some of the remaining seeds of both series whether or not in a state of germination were thickly sown on the opposite sides of two very large pots and the six highest plants on each side of each pot were measured after they had grown to nearly their full height but their heights were much less than in the former trials owing to their extremely crowded condition even whilst quite young the crossed

and the twenty tallest selffertilised 352 inches in height or as 100 to 72 these plants after being measured were cut down close to the ground and the twenty crossed plants weighed 19575 ounces and the twenty selffertilised plants 12325 ounces or as 100 to 63  in tables 688 689 and 690 we have the measurements of fiftysix plants derived from two plants of the third selffertilised generation crossed with pollen from a fresh stock and of fiftysix plants of the fourth selffertilised generation derived from the same two plants these crossed and selffertilised plants were treated in three different ways having been put firstly into moderately close competition with one another in pots secondly having been subjected to unfavourable conditions and to very severe competition from being greatly crowded in two large pots and thirdly having been sown separately in open and good ground so as not to suffer from any mutual competition in all these cases the crossed plants in each lot were greatly superior to the selffertilised this was shown in several waysby the earlier germination of the crossed seeds by the more rapid growth of the seedlings whilst quite young by the earlier flowering of the mature plants as well as by the greater height which they ultimately attained the superiority of the crossed plants was shown still more plainly when the two lots were weighed the weight of the crossed plants to that of the selffertilised in the two crowded pots being as 100 to 37 better evidence could hardly be desired of the immense advantage derived from a cross with a fresh stock  26 primulaceaecyclamen persicum 65 cyclamen repandum according to lecoq geographie botanique de leurope tome 8 1858 page 150 is proterandrous and this i believe to be the case with cyclamen persicum  ten flowers crossed with pollen from plants known to be distinct seedlings yielded nine capsules containing on an average 342 seeds with a maximum of seventyseven in one ten flowers selffertilised yielded eight capsules containing on an average only 131 seeds with a maximum of twentyfive in one this gives a ratio of 100 to 38 for the average number of seeds per capsule for the crossed and selffertilised flowers the flowers hang downwards and as the stigmas stand close beneath the anthers it might have been expected that pollen would have fallen on them and that they would have been spontaneously selffertilised but these coveredup plants did not produce a single capsule on some other occasions uncovered plants in the same greenhouse produced plenty of capsules and i suppose that the flowers had been visited by bees which could hardly fail to carry pollen from plant to plant  the seeds obtained in the manner just described were placed on sand and after germinating were planted in pairsthree crossed and three selffertilised plants on the opposite sides of four pots when the leaves were 2 or 3 inches in length including the footstalks the seedlings on both sides were equal in the course of a month or two the crossed plants began to show a slight superiority over the selffertilised which steadily increased and the crossed flowered in all four pots some weeks before and much more profusely than the selffertilised the two tallest flowerstems on the crossed plants in each pot were now measured and the average height of the eight stems was 949 inches after a considerable interval of time the selffertilised plants flowered and several of their flowerstems but i forgot to record how many were roughly measured and their average height was a little under 75 inches so that the flowerstems on the crossed plants to those on the selffertilised were at least as 100 to 79 the reason why i did not make more careful measurements of the selffertilised plants was that they looked such poor specimens that i determined to there them repotted in larger pots and in the following year to measure them carefully but we shall see that this was partly frustrated by so few flowerstems being then produced  these plants were left uncovered in the greenhouse and the twelve crossed plants produced forty capsules whilst the twelve selffertilised plants produced only five or as 100 to 12 but this difference does not give a just idea of the relative fertility of the two lots i counted the seeds in one of the finest capsules on the crossed plants and it contained seventythree whilst the finest of the five capsules produced by the selffertilised plants contained only thirtyfive good seeds in the other four capsules most of the seeds were barely half as large as

single flowerstem in pot 4 only one and in pot 3 six of which the three tallest were measured  the average height of the twelve flowerstems on the crossed plants is 999 and that of the four flowerstems on the selffertilised plants 737 inches or as 100 to 74 the selffertilised plants were miserable specimens whilst the crossed ones looked very vigorous  anagallis  anagallis collina var grandiflora pale red and blueflowered subvarieties  firstly twentyfive flowers on some plants of the red variety were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant of the same variety and produced ten capsules thirtyone flowers were fertilised with their own pollen and produced eighteen capsules these plants which were grown in pots in the greenhouse were evidently in a very sterile condition and the seeds in both sets of capsules especially in the selffertilised although numerous were of so poor a quality that it was very difficult to determine which were good and which bad but as far as i could judge the crossed capsules contained on an average 63 good seeds with a maximum in one of thirteen whilst the selffertilised contained 605 such seeds with a maximum in one of fourteen  secondly eleven flowers on the red variety were castrated whilst young and fertilised with pollen from the blue variety and this cross evidently much increased their fertility for the eleven flowers yielded seven capsules which contained on an average twice as many good seeds as before namely 127 with a maximum in two of the capsules of seventeen seeds therefore these crossed capsules yielded seeds compared with those in the foregoing selffertilised capsules as 100 to 48 these seeds were also conspicuously larger than those from the cross between two individuals of the same red variety and germinated much more freely the flowers on most of the plants produced by the cross between the twocoloured varieties of which several were raised took after their mother and were redcoloured but on two of the plants the flowers were plainly stained with blue and to such a degree in one case as to be almost intermediate in tint  the crossed seeds of the two foregoing kinds and the selffertilised were sown on the opposite sides of two large pots and the seedlings were measured when fully grown as shown in tables 692a and 692b  table 692a anagallis collina red variety crossed by a distinct

of both lots          14463    9975  as the plants of the two lots are few in number they may be run together for the general average but i may first state that the height of the seedlings from the cross between two individuals of the red variety is to that of the selffertilised plants of the red variety as 100 to 73 whereas the height of the crossed offspring from the two varieties to the selffertilised plants of the red variety is as 100 to 66 so that the cross between the two varieties is here seen to be the most advantageous the average height of all six crossed plants in the two lots taken together is 4820 and that of the six selffertilised plants 3325 or as 100 to 69  these six crossed plants produced spontaneously twentysix capsules whilst the six selffertilised plants produced only two or as 100 to 8 there is therefore the same extraordinary difference in fertility between the crossed and selffertilised plants as in the last genus cyclamen which belongs to the same family of the primulaceae  primula veris british flora var officinalis linn  the cowslip  most of the species in this genus are heterostyled or dimorphic that is they present two formsone longstyled with short stamens and the other shortstyled with long stamens 66 see my paper on the two forms or dimorphic condition in the species of primula in journal of the proceedings of the linnean society volume 6 1862 page 77 a second paper to which i presently refer on the hybridlike nature of the offspring from the illegitimate unions of dimorphic and trimorphic plants was published in volume 10 1867 page 393 of the same journal for complete fertilisation it is necessary that pollen from the one form should be applied to the stigma of the other form and this is effected under nature by insects such unions and the seedlings raised from them i have called legitimate if one form is fertilised with pollen from the same form the full complement of seed is not produced and in the case of some heterostyled genera no seed at all is produced such unions and the seedlings raised from them i have called illegitimate these seedlings are often dwarfed and more or less sterile like hybrids i possessed some longstyled plants of primula veris which during four successive generations had been produced from illegitimate unions between longstyled plants they were moreover in some degree interrelated and had been subjected all the time to similar conditions in pots in the greenhouse as long as they were cultivated in this manner they grew well and were healthy and fertile their fertility even increased in the later generations as if they were becoming habituated to illegitimate fertilisation plants of the first illegitimate generation when taken from the greenhouse and planted in moderately good soil out of doors grew well and were healthy but when those of the two last illegitimate generations were thus treated they became excessively sterile and dwarfed and remained so during the following year by which time they ought to have become accustomed to growing out of doors so that they must have possessed a weak constitution  under these circumstances it seemed advisable to ascertain what would be the effect of legitimately crossing longstyled plants of the fourth illegitimate generation with pollen taken from nonrelated shortstyled plants growing under different conditions accordingly several flowers on plants of the fourth illegitimate generation ie greatgreatgrandchildren of plants which had been legitimately fertilised growing vigorously in pots in the greenhouse were legitimately fertilised with pollen from an almost wild shortstyled cowslip and these flowers yielded some fine capsules thirty other flowers on the same illegitimate plants were fertilised with their own pollen and these yielded seventeen capsules containing on an average thirtytwo seeds this is a high degree of fertility higher i believe than that which generally obtains with illegitimately fertilised longstyled plants growing out of doors and higher than that of the previous illegitimate generations although their flowers were fertilised with pollen taken from a distinct plant of the same form  these two lots of seeds were sown for they will not germinate well when placed on bare sand on the opposite sides of four pots and the seedlings were thinned so that an equal number were left on the two sides for some time there was no marked difference in height between the two lots and in pot 3 table 693 the selffertilised plants were rather the tallest but by the time that they had thrown up young flowerstems the legitimately crossed plants revealed much the finest and had greener and larger leaves the breadth of the largest leaf on each plant was measured and those on the crossed plants were on an average a quarter of an inch exactly 28 of an inch broader than those on the selffertilised plants the plants from being too much crowded produced poor and short flowerstems the two finest on each side were measured the eight on the legitimately crossed plants averaged 408 and the eight on the illegitimately selffertilised plants averaged 293 inches in height or as 100 to 72  these plants after they had flowered were turned out of their pots and planted in fairly good soil in the open ground in the following year 1870 when in full flower the two tallest flowerstems on each side were again measured as shown in table 693 which likewise gives the number of flowerstems produced on both sides of all the pots  table 693 primula veris

total     5626    62        2575   15  the average height of the eight tallest flowerstems on the crossed plants is here 703 inches and that of the eight tallest flowerstems on the selffertilised plants 321 inches or as 100 to 46 we see also that the crossed plants bore sixtytwo flowerstems that is above four times as many as those namely fifteen borne by the selffertilised plants the flowers were left exposed to the visits of insects and as many plants of both forms grew close by they must have been legitimately and naturally fertilised under these circumstances the crossed plants produced 324 capsules whilst the selffertilised produced only 16 and these were all produced by a single plant in pot 2 which was much finer than any other selffertilised plant judging by the number of capsules produced the fertility of an equal number of crossed and selffertilised plants was as 100 to 5  in the succeeding year 1871 i did not count all the flowerstems on these plants but only those which produced capsules containing good seeds the season was unfavourable and the crossed plants produced only forty such flowerstems bearing 168 good capsules whilst the selffertilised plants produced only two such flowerstems bearing only 6 capsules half of which were very poor ones so that the fertility of the two lots judging by the number of capsules was as 100 to 35  in considering the great difference in height and the wonderful difference in fertility between the two sets of plants we should bear in mind that this is the result of two distinct agencies the selffertilised plants were the product of illegitimate fertilisation during five successive generations in all of which excepting the last the plants had been fertilised with pollen taken from a distinct individual belonging to the same form but which was more or less closely related the plants had also been subjected in each generation to closely similar conditions this treatment alone as i know from other observations would have greatly reduced the size and fertility of the offspring on the other hand the crossed plants were the offspring of longstyled plants of the fourth illegitimate generation legitimately crossed with pollen from a shortstyled plant which as well as its progenitors had been exposed to very different conditions and this latter circumstance alone would have given great vigour to the offspring as we may infer from the several analogous cases already given how much proportional weight ought to be attributed to these two agenciesthe one tending to injure the selffertilised offspring and the other to benefit the crossed offspringcannot be determined but we shall immediately see that the greater part of the benefit as far as increased fertility is concerned must be attributed to the cross having been made with a fresh stock  primula veris  equalstyled and redflowered var  i have described in my paper on the illegitimate unions of dimorphic and trimorphic plants this remarkable variety which was sent to me from edinburgh by mr j scott it possessed a pistil proper to the longstyled form and stamens proper to the shortstyled form so that it had lost the heterostyled or dimorphic character common to most of the species of the genus and may be compared with an hermaphrodite form of a bisexual animal consequently the pollen and stigma of the same flower are adapted for complete mutual fertilisation instead of its being necessary that pollen should be brought from one form to another as in the common cowslip from the stigma and anthers standing nearly on the same level the flowers are perfectly selffertile when insects are excluded owing to the fortunate existence of this variety it is possible to fertilise its flowers in a legitimate manner with their own pollen and to cross other flowers in a legitimate manner with pollen from another variety or fresh stock thus the offspring from both unions can be compared quite fairly free from any doubt from the injurious effects of an illegitimate union  the plants on which i experimented had been raised during two successive generations from spontaneously selffertilised seeds produced by plants under a net and as the variety is highly selffertile its progenitors in edinburgh may have been selffertilised during some previous generations several flowers on two of my plants were legitimately crossed with pollen from a shortstyled common cowslip growing almost wild in my orchard so that the cross was between plants which had been subjected to considerably different conditions several other flowers on the same two plants were allowed to fertilise themselves under a net and this union as already explained is a legitimate one  the crossed and selffertilised seeds thus obtained were sown thickly on the opposite sides of three pots and the seedlings thinned so that an equal number were left on the two sides the seedlings during the first year were nearly equal in height excepting in pot 3 table 694 in which the selffertilised plants had a decided advantage in the autumn the plants were bedded out in their pots owing to this circumstance and to many plants growing in each pot they did not flourish and none were very productive in seeds but the conditions were perfectly equal and fair for both sides in the following spring i record in my notes that in two of the pots the crossed plants are incomparably the finest in general appearance and in all three pots they flowered before the selffertilised when in full flower the tallest flowerstem on each side of each pot was measured and the number of the flowerstems on both sides counted as shown in table 694 the plants were left uncovered and as other plants were growing close by the flowers no doubt were crossed by insects when the capsules were ripe they were gathered and counted and the result is likewise shown in table 694  table 694 primula veris equalstyled redflowered variety  heights of plants measured in inches

 the average height of the three tallest flowerstems on the crossed plants is 866 inches and that of the three on the selffertilised plants 733 inches or as 100 to 85  all the crossed plants together produced thirtythree flowerstems whilst the selffertilised bore only thirteen the number of the capsules were counted only on the plants in pots 1 and 3 for the selffertilised plants in pot 2 produced none therefore those on the crossed plants on the opposite side were not counted capsules not containing any good seeds were rejected the crossed plants in the above two pots produced 206 and the selffertilised in the same pots only 32 capsules or as 100 to 15 judging from the previous generations the extreme unproductiveness of the selffertilised plants in this experiment was wholly due to their having been subjected to unfavourable conditions and to severe competition with the crossed plants for had they grown separately in good soil it is almost certain that they would have produced a large number of capsules the seeds were counted in twenty capsules from the crossed plants and they averaged 2475 whilst in twenty capsules from the selffertilised plants the average was 1765 or as 100 to 71 moreover the seeds from the selffertilised plants were not nearly so fine as those from the crossed plants if we consider together the number of capsules produced and the average number of contained seeds the fertility of the crossed plants to the selffertilised plants was as 100 to 11 we thus see what a great effect as far as fertility is concerned was produced by a cross between the two varieties which had been long exposed to different conditions in comparison with selffertilisation the fertilisation having been in both cases of the legitimate order  primula sinensis  as the chinese primrose is a heterostyled or dimorphic plant like the common cowslip it might have been expected that the flowers of both forms when illegitimately fertilised with their own pollen or with that from flowers on another plant of the same form would have yielded less seed than the legitimately crossed flowers and that the seedlings raised from illegitimately selffertilised seeds would have been somewhat dwarfed and less fertile in comparison with the seedlings from legitimately crossed seeds this holds good in relation to the fertility of the flowers but to my surprise there was no difference in growth between the offspring from a legitimate union between two distinct plants and from an illegitimate union whether between the flowers on the same plant or between distinct plants of the same form but i have shown in the paper before referred to that in england this plant is in an abnormal condition such as judging from analogous cases would tend to render a cross between two individuals of no benefit to the offspring our plants have been commonly raised from selffertilised seeds and the seedlings have generally been subjected to nearly uniform conditions in pots in greenhouses moreover many of the plants are now varying and changing their character so as to become in a greater or less degree equalstyled and in consequence highly selffertile from the analogy of primula veris there can hardly be a doubt that if a plant of primula sinensis could have been procured direct from china and if it had been crossed with one of our english varieties the offspring would have shown wonderful superiority in height and fertility though probably not in the beauty of their flowers over our ordinary plants  my first experiment consisted in fertilising many flowers on longstyled and shortstyled plants with their own pollen and other flowers on the same plants with pollen taken from distinct plants belonging to the same form so that all the unions were illegitimate there was no uniform and marked difference in the number of seeds obtained from these two modes of selffertilisation both of which were illegitimate the two lots of seeds from both forms were sown thickly on opposite sides of four pots and numerous plants thus raised but there was no difference in their growth excepting in one pot in which the offspring from the illegitimate union of two longstyled plants exceeded in a decided manner in height the offspring of flowers on the same plants fertilised with their own pollen but in all four pots the plants raised from the union of distinct plants belonging to the same form flowered before the offspring from the selffertilised flowers  some longstyled and shortstyled plants were now raised from purchased seeds and flowers on both forms were legitimately crossed with pollen from a distinct plant and other flowers on both forms were illegitimately fertilised with pollen from the flowers on the same plant the seeds were sown on opposite sides of pots 1 to 4 in table 695 a single plant being left on each side several flowers on the illegitimate longstyled and shortstyled plants described in the last paragraph were also legitimately and illegitimately fertilised in the manner just described and their seeds were sown in pots 5 to 8 in the same table as the two sets of seedlings did not differ in any essential manner their measurements are given in a single table i should add that the legitimate unions in both cases yielded as might have been expected many more seeds than the illegitimate unions the seedlings whilst halfgrown presented no difference in height on the two sides of the several pots when fully grown they were measured to the tips of their longest leaves and the result is given in table 695

latter exceeded the former in two of the pots in a more strongly marked manner the average height of the eight legitimately crossed plants is 901 and that of the eight illegitimately selffertilised 903 inches or as 100 to 1002 the plants on the opposite sides produced as far as could be judged by the eye an equal number of flowers i did not count the capsules or the seeds produced by them but undoubtedly judging from many previous observations the plants derived from the legitimately crossed seeds would have been considerably more fertile than those from the illegitimately selffertilised seeds the crossed plants as in the previous case flowered before the selffertilised plants in all the pots except in pot 2 in which the two sides flowered simultaneously and this early flowering may perhaps be considered as an advantage  27 polygoneaefagopyrum esculentum  this plant was discovered by hildebrand to be heterostyled that is to present like the species of primula a longstyled and a shortstyled form which are adapted for reciprocal fertilisation therefore the following comparison of the growth of the crossed and selffertilised seedlings is not fair for we do not know whether the difference in their heights may not be wholly due to the illegitimate fertilisation of the selffertilised flowers  i obtained seeds by legitimately crossing flowers on longstyled and shortstyled plants and by fertilising other flowers on both forms with pollen from the same plant rather more seeds were obtained by the former than by the latter process and the legitimately crossed seeds were heavier than an equal number of the illegitimately selffertilised seeds in the ratio of 100 to 82 crossed and selffertilised seeds from the shortstyled parents after germinating on sand were planted in pairs on the opposite sides of a large pot and two similar lots of seeds from longstyled parents were planted in a like manner on the opposite sides of two other pots in all three pots the legitimately crossed seedlings when a few inches in height were taller than the selffertilised and in all three pots they flowered before them by one or two days when fully grown they were all cut down close to the ground and as i was pressed for time they were placed in a long row the cut end of one plant touching the tip of another and the total length of the legitimately crossed plants was 47 feet 7 inches and of the illegitimately selffertilised plants 32 feet 8 inches therefore the average height of the fifteen crossed plants in all three pots was 3806 inches and that of the fifteen selffertilised plants 2613 inches or as 100 to 69  28 chenopodiaceaebeta vulgaris  a single plant no others growing in the same garden was left to fertilise itself and the selffertilised seeds were collected seeds were also collected from a plant growing in the midst of a large bed in another garden and as the incoherent pollen is abundant the seeds of this plant will almost certainly have been the product of a crossed between distinct plants by means of the wind some of the two lots of seeds were sown on the opposite sides of two very large pots and the young seedlings were thinned so that an equal but considerable number was left on the two sides these plants were thus subjected to very severe competition as well as to poor conditions the remaining seeds were sown out of doors in good soil in two long and not closely adjoining rows so that these seedlings were placed under favourable conditions and were not subjected to any mutual competition the selffertilised seeds in the open ground came up very badly and on removing the soil in two or three places it was found that many had sprouted under ground and had then died no such case had been observed before owing to the large number of seedlings which thus perished the surviving selffertilised plants grew thinly in the row and thus had an advantage over the crossed plants which grew very thickly in the other row the young plants in the two rows were protected by a little straw during the winter and those in the two large pots were placed in the greenhouse  there was no difference between the two lots in the pots until the ensuing spring when they had grown a little and then some of the crossed plants were finer and taller than any of the selffertilised when in full flower their stems were measured and the measurements are given in table 696  table 696 beta vulgaris  heights of flower stems measured in inches  column 1 number name of pot  column 2 crossed plants  column 3 selffertilised plants  pot 1

23850  the average height of the eight crossed plants is here 3409 and that of the eight selffertilised plants 2981 or as 100 to 87  with respect to the plants in the open ground each long row was divided into half so as to diminish the chance of any accidental advantage in one part of either row and the four tallest plants in the two halves of the two rows were carefully selected and measured the eight tallest crossed plants averaged 3092 and the eight tallest selffertilised 307 inches in height or as 100 to 99 so that they were practically equal but we should bear in mind that the trial was not quite fair as the selffertilised plants had a great advantage over the crossed in being much less crowded in their own row owing to the large number of seeds which had perished under ground after sprouting nor were the lots in the two rows subjected to any mutual competition  29 cannaceaecanna warscewiczi  in most or all the species belonging to this genus the pollen is shed before the flower expands and adheres in a mass to the foliaceous pistil close beneath the stigmatic surface as the edge of this mass generally touches the edge of the stigma and as it was ascertained by trials purposely made that a very few pollengrains suffice for fertilisation the present species and probably all the others of the genus are highly selffertile exceptions occasionally occur in which from the stamen being slightly shorter than usual the pollen is deposited a little beneath the stigmatic surface and such flowers drop off unimpregnated unless they are artificially fertilised sometimes though rarely the stamen is a little longer than usual and then the whole stigmatic surface gets thickly covered with pollen as some pollen is generally deposited in contact with the edge of the stigma certain authors have concluded that the flowers are invariably selffertilised this is an extraordinary conclusion for it implies that a great amount of pollen is produced for no purpose on this view also the large size of the stigmatic surface is an unintelligible feature in the structure of the flower as well as the relative position of all the parts which is such that when insects visit the flowers to suck the copious nectar they cannot fail to carry pollen from one flower to another 67 delpino has described bot zeitung 1867 page 277 and scientific opinion 1870 page 135 the structure of the flowers in this genus but he was mistaken in thinking that selffertilisation is impossible at least in the case of the present species dr dickie and professor faivre state that the flowers are fertilised in the bud and that selffertilisation is inevitable i presume that they were misled by the pollen being deposited at a very early period on the pistil see journal of linnean society botany volume 10 page 55 and variabilité des espèces 1868 page 158  according to delpino bees eagerly visit the flowers in north italy but i have never seen any insect visiting the flowers of the present species in my hothouse although many plants grew there during several years nevertheless these plants produced plenty of seed as they likewise did when covered by a net they are therefore fully capable of selffertilisation and have probably been selffertilised in this country for many generations as they are cultivated in pots and are not exposed to competition with surrounding plants they have also been subjected for a considerable time to somewhat uniform conditions this therefore is a case exactly parallel with that of the common pea in which we have no right to expect much or any good from intercrossing plants thus descended and thus treated and no good did follow excepting that the crossfertilised flowers yielded rather more seeds than the selffertilised this species was one of the earlier ones on which i experimented and as i had not then raised any selffertilised plants for several successive generations under uniform conditions i did not know or even suspect that such treatment would interfere with the advantages to be gained from a cross i was therefore much surprised at the crossed plants not growing more vigorously than the selffertilised and a large number of plants were raised notwithstanding that the present species is an extremely troublesome one to experiment on the seeds even those which have been long soaked in water will not germinate well on bare sand and those that were sown in pots which plan i was forced to follow germinated at very unequal intervals of time so that it was difficult to get pairs of the same exact age and many seedlings had to be pulled up and thrown away my experiments were continued during three successive generations and in each generation the selffertilised plants were again selffertilised their early progenitors in this country having probably been selffertilised for many previous generations in each generation also the crossed plants were fertilised with pollen from another crossed plant  of the flowers which were crossed in the three generations taken together a rather larger proportion yielded capsules than did those which were selffertilised the seeds were counted in fortyseven capsules from the crossed flowers and they contained on an average 995 seeds whereas fortyeight capsules from the selffertilised flowers contained on an average 845 seeds or as 100 to 85 the seeds from the crossed flowers were not heavier on the contrary a little lighter than those from the selffertilised flowers as was thrice ascertained on one occasion i weighed 200 of the crossed and 106 of the selffertilised seeds and the relative weight of an equal number was as 100 for the crossed to 1015 for the selffertilised with other plants when the seeds from the selffertilised flowers were heavier than those from the crossed flowers this appeared to be due generally to fewer having been produced by the selffertilised flowers and to their having been in consequence better nourished but in the present instance the seeds from the crossed capsules were separated into two lotsnamely those from the capsules containing over fourteen seeds and those from the capsules containing under fourteen seeds and the seeds from the more productive capsules were the heavier of the two so that the above explanation here fails  as pollen is deposited at a very early age on the pistil generally in contact with the stigma some flowers whilst still in bud were castrated for my first experiment and were afterwards fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant other flowers were fertilised with their own pollen from the seeds thus obtained i succeeded in rearing only three pairs of plants of equal age the three crossed plants averaged 3279 inches and the three selffertilised 3208 inches in height so that they were nearly equal the crossed having a slight advantage as the same result followed in all three generations it would be superfluous to give the heights of all the plants and i will give only the averages  in order to raise crossed and selffertilised plants of the second generation some flowers on the above crossed plants were crossed within twentyfour hours after they had expanded with pollen from a distinct plant and this interval would probably not be too great to allow of crossfertilisation being effectual some flowers on the selffertilised plants of the last generation were also selffertilised from these two lots of seeds ten crossed and twelve selffertilised plants of equal ages were raised and these were measured when fully grown the crossed averaged 3698 and the selffertilised averaged 3742 inches in height so that here again the two lots were nearly equal but the selffertilised had a slight advantage  in order to raise plants of the third generation a better plan was followed and flowers on the crossed plants of the second generation were selected in which the stamens were too short to reach the stigmas so that they could not possibly have been selffertilised these flowers were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant flowers on the selffertilised plants of the second generation were again selffertilised from the two lots of seeds thus obtained twentyone crossed and nineteen selffertilised plants of equal age and forming the third generation were raised in fourteen large pots they were measured when fully grown and by an odd chance the average height of the two lots was exactly the same namely 3596 inches so that neither side had the least advantage over the other to test this result all the plants on both sides in ten out of the above fourteen pots were cut down after they had flowered and in the ensuing year the stems were again measured and now the crossed plants exceeded by a little namely 17 inches the selffertilised they were again cut down and on their flowering for the third time the selffertilised plants had a slight advantage namely 154 inches over the crossed hence the result arrived at with these plants during the previous trials was confirmed namely that neither lot had any decided advantage over the other it may however be worth mentioning that the selffertilised plants showed some tendency to flower before the crossed plants this occurred with all three pairs of the first generation and with the cut down plants of the third generation a selffertilised plant flowered first in nine out of the twelve pots whilst in the remaining three pots a crossed plant flowered first  if we consider all the plants of the three generations taken together the thirtyfour crossed plants average 3598 and the thirtyfour selffertilised plants 3639 inches in height or as 100 to 101 we may therefore conclude that the two lots possessed equal powers of growth and this i believe to be the result of longcontinued selffertilisation together with exposure to similar conditions in each generation so that all the individuals had acquired a closely similar constitution  30 graminaceaezea mays  this plant is monoecious and was selected for trial on this account no other such plant having been experimented on 68 hildebrand remarks that this species seems at first sight adapted to be fertilised by pollen from the same plant owing to the male flowers standing above the female flowers but practically it must generally be fertilised by pollen from another plant as the male flowers usually shed their pollen before the female flowers are mature monatsbericht der k akad berlin october 1872 page 743 it is also anemophilous or is fertilised by the wind and of such plants only the common beet had been tried some plants were raised in the greenhouse and were crossed with pollen taken from a distinct plant and a single plant growing quite separately in a different part of the house was allowed to fertilise itself spontaneously the seeds thus obtained were placed on damp sand and as they germinated in pairs of equal age were planted on the opposite sides of four very large pots nevertheless they were considerably crowded the pots were kept in the hothouse the plants were first measured to the tips of their leaves when only between 1 and 2 feet in height as shown in table 697  table 697

the curves thus formed  shortly afterwards one of the crossed plants in pot 1 died another became much diseased and stunted and the third never grew to its full height they seemed to have been all

height is 6566 inches from this it follows as shown in the right hand column that if the mean height of the crossed plants be taken as 100 that of the selffertilised plants is 76 the same plan is followed with all the other species  the crossed and selffertilised plants were generally grown in pots in competition with one another and always under as closely similar conditions as could be attained they were however sometimes grown in separate rows in the open ground with several of the species the crossed plants were again crossed and the selffertilised plants again selffertilised and thus successive generations were raised and measured as may be seen in table 7a owing to this manner of proceeding the crossed plants became in the later generations more or less closely interrelated  in table 7b the relative weights of the crossed and selffertilised plants after they had flowered and had been cut down are given in the few cases in which they were ascertained the results are i think more striking and of greater value as evidence of constitutional vigour than those deduced from the relative heights of the plants  the most important table is table 7c as it includes the relative heights weights and fertility of plants raised from parents crossed by a fresh stock that is by nonrelated plants grown under different conditions or by a distinct subvariety in comparison with selffertilised plants or in a few cases with plants of the same old stock intercrossed during several generations the relative fertility of the plants in this and the other tables will be more

genera and to thirty great natural families are given the species are natives of various parts of the world the number of crossed plants including those derived from a cross between plants of the same stock and of two different stocks amounts to 1101 and the number of selffertilised plants including a few in table 7c derived from a cross between plants of the same old stock is 1076 their growth was observed from the germination of the seeds to maturity and most of them were measured twice and some thrice the various precautions taken to prevent either lot being unduly favoured have been described in the introductory chapter bearing all these circumstances in mind it may be admitted that we have a fair basis for judging of the comparative effects of crossfertilisation and of selffertilisation on the growth of the offspring  it will be the most convenient plan first to consider the results given in table 7c as an opportunity will thus be afforded of incidentally discussing some important points if the reader will look down the right hand column of this table he will see at a glance what an extraordinary advantage in height weight and fertility the plants derived from a cross with a fresh stock or with another subvariety have over the selffertilised plants as well as over the intercrossed plants of the same old stock there are only two exceptions to this rule and these are hardly real ones in the case of eschscholtzia the advantage is confined to fertility in that of petunia though the plants derived from a cross with a fresh stock had an immense superiority in height weight and fertility over the selffertilised plants they were conquered by the intercrossed plants of the same old stock in height and weight but not in fertility it has however been shown that the superiority of these intercrossed plants in height and weight was in all probability not real for if the two sets had been allowed to grow for another month it is almost certain that those from a cross with the fresh stock would have been victorious in every way over the intercrossed plants  before we consider in detail the several cases given in table 7c some preliminary remarks must be made there is the clearest evidence as we shall presently see that the advantage of a cross depends wholly on the plants differing somewhat in constitution and that the disadvantages of selffertilisation depend on the two parents which are combined in the same hermaphrodite flower having a closely similar constitution a certain amount of differentiation in the sexual elements seems indispensable for the full fertility of the parents and for the full vigour of the offspring all the individuals of the same species even those produced in a state of nature differ somewhat though often very slightly from one another in external characters and probably in constitution this obviously holds good between the varieties of the same species as far as external characters are concerned and much evidence could be advanced with respect to their generally differing somewhat in constitution there can hardly be a doubt that the differences of all kinds between the individuals and varieties of the same species depend largely and as i believe exclusively on their progenitors having been subjected to different conditions though the conditions to which the individuals of the same species are exposed in a state of nature often falsely appear to us the same for instance the individuals growing together are necessarily exposed to the same climate and they seem to us at first sight to be subjected to identically the same conditions but this can hardly be the case except under the unusual contingency of each individual being surrounded by other kinds of plants in exactly the same proportional numbers for the surrounding plants absorb different amounts of various substances from the soil and thus greatly affect the nourishment and even the life of the individuals of any particular species these will also be shaded and otherwise affected by the nature of the surrounding plants moreover seeds often lie dormant in the ground and those which germinate during any one year will often have been matured during very different seasons seeds are widely dispersed by various means and some will occasionally be brought from distant stations where their parents have grown under somewhat different conditions and the plants produced from such seeds will intercross with the old residents thus mingling their constitutional peculiarities in all sorts of proportions  plants when first subjected to culture even in their native country cannot fail to be exposed to greatly changed conditions of life more especially from growing in cleared ground and from not having to compete with many or any surrounding plants they are thus enabled to absorb whatever they require which the soil may contain fresh seeds are often brought from distant gardens where the parentplants have been subjected to different conditions cultivated plants like those in a state of nature frequently intercross and will thus mingle their constitutional peculiarities on the other hand as long as the individuals of any species are cultivated in the same garden they will apparently be subjected to more uniform conditions than plants in a state of nature as the individuals have not to compete with various surrounding species the seeds sown at the same time in a garden have generally been matured during the same season and in the same place and in this respect they differ much from the seeds sown by the hand of nature some exotic plants are not frequented by the native insects in their new home and therefore are not intercrossed and this appears to be a highly important factor in the individuals acquiring uniformity of constitution  in my experiments the greatest care was taken that in each generation all the crossed and selffertilised plants should be subjected to the same conditions not that the conditions were absolutely the same for the more vigorous individuals will have robbed the weaker ones of nutriment and likewise of water when the soil in the pots was becoming dry and both lots at one end of the pot will have received a little more light than those at the other end in the successive generations the plants were subjected to somewhat different conditions for the seasons necessarily varied and they were sometimes raised at different periods of the year but as they were all kept under glass they were exposed to far less abrupt and great changes of temperature and moisture than are plants growing out of doors with respect to the intercrossed plants their first parents which were not related would almost certainly have differed somewhat in constitution and such constitutional peculiarities would be variously mingled in each succeeding intercrossed generation being sometimes augmented but more commonly neutralised in a greater or less degree and sometimes revived through reversion just as we know to be the case with the external characters of crossed species and varieties with the plants which were selffertilised during the successive generations this latter important source of some diversity of constitution will have been wholly eliminated and the sexual elements produced by the same flower must have been developed under as nearly the same conditions as it is possible to conceive  in table 7c the crossed plants are the offspring of a cross with a fresh stock or with a distinct variety and they were put into competition either with selffertilised plants or with intercrossed plants of the same old stock by the term fresh stock i mean a nonrelated plant the progenitors of which have been raised during some generations in another garden and have consequently been exposed to somewhat different conditions in the case of nicotiana iberis the red variety of primula the common pea and perhaps anagallis the plants which were crossed may be ranked as distinct varieties or subvarieties of the same species but with ipomoea mimulus dianthus and petunia the plants which were crossed differed exclusively in the tint of their flowers and as a large proportion of the plants raised from the same lot of purchased seeds thus varied the differences may be estimated as merely individual having made these preliminary remarks we will now consider in detail the several cases given in table 7c and they are well worthy of full consideration  1 ipomoea purpurea  plants growing in the same pots and subjected in each generation to the same conditions were intercrossed for nine consecutive generations these intercrossed plants thus became in the later generations more or less closely interrelated flowers on the plants of the ninth intercrossed generation were fertilised with pollen taken from a fresh stock and seedlings thus raised other flowers on the same intercrossed plants were fertilised with pollen from another intercrossed plant producing seedlings of the tenth intercrossed generation these two sets of seedlings were grown in competition with one another and differed greatly in height and fertility for the offspring from the cross with a fresh stock exceeded in height the intercrossed plants in the ratio of 100 to 78 and this is nearly the same excess which the intercrossed had over the selffertilised plants in all ten generations taken together namely as 100 to 77 the plants raised from the cross with a fresh stock were also greatly superior in fertility to the intercrossed namely in the ratio of 100 to 51 as judged by the relative weight of the seedcapsules produced by an equal number of plants of the two sets both having been left to be naturally fertilised it should be especially observed that none of the plants of either lot were the product of selffertilisation on the contrary the intercrossed plants had certainly been crossed for the last ten generations and probably during all previous generations as we may infer from the structure of the flowers and from the frequency of the visits of humblebees and so it will have been with the parentplants of the fresh stock the whole great difference in height and fertility between the two lots must be attributed to the one being the product of a cross with pollen from a fresh stock and the other of a cross between plants of the same old stock  this species offers another interesting case in the five first generations in which intercrossed and selffertilised plants were put into competition with one another every single intercrossed plant beat its selffertilised antagonist except in one instance in which they were equal in height but in the sixth generation a plant appeared named by me the hero remarkable for its tallness and increased selffertility and which transmitted its characters to the next three generations the children of hero were again selffertilised forming the eighth selffertilised generation and were likewise intercrossed one with another but this cross between plants which had been subjected to the same conditions and had been selffertilised during the seven previous generations did not effect the least good for the intercrossed grandchildren were actually shorter than the selffertilised grandchildren in the ratio of 100 to 107 we here see that the mere act of crossing two distinct plants does not by itself benefit the offspring this case is almost the converse of that in the last paragraph on which the offspring profited so greatly by a cross with a fresh stock a similar trial was made with the descendants of hero in the following generation and with the same result but the trial cannot be fully trusted owing to the extremely unhealthy condition of the plants subject to this same serious cause of doubt even a cross with a fresh stock did not benefit the greatgrandchildren of hero and if this were really the case it is the greatest anomaly observed by me in all my experiments  2 mimulus luteus  during the three first generations the intercrossed plants taken together exceeded in height the selffertilised taken together in the ratio of 100 to 65 and in fertility in a still higher degree in the fourth generation a new variety which grew taller and had whiter and larger flowers than the old varieties began to prevail especially amongst the selffertilised plants this variety transmitted its characters with remarkable fidelity so that all the plants in the later selffertilised generations belonged to it these consequently exceeded the intercrossed plants considerably in height thus in the seventh generation the intercrossed plants were to the selffertilised in height as 100 to 137 it is a more remarkable fact that the selffertilised plants of the sixth generation had become much more fertile than the intercrossed plants judging by the number of capsules spontaneously produced in the ratio of 147 to 100 this variety which as we have seen appeared amongst the plants of the fourth selffertilised generation resembles in almost all its constitutional peculiarities the variety called hero which appeared in the sixth selffertilised generation of ipomoea no other such case with the partial exception of that of nicotiana occurred in my experiments carried on during eleven years  two plants of this variety of mimulus belonging to the sixth selffertilised generation and growing in separate pots were intercrossed and some flowers on the same plants were again selffertilised from the seeds thus obtained plants derived from a cross between the selffertilised plants and others of the seventh selffertilised generation were raised but this cross did not do the least good the intercrossed plants being inferior in height to the selffertilised in the ratio of 100 to 110 this case is exactly parallel with that given under ipomoea of the grandchildren of hero and apparently of its greatgrandchildren for the seedlings raised by intercrossing these plants were not in any way superior to those of the corresponding generation raised from the selffertilised flowers therefore in these several cases the crossing of plants which had been selffertilised for several generations and which had been cultivated all the time under as nearly as possible the same conditions was not in the least beneficial  another experiment was now tried firstly plants of the eighth selffertilised generation were again selffertilised producing plants of the ninth selffertilised generation secondly two of the plants of the eighth selffertilised generation were intercrossed one with another as in the experiment above referred to but this was now effected on plants which had been subjected to two additional generations of selffertilisation thirdly the same plants of the eighth selffertilised generation were crossed with pollen from plants of a fresh stock brought from a distant garden numerous plants were raised from these three sets of seeds and grown in competition with one another the plants derived from a cross between the selffertilised plants exceeded in height by a little the selffertilised namely as 100 to 92 and in fertility in a greater degree namely as 100 to 73 i do not know whether this difference in the result compared with that in the previous case can be accounted for by the increased deterioration of the selffertilised plants from two additional generations of selffertilisation and the consequent advantage of any cross whatever along merely between the selffertilised plants but however this may be the effects of crossing the selffertilised plants of the eighth generation with a fresh stock were extremely striking for the seedlings thus raised were to the selffertilised of the ninth generation as 100 to 52 in height and as 100 to 3 in fertility they were also to the intercrossed plants derived from crossing two of the selffertilised plants of the eighth generation in height as 100 to 56 and in fertility as 100 to 4 better evidence could hardly be desired of the potent influence of a cross with a fresh stock on plants which had been selffertilised for eight generations and had been cultivated all the time under nearly uniform conditions in comparison with plants selffertilised for nine generations continuously or then once intercrossed namely in the last generation  3 brassica oleracea  some flowers on cabbage plants of the second selffertilised generation were crossed with pollen from a plant of the same variety brought from a distant garden and other flowers were again selffertilised plants derived from a cross with a fresh stock and plants of the third selffertilised generation were thus raised the former were to the selffertilised in weight as 100 to 22 and this enormous difference must be attributed in part to the beneficial effects of a cross with a fresh stock and in part to the deteriorating effects of selffertilisation continued during three generations  4 iberis umbellata  seedlings from a crimson english variety crossed by a palecoloured variety which had been grown for some generations in algiers were to the selffertilised seedlings from the crimson variety in height as 100 to 89 and as 100 to 75 in fertility i am surprised that this cross with another variety did not produce a still more strongly marked beneficial effect for some intercrossed plants of the crimson english variety put into competition with plants of the same variety selffertilised during three generations were in height as 100 to 86 and in fertility as 100 to 75 the slightly greater difference in height in this latter case may possibly be attributed to the deteriorating effects of selffertilisation carried on for two additional generations  5 eschscholtzia californica  this plant offers an almost unique case inasmuch as the good effects of a cross are confined to the reproductive system intercrossed and selffertilised plants of the english stock did not differ in height nor in weight as far as was ascertained in any constant manner the selffertilised plants usually having the advantage so it was with the offspring of plants of the brazilian stock tried in the same manner the parentplants however of the english stock produced many more seeds when fertilised with pollen from another plant than when selffertilised and in brazil the parentplants were absolutely sterile unless they were fertilised with pollen from another plant intercrossed seedlings raised in england from the brazilian stock compared with selffertilised seedlings of the corresponding second generation yielded seeds in number as 100 to 89 both lots of plants being left freely exposed to the visits of insects if we now turn to the effects of crossing plants of the brazilian stock with pollen from the english stockso that plants which had been long exposed to very different conditions were intercrossedwe find that the offspring were as before inferior in height and weight to the plants of the brazilian stock after two generations of selffertilisation but were superior to them in the most marked manner in the number of seeds produced namely as 100 to 40 both lots of plants being left freely exposed to the visits of insects  in the case of ipomoea we have seen that the plants derived from a cross with a fresh stock were superior in height as 100 to 78 and in fertility as 100 to 51 to the plants of the old stock although these had been intercrossed during the last ten generations with eschscholtzia we have a nearly parallel case but only as far as fertility is concerned for the plants derived from a cross with a fresh stock were superior in fertility in the ratio of 100 to 45 to the brazilian plants which had been artificially intercrossed in england for the two last generations and which must have been naturally intercrossed by insects during all previous generations in brazil where otherwise they are quite sterile  6 dianthus caryophyllus  plants selffertilised for three generations were crossed with pollen from a fresh stock and their offspring were grown in competition with plants of the fourth selffertilised generation the crossed plants thus obtained were to the selffertilised in height as 100 to 81 and in fertility both lots being left to be naturally fertilised by insects as 100 to 33  these same crossed plants were also to the offspring from the plants of the third generation crossed by the intercrossed plants of the corresponding generation in height as 100 to 85 and in fertility as 100 to 45  we thus see what a great advantage the offspring from a cross with a fresh stock had not only over the selffertilised plants of the fourth generation but over the offspring from the selffertilised plants of the third generation when crossed by the intercrossed plants of the old stock  7 pisum sativum  it has been shown under the head of this species that the several varieties in this country almost invariably fertilise themselves owing to insects rarely visiting the flowers and as the plants have been long cultivated under nearly similar conditions we can understand why a cross between two individuals of the same variety does not do the least good to the offspring either in height or fertility this case is almost exactly parallel with that of mimulus or that of the ipomoea named hero for in these two instances crossing plants which had been selffertilised for seven generations did not at all benefit the offspring on the other hand a cross between two varieties of the pea causes a marked superiority in the growth and vigour of the offspring over the selffertilised plants of the same varieties as shown by two excellent observers from my own observations not made with great care the offspring from crossed varieties were to selffertilised plants in height in one case as 100 to about 75 and in a second case as 100 to 60  8 lathyrus odoratus  the sweetpea is in the same state in regard to selffertilisation as the common pea and we have seen that seedlings from a cross between two varieties which differed in no respect except in the colour of their flowers were to the selffertilised seedlings from the same motherplant in height as 100 to 80 and in the second generation as 100 to 88 unfortunately i did not ascertain whether crossing two plants of the same variety failed to produce any beneficial effect but i venture to predict such would be the result  9 petunia violacea  the intercrossed plants of the same stock in four out of the five successive generations plainly exceeded in height the selffertilised plants the latter in the fourth generation were crossed by a fresh stock and the seedlings thus obtained were put into competition with the selffertilised plants of the fifth generation the crossed plants exceeded the selffertilised in height in the ratio of 100 to 66 and in weight as 100 to 23 but this difference though so great is not much greater than that between the intercrossed plants of the same stock in comparison with the selffertilised plants of the corresponding generation this case therefore seems at first sight opposed to the rule that a cross with a fresh stock is much more beneficial than a cross between individuals of the same stock but as with eschscholtzia the reproductive system was here chiefly benefited for the plants raised from the cross with the fresh stock were to the selffertilised plants in fertility both lots being naturally fertilised as 100 to 46 whereas the intercrossed plants of the same stock were to the selffertilised plants of the corresponding fifth generation in fertility only as 100 to 86  although at the time of measurement the plants raised from the cross with the fresh stock did not exceed in height or weight the intercrossed plants of the old stock owing to the growth of the former not having been completed as explained under the head of this species yet they exceeded the intercrossed plants in fertility in the ratio of 100 to 54 this fact is interesting as it shows that plants selffertilised for four generations and then crossed by a fresh stock yielded seedlings which were nearly twice as fertile as those from plants of the same stock which had been intercrossed for the five previous generations we here see as with eschscholtzia and dianthus that the mere act of crossing independently of the state of the crossed plants has little efficacy in giving increased fertility to the offspring the same conclusion holds good as we have already seen in the analogous cases of ipomoea mimulus and dianthus with respect to height  10 nicotiana tabacum  my plants were remarkably selffertile and the capsules from the selffertilised flowers apparently yielded more seeds than those which were crossfertilised no insects were seen to visit the flowers in the hothouse and i suspect that the stock on which i experimented had been raised under glass and had been selffertilised during several previous generations if so we can understand why in the course of three generations the crossed seedlings of the same stock did not uniformly exceed in height the selffertilised seedlings but the case is complicated by individual plants having different constitutions so that some of the crossed and selffertilised seedlings raised at the same time from the same parents behaved differently however this may be plants raised from selffertilised plants of the third generation crossed by a slightly different subvariety exceeded greatly in height and weight the selffertilised plants of the fourth generation and the trial was made on a large scale they exceeded them in height when grown in pots and not much crowded in the ratio of 100 to 66 and when much crowded as 100 to 54 these crossed plants when thus subjected to severe competition also exceeded the selffertilised in weight in the ratio of 100 to 37 so it was but in a less degree as may be seen in table 7c when the two lots were grown out of doors and not subjected to any mutual competition nevertheless strange as is the fact the flowers on the motherplants of the third selffertilised generation did not yield more seed when they were crossed with pollen from plants of the fresh stock than when they were selffertilised  11 anagallis collina  plants raised from a red variety crossed by another plant of the same variety were in height to the selffertilised plants from the red variety as 100 to 73 when the flowers on the red variety were fertilised with pollen from a closely similar blueflowered variety they yielded double the number of seeds to what they did when crossed by pollen from another individual of the same red variety and the seeds were much finer the plants raised from this cross between the two varieties were to the selffertilised seedlings from the red variety in height as 100 to 66 and in fertility as 100 to 6  12 primula veris  some flowers on longstyled plants of the third illegitimate generation were legitimately crossed with pollen from a fresh stock and others were fertilised with their own pollen from the seeds thus produced crossed plants and selffertilised plants of the fourth illegitimate generation were raised the former were to the latter in height as 100 to 46 and in fertility during one year as 100 to 5 and as 100 to 35 during the next year in this case however we have no means of distinguishing between the evil effects of illegitimate fertilisation continued during four generations that is by pollen of the same form but taken from a distinct plant and strict selffertilisation but it is probable that these two processes do not differ so essentially as at first appears to be the case in the following experiment any doubt arising from illegitimate fertilisation was completely eliminated  13 primula veris equalstyled redflowered variety  flowers on plants of the second selffertilised generation were crossed with pollen from a distinct variety or fresh stock and others were again selffertilised crossed plants and plants of the third selffertilised generation all of legitimate origin were thus raised and the former was to the latter in height as 100 to 85 and in fertility as judged by the number of capsules produced together with the average number of seeds as 100 to 11  summary of the measurements in table 7c  this table includes the heights and often the weights of 292 plants derived from a cross with a fresh stock and of 305 plants either of selffertilised origin or derived from an intercross between plants of the same stock these 597 plants belong to thirteen species and twelve genera the various precautions which were taken to ensure a fair comparison have already been stated if we now look down the right hand column in which the mean height weight and fertility of the plants derived from a cross with a fresh stock are represented by 100 we shall see by the other figures how wonderfully superior they are both to the selffertilised and to the intercrossed plants of the same stock with respect to height and weight there are only two exceptions to the rule namely with eschscholtzia and petunia and the latter is probably no real exception nor do these two species offer an exception in regard to fertility for the plants derived from the cross with a fresh stock were much more fertile than the selffertilised plants the difference between the two sets of plants in the table is generally much greater in fertility than in height or weight on the other hand with some of the species as with nicotiana there was no difference in fertility between the two sets although a great difference in height and weight considering all the cases in this table there can be no doubt that plants profit immensely though in different ways by a cross with a fresh stock or with a distinct subvariety it cannot be maintained that the benefit thus derived is due merely to the plants of the fresh stock being perfectly healthy whilst those which had been long intercrossed or selffertilised had become unhealthy for in most cases there was no appearance of such unhealthiness and we shall see under table 7a that the intercrossed plants of the same stock are generally superior to a certain extent to the selffertilisedboth lots having been subjected to exactly the same conditions and being equally healthy or unhealthy  we further learn from table 7c that a cross between plants that have been selffertilised during several successive generations and kept all the time under nearly uniform conditions does not benefit the offspring in the least or only in a very slight degree mimulus and the descendants of ipomoea named hero offer instances of this rule again plants selffertilised during several generations profit only to a small extent by a cross with intercrossed plants of the same stock as in the case of dianthus in comparison with the effects of a cross by a fresh stock plants of the same stock intercrossed during several generations as with petunia were inferior in a marked manner in fertility to those derived from the corresponding selffertilised plants crossed by a fresh stock lastly certain plants which are regularly intercrossed by insects in a state of nature and which were artificially crossed in each succeeding generation in the course of my experiments so that they can never or most rarely have suffered any evil from selffertilisation as with eschscholtzia and ipomoea nevertheless profited greatly by a cross with a fresh stock these several cases taken together show us in the clearest manner that it is not the mere crossing of any two individuals which is beneficial to the offspring the benefit thus derived depends on the plants which are united differing in some manner and there can hardly be a doubt that it is in the constitution or nature of the sexual elements anyhow it is certain that the differences are not of an external nature for two plants which resemble each other as closely as the individuals of the same species ever do profit in the plainest manner when intercrossed if their progenitors have been exposed during several generations to different conditions but to this latter subject i shall have to recur in a future chapter  table 7a  we will now turn to our first table which relates to crossed and selffertilised plants of the same stock these consist of fiftyfour species belonging to thirty natural orders the total number of crossed plants of which measurements are given is 796 and of selffertilised 809 that is altogether 1605 plants some of the species were experimented on during several successive generations and it should be borne in mind that in such cases the crossed plants in each generation were crossed with pollen from another crossed plant and the flowers on the selffertilised plants were almost always fertilised with their own pollen though sometimes with pollen from other flowers on the same plant the crossed plants thus became more or less closely interrelated in the later generations and both lots were subjected in each generation to almost absolutely the same conditions and to nearly the same conditions in the successive generations it would have been a better plan in some respects if i had always crossed some flowers either on the selffertilised or intercrossed plants of each generation with pollen from a nonrelated plant grown under different conditions as was done with the plants in table 7c for by this procedure i should have learnt how much the offspring became deteriorated through continued selffertilisation in the successive generations as the case stands the selffertilised plants of the successive generations in table 7a were put into competition with and compared with intercrossed plants which were probably deteriorated in some degree by being more or less interrelated and grown under similar conditions nevertheless had i always followed the plan in table 7c i should not have discovered the important fact that although a cross between plants which are rather closely related and which had been subjected to closely similar conditions gives during several generations some advantage to the offspring yet that after a time they may be intercrossed with no advantage whatever to the offspring nor should i have learnt that the selffertilised plants of the later generations might be crossed with intercrossed plants of the same stock with little or no advantage although they profited to an extraordinary degree by a cross with a fresh stock  with respect to the greater number of the plants in table 7a nothing special need here be said full particulars may be found under the head of each species by the aid of the index the figures in the righthand column show the mean height of the selffertilised plants that of the crossed plants with which they competed being represented by 100 no notice is here taken of the few cases in which crossed and selffertilised plants were grown in the open ground so as not to compete together the table includes as we have seen plants belonging to fiftyfour species but as some of these were measured during several successive generations there are eightythree cases in which crossed and selffertilised plants were compared as in each generation the number of plants which were measured given in the table was never very large and sometimes small whenever in the right hand column the mean height of the crossed and selffertilised plants is the same within five per cent their heights may be considered as practically equal of such cases that is of selffertilised plants of which the mean height is expressed by figures between 95 and 105 there are eighteen either in some one or all the generations there are eight cases in which the selffertilised plants exceed the crossed by above five per cent as shown by the figures in the right hand column being above 105 lastly there are fiftyseven cases in which the crossed plants exceed the selffertilised in a ratio of at least 100 to 95 and generally in a much higher degree  if the relative heights of the crossed and selffertilised plants had been due to mere chance there would have been about as many cases of selffertilised plants exceeding the crossed in height by above five per cent as of the crossed thus exceeding the selffertilised but we see that of the latter there are fiftyseven cases and of the former only eight cases so that the cases in which the crossed plants exceed in height the selffertilised in the above proportion are more than seven times as numerous as those in which the selffertilised exceed the crossed in the same proportion for our special purpose of comparing the powers of growth of crossed and selffertilised plants it may be said that in fiftyseven cases the crossed plants exceeded the selffertilised by more than five per cent and that in twentysix cases 18  8 they did not thus exceed them but we shall now show that in several of these twentysix cases the crossed plants had a decided advantage over the selffertilised in other respects though not in height that in other cases the mean heights are not trustworthy owing to too few plants having been measured or to their having grown unequally from being unhealthy or to both causes combined nevertheless as these cases are opposed to my general conclusion i have felt bound to give them lastly the cause of the crossed plants having no advantage over the selffertilised can be explained in some other cases thus a very small residue is left in which the selffertilised plants appear as far as my experiments serve to be really equal or superior to the crossed plants  we will now consider in some little detail the eighteen cases in which the selffertilised plants equalled in average height the crossed plants within five per cent and the eight cases in which the selffertilised plants exceeded in average height the crossed plants by above five per cent making altogether twentysix cases in which the crossed plants were not taller than the selffertilised plants in any marked degree  1 dianthus caryophyllus third generation  this plant was experimented on during four generations in three of which the crossed plants exceeded in height the selffertilised generally by much more than five per cent and we have seen under table 7c that the offspring from the plants of the third selffertilised generation crossed by a fresh stock profited in height and fertility to an extraordinary degree but in this third generation the crossed plants of the same stock were in height to the selffertilised only as 100 to 99 that is they were practically equal nevertheless when the eight crossed and eight selffertilised plants were cut down and weighed the former were to the latter in weight as 100 to 49 there can therefore be not the least doubt that the crossed plants of this species are greatly superior in vigour and luxuriance to the selffertilised and what was the cause of the selffertilised plants of the third generation though so light and thin growing up so as almost to equal the crossed in height i cannot explain  2 lobelia fulgens first generation  the crossed plants of this generation were much inferior in height to the selffertilised in the proportion of 100 to 127 although only two pairs were measured which is obviously much too few to be trusted yet from other evidence given under the head of this species it is certain that the selffertilised plants were very much more vigorous than the crossed as i used pollen of unequal maturity for crossing and selffertilising the parentplants it is possible that the great difference in the growth of their offspring may have been due to this cause in the next generation this source of error was avoided and many more plants were raised and now the average height of the twentythree crossed plants was to that of the twentythree selffertilised plants as 100 to 91 we can therefore hardly doubt that a cross is beneficial to this species  3 petunia violacea third generation  eight crossed plants were to eight selffertilised of the third generation in average height as 100 to 131 and at an early age the crossed were inferior even in a still higher degree but it is a remarkable fact that in one pot in which plants of both lots grew extremely crowded the crossed were thrice as tall as the selffertilised as in the two preceding and two succeeding generations as well as with plants raised by a crossed with a fresh stock the crossed greatly exceeded the selffertilised in height weight and fertility when these two latter points were attended to the present case must be looked at as an anomaly not affecting the general rule the most probable explanation is that the seeds from which the crossed plants of the third generation were raised were not well ripened for i have observed an analogous case with iberis selffertilised seedlings of this latter plant which were known to have been produced from seeds not well matured grew from the first much more quickly than the crossed plants which were raised from better matured seeds so that having thus once got a great start they were enabled ever afterwards to retain their advantage some of these same seeds of the iberis were sown on the opposite sides of pots filled with burnt earth and pure sand not containing any organic matter and now the young crossed seedlings grew during their short life to double the height of the selffertilised in the same manner as occurred with the above two sets of seedlings of petunia which were much crowded and thus exposed to very unfavourable conditions we have seen also in the eighth generation of ipomoea that the selffertilised seedlings raised from unhealthy parents grew at first very much more quickly than the crossed seedlings so that they were for a long time much taller though ultimately beaten by them  4 5 6 eschscholtzia californica  four sets of measurements are given in table 7a in one of these the crossed plants exceed the selffertilised in average height so that this is not one of the exceptions here to be considered in two other cases the crossed equalled the selffertilised in height within five per cent and in the fourth case the selffertilised exceeded the crossed by above this limit we have seen in table 7c that the whole advantage of a cross by a fresh stock is confined to fertility and so it was with the intercrossed plants of the same stock compared with the selffertilised for the former were in fertility to the latter as 100 to 89 the intercrossed plants thus have at least one important advantage over the selffertilised moreover the flowers on the parentplants when fertilised with pollen from another individual of the same stock yield far more seeds than when selffertilised the flowers in this latter case being often quite sterile we may therefore conclude that a cross does some good though it does not give to the crossed seedlings increased powers of growth  7 viscaria oculata  the average height of the fifteen intercrossed plants to that of the fifteen selffertilised plants was only as 100 to 97 but the former produced many more capsules than the latter in the ratio of 100 to 77 moreover the flowers on the parentplants which were crossed and selffertilised yielded seeds on one occasion in the proportion of 100 to 38 and on a second occasion in the proportion of 100 to 58 so that there can be no doubt about the beneficial effects of a cross although the mean height of the crossed plants was only three per cent above that of the selffertilised plants  8 specularia speculum  only the four tallest of the crossed and the four tallest of the selffertilised plants growing in four pots were measured and the former were to the latter in height as 100 to 98 in all four pots a crossed plant flowered before any one of the selffertilised plants and this is usually a safe indication of some real superiority in the crossed plants the flowers on the parentplants which were crossed with pollen from another plant yielded seeds compared with the selffertilised flowers in the ratio of 100 to 72 we may therefore draw the same conclusion as in the last case with respect to a cross being decidedly beneficial  9 borago officinalis  only four crossed and four selffertilised plants were raised and measured and the former were to the latter in height as 100 to 102 so small a number of measurements ought never to be trusted and in the present instance the advantage of the selffertilised over the crossed plants depended almost entirely on one of the selffertilised plants having grown to an unusual height all four crossed plants flowered before their selffertilised opponents the crossfertilised flowers on the parentplants in comparison with the selffertilised flowers yielded seeds in the proportion of 100 to 60 so that here again we may draw the same conclusion as in the two last cases  10 passiflora gracilis  only two crossed and two selffertilised plants were raised and the former were to the latter in height as 100 to 104 on the other hand fruits from the crossfertilised flowers on the parentplants contained seeds in number compared with those from the selffertilised flowers in the proportion of 100 to 85  11 phaseolus multiflorus  the five crossed plants were to the five selffertilised in height as 100 to 96 although the crossed plants were thus only four per cent taller than the selffertilised they flowered in both pots before them it is therefore probable that they had some real advantage over the selffertilised plants  12 adonis aestivalis  the four crossed plants were almost exactly equal in height to the four selffertilised plants but as so few plants were measured and as these were all miserably unhealthy nothing can be inferred with safety with respect to their relative heights  13 bartonia aurea  the eight crossed plants were to the eight selffertilised in height as 100 to 107 this number of plants considering the care with which they were raised and compared ought to have given a trustworthy result but from some unknown cause they grew very unequally and they became so unhealthy that only three of the crossed and three of the selffertilised plants set any seeds and these few in number under these circumstances the mean height of neither lot can be trusted and the experiment is valueless the crossfertilised flowers on the parentplants yielded rather more seeds than the selffertilised flowers  14 thunbergia alata  the six crossed plants were to the six selffertilised in height as 100 to 108 here the selffertilised plants seem to have a decided advantage but both lots grew unequally some of the plants in both being more than twice as tall as others the parentplants also were in an odd semisterile condition under these circumstances the superiority of the selffertilised plants cannot be fully trusted  15 nolana prostrata  the five crossed plants were to the five selffertilised in height as 100 to 105 so that the latter seem here to have a small but decided advantage on the other hand the flowers on the parentplants which were crossfertilised produced very many more capsules than the selffertilised flowers in the ratio of 100 to 21 and the seeds which the former contained were heavier than an equal number from the selffertilised capsules in the ratio of 100 to 82  16 hibiscus africanus  only four pairs were raised and the crossed were to the selffertilised in height as 100 to 109 excepting that too few plants were measured i know of nothing else to cause distrust in the result the crossfertilised flowers on the parentplants were on the other hand rather more productive than the selffertilised flowers  17 apium petroselinum  a few plants number not recorded derived from flowers believed to have been crossed by insects and a few selffertilised plants were grown on the opposite sides of four pots they attained to a nearly equal height the crossed having a very slight advantage  18 vandellia nummularifolia  twenty crossed plants raised from the seeds of perfect flowers were to twenty selffertilised plants likewise raised from the seeds of perfect flowers in height as 100 to 99 the experiment was repeated with the sole difference that the plants were allowed to grow more crowded and now the twentyfour tallest of the crossed plants were to the twentyfour tallest selffertilised plants in height as 100 to 94 and in weight as 100 to 97 moreover a larger number of the crossed than of the selffertilised plants grew to a moderate height the abovementioned twenty crossed plants were also grown in competition with twenty selffertilised plants raised from the closed or cleistogene flowers and their heights were as 100 to 94 therefore had it not been for the first trial in which the crossed plants were to the selffertilised in height only as 100 to 99 this species might have been classed with those in which the crossed plants exceed the selffertilised by above five per cent on the other hand the crossed plants in the second trial bore fewer capsules and these contained fewer seeds than did the selffertilised plants all the capsules having been produced by cleistogene flowers the whole case therefore must be left doubtful  19 pisum sativum common pea  fourplants derived from a cross between individuals of the same variety were in height to four selffertilised plants belonging to the same variety as 100 to 115 although this cross did no good we have seen under table 7c that a cross between distinct varieties adds greatly to the height and vigour of the offspring and it was there explained that the fact of a cross between the individuals of the same variety not being beneficial is almost certainly due to their having been selffertilised for many generations and in each generation grown under nearly similar conditions  20 21 22 canna warscewiczi  plants belonging to three generations were observed and in all of three the crossed were approximately equal to the selffertilised the average height of the thirtyfour crossed plants being to that of the same number of selffertilised plants as 100 to 101 therefore the crossed plants had no advantage over the selffertilised and it is probable that the same explanation here holds good as in the case of pisum sativum for the flowers of this canna are perfectly selffertile and were never seen to be visited by insects in the hothouse so as to be crossed by them this plant moreover has been cultivated under glass for several generations in pots and therefore under nearly uniform conditions the capsules produced by the crossfertilised flowers on the above thirtyfour crossed plants contained more seeds than did the capsules produced by the selffertilised flowers on the selffertilised plants in the proportion of 100 to 85 so that in this respect crossing was beneficial  23 primula sinensis  the offspring of plants some of which were legitimately and others illegitimately fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant were almost exactly of the same height as the offspring of selffertilised plants but the former with rare exceptions flowered before the latter i have shown in my paper on dimorphic plants that this species is commonly raised in england from selffertilised seed and the plants from having been cultivated in pots have been subjected to nearly uniform conditions moreover many of them are now varying and changing their character so as to become in a greater or less degree equalstyled and in consequence highly selffertile therefore i believe that the cause of the crossed plants not exceeding in height the selffertilised is the same as in the two previous cases of pisum sativum and canna  24 25 26 nicotiana tabacum  four sets of measurements were made in one the selffertilised plants greatly exceeded in height the crossed in two others they were approximately equal to the crossed and in the fourth were beaten by them but this latter case does not here concern us the individual plants differ in constitution so that the descendants of some profit by their parents having been intercrossed whilst others do not taking all three generations together the twentyseven crossed plants were in height to the twentyseven selffertilised plants as 100 to 96 this excess of height in the crossed plants is so small compared with that displayed by the offspring from the same motherplants when crossed by a slightly different variety that we may suspect as explained under table 7c that most of the individuals belonging to the variety which served as the motherplants in my experiments had acquired a nearly similar constitution so as not to profit by being mutually intercrossed  reviewing these twentysix cases in which the crossed plants either do not exceed the selffertilised by above five per cent in height or are inferior to them we may conclude that much the greater number of the cases do not form real exceptions to the rulethat a cross between two plants unless these have been selffertilised and exposed to nearly the same conditions for many generations gives a great advantage of some kind to the offspring of the twentysix cases at least two namely those of adonis and bartonia may be wholly excluded as the trials were worthless from the extreme unhealthiness of the plants inn twelve other cases three trials with eschscholtzia here included the crossed plants either were superior in height to the selffertilised in all the other generations excepting the one in question or they showed their superiority in some different manner as in weight fertility or in flowering first or again the crossfertilised flowers on the motherplant were much more productive of seed than the selffertilised  deducting these fourteen cases there remain twelve in which the crossed plants show no wellmarked advantage over the selffertilised on the other hand we have seen that there are fiftyseven cases in which the crossed plants exceed the selffertilised in height by at least five per cent and generally in a much higher degree but even in the twelve cases just referred to the want of any advantage on the crossed side is far from certain with thunbergia the parentplants were in an odd semisterile condition and the offspring grew very unequally with hibiscus and apium much too few plants were raised for the measurements to be trusted and the crossfertilised flowers of hibiscus produced rather more seed than did the selffertilised with vandellia the crossed plants were a little taller and heavier than the selffertilised but as they were less fertile the case must be left doubtful lastly with pisum primula the three generations of canna and the three of nicotiana which together complete the twelve cases a cross between two plants certainly did no good or very little good to the offspring but we have reason to believe that this is the result of these plants having been selffertilised and cultivated under nearly uniform conditions for several generations the same result followed with the experimental plants of ipomoea and mimulus and to a certain extent with some other species which had been intentionally treated by me in this manner yet we know that these species in their normal condition profit greatly by being intercrossed there is therefore not a single case in table 7a which affords decisive evidence against the rule that a cross between plants the progenitors of which have been subjected to somewhat diversified conditions is beneficial to the offspring this is a surprising conclusion for from the analogy of domesticated animals it could not have been anticipated that the good effects of crossing or the evil effects of selffertilisation would have been perceptible until the plants had been thus treated for several generations  the results given in table 7a may be looked at under another point of view hitherto each generation has been considered as a separate case of which there are eightythree and this no doubt is the more correct method of comparing the crossed and selffertilised plants  but in those cases in which plants of the same species were observed during several generations a general average of their heights in all the generations together may be made and such averages are given in table 7a for instance under ipomoea the general average for the plants of all ten generations is as 100 for the crossed to 77 for the selffertilised plants this having been done in each case in which more than one generation was raised it is easy to calculate the average of the average heights of the crossed and selffertilised plants of all the species included in table 7a it should however be observed that as only a few plants of some species whilst a considerable number of others were measured the value of the mean or average heights of the several species is very different subject to this source of error it may be worth while to give the mean of the mean heights of the fiftyfour species in table 7a and the result is calling the mean of the mean heights of the crossed plants 100 that of the selffertilised plants is 87 but it is a better plan to divide the fiftyfour species into three groups as was done with the previously given eightythree cases the first group consists of species of which the mean heights of the selffertilised plants are within five per cent of 100 so that the crossed and selffertilised plants are approximately equal and of such species there are twelve about which nothing need be said the mean of the mean heights of the selffertilised being of course very nearly 100 or exactly 9958 the second group consists of the species thirtyseven in number of which the mean heights of the crossed plants exceed that of the selffertilised plants by more than five per cent and the mean of their mean heights is to that of the selffertilised plants as 100 to 78 the third group consists of the species only five in number of which the mean heights of the selffertilised plants exceed that of the crossed by more than five per cent and here the mean of the mean heights of the crossed plants is to that of the selffertilised as 100 to 109 therefore if we exclude the species which are approximately equal there are thirtyseven species in which the mean of the mean heights of the crossed plants exceeds that of the selffertilised by twentytwo per cent whereas there are only five species in which the mean of the mean heights of the selffertilised plants exceeds that of the crossed and this only by nine per cent  the truth of the conclusionthat the good effects of a cross depend on the plants having been subjected to different conditions or to their belonging to different varieties in both of which cases they would almost certainly differ somewhat in constitutionis supported by a comparison of the tables 7a and 7c the latter table gives the results of crossing plants with a fresh stock or with a distinct variety and the superiority of the crossed offspring over the selffertilised is here much more general and much more strongly marked than in table 7a in which plants of the same stock were crossed we have just seen that the mean of the mean heights of the crossed plants of the whole fiftyfour species in table 7a is to that of the selffertilised plants as 100 to 87 whereas the mean of the mean heights of the plants crossed by a fresh stock is to that of the selffertilised in table 7c as 100 to 74 so that the crossed plants beat the selffertilised plants by thirteen per cent in table 7a and by twentysix per cent or double as much in table 7c which includes the results of the cross by a fresh stock  table 7b  a few words must be added on the weights of the crossed plants of the same stock in comparison with the selffertilised eleven cases are given in table 7b relating to eight species the number of plants which were weighed is shown in the two left columns and their relative weights in the right column that of the crossed plants being taken as 100 a few other cases have already been recorded in table 7c in reference to plants crossed by a fresh stock i regret that more trials of this kind were not made as the evidence of the superiority of the crossed over the selffertilised plants is thus shown in a more conclusive manner than by their relative heights but this plan was not thought of until a rather late period and there were difficulties either way as the seeds had to be collected when ripe by which time the plants had often begun to wither in only one out of the eleven cases in table 7b that of eschscholtzia do the selffertilised plants exceed the crossed in weight and we have already seen they are likewise superior to them in height though inferior in fertility the whole advantage of a cross being here confined to the reproductive system with vandellia the crossed plants were a little heavier as they were also a little taller than the selffertilised but as a greater number of more productive capsules were produced by the cleistogene flowers on the selffertilised plants than by those on the crossed plants the case must be left as remarked under table 7a altogether doubtful the crossed and selffertilised offspring from a partially selfsterile plant of reseda odorata were almost equal in weight though not in height in the remaining eight cases the crossed plants show a wonderful superiority over the selffertilised being more than double their weight except in one case and here the ratio is as high as 100 to 67 the results thus deduced from the weights of the plants confirm in a striking manner the former evidence of the beneficial effects of a cross between two plants of the same stock and in the few cases in which plants derived from a cross with a fresh stock were weighed the results are similar or even more striking    chapter viii  difference between crossed and selffertilised plants in constitutional vigour and in other respects  greater constitutional vigour of crossed plants the effects of great crowding competition with other kinds of plants selffertilised plants more liable to premature death crossed plants generally flower before the selffertilised negative effects of intercrossing flowers on the same plant cases described transmission of the good effects of a cross to later generations effects of crossing plants of closely related parentage uniform colour of the flowers on plants selffertilised during several generations and cultivated under similar conditions  greater constitutional vigour of crossed plants  as in almost all my experiments an equal number of crossed and selffertilised seeds or more commonly seedlings just beginning to sprout were planted on the opposite sides of the same pots they had to compete with one another and the greater height weight and fertility of the crossed plants may be attributed to their possessing greater innate constitutional vigour generally the plants of the two lots whilst very young were of equal height but afterwards the crossed gained insensibly on their opponents and this shows that they possessed some inherent superiority though not displayed at a very early period in life there were however some conspicuous exceptions to the rule of the two lots being at first equal in height thus the crossed seedlings of the broom sarothamnus scoparius when under three inches in height were more than twice as tall as the selffertilised plants  after the crossed or the selffertilised plants had once grown decidedly taller than their opponents a still increasing advantage would tend to follow from the stronger plants robbing the weaker ones of nourishment and overshadowing them this was evidently the case with the crossed plants of viola tricolor which ultimately quite overwhelmed the selffertilised but that the crossed plants have an inherent superiority independently of competition was sometimes well shown when both lots were planted separately not far distant from one another in good soil in the open ground this was likewise shown in several cases even with plants growing in close competition with one another by one of the selffertilised plants exceeding for a time its crossed opponent which had been injured by some accident or was at first sickly but being ultimately conquered by it the plants of the eighth generation of ipomoea were raised from small seeds produced by unhealthy parents and the selffertilised plants grew at first very rapidly so that when the plants of both lots were about three feet in height the mean height of the crossed to that of the selffertilised was as 100 to 122 when they were about six feet high the two lots were very nearly equal but ultimately when between eight and nine feet in height the crossed plants asserted their usually superiority and were to the selffertilised in height as 100 to 85  the constitutional superiority of the crossed over the selffertilised plants was proved in another way in the third generation of mimulus by selffertilised seeds being sown on one side of a pot and after a certain interval of time crossed seeds on the opposite side the selffertilised seedlings thus had for i ascertained that the seeds germinated simultaneously a clear advantage over the crossed in the start for the race nevertheless they were easily beaten as may be seen under the head of mimulus when the crossed seeds were sown two whole days after the selffertilised but when the interval was four days the two lots were nearly equal throughout life even in this latter case the crossed plants still possessed an inherent advantage for after both lots had grown to their full height they were cut down and without being disturbed were transferred to a larger pot and when in the ensuing year they had again grown to their full height they were measured and now the tallest crossed plants were to the tallest selffertilised plants in height as 100 to 75 and in fertility ie by weight of seeds produced by an equal number of capsules from both lots as 100 to 34  my usual method of proceeding namely to plant several pairs of crossed and selffertilised seeds in an equal state of germination on the opposite sides of the same pots so that the plants were subjected to moderately severe mutual competition was i think the best that could have been followed and was a fair test of what occurs in a state of nature for plants sown by nature generally come up crowded and are almost always exposed to very severe competition with one another and with other kinds of plants this latter consideration led me to make some trials chiefly but not exclusively with ipomoea and mimulus by sowing crossed and selffertilised seeds on the opposite sides of large pots in which other plants had long been growing or in the midst of other plants out of doors the seedlings were thus subjected to very severe competition with plants of other kinds and in all such cases the crossed seedlings exhibited a great superiority in their power of growth over the selffertilised  after the germinating seedlings had been planted in pairs on the opposite sides of several pots the remaining seeds whether or not in a state of germination were in most cases sown very thickly on the two sides of an additional large pot so that the seedlings came up extremely crowded and were subjected to extremely severe competition and unfavourable conditions in such cases the crossed plants almost invariably showed a greater superiority over the selffertilised than did the plants which grew in pairs in the pots  sometimes crossed and selffertilised seeds were sown in separate rows in the open ground which was kept clear of weeds so that the seedlings were not subjected to any competition with other kinds of plants those however in each row had to struggle with the adjoining ones in the same row when fully grown several of the tallest plants in each row were selected measured and compared the result was in several cases but not so invariably as might have been expected that the crossed plants did not exceed in height the selffertilised in nearly so great a degree as when grown in pairs in the pots thus with the plants of digitalis which competed together in pots the crossed were to the selffertilised in height as 100 to 70 whilst those which were grown separately were only as 100 to 85 nearly the same result was observed with brassica with nicotiana the crossed were to the selffertilised plants in height when grown extremely crowded together in pots as 100 to 54 when grown much less crowded in pots as 100 to 66 and when grow in the open ground so as to be subjected to but little competition as 100 to 72 on the other hand with zea there was a greater difference in height between the crossed and selffertilised plants growing out of doors than between the pairs which grew in pots in the hothouse but this may be attributed to the selffertilised plants being more tender so that they suffered more than the crossed when both lots were exposed to a cold and wet summer lastly with one out of two series of reseda odorata grown out of doors in rows as well as with beta vulgaris the crossed plants did not at all exceed the selffertilised in height or exceeded them by a mere trifle  the innate power of the crossed plants to resist unfavourable conditions far better than did the selffertilised plants was shown on two occasions in a curious manner namely with iberis and in the third generation of petunia by the great superiority in height of the crossed over the selffertilised seedlings when both sets were grown under extremely unfavourable conditions whereas owing to special circumstances exactly the reverse occurred with the plants raised from the same seeds and grown in pairs in pots a nearly analogous case was observed on two other occasions with plants of the first generation of nicotiana  the crossed plants always withstood the injurious effects of being suddenly removed into the open air after having been kept in the greenhouse better than did the selffertilised on several occasions they also resisted much better cold and intemperate weather this was manifestly the case with some crossed and selffertilised plants of ipomoea which were suddenly moved from the hothouse to the coldest part of a cool greenhouse the offspring of plants of the eighth selffertilised generation of mimulus crossed by a fresh stock survived a frost which killed every single selffertilised and intercrossed plant of the same old stock nearly the same result followed with some crossed and selffertilised plants of viola tricolor even the tips of the shoots of the crossed plants of sarothamnus scoparius were not touched by a very severe winter whereas all the selffertilised plants were killed halfway down to the ground so that they were not able to flower during the next summer young crossed seedlings of nicotiana withstood a cold and wet summer much better than the selffertilised seedlings i have met with only one exception to the rule of crossed plants being hardier than the selffertilised three long rows of eschscholtzia plants consisting of crossed seedlings from a fresh stock of intercrossed seedlings of the same stock and of selffertilised ones were left unprotected during a severe winter and all perished except two of the selffertilised but this case is not so anomalous as it at first appears for it should be remembered that the selffertilised plants of eschscholtzia always grow taller and are heavier than the crossed the whole benefit of a cross with this species being confined to increased fertility  independently of any external cause which could be detected the selffertilised plants were more liable to premature death than were the crossed and this seems to me a curious fact whilst the seedlings were very young if one died its antagonist was pulled up and thrown away and i believe that many more of the selffertilised died at this early age than of the crossed but i neglected to keep any record with beta vulgaris however it is certain that a large number of the selffertilised seeds perished after germinating beneath the ground whereas the crossed seeds sown at the same time did not thus suffer when a plant died at a somewhat more advanced age the fact was recorded and i find in my notes that out of several hundred plants only seven of the crossed died whilst of the selffertilised at least twentynine were thus lost that is more than four times as many mr galton after examining some of my tables remarks it is very evident that the columns with the selffertilised plants include the larger number of exceptionally small plants and the frequent presence of such puny plants no doubt stands in close relation with their liability to premature death the selffertilised plants of petunia completed their growth and began to wither sooner than did the intercrossed plants and these latter considerably before the offspring from a cross with a fresh stock  period of flowering  in some cases as with digitalis dianthus and reseda a larger number of the crossed than of the selffertilised plants threw up flowerstems but this probably was merely the result of their greater power of growth for in the first generation of lobelia fulgens in which the selffertilised plants greatly exceeded in height the crossed plants some of the latter failed to throw up flowerstems with a large number of species the crossed plants exhibited a wellmarked tendency to flower before the selffertilised ones growing in the same pots it should however be remarked that no record was kept of the flowering of many of the species and when a record was kept the flowering of the first plant in each pot was alone observed although two or more pairs grew in the same pot i will now give three listsone of the species in which the first plant that flowered was a crossed onea second in which the first that

selffertilised in height as 100 to 82 yet in all three pots the selffertilised plants flowered first  clarkia elegans  although the crossed plants were as in the last case to the selffertilised in height as 100 to 82 yet in the two pots the selffertilised flowered first  lobelia fulgens first generation  the crossed plants were to the selffertilised in height only as 100 to 127 and the latter flowered much before the crossed  petunia violacea third generation  the crossed plants were to the selffertilised in height as 100 to 131 and in three out of the four pots a selffertilised plant flowered first in the fourth pot simultaneously  petunia violacea fourth generation  although the crossed plants were to the selffertilised in height as 100 to 69 yet in three out of the five pots a selffertilised plant flowered first in the fourth pot simultaneously and only in the fifth did a crossed plant flower first  nicotiana tabacum first generation  the crossed plants were to the selffertilised in height only as 100 to 178 and a selffertilised plant flowered first in all four pots  nicotiana tabacum third generation  the crossed plants were to the selffertilised in height as 100 to 101 and in four out of the five pots a selffertilised plant flowered first  canna warscewiczi  in the three generations taken together the crossed were to the selffertilised in height as 100 to 101 in the first generation the selffertilised plants showed some tendency to flower first and in the third generation they flowered first in nine out of the twelve pots  species in which the crossed and selffertilised plants flowered almost simultaneously  mimulus luteus sixth generation  the crossed plants were inferior in height and vigour to the selffertilised plants which all belonged to the new whiteflowered tall variety yet in only half the pots did the selffertilised plants flower first and in the other half the crossed plants  viscaria oculata  the crossed plants were only a little taller than the selffertilised namely as 100 to 97 but considerably more fertile yet both lots flowered almost simultaneously  lathyrus odoratus second generation  although the crossed plants were to the selffertilised in height as 100 to 88 yet there was no marked difference in their period of flowering  lobelia fulgens second generation  although the crossed plants were to the selffertilised in height as 100 to 91 yet they flowered simultaneously  nicotiana tabacum third generation  although the crossed plants were to the selffertilised in height as 100 to 83 yet in half the pots a selffertilised plant flowered first and in the other half a crossed plant  these three lists include fiftyeight cases in which the period of flowering of the crossed and selffertilised plants was recorded in fortyfour of them a crossed plant flowered first either in a majority of the pots or in all in nine instances a selffertilised plant flowered first and in five the two lots flowered simultaneously one of the most striking cases is that of cyclamen in which the crossed plants flowered some weeks before the selffertilised in all four pots during two seasons in the second generation of lobelia ramosa a crossed plant flowered in all four pots some days before any one of the selffertilised plants derived from a cross with a fresh stock generally showed a very strongly marked tendency to flower before the selffertilised and the intercrossed plants of the old stock all three lots growing in the same pots thus with mimulus and dianthus in only one pot out of ten and in nicotiana in only one pot out of sixteen did a selffertilised plant flower before the plants of the two crossed kindsthese latter flowering almost simultaneously  a consideration of the two first lists especially of the second one shows that a tendency to flower first is generally connected with greater power of growth that is with greater height but there are some remarkable exceptions to this rule proving that some other cause comes into play thus the crossed plants both of lupinus luteus and clarkia elegans were to the selffertilised plants in height as 100 to 82 and yet the latter flowered first in the third generation of nicotiana and in all three generations of canna the crossed and selffertilised plants were of nearly equal height yet the selffertilised tended to flower first on the other hand with primula sinensis plants raised from a cross between two distinct individuals whether these were legitimately or illegitimately crossed flowered before the illegitimately selffertilised plants although all the plants were of nearly equal height in both cases so it was with respect to height and flowering with phaseolus specularia and borago the crossed plants of hibiscus were inferior in height to the selffertilised in the ratio of 100 to 109 and yet they flowered before the selffertilised in three out of the four pots on the whole there can be no doubt that the crossed plants exhibit a tendency to flower before the selffertilised almost though not quite so strongly marked as to grow to a greater height to weigh more and to be more fertile  a few other cases not included in the above three lists deserve notice in all three pots of viola tricolor naturally crossed plants the offspring of crossed plants flowered before naturally crossed plants the offspring of selffertilised plants flowers on two plants both of selffertilised parentage of the sixth generation of mimulus luteus were intercrossed and other flowers on the same plants were fertilised with their own pollen intercrossed seedlings and seedlings of the seventh selffertilised generation were thus raised and the latter flowered before the intercrossed in three out of the five pots flowers on a plant both of mimulus luteus and of ipomoea purpurea were crossed with pollen from other flowers on the same plant and other flowers were fertilised with their own pollen intercrossed seedlings of this peculiar kind and others strictly selffertilised being thus raised in the case of the mimulus the selffertilised plants flowered first in seven out of the eight pots and in the case of the ipomoea in eight out of the ten pots so that an intercross between the flowers on the same plant was very far from giving to the offspring thus raised any advantage over the strictly selffertilised plants in their period of flowering  effects of crossing flowers on the same plant  in the discussion on the results of a cross with a fresh stock given under table 7c in the last chapter it was shown that the mere act of crossing by itself does no good but that the advantages thus derived depend on the plants which are crossed either consisting of distinct varieties which will almost certainly differ somewhat in constitution or on the progenitors of the plants which are crossed though identical in every external character having been subjected to somewhat different conditions and having thus acquired some slight difference in constitution all the flowers produced by the same plant have been developed from the same seed those which expand at the same time have been exposed to exactly the same climatic influences and the stems have all been nourished by the same roots therefore in accordance with the conclusion just referred to no good ought to result from crossing flowers on the same plant 81 it is however possible that the stamens which differ in length or construction in the same flower may produce pollen differing in nature and in this manner a cross might be made effective between the several flowers on the same plant mr macnab states in a communication to m verlot la production des varietes 1865 page 42 that seedlings raised from the shorter and longer stamens of rhododendron differ in character but the shorter stamens apparently are becoming rudimentary and the seedlings are dwarfs so that the result may be simply due to a want of fertilising power in the pollen as in the case of the dwarfed plants of mirabilis raised by naudin by the use of too few pollengrains analogous statements have been made with respect to the stamens of pelargonium with some of the melastomaceae seedlings raised by me from flowers fertilised by pollen from the shorter stamens certainly differed in appearance from those raised from the longer stamens with differently coloured anthers but here again there is some reason for believing that the shorter stamens are tending towards abortion in the very different case of trimorphic heterostyled plants the two sets of stamens in the same flower have widely different fertilising powers in opposition to this conclusion is the fact that a bud is in one sense a distinct individual and is capable of occasionally or even not rarely assuming new external characters as well as new constitutional peculiarities plants raised from buds which have thus varied may be propagated for a great length of time by grafts cuttings etc and sometimes even by seminal generation 82 i have given numerous cases of such budvariations in my variation of animals and plants under domestication chapter 11 2nd edition volume 1 page 448 there exist also numerous species in which the flowers on the same plant differ from one anotheras in the sexual organs of monoecious and polygamous plantsin the structure of the circumferential flowers in many compositae umbelliferae etcin the structure of the central flower in some plantsin the two kinds of flowers produced by cleistogene speciesand in several other such cases these instances clearly prove that the flowers on the same plant have often varied independently of one another in many important respects such variations having been fixed like those on distinct plants during the development of species  it was therefore necessary to ascertain by experiment what would be the effect of intercrossing flowers on the same plant in comparison with fertilising them with their own pollen or crossing them with pollen from a distinct plant trials were carefully made on five genera belonging to four families and in only one case namely digitalis did the offspring from a cross between the flowers on the same plant receive any benefit and the benefit here was small compared with that derived from a cross between distinct plants in the chapter on fertility when we consider the effects of crossfertilisation and selffertilisation on the productiveness of the parentplants we shall arrive at nearly the same result namely that a cross between the flowers on the same plant does not at all increase the number of the seeds or only occasionally and to a slight degree i will now give an abstract of the results of the five trials which were made  1 digitalis purpurea  seedlings raised from intercrossed flowers on the same plant and others from flowers fertilised with their own pollen were grown in the usual manner in competition with one another on the opposite sides of ten pots in this and the four following cases the details may be found under the head of each species in eight pots in which the plants did not grow much crowded the flowerstems on sixteen intercrossed plants were in height to those on sixteen selffertilised plants as 100 to 94 in the two other pots on which the plants grew much crowded the flowerstems on nine intercrossed plants were in height to those on nine selffertilised plants as 100 to 90 that the intercrossed plants in these two latter pots had a real advantage over their selffertilised opponents was well shown by their relative weights when cut down which was as 100 to 78 the mean height of the flowerstems on the twentyfive intercrossed plants in the ten pots taken together was to that of the flowerstems on the twentyfive selffertilised plants as 100 to 92 thus the intercrossed plants were certainly superior to the selffertilised in some degree but their superiority was small compared with that of the offspring from a cross between distinct plants over the selffertilised this being in the ratio of 100 to 70 in height nor does this latter ratio show at all fairly the great superiority of the plants derived from a cross between distinct individuals over the selffertilised as the former produced more than twice as many flowerstems as the latter and were much less liable to premature death  2 ipomoea purpurea  thirtyone intercrossed plants raised from a cross between flowers on the same plants were grown in ten pots in competition with the same number of selffertilised plants and the former were to the latter in height as 100 to 105 so that the selffertilised plants were a little taller than the intercrossed and in eight out of the ten pots a selffertilised plant flowered before any one of the crossed plants in the same pots the plants which were not greatly crowded in nine of the pots and these offer the fairest standard of comparison were cut down and weighed and the weight of the twentyseven intercrossed plants was to that of the twentyseven selffertilised as 100 to 124 so that by this test the superiority of the selffertilised was strongly marked to this subject of the superiority of the selffertilised plants in certain cases i shall have to recur in a future chapter if we now turn to the offspring from a cross between distinct plants when put into competition with selffertilised plants we find that the mean height of seventythree such crossed plants in the course of ten generations was to that of the same number of selffertilised plants as 100 to 77 and in the case of the plants of the tenth generation in weight as 100 to 44 thus the contrast between the effects of crossing flowers on the same plant and of crossing flowers on distinct plants is wonderfully great  3 mimulus luteus  twentytwo plants raised by crossing flowers on the same plant were grown in competition with the same number of selffertilised plants and the former were to the latter in height as 100 to 105 and in weight as 100 to 103 moreover in seven out of the eight pots a selffertilised plant flowered before any of the intercrossed plants so that here again the selffertilised exhibit a slight superiority over the intercrossed plants for the sake of comparison i may add that seedlings raised during three generations from a cross between distinct plants were to the selffertilised plants in height as 100 to 65  4 pelargonium zonale  two plants growing in separate pots which had been propagated by cuttings from the same plant and therefore formed in fact parts of the same individual were intercrossed and other flowers on one of these plants were selffertilised but the seedlings obtained by the two processes did not differ in height when on the other hand flowers on one of the above plants were crossed with pollen taken from a distinct seedling and other flowers were selffertilised the crossed offspring thus obtained were to the selffertilised in height as 100 to 74  5 origanum vulgare  a plant which had been long cultivated in my kitchen garden had spread by stolons so as to form a large bed or clump seedlings raised by intercrossing flowers on these plants which strictly consisted of the same plant and other seedlings raised from selffertilised flowers were carefully compared from their earliest youth to maturity and they did not differ at all in height or in constitutional vigour some flowers on these seedlings were then crossed with pollen taken from a distinct seedling and other flowers were selffertilised two fresh lots of seedlings being thus raised which were the grandchildren of the plant that had spread by stolons and formed a large clump in my garden these differed much in height the crossed plants being to the selffertilised as 100 to 86 they differed also to a wonderful degree in constitutional vigour the crossed plants flowered first and produced exactly twice as many flowerstems and they afterwards increased by stolons to such an extent as almost to overwhelm the selffertilised plants  reviewing these five cases we see that in four of them the effect of a cross between flowers on the same plant even on offsets of the same plant growing on separate roots as with the pelargonium and origanum does not differ from that of the strictest selffertilisation indeed in two of the cases the selffertilised plants were superior to such intercrossed plants with digitalis a cross between the flowers on the same plant certainly did do some good yet very slight compared with that from a cross between distinct plants on the whole the results here arrived at if we bear in mind that the flowerbuds are to a certain extent distinct individuals and occasionally vary independently of one another agree well with our general conclusion that the advantages of a cross depend on the progenitors of the crossed plants possessing somewhat different constitutions either from having been exposed to different conditions or to their having varied from unknown causes in a manner which we in our ignorance are forced to speak of as spontaneous hereafter i shall have to recur to this subject of the inefficiency of a cross between the flowers on the same plant when we consider the part which insects play in the crossfertilisation of flowers  on the transmission of the good effects from a cross and of the evil effects from selffertilisation  we have seen that seedlings from a cross between distinct plants almost always exceed their selffertilised opponents in height weight and constitutional vigour and as will hereafter be shown often in fertility to ascertain whether this superiority would be transmitted beyond the first generation seedlings were raised on three occasions from crossed and selffertilised plants both sets being fertilised in the same manner and therefore not as in the many cases given in tables 7a 7b 7c in which the crossed plants were again crossed and the selffertilised again selffertilised  firstly seedlings were raised from selffertilised seeds produced under a net by crossed and selffertilised plants of nemophila insignis and the latter were to the former in height as 133 to 100 but these seedlings became very unhealthy early in life and grew so unequally that some of them in both lots were five times as tall as the others therefore this experiment was quite worthless but i have felt bound to give it as opposed to my general conclusion i should state that in this and the two following trials both sets of plants were grown on the opposite sides of the same pots and treated in all respects alike the details of the experiments may be found under the head of each species  secondly a crossed and a selffertilised plant of heartsease viola tricolor grew near together in the open ground and near to other plants of heartsease and as both produced an abundance of very fine capsules the flowers on both were certainly crossfertilised by insects seeds were collected from both plants and seedlings raised from them those from the crossed plants flowered in all three pots before those from the selffertilised plants and when fully grown the former were to the latter in height as 100 to 82 as both sets of plants were the product of crossfertilisation the difference in their growth and period of flowering was clearly due to their parents having been of crossed and selffertilised parentage and it is equally clear that they transmitted different constitutional powers to their offspring the grandchildren of the plants which were originally crossed and selffertilised  thirdly the sweet pea lathyrus odoratus habitually fertilises itself in this country as i possessed plants the parents and grandparents of which had been artificially crossed and other plants descended from the same parents which had been selffertilised for many previous generations these two lots of plants were allowed to fertilise themselves under a net and their selffertilised seeds saved the seedlings thus raised were grown in competition with each other in the usual manner and differed in their powers of growth those from the selffertilised plants which had been crossed during the two previous generations were to those from the plants selffertilised during many previous generations in height as 100 to 90 these two lots of seeds were likewise tried by being sown under very unfavourable conditions in poor exhausted soil and the plants whose grandparents and greatgrandparents had been crossed showed in an unmistakable manner their superior constitutional vigour in this case as in that of the heartsease there could be no doubt that the advantage derived from a cross between two plants was not confined to the offspring of the first generation that constitutional vigour due to crossparentage is transmitted for many generations may also be inferred as highly probable from some of andrew knights varieties of the common pea which were raised by crossing distinct varieties after which time they no doubt fertilised themselves in each succeeding generation these varieties lasted for upwards of sixty years but their glory is now departed 83 see the evidence on this head in my variation under domestication chapter 9 volume 1 2nd edition page 397 on the other hand most of the varieties of the common pea which there is no reason to suppose owe their origin to a cross have had a much shorter existence some also of mr laxtons varieties produced by artificial crosses have retained their astonishing vigour and luxuriance for a considerable number of generations but as mr laxton informs me his experience does not extend beyond twelve generations within which period he has never perceived any diminution of vigour in his plants  an allied point may be here noticed as the force of inheritance is strong with plants of which abundant evidence could be given it is almost certain that seedlings from the same capsule or from the same plant would tend to inherit nearly the same constitution and as the advantage from a cross depends on the plants which are crossed differing somewhat in constitution it may be inferred as probable that under similar conditions a cross between the nearest relations would not benefit the offspring so much as one between nonrelated plants in support of this conclusion we have some evidence as fritz muller has shown by his valuable experiments on hybrid abutilons that the union of brothers and sisters parents and children and of other near relations is highly injurious to the fertility of the offspring in one case moreover seedlings from such near relations possessed very weak constitutions 84 jenaische zeitschrift fur naturw b 7 pages 22 and 45 1872 and 1873 pages 441450 this same observer also found three plants of a bignonia growing near together 85 botanische zeitung 1868 page 626 he fertilised twentynine flowers on one of them with their own pollen and they did not set a single capsule thirty flowers were then fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant one of the three growing together and they yielded only two capsules lastly five flowers were fertilised with pollen from a fourth plant growing at a distance and all five produced capsules it seems therefore probable as fritz muller suggests that the three plants growing near together were seedlings from the same parent and that from being closely related they had little power of fertilising one another 86 some remarkable cases are given in my variation under domestication chapter 17 2nd edition volume 2 page 121 of hybrids of gladiolus and cistus any one of which could be fertilised by pollen from any other but not by its own pollen  lastly the fact of the intercrossed plants in table 7a not exceeding in height the selffertilised plants in a greater and greater degree in the later generations is probably the result of their having become more and more closely interrelated  uniform colour of the flowers on plants selffertilised and grown under similar conditions for several generations  at the commencement of my experiments the parentplants of mimulus luteus ipomoea purpurea dianthus caryophyllus and petunia violacea raised from purchased seeds varied greatly in the colour of their flowers this occurs with many plants which have been long cultivated as an ornament for the flowergarden and which have been propagated by seeds the colour of the flowers was a point to which i did not at first in the least attend and no selection whatever was practised nevertheless the flowers produced by the selffertilised plants of the above four species became absolutely uniform in tint or very nearly so after they had been grown for some generations under closely similar conditions the intercrossed plants which were more or less closely interrelated in the later generations and which had been likewise cultivated all the time under similar conditions became more uniform in the colour of their flowers than were the original parentplants but much less so than the selffertilised plants when selffertilised plants of one of the later generations were crossed with a fresh stock and seedlings thus raised these presented a wonderful contrast in the diversified tints of their flowers compared with those of the selffertilised seedlings as such cases of flowers becoming uniformly coloured without any aid from selection seem to me curious i will give a full abstract of my observations  mimulus luteus  a tall variety bearing large almost white flowers blotched with crimson appeared amongst the intercrossed and selffertilised plants of the third and fourth generations this variety increased so rapidly that in the sixth generation of selffertilised plants every single one consisted of it so it was with all the many plants which were raised up to the last or ninth selffertilised generation although this variety first appeared amongst the intercrossed plants yet from their offspring being intercrossed in each succeeding generation it never prevailed amongst them and the flowers on the several intercrossed plants of the ninth generation differed considerably in colour on the other hand the uniformity in colour of the flowers on the plants of all the later selffertilised generations was quite surprising on a casual inspection they might have been said to be quite alike but the crimson blotches were not of exactly the same shape or in exactly the same position both my gardener and myself believe that this variety did not appear amongst the parentplants raised from purchased seeds but from its appearance amongst both the crossed and selffertilised plants of the third and fourth generations and from what i have seen of the variation of this species on other occasions it is probable that it would occasionally appear under any circumstances we learn however from the present case that under the peculiar conditions to which my plants were subjected this particular variety remarkable for its colouring largeness of the corolla and increased height of the whole plant prevailed in the sixth and all the succeeding selffertilised generations to the complete exclusion of every other variety  ipomoea purpurea  my attention was first drawn to the present subject by observing that the flowers on all the plants of the seventh selffertilised generation were of a uniform remarkably rich dark purple tint the many plants which were raised during the three succeeding generations up to the last or tenth all produced flowers coloured in the same manner they were absolutely uniform in tint like those of a constant species living in a state of nature and the selffertilised plants might have been distinguished with certainty as my gardener remarked without the aid of labels from the intercrossed plants of the later generations these however had more uniformly coloured flowers than those which were first raised from the purchased seeds this dark purple variety did not appear as far as my gardener and myself could recollect before the fifth or sixth selffertilised generation however this may have been it became through continued selffertilisation and the cultivation of the plants under uniform conditions perfectly constant to the exclusion of every other variety  dianthus caryophyllus  the selffertilised plants of the third generation all bore flowers of exactly the same pale rosecolour and in this respect they differed quite remarkably from the plants growing in a large bed close by and raised from seeds purchased from the same nursery garden in this case it is not improbable that some of the parentplants which were first selffertilised may have borne flowers thus coloured but as several plants were selffertilised in the first generation it is extremely improbable that all bore flowers of exactly the same tint as those of the selffertilised plants of the third generation the intercrossed plants of the third generation likewise produced flowers almost though not quite so uniform in tint as those of the selffertilised plants  petunia violacea  in this case i happened to record in my notes that the flowers on the parentplant which was first selffertilised were of a dingy purple colour in the fifth selffertilised generation every one of the twentyone selffertilised plants growing in pots and all the many plants in a long row out of doors produced flowers of absolutely the same tint namely of a dull rather peculiar and ugly flesh colour therefore considerably unlike those on the parentplant i believe that this change of colour supervened quite gradually but i kept no record as the point did not interest me until i was struck with the uniform tint of the flowers on the selffertilised plants of the fifth generation the flowers on the intercrossed plants of the corresponding generation were mostly of the same dull flesh colour but not nearly so uniform as those on the selffertilised plants some few being very pale almost white the selffertilised plants which grew in a long row in the open ground were also remarkable for their uniformity in height as were the intercrossed plants in a less degree both lots being compared with a large number of plants raised at the same time under similar conditions from the selffertilised plants of the fourth generation crossed by a fresh stock i regret that i did not attend to the uniformity in height of the selffertilised seedlings in the later generations of the other species  these few cases seem to me to possess much interest we learn from them that new and slight shades of colour may be quickly and firmly fixed independently of any selection if the conditions are kept as nearly uniform as is possible and no intercrossing be permitted with mimulus not only a grotesque style of colouring but a larger corolla and increased height of the whole plant were thus fixed whereas with most plants which have been long cultivated for the flowergarden no character is more variable than that of colour excepting perhaps that of height from the consideration of these cases we may infer that the variability of cultivated plants in the above respects is due firstly to their being subjected to somewhat diversified conditions and secondly to their being often intercrossed as would follow from the free access of insects i do not see how this inference can be avoided as when the above plants were cultivated for several generations under closely similar conditions and were intercrossed in each generation the colour of their flowers tended in some degree to change and to become uniform when no intercrossing with other plants of the same stock was allowedthat is when the flowers were fertilised with their own pollen in each generationtheir colour in the later generations became as uniform as that of plants growing in a state of nature accompanied at least in one instance by much uniformity in the height of the plants but in saying that the diversified tints of the flowers on cultivated plants treated in the ordinary manner are due to differences in the soil climate etc to which they are exposed i do not wish to imply that such variations are caused by these agencies in any more direct manner than that in which the most diversified illnesses as colds inflammation of the lungs or pleura rheumatism etc may be said to be caused by exposure to cold in both cases the constitution of the being which is acted on is of preponderant importance    chapter ix  the effects of crossfertilisation and selffertilisation on the production of seeds  fertility of plants of crossed and selffertilised parentage both lots being fertilised in the same manner fertility of the parentplants when first crossed and selffertilised and of their crossed and selffertilised offspring when again crossed and selffertilised comparison of the fertility of flowers fertilised with their own pollen and with that from other flowers on the same plant selfsterile plants causes of selfsterility the appearance of highly selffertile varieties selffertilisation apparently in some respects beneficial independently of the assured production of seeds relative weights and rates of germination of seeds from crossed and selffertilised flowers  the present chapter is devoted to the fertility of plants as influenced by crossfertilisation and selffertilisation the subject consists of two distinct branches firstly the relative productiveness or fertility of flowers crossed with pollen from a distinct plant and with their own pollen as shown by the proportional number of capsules which they produce together with the number of the contained seeds secondly the degree of innate fertility or sterility of the seedlings raised from crossed and selffertilised seeds such seedlings being of the same age grown under the same conditions and fertilised in the same manner these two branches of the subject correspond with the two which have to be considered by any one treating of hybrid plants namely in the first place the comparative productiveness of a species when fertilised with pollen from a distinct species and with its own pollen and in the second place the fertility of its hybrid offspring these two classes of cases do not always run parallel thus some plants as gartner has shown can be crossed with great ease but yield excessively sterile hybrids while others are crossed with extreme difficulty but yield fairly fertile hybrids  the natural order to follow in this chapter would have been first to consider the effects on the fertility of the parentplants of crossing them and of fertilising them with their own pollen but as we have discussed in the two last chapters the relative height weight and constitutional vigour of crossed and selffertilised plantsthat is of plants raised from crossed and selffertilised seedsit will be convenient here first to consider their relative fertility the cases observed by me are given in table 9d in which plants of crossed and selffertilised parentage were left to fertilise themselves being either crossed by insects or spontaneously selffertilised it should be observed that the results cannot be considered as fully trustworthy for the fertility of a plant is a most variable element depending on its age health nature of the soil amount of water given and temperature to which it is exposed the number of the capsules produced and the number of the contained seeds ought to have been ascertained on a large number of crossed and selffertilised plants of the same age and treated in every respect alike in these two latter respects my observations may be trusted but a sufficient number of capsules were counted only in a few instances the fertility or as it may perhaps better be called the productiveness of a plant depends on the number of capsules produced and on the number of seeds which these contain but from various causes chiefly from the want of time i was often compelled to rely on the number of the capsules alone nevertheless in the more interesting cases the seeds were also counted or weighed the average number of seeds per capsule is a more valuable criterion of fertility than the number of capsules produced this latter circumstance depends partly on the size of the plant and we know that crossed plants are generally taller and heavier than the selffertilised but the difference in this respect is rarely sufficient to account for the difference in the number of the capsules produced it need hardly be added that in table 9d the same number of crossed and selffertilised plants are always compared subject to the foregoing sources of doubt i will now give the table in which the parentage of the plants experimented on and the manner of determining their fertility are explained fuller details may be found in the previous part of this work under the head of each species  table

those of selffertilised parentage both lots being fertilised in the same manner with several of the species as with eschscholtzia reseda viola dianthus petunia and primula both lots were certainly crossfertilised by insects and so it probably was with several of the others but in some of the species as with nemophila and in some of the trials with ipomoea and dianthus the plants were covered up and both lots were spontaneously selffertilised this also was necessarily the case with the capsules produced by the cleistogene flowers of vandellia  the fertility of the crossed plants is represented in table 9d by 100 and that of the selffertilised by the other figures there are five cases in which the fertility of the selffertilised plants is approximately equal to that of the crossed nevertheless in four of these cases the crossed plants were plainly taller and in the fifth somewhat taller than the selffertilised but i should state that in some of these five cases the fertility of the two lots was not strictly ascertained as the capsules were not actually counted from appearing equal in number and from all apparently containing a full complement of seeds in only two instances in the table namely with vandellia and in the third generation of dianthus the capsules on the selffertilised plants contained more seed than those on the crossed plants with dianthus the ratio between the number of seeds contained in the selffertilised and crossed capsules was as 125 to 100 both sets of plants were left to fertilise themselves under a net and it is almost certain that the greater fertility of the selffertilised plants was here due merely to their having varied and become less strictly dichogamous so as to mature their anthers and stigmas more nearly at the same time than is proper to the species excluding the seven cases now referred to there remain twentysix in which the crossed plants were manifestly much more fertile sometimes to an extraordinary degree than the selffertilised with which they grew in competition the most striking instances are those in which plants derived from a cross with a fresh stock are compared with plants of one of the later selffertilised generations yet there are some striking cases as that of viola between the intercrossed plants of the same stock and the selffertilised even in the first generation the results most to be trusted are those in which the productiveness of the plants was ascertained by the number of capsules produced by an equal number of plants together with the actual or average number of seeds in each capsule of such cases there are twelve in the table and the mean of their mean fertility is as 100 for the crossed plants to 59 for the selffertilised plants the primulaceae seem eminently liable to suffer in fertility from selffertilisation  the following short table table 9e includes four cases which have already been partly given in the last table  table 9einnate fertility

the same stock with the intercrossed and selffertilised plants and to the corresponding generation  these cases show us how greatly superior in innate fertility the seedlings from plants selffertilised or intercrossed for several generations and then crossed by a fresh stock are in comparison with the seedlings from plants of the old stock either intercrossed or selffertilised for the same number of generations the three lots of plants in each case were left freely exposed to the visits of insects and their flowers without doubt were crossfertilised by them  table 9e further shows us that in all four cases the intercrossed plants of the same stock still have a decided though small advantage in fertility over the selffertilised plants  with respect to the state of the reproductive organs in the selffertilised plants of tables 9d and 9e only a few observations were made in the seventh and eighth generation of ipomoea the anthers in the flowers of the selffertilised plants were plainly smaller than those in the flowers of the intercrossed plants the tendency to sterility in these same plants was also shown by the firstformed flowers after they had been carefully fertilised often dropping off in the same manner as frequently occurs with hybrids the flowers likewise tended to be monstrous in the fourth generation of petunia the pollen produced by the selffertilised and intercrossed plants was compared and they were far more empty and shrivelled grains in the former  relative fertility of flowers crossed with pollen from a distinct plant and with their own pollen this heading includes flowers on the parentplants and on the crossed and selffertilised seedlings of the first or a succeeding generation  i will first treat of the parentplants which were raised from seeds purchased from nurserygardens or taken from plants growing in my garden or growing wild and surrounded in every case by many individuals of the same species plants thus circumstanced will commonly have been intercrossed by insects so that the seedlings which were first experimented on will generally have been the product of a cross consequently any difference in the fertility of their flowers when crossed and selffertilised will have been caused by the nature of the pollen employed that is whether it was taken from a distinct plant or from the same flower the degrees of fertility shown in table 9f were determined in each case by the average number of seeds per capsule ascertained either by counting or weighing  another element ought properly to have been taken into account namely the proportion of flowers which yielded capsules when they were crossed and selffertilised and as crossed flowers generally produce a larger proportion of capsules their superiority in fertility if this element had been taken into account would have been much more strongly marked than appears in table 9f but had i thus acted there would have been greater liability to error as pollen applied to the stigma at the wrong time fails to produce any effect independently of its greater or less potency a good illustration of the great difference in the results which sometimes follows if the number of capsules produced relatively to the number of flowers fertilised be included in the calculation was afforded by nolana prostrata thirty flowers on some plants of this species were crossed and produced twentyseven capsules each containing five seeds thirtytwo flowers on the same plants were selffertilised and produced only six capsules each containing five seeds as the number of seeds per capsule is here the same the fertility of the crossed and selffertilised flowers is given in table 9f as equal or as 100 to 100 but if the flowers which failed to produce capsules be included the crossed flowers yielded on an average 450 seeds whilst the selffertilised flowers yielded only 094 seeds so that their relative fertility would have been as 100 to 21 i should here state that it has been found convenient to reserve for separate discussion the cases of flowers which are usually quite sterile with their own pollen  table 9frelative fertility of the

generation here two causes combine to diminish the fertility of the selffertilised flowers namely the lesser efficacy of pollen from the same flower and the innate lessened fertility of plants derived from selffertilised seeds which as we have seen in the previous table 9d is strongly marked the fertility was determined in the same manner as in table 9f that is by the average number of seeds per capsule and the same remarks as before with respect to the different proportion of flowers which set capsules when they are crossfertilised and selffertilised are here likewise applicable  table

and selffertilised flowers on the crossed and selffertilised plants of three generations taken together yielded seeds as 85  as both these tables relate to the fertility of flowers fertilised by pollen from another plant and by their own pollen they may be considered together the difference between them consists in the selffertilised flowers in table 9g being produced by selffertilised parents and the crossed flowers by crossed parents which in the later generations had become somewhat closely interrelated and had been subjected all the time to nearly the same conditions these two tables include fifty cases relating to thirtytwo species the flowers on many other species were crossed and selffertilised but as only a few were thus treated the results cannot be trusted as far as fertility is concerned and are not here given some other cases have been rejected as the plants were in an unhealthy condition if we look to the figures in the two tables expressing the ratios between the mean relative fertility of the crossed and selffertilised flowers we see that in a majority of cases ie in thirtyfive out of fifty flowers fertilised by pollen from a distinct plant yield more sometimes many more seeds than flowers fertilised with their own pollen and they commonly set a larger proportion of capsules the degree of infertility of the selffertilised flowers differs extremely in the different species and even as we shall see in the section on selfsterile plants in the individuals of the same species as well as under slightly changed conditions of life their fertility ranges from zero to fertility equalling that of the crossed flowers and of this fact no explanation can be offered there are fifteen cases in the two tables in which the number of seeds per capsule produced by the selffertilised flowers equals or even exceeds that yielded by the crossed flowers some few of these cases are i believe accidental that is would not recur on a second trial this was apparently the case with the plants of the fifth generation of ipomoea and in one of the experiments with dianthus nicotiana offers the most anomalous case of any as the selffertilised flowers on the parentplants and on their descendants of the second and third generations produced more seeds than did the crossed flowers but we shall recur to this case when we treat of highly selffertile varieties  it might have been expected that the difference in fertility between the crossed and selffertilised flowers would have been more strongly marked in table 9g in which the plants of one set were derived from selffertilised parents than in table 9f in which flowers on the parentplants were selffertilised for the first time but this is not the case as far as my scanty materials allow of any judgment there is therefore no evidence at present that the fertility of plants goes on diminishing in successive selffertilised generations although there is some rather weak evidence that this does occur with respect to their height or growth but we should bear in mind that in the later generations the crossed plants had become more or less closely interrelated and had been subjected all the time to nearly uniform conditions  it is remarkable that there is no close correspondence either in the parentplants or in the successive generations between the relative number of seeds produced by the crossed and selffertilised flowers and the relative powers of growth of the seedlings raised from such seeds thus the crossed and selffertilised flowers on the parentplants of ipomoea gesneria salvia limnanthes lobelia fulgens and nolana produced a nearly equal number of seeds yet the plants raised from the crossed seeds exceeded considerably in height those raised from the selffertilised seeds the crossed flowers of linaria and viscaria yielded far more seeds than the selffertilised flowers and although the plants raised from the former were taller than those from the latter they were not so in any corresponding degree with nicotiana the flowers fertilised with their own pollen were more productive than those crossed with pollen from a slightly different variety yet the plants raised from the latter seeds were much taller heavier and more hardy than those raised from the selffertilised seeds on the other hand the crossed seedlings of eschscholtzia were neither taller nor heavier than the selffertilised although the crossed flowers were far more productive than the selffertilised but the best evidence of a want of correspondence between the number of seeds produced by crossed and selffertilised flowers and the vigour of the offspring raised from them is afforded by the plants of the brazilian and european stocks of eschscholtzia and likewise by certain individual plants of reseda odorata for it might have been expected that the seedlings from plants the flowers of which were excessively selfsterile would have profited in a greater degree by a cross than the seedlings from plants which were moderately or fully selffertile and therefore apparently had no need to be crossed but no such result followed in either case for instance the crossed and selffertilised offspring from a highly selffertile plant of reseda odorata were in average height to each other as 100 to 82 whereas the similar offspring from an excessively selfsterile plant were as 100 to 92 in average height  with respect to the innate fertility of the plants of crossed and selffertilised parentage given in the previous table 9dthat is the number of seeds produced by both lots when their flowers were fertilised in the same mannernearly the same remarks are applicable in reference to the absence of any close correspondence between their fertility and powers of growth as in the case of the plants in the tables 9f and 9g just considered thus the crossed and selffertilised plants of ipomoea papaver reseda odorata and limnanthes were almost equally fertile yet the former exceeded considerably in height the selffertilised plants on the other hand the crossed and selffertilised plants of mimulus and primula differed to an extreme degree in innate fertility but by no means to a corresponding degree in height or vigour  in all the cases of selffertilised flowers included in tables 9e 9f and 9g these were fertilised with their own pollen but there is another form of selffertilisation namely by pollen from other flowers on the same plant but this latter method made no difference in comparison with the former in the number of seeds produced or only a slight difference neither with digitalis nor dianthus were more seeds produced by the one method than by the other to any trustworthy degree with ipomoea rather more seeds in the proportion of 100 to 91 were produced from a crossed between flowers on the same plant than from strictly selffertilised flowers but i have reason to suspect that the result was accidental with origanum vulgare however a cross between flowers on plants propagated by stolons from the same stock certainly increased slightly their fertility this likewise occurred as we shall see in the next section with eschscholtzia perhaps with corydalis cava and oncidium but not so with bignonia abutilon tabernaemontana senecio and apparently reseda odorata  selfsterile plants  the cases here to be described might have been introduced in table 9f which gives the relative fertility of flowers fertilised with their own pollen and with that from a distinct plant but it has been found more convenient to keep them for separate discussion the present cases must not be confounded with those to be given in the next chapter relatively to flowers which are sterile when insects are excluded for such sterility depends not merely on the flowers being incapable of fertilisation with their own pollen but on mechanical causes by which their pollen is prevented from reaching the stigma or on the pollen and stigma of the same flower being matured at different periods  in the seventeenth chapter of my variation of animals and plants under domestication i had occasion to enter fully on the present subject and i will therefore here give only a brief abstract of the cases there described but others must be added as they have an important bearing on the present work kolreuter long ago described plants of verbascum phoeniceum which during two years were sterile with their own pollen but were easily fertilised by that of four other species these plants however afterwards became more or less selffertile in a strangely fluctuating manner mr scott also found that this species as well as two of its varieties were selfsterile as did gartner in the case of verbascum nigrum so it was according to this latter author with two plants of lobelia fulgens though the pollen and ovules of both were in an efficient state in relation to other species five species of passiflora and certain individuals of a sixth species have been found sterile with their own pollen but slight changes in their conditions such as being grafted on another stock or a change of temperature rendered them selffertile flowers on a completely selfimpotent plant of passiflora alata fertilised with pollen from its own selfimpotent seedlings were quite fertile mr scott and afterwards mr munro found that some species of oncidium and of maxillaria cultivated in a hothouse in edinburgh were quite sterile with their own pollen and fritz muller found this to be the case with a large number of orchidaceous genera growing in their native home of south brazil 92 botanische zeitung 1868 page 114 he also discovered that the pollenmasses of some orchids acted on their own stigmas like a poison and it appears that gartner formerly observed indications of this extraordinary fact in the case of some other plants  fritz muller also states that a species of bignonia and tabernaemontana echinata are both sterile with their own pollen in their native country of brazil 93 ibid 1868 page 626 and 1870 page 274 several amaryllidaceous and liliaceous plants are in the same predicament hildebrand observed with care corydalis cava and found it completely selfsterile 94 report of the international horticultural congress 1866 but according to caspary a few selffertilised seeds are occasionally produced corydalis halleri is only slightly selfsterile and c intermedia not at all so 95 botanische zeitung june 27 1873 in another fumariaceous genus hypecoum hildebrand observed that h grandiflorum was highly selfsterile whilst h procumbens was fairly selffertile 96 jahrb fur wiss botanik b 7 page 464 thunbergia alata kept by me in a warm greenhouse was selfsterile early in the season but at a later period produced many spontaneously selffertilised fruits so it was with papaver vagum another species p alpinum was found by professor h hoffmann to be quite selfsterile excepting on one occasion 97 zur speciesfrage 1875 page 47 whilst p somniferum has been with me always completely selfsterile  eschscholtzia californica  this species deserves a fuller consideration a plant cultivated by fritz muller in south brazil happened to flower a month before any of the others and it did not produce a single capsule this led him to make further observations during the next six generations and he found that all his plants were completely sterile unless they were crossed by insects or were artificially fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant in which case they were completely fertile 98 botanische zeitung 1868 page 115 and 1869 page 223 i was much surprised at this fact as i had found that english plants when covered by a net set a considerable number of capsules and that these contained seeds by weight compared with those on plants intercrossed by the bees as 71 to 100 professor hildebrand however found this species much more selfsterile in germany than it was with me in england for the capsules produced by selffertilised flowers compared with those from intercrossed flowers contained seeds in the ratio of only 11 to 100 at my request fritz muller sent me from brazil seeds of his selfsterile plants from which i raised seedlings two of these were covered with a net and one produced spontaneously only a single capsule containing no good seeds but yet when artificially fertilised with its own pollen produced a few capsules the other plant produced spontaneously under the net eight capsules one of which contained no less than thirty seeds and on an average about ten seeds per capsule eight flowers on these two plants were artificially selffertilised and produced seven capsules containing on an average twelve seeds eight other flowers were fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant of the brazilian stock and produced eight capsules containing on an average about eighty seeds this gives a ratio of 15 seeds for the selffertilised capsules to 100 for the crossed capsules later in the season twelve other flowers on these two plants were artificially selffertilised but they yielded only two capsules containing three and six seeds it appears therefore that a lower temperature than that of brazil favours the selffertility of this plant whilst a still lower temperature lessens it as soon as the two plants which had been covered by the net were uncovered they were visited by many beesand it was interesting to observe how quickly they became even the more sterile plant of the two covered with young capsules on the following year eight flowers on plants of the brazilian stock of selffertilised parentage ie grandchildren of the plants which grew in brazil were again selffertilised and produced five capsules containing on an average 274 seeds with a maximum in one of fortytwo seeds so that their selffertility had evidently increased greatly by being reared for two generations in england on the whole we may conclude that plants of the brazilian stock are much more selffertile in this country than in brazil and less so than plants of the english stock in england so that the plants of brazilian parentage retained by inheritance some of their former sexual constitution conversely seeds from english plants sent by me to fritz muller and grown in brazil were much more selffertile than his plants which had been cultivated there for several generations but he informs me that one of the plants of english parentage which did not flower the first year and was thus exposed for two seasons to the climate of brazil proved quite selfsterile like a brazilian plant showing how quickly the climate had acted on its sexual constitution  abutilon darwinii  seeds of this plant were sent me by fritz muller who found it as well as some other species of the same genus quite sterile in its native home of south brazil unless fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant either artificially or naturally by hummingbirds 99 jenaische zeitschr fur naturwiss b 7 1872 page 22 and 1873 page 441 several plants were raised from these seeds and kept in the hothouse they produced flowers very early in the spring and twenty of them were fertilised some with pollen from the same flower and some with pollen from other flowers on the same plants but not a single capsule was thus produced yet the stigmas twentyseven hours after the application of the pollen were penetrated by the pollentubes at the same time nineteen flowers were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant and these produced thirteen capsules all abounding with fine seeds a greater number of capsules would have been produced by the cross had not some of the nineteen flowers been on a plant which was afterwards proved to be from some unknown cause completely sterile with pollen of any kind thus far these plants behaved exactly like those in brazil but later in the season in the latter part of may and in june they began to produce under a net a few spontaneously selffertilised capsules as soon as this occurred sixteen flowers were fertilised with their own pollen and these produced five capsules containing on an average 34 seeds at the same time i selected by chance four capsules from the uncovered plants growing close by the flowers of which i had seen visited by humblebees and these contained on an average 215 seeds so that the seeds in the naturally intercrossed capsules to those in the selffertilised capsules were as 100 to 16 the interesting point in this case is that these plants which were unnaturally treated by being grown in pots in a hothouse under another hemisphere with a complete reversal of the seasons were thus rendered slightly selffertile whereas they seem always to be completely selfsterile in their native home  senecio cruentus greenhouse varieties commonly called cinerarias probably derived from several fruticose or herbaceous species much intercrossed 910 i am much obliged to mr moore and to mr thiselton dyer for giving me information with respect to the varieties on which i experimented mr moore believes that senecio cruentas tussilaginis and perhaps heritieri maderensis and populifolius have all been more or less blended together in our cinerarias  two purpleflowered varieties were placed under a net in the greenhouse and four corymbs on each were repeatedly brushed with flowers from the other plant so that their stigmas were well covered with each others pollen two of the eight corymbs thus treated produced very few seeds but the other six produced on an average 413 seeds per corymb and these germinated well the stigmas on four other corymbs on both plants were well smeared with pollen from the flowers on their own corymbs these eight corymbs produced altogether ten extremely poor seeds which proved incapable of germinating i examined many flowers on both plants and found the stigmas spontaneously covered with pollen but they produced not a single seed these plants were afterwards left uncovered in the same house where many other cinerarias were in flower and the flowers were frequently visited by bees they then produced plenty of seed but one of the two plants less than the other as this species shows some tendency to be dioecious  the trial was repeated on another variety with white petals tipped with red many stigmas on two corymbs were covered with pollen from the foregoing purple variety and these produced eleven and twentytwo seeds which germinated well a large number of the stigmas on several of the other corymbs were repeatedly smeared with pollen from their own corymb but they yielded only five very poor seeds which were incapable of germination therefore the above three plants belonging to two varieties though growing vigorously and fertile with pollen from either of the other two plants were utterly sterile with pollen from other flowers on the same plant  reseda odorata  having observed that certain individuals were selfsterile i covered during the summer of 1868 seven plants under separate nets and will call these plants a b c d e f g they all appeared to be quite sterile with their own pollen but fertile with that of any other plant  fourteen flowers on a were crossed with pollen from b or c and produced thirteen fine capsules sixteen flowers were fertilised with pollen from other flowers on the same plant but yielded not a single capsule  fourteen flowers on b were crossed with pollen from a c or d and all produced capsules some of these were not very fine yet they contained plenty of seeds eighteen flowers were fertilised with pollen from other flowers on the same plant and produced not one capsule  ten flowers on c were crossed with pollen from a b d or e and produced nine fine capsules nineteen flowers were fertilised with pollen from other flowers on the same plant and produced no capsules  ten flowers on d were crossed with pollen from a b c or e and produced nine fine capsules eighteen flowers were fertilised with pollen from other flowers on the same plant and produced no capsules  seven flowers on e were crossed with pollen from a c or d and all produced fine capsules eight flowers were fertilised with pollen from other flowers on the same plant and produced no capsules  on the plants f and g no flowers were crossed but very many number not recorded were fertilised with pollen from other flowers on the same plants and these did not produce a single capsule  we thus see that fiftyfive flowers on five of the above plants were reciprocally crossed in various ways several flowers on each of these plants being fertilised with pollen from several of the other plants these fiftyfive flowers produced fiftytwo capsules almost all of which were of full size and contained an abundance of seeds on the other hand seventynine flowers besides many others not recorded were fertilised with pollen from other flowers on the same plants and these did not produce a single capsule in one case in which i examined the stigmas of the flowers fertilised with their own pollen these were penetrated by the pollentubes although such penetration produced no effect pollen falls generally and i believe always from the anthers on the stigmas of the same flower yet only three out of the above seven protected plants produced spontaneously any capsules and these it might have been thought must have been selffertilised there were altogether seven such capsules but as they were all seated close to the artificially crossed flowers i can hardly doubt that a few grains of foreign pollen had accidentally fallen on their stigmas besides the above seven plants four others were kept covered under the same large net and some of these produced here and there in the most capricious manner little groups of capsules and this makes me believe that a bee many of which settled on the outside of the net being attracted by the odour had on some one occasion found an entrance and had intercrossed a few of the flowers  in the spring of 1869 four plants raised from fresh seeds were carefully protected under separate nets and now the result was widely different to what it was before three of these protected plants became actually loaded with capsules especially during the early part of the summer and this fact indicates that temperature produces some effect but the experiment given in the following paragraph shows that the innate constitution of the plant is a far more important element the fourth plant produced only a few capsules many of them of small size yet it was far more selffertile than any of the seven plants tried during the previous year the flowers on four small branches of this semiselfsterile plant were smeared with pollen from one of the other plants and they all produced fine capsules  as i was much surprised at the difference in the results of the trials made during the two previous years six fresh plants were protected by separate nets in the year 1870 two of these proved almost completely selfsterile for on carefully searching them i found only three small capsules each containing either one or two seeds of small size which however germinated a few flowers on both these plants were reciprocally fertilised with each others pollen and a few with pollen from one of the following selffertile plants and all these flowers produced fine capsules the four other plants whilst still remaining protected beneath the nets presented a wonderful contrast though one of them in a somewhat less degree than the others for they became actually covered with spontaneously selffertilised capsules as numerous as or very nearly so and as fine as those on the unprotected plants growing near  the above three spontaneously selffertilised capsules produced by the two almost completely selfsterile plants contained altogether five seeds and from these i raised in the following year 1871 five plants which were kept under separate nets they grew to an extraordinarily large size and on august 29th were examined at first sight they appeared entirely destitute of capsules but on carefully searching their many branches two or three capsules were found on three of the plants halfadozen on the fourth and about eighteen on the fifth plant but all these capsules were small some being empty the greater number contained only a single seed and very rarely more than one after this examination the nets were taken off and the bees immediately carried pollen from one of these almost selfsterile plants to the other for no other plants grew near after a few weeks the ends of the branches on all five plants became covered with capsules presenting a curious contrast with the lower and naked parts of the same long branches these five plants therefore inherited almost exactly the same sexual constitution as their parents and without doubt a selfsterile race of mignonette could have been easily established  reseda lutea  plants of this species were raised from seeds gathered from a group of wild plants growing at no great distance from my garden after casually observing that some of these plants were selfsterile two plants taken by hazard were protected under separate nets one of these soon became covered with spontaneously selffertilised capsules as numerous as those on the surrounding unprotected plants so that it was evidently quite selffertile the other plant was partially selfsterile producing very few capsules many of which were of small size when however this plant had grown tall the uppermost branches became pressed against the net and grew crooked and in this position the bees were able to suck the flowers through the meshes and brought pollen to them from the neighbouring plants these branches then became loaded with capsules the other and lower branches remaining almost bare the sexual constitution of this species is therefore similar to that of reseda odorata  concluding remarks on selfsterile plants  in order to favour as far as possible the selffertilisation of some of the foregoing plants all the flowers on reseda odorata and some of those on the abutilon were fertilised with pollen from other flowers on the same plant instead of with their own pollen and in the case of the senecio with pollen from other flowers on the same corymb but this made no difference in the result fritz muller tried both kinds of selffertilisation in the case of bignonia tabernaemontana and abutilon likewise with no difference in the result with eschscholtzia however he found that pollen from other flowers on the same plant was a little more effective than pollen from the same flower so did hildebrand in germany as thirteen out of fourteen flowers of eschscholtzia thus fertilised set capsules these containing on an average 95 seeds whereas only fourteen flowers out of twentyone fertilised with their own pollen set capsules these containing on an average 90 seeds 911 pringsheims jahrbuch fur wiss botanik 7 page 467 hildebrand found a trace of a similar difference with corydalis cava as did fritz muller with an oncidium 912 variation under domestication chapter 17 2nd edition volume 2 pages 113115  in considering the several cases above given of complete or almost complete selfsterility we are first struck with their wide distribution throughout the vegetable kingdom their number is not at present large for they can be discovered only by protecting plants from insects and then fertilising them with pollen from another plant of the same species and with their own pollen and the latter must be proved to be in an efficient state by other trials unless all this be done it is impossible to know whether their selfsterility may not be due to the male or female reproductive organs or to both having been affected by changed conditions of life as in the course of my experiments i have found three new cases and as fritz muller has observed indications of several others it is probable that they will hereafter be proved to be far from rare 913 mr wilder the editor of a horticultural journal in the united states quoted in gardeners chronicle 1868 page 1286 states that lilium auratum impatiens pallida and fulva and forsythia viridissima cannot be fertilised with their own pollen  as with plants of the same species and parentage some individuals are selfsterile and others selffertile of which fact reseda odorata offers the most striking instances it is not at all surprising that species of the same genus differ in this same manner thus verbascum phoeniceum and nigrum are selfsterile whilst v thapsus and lychnitis are quite selffertile as i know by trial there is the same difference between some of the species of papaver corydalis and of other genera nevertheless the tendency to selfsterility certainly runs to a certain extent in groups as we see in the genus passiflora and with the vandeae amongst orchids  selfsterility differs much in degree in different plants in those extraordinary cases in which pollen from the same flower acts on the stigma like a poison it is almost certain that the plants would never yield a single selffertilised seed other plants like corydalis cava occasionally though very rarely produce a few selffertilised seeds a large number of species as may be seen in table 9f are less fertile with their own pollen than with that from another plant and lastly some species are perfectly selffertile even with the individuals of the same species as just remarked some are utterly selfsterile others moderately so and some perfectly selffertile the cause whatever it may be which renders many plants more or less sterile with their own pollen that is when they are selffertilised must be different at least to a certain extent from that which determines the difference in height vigour and fertility of the seedlings raised from selffertilised and crossed seeds for we have already seen that the two classes of cases do not by any means run parallel this want of parallelism would be intelligible if it could be shown that selfsterility depended solely on the incapacity of the pollentubes to penetrate the stigma of the same flower deeply enough to reach the ovules whilst the greater or less vigorous growth of the seedlings no doubt depends on the nature of the contents of the pollengrains and ovules now it is certain that with some plants the stigmatic secretion does not properly excite the pollengrains so that the tubes are not properly developed if the pollen is taken from the same flower this is the case according to fritz muller with eschscholtzia for he found that the pollentubes did not penetrate the stigma deeply and with the orchidaceous genus notylia they failed altogether to penetrate it 914 botanische zeitung 1868 pages 114 115  with dimorphic and trimorphic species an illegitimate union between plants of the same form presents the closest analogy with selffertilisation whilst a legitimate union closely resembles crossfertilisation and here again the lessened fertility or complete sterility of an illegitimate union depends at least in part on the incapacity for interaction between the pollengrains and stigma thus with linum grandiflorum as i have elsewhere shown not more than two or three out of hundreds of pollengrains either of the longstyled or shortstyled form when placed on the stigma of their own form emit their tubes and these do not penetrate deeply nor does the stigma itself change colour as occurs when it is legitimately fertilised 915 journal of the linnean society botany volume 7 1863 pages 7375  on the other hand the difference in innate fertility as well as in growth between plants raised from crossed and selffertilised seeds and the difference in fertility and growth between the legitimate and illegitimate offspring of dimorphic and trimorphic plants must depend on some incompatibility between the sexual elements contained within the pollengrains and ovules as it is through their union that new organisms are developed  if we now turn to the more immediate cause of selfsterility we clearly see that in most cases it is determined by the conditions to which the plants have been subjected thus eschscholtzia is completely selfsterile in the hot climate of brazil but is perfectly fertile there with the pollen of any other individual the offspring of brazilian plants became in england in a single generation partially selffertile and still more so in the second generation conversely the offspring of english plants after growing for two seasons in brazil became in the first generation quite selfsterile again abutilon darwinii which is selfsterile in its native home of brazil became moderately selffertile in a single generation in an english hothouse some other plants are selfsterile during the early part of the year and later in the season become selffertile passiflora alata lost its selfsterility when grafted on another species with reseda however in which some individuals of the same parentage are selfsterile and others are selffertile we are forced in our ignorance to speak of the cause as due to spontaneous variability but we should remember that the progenitors of these plants either on the male or female side may have been exposed to somewhat different conditions the power of the environment thus to affect so readily and in so peculiar a manner the reproductive organs is a fact which has many important bearings and i have therefore thought the foregoing details worth giving for instance the sterility of many animals and plants under changed conditions of life such as confinement evidently comes within the same general principle of the sexual system being easily affected by the environment it has already been proved that a cross between plants which have been selffertilised or intercrossed during several generations having been kept all the time under closely similar conditions does not benefit the offspring and on the other hand that a cross between plants that have been subjected to different conditions benefits the offspring to an extraordinary degree we may therefore conclude that some degree of differentiation in the sexual system is necessary for the full fertility of the parentplants and for the full vigour of their offspring it seems also probable that with those plants which are capable of complete selffertilisation the male and female elements and organs already differ to an extent sufficient to excite their mutual interaction but that when such plants are taken to another country and become in consequence selfsterile their sexual elements and organs are so acted on as to be rendered too uniform for such interaction like those of a selffertilised plant long cultivated under the same conditions conversely we may further infer that plants which are selfsterile in their native country but become selffertile under changed conditions have their sexual elements so acted on that they become sufficiently differentiated for mutual interaction  we know that selffertilised seedlings are inferior in many respects to those from a cross and as with plants in a state of nature pollen from the same flower can hardly fail to be often left by insects or by the wind on the stigma it seems at first sight highly probable that selfsterility has been gradually acquired through natural selection in order to prevent selffertilisation it is no valid objection to this belief that the structure of some flowers and the dichogamous condition of many others suffice to prevent the pollen reaching the stigma of the same flower for we should remember that with most species many flowers expand at the same time and that pollen from the same plant is equally injurious or nearly so as that from the same flower nevertheless the belief that selfsterility is a quality which has been gradually acquired for the special purpose of preventing selffertilisation must i believe be rejected in the first place there is no close correspondence in degree between the sterility of the parentplants when selffertilised and the extent to which their offspring suffer in vigour by this process and some such correspondence might have been expected if selfsterility had been acquired on account of the injury caused by selffertilisation the fact of individuals of the same parentage differing greatly in their degree of selfsterility is likewise opposed to such a belief unless indeed we suppose that certain individuals have been rendered selfsterile to favour intercrossing whilst other individuals have been rendered selffertile to ensure the propagation of the species the fact of selfsterile individuals appearing only occasionally as in the case of lobelia does not countenance this latter view but the strongest argument against the belief that selfsterility has been acquired to prevent selffertilisation is the immediate and powerful effect of changed conditions in either causing or in removing selfsterility we are not therefore justified in admitting that this peculiar state of the reproductive system has been gradually acquired through natural selection but we must look at it as an incidental result dependent on the conditions to which the plants have been subjected like the ordinary sterility caused in the case of animals by confinement and in the case of plants by too much manure heat etc i do not however wish to maintain that selfsterility may not sometimes be of service to a plant in preventing selffertilisation but there are so many other means by which this result might be prevented or rendered difficult including as we shall see in the next chapter the prepotency of pollen from a distinct individual over a plants own pollen that selfsterility seems an almost superfluous acquirement for this purpose  finally the most interesting point in regard to selfsterile plants is the evidence which they afford of the advantage or rather of the necessity of some degree or kind of differentiation in the sexual elements in order that they should unite and give birth to a new being it was ascertained that the five plants of reseda odorata which were selected by chance could be perfectly fertilised by pollen taken from any one of them but not by their own pollen and a few additional trials were made with some other individuals which i have not thought worth recording so again hildebrand and fritz muller frequently speak of selfsterile plants being fertile with the pollen of any other individual and if there had been any exceptions to the rule these could hardly have escaped their observation and my own we may therefore confidently assert that a selfsterile plant can be fertilised by the pollen of any one out of a thousand or ten thousand individuals of the same species but not by its own now it is obviously impossible that the sexual organs and elements of every individual can have been specialised with respect to every other individual but there is no difficulty in believing that the sexual elements of each differ slightly in the same diversified manner as do their external characters and it has often been remarked that no two individuals are absolutely alike therefore we can hardly avoid the conclusion that differences of an analogous and indefinite nature in the reproductive system are sufficient to excite the mutual action of the sexual elements and that unless there be such differentiation fertility fails  the appearance of highly selffertile varieties  we have just seen that the degree to which flowers are capable of being fertilised with their own pollen differs much both with the species of the same genus and sometimes with the individuals of the same species some allied cases of the appearance of varieties which when selffertilised yield more seed and produce offspring growing taller than their selffertilised parents or than the intercrossed plants of the corresponding generation will now be considered  firstly in the third and fourth generations of mimulus luteus a tall variety often alluded to having large white flowers blotched with crimson appeared amongst both the intercrossed and selffertilised plants it prevailed in all the later selffertilised generations to the exclusion of every other variety and transmitted its characters faithfully but disappeared from the intercrossed plants owing no doubt to their characters being repeatedly blended by crossing the selffertilised plants belonging to this variety were not only taller but more fertile than the intercrossed plants though these latter in the earlier generations were much taller and more fertile than the selffertilised plants thus in the fifth generation the selffertilised plants were to the intercrossed in height as 126 to 100 in the sixth generation they were likewise much taller and finer plants but were not actually measured they produced capsules compared with those on the intercrossed plants in number as 147 to 100 and the selffertilised capsules contained a greater number of seeds in the seventh generation the selffertilised plants were to the crossed in height as 137 to 100 and twenty flowers on these selffertilised plants fertilised with their own pollen yielded nineteen very fine capsulesa degree of selfsterility which i have not seen equalled in any other case this variety seems to have become specially adapted to profit in every way by selffertilisation although this process was so injurious to the parentplants during the first four generations it should however be remembered that seedlings raised from this variety when crossed by a fresh stock were wonderfully superior in height and fertility to the selffertilised plants of the corresponding generation  secondly in the sixth selffertilised generation of ipomoea a single plant named the hero appeared which exceeded by a little in height its intercrossed opponenta case which had not occurred in any previous generation hero transmitted the peculiar colour of its flowers as well as its increased tallness and a high degree of selffertility to its children grandchildren and greatgrandchildren the selffertilised children of hero were in height to other selffertilised plants of the same stock as 100 to 85 ten selffertilised capsules produced by the grandchildren contained on an average 52 seeds and this is a higher average than was yielded in any other generation by the capsules of selffertilised flowers the greatgrandchildren of hero derived from a cross with a fresh stock were so unhealthy from having been grown at an unfavourable season that their average height in comparison with that of the selffertilised plants cannot be judged of with any safety but it did not appear that they had profited even by a cross of this kind  thirdly the plants of nicotiana on which i experimented appear to come under the present class of cases for they varied in their sexual constitution and were more or less highly selffertile they were probably the offspring of plants which had been spontaneously selffertilised under glass for several generations in this country the flowers on the parentplants which were first fertilised by me with their own pollen yielded half again as many seeds as did those which were crossed and the seedlings raised from these selffertilised seeds exceeded in height those raised from the crossed seeds to an extraordinary degree in the second and third generations although the selffertilised plants did not exceed the crossed in height yet their selffertilised flowers yielded on two occasions considerably more seeds than the crossed flowers even than those which were crossed with pollen from a distinct stock or variety  lastly as certain individual plants of reseda odorata and lutea are incomparably more selffertile than other individuals the former might be included under the present heading of the appearance of new and highly selffertile varieties but in this case we should have to look at these two species as normally selfsterile and this judging by my experience appears to be the correct view  we may therefore conclude from the facts now given that varieties sometimes arise which when selffertilised possess an increased power of producing seeds and of growing to a greater height than the intercrossed or selffertilised plants of the corresponding generationall the plants being of course subjected to the same conditions the appearance of such varieties is interesting as it bears on the existence under nature of plants which regularly fertilise themselves such as ophrys apifera and a few other orchids or as leersia oryzoides which produces an abundance of cleistogene flowers but most rarely flowers capable of crossfertilisation  some observations made on other plants lead me to suspect that selffertilisation is in some respects beneficial although the benefit thus derived is as a rule very small compared with that from a cross with a distinct plant thus we have seen in the last chapter that seedlings of ipomoea and mimulus raised from flowers fertilised with their own pollen which is the strictest possible form of selffertilisation were superior in height weight and in early flowering to the seedlings raised from flowers crossed with pollen from other flowers on the same plant and this superiority apparently was too strongly marked to be accidental again the cultivated varieties of the common pea are highly selffertile although they have been selffertilised for many generations and they exceeded in height seedlings from a cross between two plants belonging to the same variety in the ratio of 115 to 100 but then only four pairs of plants were measured and compared the selffertility of primula veris increased after several generations of illegitimate fertilisation which is a process closely analogous to selffertilisation but only as long as the plants were cultivated under the same favourable conditions i have also elsewhere shown that with primula veris and sinensis equalstyled varieties occasionally appear which possess the sexual organs of the two forms combined in the same flower 916 journal of the linnean society botany volume 10 1867 pages 417 419 consequently they fertilise themselves in a legitimate manner and are highly selffertile but the remarkable fact is that they are rather more fertile than ordinary plants of the same species legitimately fertilised by pollen from a distinct individual formerly it appeared to me probable that the increased fertility of these dimorphic plants might be accounted for by the stigma lying so close to the anthers that it was impregnated at the most favourable age and time of the day but this explanation is not applicable to the above given cases in which the flowers were artificially fertilised with their own pollen  considering the facts now adduced including the appearance of those varieties which are more fertile and taller than their parents and than the intercrossed plants of the corresponding generation it is difficult to avoid the suspicion that selffertilisation is in some respects advantageous though if this be really the case any such advantage is as a rule quite insignificant compared with that from a cross with a distinct plant and especially with one of a fresh stock should this suspicion be hereafter verified it would throw light as we shall see in the next chapter on the existence of plants bearing small and inconspicuous flowers which are rarely visited by insects and therefore are rarely intercrossed  relative weight and period of germination of seeds from crossed and selffertilised flowers  an equal number of seeds from flowers fertilised with pollen from another plant and from flowers fertilised with their own pollen were weighed but only in sixteen cases their relative weights are given in the following list that of the seeds from the crossed flowers being taken as 100  column 1 name of plant  column 2 x in the expression 100 to x  ipomoea purpurea parent plants 127 ipomoea purpurea third generation  87 salvia coccinea 100 brassica oleracea 103 iberis umbellata second generation 136 delphinium consolida  45 hibiscus africanus 105 tropaeolum minus 115

generations 102  it is remarkable that in ten out of these sixteen cases the selffertilised seeds were either superior or equal to the crossed in weight nevertheless in six out of the ten cases namely with ipomoea salvia brassica tropaeolum lathyrus and nemophila the plants raised from these selffertilised seeds were very inferior in height and in other respects to those raised from the crossed seeds the superiority in weight of the selffertilised seeds in at least six out of the ten cases namely with brassica hibiscus tropaeolum nemophila borago and canna may be accounted for in part by the selffertilised capsules containing fewer seeds for when a capsule contains only a few seeds these will be apt to be better nourished so as to be heavier than when many are contained in the same capsule it should however be observed that in some of the above cases in which the crossed seeds were the heaviest as with sarothamnus and cyclamen the crossed capsules contained a larger number of seeds whatever may be the explanation of the selffertilised seeds being often the heaviest it is remarkable in the case of brassica tropaeolum nemophila and of the first generation of ipomoea that the seedlings raised from them were inferior in height and in other respects to the seedlings raised from the crossed seeds this fact shows how superior in constitutional vigour the crossed seedlings must have been for it cannot be doubted that heavy and fine seeds tend to yield the finest plants mr galton has shown that this holds good with lathyrus odoratus as has mr aj wilson with the swedish turnip brassica campestris ruta baga mr wilson separated the largest and smallest seeds of this latter plant the ratio between the weights of the two lots being as 100 to 59 and he found that the seedlings from the larger seeds took the lead and maintained their superiority to the last both in height and thickness of stem 917 gardeners chronicle 1867 page 107 loiseleurdeslongchamp les cereales 1842 pages 208219 was led by his observations to the extraordinary conclusion that the smaller grains of cereals produce as fine plants as the large this conclusion is however contradicted by major hallets great success in improving wheat by the selection of the finest grains it is possible however that man by longcontinued selection may have given to the grains of the cereals a greater amount of starch or other matter than the seedlings can utilise for their growth there can be little doubt as humboldt long ago remarked that the grains of cereals have been rendered attractive to birds in a degree which is highly injurious to the species nor can this difference in the growth of the seedling turnips be attributed to the heavier seeds having been of crossed and the lighter of selffertilised origin for it is known that plants belonging to this genus are habitually intercrossed by insects  with respect to the relative period of germination of crossed and selffertilised seeds a record was kept in only twentyone cases and the results are very perplexing neglecting one case in which the two lots germinated simultaneously in ten cases or exactly onehalf many of the selffertilised seeds germinated before the crossed and in the other half many of the crossed before the selffertilised in four out of these twenty cases seeds derived from a cross with a fresh stock were compared with selffertilised seeds from one of the later selffertilised generations and here again in half the cases the crossed seeds and in the other half the selffertilised seeds germinated first yet the seedlings of mimulus raised from such selffertilised seeds were inferior in all respects to the crossed seedlings and in the case of eschscholtzia they were inferior in fertility unfortunately the relative weight of the two lots of seeds was ascertained in only a few instances in which their germination was observed but with ipomoea and i believe with some of the other species the relative lightness of the selffertilised seeds apparently determined their early germination probably owing to the smaller mass being favourable to the more rapid completion of the chemical and morphological changes necessary for germination on the other hand mr galton gave me seeds no doubt all selffertilised of lathyrus odoratus which were divided into two lots of heavier and lighter seeds and several of the former germinated first it is evident that many more observations are necessary before anything can be decided with respect to the relative period of germination of crossed and selffertilised seeds    chapter x  means of fertilisation  sterility and fertility of plants when insects are excluded the means by which flowers are crossfertilised structures favourable to selffertilisation relation between the structure and conspicuousness of flowers the visits of insects and the advantages of crossfertilisation the means by which flowers are fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant greater fertilising power of such pollen anemophilous species conversion of anemophilous species into entomophilous origin of nectar anemophilous plants generally have their sexes separated conversion of diclinous into hermaphrodite flowers trees often have their sexes separated  in the introductory chapter i briefly specified the various means by which crossfertilisation is favoured or ensured namely the separation of the sexesthe maturity of the male and female sexual elements at different periodsthe heterostyled or dimorphic and trimorphic condition of certain plantsmany mechanical contrivancesthe more or less complete inefficiency of a flowers own pollen on the stigmaand the prepotency of pollen from any other individual over that from the same plant some of these points require further consideration but for full details i must refer the reader to the several excellent works mentioned in the introduction i will in the first place give two lists the first of plants which are either quite sterile or produce less than about half the full complement of seeds when insects are excluded and a second list of plants which when thus treated are fully fertile or produce at least half the full complement of seeds these lists have been compiled from the several previous tables with some additional cases from my own observations and those of others the species are arranged nearly in the order followed by lindley in his vegetable kingdom the reader should observe that the sterility or fertility of the plants in these two lists depends on two wholly distinct causes namely the absence or presence of the proper means by which pollen is applied to the stigma and its less or greater efficiency when thus applied as it is obvious that with plants in which the sexes are separate pollen must be carried by some means from flower to flower such species are excluded from the lists as are likewise dimorphic and trimorphic plants in which the same necessity occurs to a limited extent experience has proved to me that independently of the exclusion of insects the seedbearing power of a plant is not lessened by covering it while in flower under a thin net supported on a frame and this might indeed have been inferred from the consideration of the two following lists as they include a considerable number of species belonging to the same genera some of which are quite sterile and others quite fertile when protected by a net from the access of insects  list of plants which when insects are excluded are either quite sterile or produce as far as i could judge less than half the number of seeds produced by unprotected plants  passiflora alata racemosa coerulea edulis laurifolia and some individuals of p quadrangularis passifloraceae are quite

produced seeds capable of germination only on one occasion  corydalis cava fumariaceaesterile see the previous discussion on selfsterile plants  corydalis solidai had a single plant in my garden 1863 and saw many hivebees sucking the flowers but not a single seed was produced i was much surprised at this fact as professor hildebrands discovery that c cava is sterile with its own pollen had not then been made he likewise concludes from the few experiments which he made on the present species that it is selfsterile the two foregoing cases are interesting because botanists formerly thought see for instance lecoq de la fecondation et de lhybridation 1845 page 61 and lindley vegetable kingdom 1853 page 436 that all the species of the fumariaceae were specially adapted for selffertilisation  corydalis luteaa coveredup plant produced 1861 exactly half as many capsules as an exposed plant of the same size growing close alongside when humblebees visit the flowers and i repeatedly saw them thus acting the lower petals suddenly spring downwards and the pistil upwards this is due to the elasticity of the parts which takes effect as soon as the coherent edges of the hood are separated by the entrance of an insect unless insects visit the flowers the parts do not move nevertheless many of the flowers on the plants which i had protected produced capsules notwithstanding that their petals and pistils still retained their original position and i found to my surprise that these capsules contained more seeds than those from flowers the petals of which had been artificially separated and allowed to spring apart thus nine capsules produced by undisturbed flowers contained fiftythree seeds whilst nine capsules from flowers the petals of which had been artificially separated contained only thirtytwo seeds but we should remember that if bees had been permitted to visit these flowers they would have visited them at the best time for fertilisation the flowers the petals of which had been artificially separated set their capsules before those which were left undisturbed under the net to show with what certainty the flowers are visited by bees i may add that on one occasion all the flowers on some unprotected plants were examined and every single one had its petals separated and on a second occasion fortyone out of fortythree flowers were in this state

nevertheless as the nectary contains much nectar especially in the evening i felt convinced that they were visited probably by moths the petals do not naturally separate or open in the least but they had been opened by some means in a certain proportion of the flowers in the same manner as follows when a thick bristle is pushed into the nectary so that in this respect they resemble the flowers of corydalis lutea thirtyfour heads each including many flowers were examined and twenty of them had from one to four flowers whilst fourteen had not a single flower thus opened it is therefore clear

accident the same number of genera namely fortynine the genera in the first list include sixtyfive species and those in the second sixty species the orchideae in both being excluded if the genera in this latter order as well as in the asclepiadae and apocynaceae had been included the number of species which are sterile if insects are excluded would have been greatly increased but the lists are confined to species which were actually experimented on the results can be considered as only approximately accurate for fertility is so variable a character that each species ought to have been tried many times the above number of species namely 125 is as nothing to the host of living plants but the mere fact of more than half of them being sterile within the specified degree when insects are excluded is a striking one for whenever pollen has to be carried from the anthers to the stigma in order to ensure full fertility there is at least a good chance of crossfertilisation i do not however believe that if all known plants were tried in the same manner half would be found to be sterile within the specified limits for many flowers were selected for experiment which presented some remarkable structure and such flowers often require insectaid thus out of the fortynine genera in the first list about thirtytwo have flowers which are asymmetrical or present some remarkable peculiarity whilst in the second list including species which are fully or moderately fertile when insects were excluded only about twentyone out of the fortynine are asymmetrical or present any remarkable peculiarity  means of crossfertilisation  the most important of all the means by which pollen is carried from the anthers to the stigma of the same flower or from flower to flower are insects belonging to the orders of hymenoptera lepidoptera and diptera and in some parts of the world birds 101 i will here give all the cases known to me of birds fertilising flowers in south brazil

may add that i often saw in chile a mimus with its head yellow with pollen from as i believe a cassia i have been assured that at the cape of good hope strelitzia is fertilised by the nectarinidae there can hardly be a doubt that many australian flowers are fertilised by the many honeysucking birds of that country mr wallace remarks address to the biological section british association 1876 that he has often observed the beaks and faces of the brushtongued lories of the moluccas covered with pollen in new zealand many specimens of the anthornis melanura had their heads coloured with pollen from the flowers of an endemic species of fuchsia potts transactions of the new zealand institute volume 3 1870 page 72 next in importance but in a quite subordinate degree is the wind and with some aquatic plants according to delpino currents of water the simple fact of the necessity in many cases of extraneous aid for the transport of the pollen and the many contrivances for this purpose render it highly probable that some great benefit is thus gained and this conclusion has now been firmly established by the proved superiority in growth vigour and fertility of plants of crossed parentage over those of selffertilised parentage but we should always keep in mind that two somewhat opposed ends have to be gained the first and more important one being the production of seeds by any means and the second crossfertilisation  the advantages derived from crossfertilisation throw a flood of light on most of the chief characters of flowers we can thus understand their large size and bright colours and in some cases the bright tints of the adjoining parts such as the peduncles bracteae etc by this means they are rendered conspicuous to insects on the same principle that almost every fruit which is devoured by birds presents a strong contrast in colour with the green foliage in order that it may be seen and its seeds freely disseminated with some flowers conspicuousness is gained at the expense even of the reproductive organs as with the rayflorets of many compositae the exterior flowers of hydrangea and the terminal flowers of the featherhyacinth or muscari there is also reason to believe and this was the opinion of sprengel that flowers differ in colour in accordance with the kinds of insects which frequent them  not only do the bright colours of flowers serve to attract insects but darkcoloured streaks and marks are often present which sprengel long ago maintained served as guides to the nectary these marks follow the veins in the petals or lie between them they may occur on only one or on all excepting one or more of the upper or lower petals or they may form a dark ring round the tubular part of the corolla or be confined to the lips of an irregular flower in the white varieties of many flowers such as of digitalis purpurea antirrhinum majus several species of dianthus phlox myosotis rhododendron pelargonium primula and petunia the marks generally persist whilst the rest of the corolla has become of a pure white but this may be due merely to their colour being more intense and thus less readily obliterated sprengels notion of the use of these marks as guides appeared to me for a long time fanciful for insects without such aid readily discover and bite holes through the nectary from the outside they also discover the minute nectarsecreting glands on the stipules and leaves of certain plants moreover some few plants such as certain poppies which are not nectariferous have guiding marks but we might perhaps expect that some few plants would retain traces of a former nectariferous condition on the other hand these marks are much more common on asymmetrical flowers the entrance into which would be apt to puzzle insects than on regular flowers sir j lubbock has also proved that bees readily distinguish colours and that they lose much time if the position of honey which they have once visited be in the least changed 102 british wild flowers in relation to insects 1875 page 44 the following case affords i think the best evidence that these marks have really been developed in correlation with the nectary the two upper petals of the common pelargonium are thus marked near their bases and i have repeatedly observed that when the flowers vary so as to become peloric or regular they lose their nectaries and at the same time the dark marks when the nectary is only partially aborted only one of the upper petals loses its mark therefore the nectary and these marks clearly stand in some sort of close relation to one another and the simplest view is that they were developed together for a special purpose the only conceivable one being that the marks serve as a guide to the nectary it is however evident from what has been already said that insects could discover the nectar without the aid of guiding marks they are of service to the plant only by aiding insects to visit and suck a greater number of flowers within a given time than would otherwise be possible and thus there will be a better chance of fertilisation by pollen brought from a distinct plant and this we know is of paramount importance  the odours emitted by flowers attract insects as i have observed in the case of plants covered by a muslin net nageli affixed artificial flowers to branches scenting some with essential oils and leaving others unscented and insects were attracted to the former in an unmistakable manner 103 enstehung etc der naturhist art 1865 page 23 not a few flowers are both conspicuous and odoriferous of all colours white is the prevailing one and of white flowers a considerably larger proportion smell sweetly than of any other colour namely 146 per cent of red only 82 per cent are odoriferous 104 the colours and odours of the flowers of 4200 species have been tabulated by landgrabe and by schubler and kohler i have not seen their original works but a very full abstract is given in loudons gardeners magazine volume 13 1837 page 367 the fact of a larger proportion of white flowers smelling sweetly may depend in part on those which are fertilised by moths requiring the double aid of conspicuousness in the dusk and of odour so great is the economy of nature that most flowers which are fertilised by crepuscular or nocturnal insects emit their odour chiefly or exclusively in the evening some flowers however which are highly odoriferous depend solely on this quality for their fertilisation such as the nightflowering stock hesperis and some species of daphne and these present the rare case of flowers which are fertilised by insects being obscurely coloured  the storage of a supply of nectar in a protected place is manifestly connected with the visits of insects so is the position which the stamens and pistils occupy either permanently or at the proper period through their own movements for when mature they invariably stand in the pathway leading to the nectary the shape of the nectary and of the adjoining parts are likewise related to the particular kinds of insects which habitually visit the flowers this has been well shown by hermann muller by his comparison of lowland species which are chiefly visited by bees with alpine species belonging to the same genera which are visited by butterflies 105 nature 1874 page 110 1875 page 190 1876 pages 210 289 flowers may also be adapted to certain kinds of insects by secreting nectar particularly attractive to them and unattractive to other kinds of which fact epipactis latifolia offers the most striking instance known to me as it is visited exclusively by wasps structures also exist such as the hairs within the corolla of the fox glove digitalis which apparently serve to exclude insects that are not well fitted to bring pollen from one flower to another 106 belt the naturalist in nicaragua 1874 page 132 i need say nothing here of the endless contrivances such as the viscid glands attached to the pollenmasses of the orchideae and asclepiadae or the viscid or roughened state of the pollengrains of many plants or the irritability of their stamens which move when touched by insects etcas all these contrivances evidently favour or ensure crossfertilisation  all ordinary flowers are so far open that insects can force an entrance into them notwithstanding that some like the snapdragon antirrhinum various papilionaceous and fumariaceous flowers are in appearance closed it cannot be maintained that their openness is necessary for fertility as cleistogene flowers which are permanently closed yield a full complement of seeds pollen contains much nitrogen and phosphorusthe two most precious of all the elements for the growth of plantsbut in the case of most open flowers a large quantity of pollen is consumed by pollendevouring insects and a large quantity is destroyed during longcontinued rain with many plants this latter evil is guarded against as far as is possible by the anthers opening only during dry weather 107 mr blackley observed that the ripe anthers of rye did not dehisce whilst kept under a bellglass in a damp atmosphere whilst other anthers exposed to the same temperature in the open air dehisced freely he also found much more pollen adhering to the sticky slides which were attached to kites and sent high up in the atmosphere during the first fine and dry days after wet weather than at other times experimental researches on hay fever 1873 page 127by the position and form of some or all of the petalsby the presence of hairs etc and as kerner has shown in his interesting essay by the movements of the petals or of the whole flower during cold and wet weather 108 die schutzmittel des pollens 1873 in order to compensate the loss of pollen in so many ways the anthers produce a far larger amount than is necessary for the fertilisation of the same flower i know this from my own experiments on ipomoea given in the introduction and it is still more plainly shown by the astonishingly small quantity produced by cleistogene flowers which lose none of their pollen in comparison with that produced by the open flowers borne by the same plants and yet this small quantity suffices for the fertilisation of all their numerous seeds mr hassall took pains in estimating the number of pollengrains produced by a flower of the dandelion leontodon and found the number to be 243600 and in a paeony 3654000 grains 109 annals and magazine of natural history volume 8 1842 page 108 the editor of the botanical register counted the ovules in the flowers of wistaria sinensis and carefully estimated the number of pollengrains and he found that for each ovule there were 7000 grains 1010 quoted in gardeners chronicle 1846 page 771 with mirabilis three or four of the very large pollengrains are sufficient to fertilise an ovule but i do not know how many grains a flower produces with hibiscus kolreuter found that sixty grains were necessary to fertilise all the ovules of a flower and he calculated that 4863 grains were produced by a single flower or eightyone times too many with geum urbanum however according to gartner the pollen is only ten times too much 1011 kolreuter vorlaufige nachricht 1761 page 9 gartner beitrage zur kenntniss etc page 346 as we thus see that the open state of all ordinary flowers and the consequent loss of much pollen necessitate the development of so prodigious an excess of this precious substance why it may be asked are flowers always left open as many plants exist throughout the vegetable kingdom which bear cleistogene flowers there can hardly be a doubt that all open flowers might easily have been converted into closed ones the graduated steps by which this process could have been effected may be seen at the present time in lathyrus nissolia biophytum sensitivum and several other plants the answer to the above question obviously is that with permanently closed flowers there could be no crossfertilisation  the frequency almost regularity with which pollen is transported by insects from flower to flower often from a considerable distance well deserves attention 1012 an experiment made by kolreuter forsetsung etc 1763 page 69 affords good evidence on this head hibiscus vesicarius is strongly dichogamous its pollen being shed before the stigmas are mature kolreuter marked 310 flowers and put pollen from other flowers on their stigmas every day so that they were thoroughly fertilised and he left the same number of other flowers to the agency of insects afterwards he counted the seeds of both lots the flowers which he had fertilised with such astonishing care produced 11237 seeds whilst those left to the insects produced 10886 that is a less number by only 351 and this small inferiority is fully accounted for by the insects not having worked during some days when the weather was cold with continued rain this is best shown by the impossibility in many cases of raising two varieties of the same species pure if they grow at all near together but to this subject i shall presently return also by the many cases of hybrids which have appeared spontaneously both in gardens and a state of nature with respect to the distance from which pollen is often brought no one who has had any experience would expect to obtain pure cabbageseed for instance if a plant of another variety grew within two or three hundred yards an accurate observer the late mr masters of canterbury assured me that he once had his whole stock of seeds seriously affected with purple bastards by some plants of purple kale which flowered in a cottagers garden at the distance of half a mile no other plant of this variety growing any nearer 1013 mr wc marshall caught no less than seven specimens of a moth cucullia umbratica with the pollinia of the butterflyorchis habenaria chlorantha sticking to their eyes and therefore in the proper position for fertilising the flowers of this species on an island in derwentwater at the distance of half a mile from any place where this plant grew nature 1872 page 393 but the most striking case which has been recorded is that by m godron who shows by the nature of the hybrids produced that primula grandiflora must have been crossed with pollen brought by bees from p officinalis growing at the distance of above two kilometres or of about one english mile and a quarter 1014 revue des sc nat 1875 page 331  all those who have long attended to hybridisation insist in the strongest terms on the liability of castrated flowers to be fertilised by pollen brought from distant plants of the same species 1015 see for instance the remarks by herbert amaryllidaceae 1837 page 349 also gartners strong expressions on this subject in his bastarderzeugung 1849 page 670 and kenntniss der befruchtung 1844 pages 510 573 also lecoq de la fecondation etc 1845 page 27 some statements have been published during late years of the extraordinary tendency of hybrid plants to revert to their parent forms but as it is not said how the flowers were protected from insects it may be suspected that they were often fertilised with pollen brought from a distance from the parentspecies the following case shows this in the clearest manner gartner before he had gained much experience castrated and fertilised 520 flowers on various species with pollen of other genera or other species but left them unprotected for as he says he thought it a laughable idea that pollen should be brought from flowers of the same species none of which grew nearer than between 500 and 600 yards 1016 kenntniss der befruchtung pages 539 550 575 576 the result was that 289 of these 520 flowers yielded no seed or none that germinated the seed of 29 flowers produced hybrids such as might have been expected from the nature of the pollen employed and lastly the seed of the remaining 202 flowers produced perfectly pure plants so that these flowers must have been fertilised by pollen brought by insects from a distance of between 500 and 600 yards 1017 henschels experiments quoted by gartner kenntniss etc page 574 which are worthless in all other respects likewise show how largely flowers are intercrossed by insects he castrated many flowers on thirtyseven species belonging to twentytwo genera and put on their stigmas either no pollen or pollen from distinct genera yet they all seeded and all the seedlings raised from them were of course pure it is of course possible that some of these 202 flowers might have been fertilised by pollen left accidentally in them when they were castrated but to show how improbable this is i may add that gartner during the next eighteen years castrated no less than 8042 flowers and hybridised them in a closed room and the seeds from only seventy of these that is considerably less than 1 per cent produced pure or unhybridised offspring 1018 kenntniss etc pages 555 576  from the various facts now given it is evident that most flowers are adapted in an admirable manner for crossfertilisation nevertheless the greater number likewise present structures which are manifestly adapted though not in so striking a manner for selffertilisation the chief of these is their hermaphrodite condition that is their including within the same corolla both the male and female reproductive organs these often stand close together and are mature at the same time so that pollen from the same flower cannot fail to be deposited at the proper period on the stigma there are also various details of structure adapted for selffertilisation 1019 hermann muller die befruchtung etc page 448 such structures are best shown in those curious cases discovered by hermann muller in which a species exists under two formsone bearing conspicuous flowers fitted for crossfertilisation and the other smaller flowers fitted for selffertilisation with many parts in the latter slightly modified for this special purpose 1020 nature 1873 pages 44 433  as two objects in most respects opposed namely crossfertilisation and selffertilisation have in many cases to be gained we can understand the coexistence in so many flowers of structures which appear at first sight unnecessarily complex and of an opposed nature we can thus understand the great contrast in structure between cleistogene flowers which are adapted exclusively for selffertilisation and ordinary flowers on the same plant which are adapted so as to allow of at least occasional crossfertilisation 1021 fritz muller has discovered in the animal kingdom jenaische zeitschr b 4 page 451 a case curiously analogous to that of the plants which bear cleistogene and perfect flowers he finds in the nests of termites in brazil males and females with imperfect wings which do not leave the nests and propagate the species in a cleistogene manner but only if a fullydeveloped queen after swarming does not enter the old nest the fullydeveloped males and females are winged and individuals from distinct nests can hardly fail often to intercross in the act of swarming they are destroyed in almost infinite numbers by a host of enemies so that a queen may often fail to enter an old nest and then the imperfectly developed males and females propagate and keep up the stock the former are always minute completely closed with their petals more or less rudimentary and never brightly coloured they never secrete nectar never are odoriferous have very small anthers which produce only a few grains of pollen and their stigmas are but little developed bearing in mind that some flowers are crossfertilised by the wind called anemophilous by delpino and others by insects called entomophilous we can further understand as was pointed out by me several years ago the great contrast in appearance between these two classes of flowers 1022 journal of the linnean society volume 7 botany 1863 page 77 anemophilous flowers resemble in many respects cleistogene flowers but differ widely in not being closed in producing an extraordinary amount of pollen which is always incoherent and in the stigma often being largely developed or plumose we certainly owe the beauty and odour of our flowers and the storage of a large supply of honey to the existence of insects  on the relation between the structure and conspicuousness of flowers the visits of insects and the advantages of crossfertilisation  it has already been shown that there is no close relation between the number of seeds produced by flowers when crossed and selffertilised and the degree to which their offspring are aaffected by the two processes i have also given reasons for believing that the inefficiency of a plants own pollen is in most cases an incidental result or has not been specially acquired for the sake of preventing selffertilisation on the other hand there can hardly be a doubt that dichogamy which prevails according to hildebrand in the greater number of species 1023 die geschlecter vertheiling etc page 32that the heterostyled condition of certain plantsand that many mechanical structureshave all been acquired so as both to check selffertilisation and to favour crossfertilisation the means for favouring crossfertilisation must have been acquired before those which prevent selffertilisation as it would manifestly be injurious to a plant that its stigma should fail to receive its own pollen unless it had already become well adapted for receiving pollen from another individual it should be observed that many plants still possess a high power of selffertilisation although their flowers are excellently constructed for crossfertilisationfor instance those of many papilionaceous species  it may be admitted as almost certain that some structures such as a narrow elongated nectary or a long tubular corolla have been developed in order that certain kinds of insects alone should obtain the nectar these insects would thus find a store of nectar preserved from the attacks of other insects and they would thus be led to visit frequently such flowers and to carry pollen from one to the other 1024 see the interesting discussion on this subject by hermann muller die befruchtung etc page 431 it might perhaps have been expected that plants having their flowers thus peculiarly constructed would profit in a greater degree by being crossed than ordinary or simple flowers but this does not seem to hold good thus tropaeolum minus has a long nectary and an irregular corolla whilst limnanthes douglasii has a regular flower and no proper nectary yet the crossed seedlings of both species are to the selffertilised in height as 100 to 79 salvia coccinea has an irregular corolla with a curious apparatus by which insects depress the stamens while the flowers of ipomoea are regular and the crossed seedlings of the former are in height to the selffertilised as 100 to 76 whilst those of the ipomoea are as 100 to 77 fagopyrum is dimorphic and anagallis collina is nondimorphic and the crossed seedlings of both are in height to the selffertilised as 100 to 69  with all european plants excepting the comparatively rare anemophilous kinds the possibility of distinct individuals intercrossing depends on the visits of insects and hermann muller has proved by his valuable observations that large conspicuous flowers are visited much more frequently and by many more kinds of insects than are small inconspicuous flowers he further remarks that the flowers which are rarely visited must be capable of selffertilisation otherwise they would quickly become extinct 1025 die befruchtung etc page 426 nature 1873 page 433 there is however some liability to error in forming a judgment on this head from the extreme difficulty of ascertaining whether flowers which are rarely or never visited during the day as in the above given case of fumaria capreolata are not visited by small nocturnal lepidoptera which are known to be strongly attracted by sugar 1026 in answer to a question by me the editor of an entomological journal writesthe depressariae as is notorious to every collector of noctuae come very freely to sugar and no doubt naturally visit flowers the entomologists weekly intelligencer 1860 page 103 the two lists given in the early part of this chapter support mullers conclusion that small and inconspicuous flowers are completely selffertile for only eight or nine out of the 125 species in the two lists come under this head and all of these were proved to be highly fertile when insects were excluded the singularly inconspicuous flowers of the fly ophrys o muscifera as i have elsewhere shown are rarely visited by insects and it is a strange instance of imperfection in contradiction to the above rule that these flowers are not selffertile so that a large proportion of them do not produce seeds the converse of the rule that plants bearing small and inconspicuous flowers are selffertile namely that plants with large and conspicuous flowers are selfsterile is far from true as may be seen in our second list of spontaneously selffertile species for this list includes such species as ipomoea purpurea adonis aestivalis verbascum thapsus pisum sativum lathyrus odoratus some species of papaver and of nymphaea and others  the rarity of the visits of insects to small flowers does not depend altogether on their inconspicuousness but likewise on the absence of some sufficient attraction for the flowers of trifolium arvense are extremely small yet are incessantly visited by hive and humblebees as are the small and dingy flowers of the asparagus the flowers of linaria cymbalaria are small and not very conspicuous yet at the proper time they are freely visited by hivebees i may add that according to mr bennett there is another and quite distinct class of plants which cannot be much frequented by insects as they flower either exclusively or often during the winter and these seem adapted for selffertilisation as they shed their pollen before the flowers expand 1027 nature 1869 page 11  that many flowers have been rendered conspicuous for the sake of guiding insects to them is highly probable or almost certain but it may be asked have other flowers been rendered inconspicuous so that they may not be frequently visited or have they merely retained a former and primitive condition if a plant were much reduced in size so probably would be the flowers through correlated growth and this may possibly account for some cases but the size and colour of the corolla are both extremely variable characters and it can hardly be doubted that if large and brightlycoloured flowers were advantageous to any species these could be acquired through natural selection within a moderate lapse of time as indeed we see with most alpine plants papilionaceous flowers are manifestly constructed in relation to the visits of insects and it seems improbable from the usual character of the group that the progenitors of the genera vicia and trifolium produced such minute and unattractive flowers as those of v hirsuta and t procumbens we are thus led to infer that some plants either have not had their flowers increased in size or have actually had them reduced and purposely rendered inconspicuous so that they are now but little visited by insects in either case they must also have acquired or retained a high degree of selffertility  if it became from any cause advantageous to a species to have its capacity for selffertilisation increased there is little difficulty in believing that this could readily be effected for three cases of plants varying in such a manner as to be more fertile with their own pollen than they originally were occurred in the course of my few experiments namely with mimulus ipomoea and nicotiana nor is there any reason to doubt that many kinds of plants are capable under favourable circumstances of propagating themselves for very many generations by selffertilisation this is the case with the varieties of pisum sativum and of lathyrus odoratus which are cultivated in england and with ophrys apifera and some other plants in a state of nature nevertheless most or all of these plants retain structures in an efficient state which cannot be of the least use excepting for crossfertilisation we have also seen reason to suspect that selffertilisation is in some peculiar manner beneficial to certain plants but if this be really the case the benefit thus derived is far more than counterbalanced by a cross with a fresh stock or with a slightly different variety  notwithstanding the several considerations just advanced it seems to me highly improbable that plants bearing small and inconspicuous flowers have been or should continue to be subjected to selffertilisation for a long series of generations i think so not from the evil which manifestly follows from selffertilisation in many cases even in the first generation as with viola tricolor sarothamnus nemophila cyclamen etc nor from the probability of the evil increasing after several generations for on this latter head i have not sufficient evidence owing to the manner in which my experiments were conducted but if plants bearing small and inconspicuous flowers were not occasionally intercrossed and did not profit by the process all their flowers would probably have been rendered cleistogene as they would thus have largely benefited by having to produce only a small quantity of safelyprotected pollen in coming to this conclusion i have been guided by the frequency with which plants belonging to distinct orders have been rendered cleistogene but i can hear of no instance of a species with all its flowers rendered permanently cleistogene leersia makes the nearest approach to this state but as already stated it has been known to produce perfect flowers in one part of germany some other plants of the cleistogene class for instance aspicarpa have failed to produce perfect flowers during several years in a hothouse but it does not follow that they would fail to do so in their native country any more than with vandellia which with me produced only cleistogene flowers during certain years plants belonging to this class commonly bear both kinds of flowers every season and the perfect flowers of viola canina yield fine capsules but only when visited by bees we have also seen that the seedlings of ononis minutissima raised from the perfect flowers fertilised with pollen from another plant were finer than those from selffertilised flowers and this was likewise the case to a certain extent with vandellia as therefore no species which at one time bore small and inconspicuous flowers has had all its flowers rendered cleistogene i must believe that plants now bearing small and inconspicuous flowers profit by their still remaining open so as to be occasionally intercrossed by insects it has been one of the greatest oversights in my work that i did not experimentise on such flowers owing to the difficulty of fertilising them and to my not having seen the importance of the subject 1028 some of the species of solanum would be good ones for such experiments for they are said by hermann muller befruchtung page 434 to be unattractive to insects from not secreting nectar not producing much pollen and not being very conspicuous hence probably it is that according to verlot production des varieties 1865 page 72 the varieties of les aubergines et les tomates species of solanum do not intercross when they are cultivated near together but it should be remembered that these are not endemic species on the other hand the flowers of the common potato s tuberosum though they do not secrete nectar kurr bedeutung der nektarien 1833 page 40 yet cannot be considered as inconspicuous and they are sometimes visited by diptera muller and as i have seen by humblebees tinzmann as quoted in gardeners chronicle 1846 page 183 found that some of the varieties did not bear seed when fertilised with pollen from the same variety but were fertile with that from another variety  it should be remembered that in two of the cases in which highly selffertile varieties appeared amongst my experimental plants namely with mimulus and nicotiana such varieties were greatly benefited by a cross with a fresh stock or with a slightly different variety and this likewise was the case with the cultivated varieties of pisum sativum and lathyrus odoratus which have been long propagated by selffertilisation therefore until the contrary is distinctly proved i must believe that as a general rule small and inconspicuous flowers are occasionally intercrossed by insects and that after longcontinued selffertilisation if they are crossed with pollen brought from a plant growing under somewhat different conditions or descended from one thus growing their offspring would profit greatly it cannot be admitted under our present state of knowledge that selffertilisation continued during many successive generations is ever the most beneficial method of reproduction  the means which favour or ensure flowers being fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant  we have seen in four cases that seedlings raised from a cross between flowers on the same plant even on plants appearing distinct from having been propagated by stolons or cuttings were not superior to seedlings from selffertilised flowers and in a fifth case digitalis superior only in a slight degree therefore we might expect that with plants growing in a state of nature a cross between the flowers on distinct individuals and not merely between the flowers on the same plant would generally or often be effected by some means the fact of bees and of some diptera visiting the flowers of the same species as long as they can instead of promiscuously visiting various species favours the intercrossing of distinct plants on the other hand insects usually search a large number of flowers on the same plant before they fly to another and this is opposed to crossfertilisation the extraordinary number of flowers which bees are able to search within a very short space of time as will be shown in a future chapter increases the chance of crossfertilisation as does the fact that they are not able to perceive without entering a flower whether other bees have exhausted the nectar for instance hermann muller found that fourfifths of the flowers of lamium album which a humblebee visited had been already exhausted of their nectar 1029 die befruchtung etc page 311 in order that distinct plants should be intercrossed it is of course indispensable that two or more individuals should grow near one another and this is generally the case thus a de candolle remarks that in ascending a mountain the individuals of the same species do not commonly disappear near its upper limit quite gradually but rather abruptly this fact can hardly be explained by the nature of the conditions as these graduate away in an insensible manner and it probably depends in large part on vigorous seedlings being produced only as high up the mountain as many individuals can subsist together  with respect to dioecious plants distinct individuals must always fertilise each other with monoecious plants as pollen has to be carried from flower to flower there will always be a good chance of its being carried from plant to plant delpino has also observed the curious fact that certain individuals of the monoecious walnut juglans regia are proterandrous and others proterogynous and these will reciprocally fertilise each other 1030 ult osservazioni etc part 2 fasc 2 page 337 so it is with the common nut corylus avellana 1031 nature 1875 page 26 and what is more surprising with some few hermaphrodite plants as observed by hermann muller 1032 die befruchtung etc pages 285 339 these latter plants cannot fail to act on each other like dimorphic or trimorphic species in which the union of two individuals is necessary for full and normal fertility with ordinary hermaphrodite species the expansion of only a few flowers at the same time is one of the simplest means for favouring the intercrossing of distinct individuals but this would render the plants less conspicuous to insects unless the flowers were of large size as in the case of several bulbous plants kerner thinks that it is for this object that the australian villarsia parnassifolia produces daily only a single flower 1033 die schutzmittel etc page 23 mr cheeseman also remarks that as certain orchids in new zealand which require insectaid for their fertilisation bear only a single flower distinct plants cannot fail to intercross 1034 transactions of the new zealand institute volume 5 1873 page 356  dichogamy which prevails so extensively throughout the vegetable kingdom much increases the chance of distinct individuals intercrossing with proterandrous species which are far more ccommon than proterogynous the young flowers are exclusively male in function and the older ones exclusively female and as bees habitually alight low down on the spikes of flowers in order to crawl upwards they get dusted with pollen from the uppermost flowers which they carry to the stigmas of the lower and older flowers on the next spike which they visit the degree to which distinct plants will thus be intercrossed depends on the number of spikes in full flower at the same time on the same plant with proterogynous flowers and with depending racemes the manner in which insects visit the flowers ought to be reversed in order that distinct plants should be intercrossed but this whole subject requires further investigation as the great importance of crosses between distinct individuals instead of merely between distinct flowers has hitherto been hardly recognised  in some few cases the special movements of certain organs almost ensure pollen being carried from plant to plant thus with many orchids the pollenmasses after becoming attached to the head or proboscis of an insect do not move into the proper position for striking the stigma until ample time has elapsed for the insect to fly to another plant with spiranthes autumnalis the pollenmasses cannot be applied to the stigma until the labellum and rostellum have moved apart and this movement is very slow 1035 the various contrivances by which british and foreign orchids are fertilised first edition page 128 with posoqueria fragrans one of the rubiaceae the same end is gained by the movement of a specially constructed stamen as described by fritz muller  we now come to a far more general and therefore more important means by which the mutual fertilisation of distinct plants is effected namely the fertilising power of pollen from another variety or individual being greater than that of a plants own pollen the simplest and best known case of prepotent action in pollen though it does not bear directly on our present subject is that of a plants own pollen over that from a distinct species if pollen from a distinct species be placed on the stigma of a castrated flower and then after the interval of several hours pollen from the same species be placed on the stigma the effects of the former are wholly obliterated excepting in some rare cases if two varieties are treated in the same manner the result is analogous though of directly opposite nature for pollen from any other variety is often or generally prepotent over that from the same flower i will give some instances the pollen of mimulus luteus regularly falls on the stigma of its own flower for the plant is highly fertile when insects are excluded now several flowers on a remarkably constant whitish variety were fertilised without being castrated with pollen from a yellowish variety and of the twentyeight seedlings thus raised every one bore yellowish flowers so that the pollen of the yellow variety completely overwhelmed that of the motherplant again iberis umbellata is spontaneously selffertile and i saw an abundance of pollen from their own flowers on the stigmas nevertheless of thirty seedlings raised from noncastrated fflowers of a crimson variety crossed with pollen from a pink variety twentyfour bore pink flowers like those of the male or pollenbearing parent  in these two cases flowers were fertilised with pollen from a distinct variety and this was shown to be prepotent by the character of the offspring nearly similar results often follow when two or more selffertile varieties are allowed to grow near one another and are visited by insects the common cabbage produces a large number of flowers on the same stalk and when insects are excluded these set many capsules moderately rich in seeds i planted a white kohlrabi a purple kohlrabi a portsmouth broccoli a brussels sprout and a sugarloaf cabbage near together and left them uncovered seeds collected from each kind were sown in separate beds and the majority of the seedlings in all five beds were mongrelised in the most complicated manner some taking more after one variety and some after another the effects of the kohlrabi were particularly plain in the enlarged stems of many of the seedlings altogether 233 plants were raised of which 155 were mongrelised in the plainest manner and of the remaining 78 not half were absolutely pure i repeated the experiment by planting near together two varieties of cabbage with purplegreen and whitegreen lacinated leaves and of the 325 seedlings raised from the purplegreen variety 165 had whitegreen and 160 purplegreen leaves of the 466 seedlings raised from the whitegreen variety 220 had purplegreen and 246 whitegreen leaves these cases show how largely pollen from a neighbouring variety of the cabbage effaces the action of the plants own pollen we should bear in mind that pollen must be carried by the bees from flower to flower on the same large branching stem much more abundantly than from plant to plant and in the case of plants the flowers of which are in some degree dichogamous those on the same stem would be of different ages and would thus be as ready for mutual fertilisation as the flowers on distinct plants were it not for the prepotency of pollen from another variety 1036 a writer in the gardeners chronicle 1855 page 730 says that he planted a bed of turnips brassica rapa and of rape b napus close together and sowed the seeds of the former the result was that scarcely one seedling was true to its kind and several closely resembled rape  several varieties of the radish raphanus sativus which is moderately selffertile when insects are excluded were in flower at the same time in my garden seed was collected from one of them and out of twentytwo seedlings thus raised only twelve were true to their kind 1037 duhamel as quoted by godron de lespece tome 2 page 50 makes an analogous statement with respect to this plant  the onion produces a large number of flowers all crowded together into a large globular head each flower having six stamens so that the stigmas receive plenty of pollen from their own and the adjoining anthers consequently the plant is fairly selffertile when protected from insects a bloodred silver globe and spanish onion were planted near together and seedlings were raised from each kind in four separate beds in all the beds mongrels of various kinds were numerous except amongst the ten seedlings from the bloodred onion which included only two altogether fortysix seedlings were raised of which thirtyone had been plainly crossed  a similar result is known to follow with the varieties of many other plants if allowed to flower near together i refer here only to species which are capable of fertilising themselves for if this be not the case they would of course be liable to be crossed by any other variety growing near horticulturists do not commonly distinguish between the effects of variability and intercrossing but i have collected evidence on the natural crossing of varieties of the tulip hyacinth anemone ranunculus strawberry leptosiphon androsaceus orange rhododendron and rhubarb all of which plants i believe to be selffertile 1038 with respect to tulips and some other flowers see godron de lespece tome 1 page 252 for anemones gardeners chronicle 1859 page 98 for strawberries see herbert in transactions of the horticultural society volume 4 page 17 the same observer elsewhere speaks of the spontaneous crossing of rhododendrons gallesio makes the same statement with respect to oranges i have myself known extensive crossing to occur with the common rhubarb for leptosiphon verlot des varieties 1865 page 20 i have not included in my list the carnation nemophila or antirrhinum the varieties of which are known to cross freely because these plants are not always selffertile i know nothing about the selffertility of trollius lecoq de la fecondation 1862 page 93 mahonia and crinum in which genera the species intercross largely with respect to mahonia it is now scarcely possible to procure in this country pure specimens of m aquifolium or repens and the various species of crinum sent by herbert amaryllidaceae page 32 to calcutta crossed there so freely that pure seed could not be saved much other indirect evidence could be given with respect to the extent to which varieties of the same species spontaneously intercross  gardeners who raise seed for sale are compelled by dearly bought experience to take extraordinary precautions against intercrossing thus messrs sharp have land engaged in the growth of seed in no less than eight parishes the mere fact of a vast number of plants belonging to the same variety growing together is a considerable protection as the chances are strong in favour of plants of the same variety intercrossing and it is in chief part owing to this circumstance that certain villages have become famous for pure seed of particular varieties 1039 with respect to messrs sharp see gardeners chronicle 1856 page 823 lindleys theory of horticulture page 319 only two trials were made by me to ascertain after how long an interval of time pollen from a distinct variety would obliterate more or less completely the action of a plants own pollen the stigmas in two lately expanded flowers on a variety of cabbage called ragged jack were well covered with pollen from the same plant after an interval of twentythree hours pollen from the early barnes cabbage growing at a distance was placed on both stigmas and as the plant was left uncovered pollen from other flowers on the ragged jack would certainly have been left by the bees during the next two or three days on the same two stigmas under these circumstances it seemed very unlikely that the pollen of the barnes cabbage would produce any effect but three out of the fifteen plants raised from the two capsules thus produced were plainly mongrelised and i have no doubt that the twelve other plants were affected for they grew much more vigorously than the selffertilised seedlings from the ragged jack planted at the same time and under the same conditions secondly i placed on several stigmas of a longstyled cowslip primula veris plenty of pollen from the same plant and after twentyfour hours added some from a shortstyled darkred polyanthus which is a variety of the cowslip from the flowers thus treated thirty seedlings were raised and all these without exception bore reddish flowers so that the effect of the plants own pollen though placed on the stigmas twentyfour hours previously was quite destroyed by that of the red variety it should however be observed that these plants are dimorphic and that the second union was a legitimate one whilst the first was illegitimate but flowers illegitimately fertilised with their own pollen yield a moderately fair supply of seeds  we have hitherto considered only the prepotent fertilising power of pollen from a distinct variety over a plants own pollenboth kinds of pollen being placed on the same stigma it is a much more remarkable fact that pollen from another individual of the same variety is prepotent over a plants own pollen as shown by the superiority of the seedlings raised from a cross of this kind over seedlings from selffertilised flowers thus in tables 7a b and c there are at least fifteen species which are selffertile when insects are excluded and this implies that their stigmas must receive their own pollen nevertheless most of the seedlings which were raised by fertilising the noncastrated flowers of these fifteen species with pollen from another plant were greatly superior in height weight and fertility to the selffertilised offspring 1040 these fifteen species consist of brassica oleracea reseda odorata and lutea limnanthes douglasii papaver vagum viscaria oculata beta vulgaris lupinus luteus ipomoea purpurea mimulus luteus calceolaria verbascum thapsus vandellia nummularifolia lactuca sativa and zea mays for instance with ipomoea purpurea every single intercrossed plant exceeded in height its selffertilised opponent until the sixth generation and so it was with mimulus luteus until the fourth generation out of six pairs of crossed and selffertilised cabbages every one of the former was much heavier than the latter with papaver vagum out of fifteen pairs all but two of the crossed plants were taller than their selffertilised opponents of eight pairs of lupinus luteus all but two of the crossed were taller of eight pairs of beta vulgaris all but one and of fifteen pairs of zea mays all but two were taller of fifteen pairs of limnanthes douglasii and of seven pairs of lactuca sativa every single crossed plant was taller than its selffertilised opponent it should also be observed that in these experiments no particular care was taken to crossfertilise the flowers immediately after their expansion it is therefore almost certain that in many of these cases some pollen from the same flower will have already fallen on and acted on the stigma  there can hardly be a doubt that several other species of which the crossed seedlings are more vigorous than the selffertilised as shown in tables 7a 7b and 7c besides the above fifteen must have received their own pollen and that from another plant at nearly the same time and if so the same remarks as those just given are applicable to them scarcely any result from my experiments has surprised me so much as this of the prepotency of pollen from a distinct individual over each plants own pollen as proved by the greater constitutional vigour of the crossed seedlings the evidence of prepotency is here deduced from the comparative growth of the two lots of seedlings but we have similar evidence in many cases from the much greater fertility of the noncastrated flowers on the motherplant when these received at the same time their own pollen and that from a distinct plant in comparison with the flowers which received only their own pollen  from the various facts now given on the spontaneous intercrossing of varieties growing near together and on the effects of crossfertilising flowers which are selffertile and have not been castrated we may conclude that pollen brought by insects or by the wind from a distinct plant will generally prevent the action of pollen from the same flower even though it may have been applied some time before and thus the intercrossing of plants in a state of nature will be greatly favoured or ensured  the case of a great tree covered with innumerable hermaphrodite flowers seems at first sight strongly opposed to the belief in the frequency of intercrosses between distinct individuals the flowers which grow on the opposite sides of such a tree will have been exposed to somewhat different conditions and a cross between them may perhaps be in some degree beneficial but it is not probable that it would be nearly so beneficial as a cross between flowers on distinct trees as we may infer from the inefficiency of pollen taken from plants which have been propagated from the same stock though growing on separate roots the number of bees which frequent certain kinds of trees when in full flower is very great and they may be seen flying from tree to tree more frequently than might have been expected nevertheless if we consider how numerous are the flowers for instance on a horsechestnut or limetree an incomparably larger number of flowers must be fertilised by pollen brought from other flowers on the same tree than from flowers on a distinct tree but we should bear in mind that with the horsechestnut for instance only one or two of the several flowers on the same peduncle produce a seed and that this seed is the product of only one out of several ovules within the same ovarium now we know from the experiments of herbert and others that if one flower is fertilised with pollen which is more efficient than that applied to the other flowers on the same peduncle the latter often drop off 1041 variation under domestication chapter 17 2nd edition volume 2 page 120 and it is probable that this would occur with many of the selffertilised flowers on a large tree if other and adjoining flowers were crossfertilised of the flowers annually produced by a great tree it is almost certain that a large number would be selffertilised and if we assume that the tree produced only 500 flowers and that this number of seeds were requisite to keep up the stock so that at least one seedling should hereafter struggle to maturity then a large proportion of the seedlings would necessarily be derived from selffertilised seeds but if the tree annually produced 50000 flowers of which the selffertilised dropped off without yielding seeds then the crossfertilised flowers might yield seeds in sufficient number to keep up the stock and most of the seedlings would be vigorous from being the product of a cross between distinct individuals in this manner the production of a vast number of flowers besides serving to entice numerous insects and to compensate for the accidental destruction of many flowers by springfrosts or otherwise would be a very great advantage to the species and when we behold our orchardtrees covered with a white sheet of bloom in the spring we should not falsely accuse nature of wasteful expenditure though comparatively little fruit is produced in the autumn  anemophilous plants  the nature and relations of plants which are fertilised by the wind have been admirably discussed by delpino and hermann muller and i have already made some remarks on the structure of their flowers in contrast with those of entomophilous species 1042 delpino ult osservazioni sulla dicogamia part 2 fasc 1 1870 and studi sopra un lignaggio anemofilo etc 1871 hermann muller die befruchtung etc pages 412 442 both these authors remark that plants must have been anemophilous before they were entomophilous hermann muller further discusses in a very interesting manner the steps by which entomophilous flowers became nectariferous and gradually acquired their present structure through successive beneficial changes there is good reason to believe that the first plants which appeared on this earth were cryptogamic and judging from what now occurs the male fertilising element must either have possessed the power of spontaneous movement through the water or over damp surfaces or have been carried by currents of water to the female organs that some of the most ancient plants such as ferns possessed true sexual organs there can hardly be a doubt and this shows as hildebrand remarks at how early a period the sexes were separated 1043 die geschlechtervertheilung 1867 pages 8490 as soon as plants became phanerogamic and grew on the dry ground if they were ever to intercross it would be indispensable that the male fertilising element should be transported by some means through the air and the wind is the simplest means of transport there must also have been a period when winged insects did not exist and plants would not then have been rendered entomophilous even at a somewhat later period the more specialised orders of the hymenoptera lepidoptera and diptera which are now chiefly concerned with the transport of pollen did not exist therefore the earliest terrestrial plants known to us namely the coniferae and cycadiae no doubt were anemophilous like the existing species of these same groups a vestige of this early state of things is likewise shown by some other groups of plants which are anemophilous as these on the whole stand lower in the scale than entomophilous species  there is no great difficulty in understanding how an anemophilous plant might have been rendered entomophilous pollen is a nutritious substance and would soon have been discovered and devoured by insects and if any adhered to their bodies it would have been carried from the anthers to the stigma of the same flower or from one flower to another one of the chief characteristics of the pollen of anemophilous plants is its incoherence but pollen in this state can adhere to the hairy bodies of insects as we see with some leguminosae ericaceae and melastomaceae we have however better evidence of the possibility of a transition of the above kind in certain plants being now fertilised partly by the wind and partly by insects the common rhubarb rheum rhaponticum is so far in an intermediate condition that i have seen many diptera sucking the flowers with much pollen adhering to their bodies and yet the pollen is so incoherent that clouds of it are emitted if the plant be gently shaken on a sunny day some of which could hardly fail to fall on the large stigmas of the neighbouring flowers according to delpino and hermann muller some species of plantago are in a similar intermediate condition 1044 die befruchtung etc page 342  although it is probable that pollen was aboriginally the sole attraction to insects and although many plants now exist whose flowers are frequented exclusively by pollendevouring insects yet the great majority secrete nectar as the chief attraction many years ago i suggested that primarily the saccharine matter in nectar was excreted as a waste product of chemical changes in the sap and that when the excretion happened to occur within the envelopes of a flower it was utilised for the important object of crossfertilisation being subsequently much increased in quantity and stored in various ways 1045 nectar was regarded by de candolle and dunal as an excretion as stated by martinet in annal des sc nat 1872 tome 14 page 211 this view is rendered probable by the leaves of some trees excreting under certain climatic conditions without the aid of special glands a saccharine fluid often called honeydew this is the case with the leaves of the lime for although some authors have disputed the fact a most capable judge dr maxwell masters informs me that after having heard the discussions on this subject before the horticultural society he feels no doubt on this head the leaves as well as the cut stems of the manna ash fraxinus ornus secrete in a like manner saccharine matter 1046 gardeners chronicle 1876 page 242 according to treviranus so do the upper surfaces of the leaves of carduus arctioides during hot weather many analogous facts could be given 1047 kurr untersuchungen uber die bedeutung der nektarien 1833 page 115 there are however a considerable number of plants which bear small glands on their leaves petioles phyllodia stipules bracteae or flower peduncles or on the outside of their calyx and these glands secrete minute drops of a sweet fluid which is eagerly sought by sugarloving insects such as ants hivebees and wasps 1048 a large number of cases are given by delpino in the bulletino entomologico anno 6 1874 to these may be added those given in my text as well as the excretion of saccharine matter from the calyx of two species of iris and from the bracteae of certain orchideae see kurr bedeutung der nektarien 1833 pages 25 28 belt nicaragua page 224 also refers to a similar excretion by many epiphytal orchids and passionflowers mr rodgers has seen much nectar secreted from the bases of the flowerpeduncles of vanilla link says that the only example of a hypopetalous nectary known to him is externally at the base of the flowers of chironia decussata see reports on botany ray society 1846 page 355 an important memoir bearing on this subject has lately appeared by reinke gottingen nachrichten 1873 page 825 who shows that in many plants the tips of the serrations on the leaves in the bud bear glands which secrete only at a very early age and which have the same morphological structure as true nectarsecreting glands he further shows that the nectarsecreting glands on the petioles of prunus avium are not developed at a very early age yet wither away on the old leaves they are homologous with those on the serrations of the blades of the same leaves as shown by their structure and by transitionforms for the lowest serrations on the blades of most of the leaves secrete nectar instead of resin harz in the case of the glands on the stipules of vicia sativa the excretion manifestly depends on changes in the sap consequent on the sun shining brightly for i repeatedly observed that as soon as the sun was hidden behind clouds the secretion ceased and the hivebees left the field but as soon as the sun broke out again they returned to their feast 1049 i published a brief notice of this case in the gardeners chronicle 1855 july 21 page 487 and afterwards made further observations besides the hivebee another species of bee a moth ants and two kinds of flies sucked the drops of fluid on the stipules the larger drops tasted sweet the hivebees never even looked at the flowers which were open at the same time whilst two species of humblebees neglected the stipules and visited only the flowers i have observed an analogous fact with the secretion of true nectar in the flowers of lobelia erinus  delpino however maintains that the power of secreting a sweet fluid by any extrafloral organ has been in every case specially gained for the sake of attracting ants and wasps as defenders of the plant against their enemies but i have never seen any reason to believe that this is so with the three species observed by me namely prunus laurocerasus vicia sativa and v faba no plant is so little attacked by enemies of any kind as the common brackenfern pteris aquilina and yet as my son francis has discovered the large glands at the bases of the fronds but only whilst young excrete much sweetish fluid which is eagerly sought by innumerable ants chiefly belonging to myrmica and these ants certainly do not serve as a protection against any enemy delpino argues that such glands ought not to be considered as excretory because if they were so they would be present in every species but i cannot see much force in this argument as the leaves of some plants excrete sugar only during certain states of the weather that in some cases the secretion serves to attract insects as defenders of the plant and may have been developed to a high degree for this special purpose i have not the least doubt from the observations of delpino and more especially from those of mr belt on acacia sphaerocephala and on passionflowers this acacia likewise produces as an additional attraction to ants small bodies containing much oil and protoplasm and analogous bodies are developed by a cecropia for the same purpose as described by fritz muller 1050 mr belt the naturalist in nicaragua 1874 page 218 has given a most interesting account of the paramount importance of ants as defenders of the above acacia with respect to the cecropia see nature 1876 page 304 my son francis has described the microscopical structure and development of these wonderful foodbodies in a paper read before the linnean society  the excretion of a sweet fluid by glands seated outside of a flower is rarely utilised as a means for crossfertilisation by the aid of insects but this occurs with the bracteae of the marcgraviaceae as the late dr cruger informed me from actual observation in the west indies and as delpino infers with much acuteness from the relative position of the several parts of their flowers 1051 ult osservaz dicogamia 186869 page 188 mr farrer has also shown that the flowers of coronilla are curiously modified so that bees may fertilise them whilst sucking the fluid secreted from the outside of the calyx 1052 nature 1874 page 169 it further appears probable from the observations of the reverend wa leighton that the fluid so abundantly secreted by glands on the phyllodia of the australian acacia magnifica which stand near the flowers is connected with their fertilisation 1053 annals and magazine of natural history volume 16 1865 page 14 in my work on the fertilisation of orchids and in a paper subsequently published in the annals and magazine of natural history it has been shown that although certain kinds of orchids possess a nectary no nectar is actually secreted by it but that insects penetrate the inner walls and suck the fluid contained in the intercellular spaces i further suggested in the case of some other orchids which do not secrete nectar that insects gnawed the labellum and this suggestion has since been proved true hermann muller and delpino have now shown that some other plants have thickened petals which are sucked or gnawed by insects their fertilisation being thus aided all the known facts on this head have been collected by delpino in his ult osserv part 2 fasc 2 1875 pages 5963  the amount of pollen produced by anemophilous plants and the distance to which it is often transported by the wind are both surprisingly great mr hassall found that the weight of pollen produced by a single plant of the bulrush typha was 144 grains bucketfuls of pollen chiefly of coniferae and gramineae have been swept off the decks of vessels near the north american shore and mr riley has seen the ground near st louis in missouri covered with pollen as if sprinkled with sulphur and there was good reason to believe that this had been transported from the pineforests at least 400 miles to the south kerner has seen the snowfields on the higher alps similarly dusted and mr blackley found numerous pollengrains in one instance 1200 adhering to sticky slides which were sent up to a height of from 500 to 1000 feet by means of a kite and then uncovered by a special mechanism it is remarkable that in these experiments there were on an average nineteen times as many pollengrains in the atmosphere at the higher than at the lower levels 1054 for mr hassalls observations see annals and magazine of natural history volume 8 1842 page 108 in the north american journal of science january 1842 there is an account of the pollen swept off the decks of a vessel riley fifth report on the noxious insects of missouri 1873 page 86 kerner die schutzmittel des pollens 1873 page 6 this author has also seen a lake in the tyrol so covered with pollen that the water no longer appeared blue mr blackley experimental researches on hayfever 1873 pages 132 141152 considering these facts it is not so surprising as it at first appears that all or nearly all the stigmas of anemophilous plants should receive pollen brought to them by mere chance by the wind during the early part of summer every object is thus dusted with pollen for instance i examined for another purpose the labella of a large number of flowers of the fly ophrys which is rarely visited by insects and found on all very many pollengrains of other plants which had been caught by their velvety surfaces  the extraordinary quantity and lightness of the pollen of anemophilous plants are no doubt both necessary as their pollen has generally to be carried to the stigmas of other and often distant flowers for as we shall soon see most anemophilous plants have their sexes separated the fertilisation of these plants is generally aided by the stigmas being of large size or plumose and in the case of the coniferae by the naked ovules secreting a drop of fluid as shown by delpino although the number of anemophilous species is small as the author just quoted remarks the number of individuals is large in comparison with that of entomophilous species this holds good especially in cold and temperate regions where insects are not so numerous as under a warmer climate and where consequently entomophilous plants are less favourably situated we see this in our forests of coniferae and other trees such as oaks beeches birches ashes etc and in the gramineae cyperaceae and juncaceae which clothe our meadows and swamps all these trees and plants being fertilised by the wind as a large quantity of pollen is wasted by anemophilous plants it is surprising that so many vigorous species of this kind abounding with individuals should still exist in any part of the world for if they had been rendered entomophilous their pollen would have been transported by the aid of the senses and appetites of insects with incomparably greater safety than by the wind that such a conversion is possible can hardly be doubted from the remarks lately made on the existence of intermediate forms and apparently it has been effected in the group of willows as we may infer from the nature of their nearest allies 1055 hermann muller die befruchtung etc page 149  it seems at first sight a still more surprising fact that plants after having been once rendered entomophilous should ever again have become anemophilous but this has occasionally though rarely occurred for instance with the common poterium sanguisorba as may be inferred from its belonging to the rosaceae such cases are however intelligible as almost all plants require to be occasionally intercrossed and if any entomiphilous species ceased to be visited by insects it would probably perish unless it were rendered anemophilous a plant would be neglected by insects if nectar failed to be secreted unless indeed a large supply of attractive pollen was present and from what we have seen of the excretion of saccharine fluid from leaves and glands being largely governed in several cases by climatic influences and from some few flowers which do not now secrete nectar still retaining coloured guidingmarks the failure of the secretion cannot be considered as a very improbable event the same result would follow to a certainty if winged insects ceased to exist in any district or became very rare now there is only a single plant in the great order of the cruciferae namely pringlea which is anemophilous and this plant is an inhabitant of kerguelen land where there are hardly any winged insects owing probably as was suggested by me in the case of madeira to the risk which they run of being blown out to sea and destroyed 1056 the reverend ae eaton in proceedings of the royal society volume 23 1875 page 351  a remarkable fact with respect to anemophilous plants is that they are often diclinous that is they are either monoecious with their sexes separated on the same plant or dioecious with their sexes on distinct plants in the class monoecia of linnaeus delpino shows that the species of twentyeight genera are anemophilous and of seventeen genera entomophilous 1057 studi sopra un lignaggio anemofilo delle compositae 1871 the larger proportion of entomophilous genera in this latter class is probably the indirect result of insects having the power of carrying pollen to another and sometimes distant plant much more securely than the wind in the above two classes taken together there are thirtyeight anemophilous and thirtysix entomophilous genera whereas in the great mass of hermaphrodite plants the proportion of anemophilous to entomophilous genera is extremely small the cause of this remarkable difference may be attributed to anemophilous plants having retained in a greater degree than the entomophilous a primordial condition in which the sexes were separated and their mutual fertilisation effected by means of the wind that the earliest and lowest members of the vegetable kingdom had their sexes separated as is still the case to a large extent is the opinion of a high authority nageli 1058 entstehung und begriff der naturhist art 1865 page 22 it is indeed difficult to avoid this conclusion if we admit the view which seems highly probable that the conjugation of the algae and of some of the simplest animals is the first step towards sexual reproduction and if we further bear in mind that a greater and greater degree of differentiation between the cells which conjugate can be traced thus leading apparently to the development of the two sexual forms 1059 see the interesting discussion on this whole subject by o butschli in his studien uber die ersten entwickelungsvorgange der eizelle etc 1876 pages 207219 also engelmann ueber entwickelung von infusorien morphol jahrbuch b 1 page 573 also dr a dodel die kraushaaralgae pringsheims jahrbuch f wiss bot b 10 we have also seen that as plants became more highly developed and affixed to the ground they would be compelled to be anemophilous in order to intercross therefore all plants which have not since been greatly modified would tend still to be both diclinous and anemophilous and we can thus understand the connection between these two states although they appear at first sight quite disconnected if this view is correct plants must have been rendered hermaphrodites at a later though still very early period and entomophilous at a yet later period namely after the development of winged insects so that the relationship between hermaphroditism and fertilisation by means of insects is likewise to a certain extent intelligible  why the descendants of plants which were originally dioecious and which therefore profited by always intercrossing with another individual should have been converted into hermaphrodites may perhaps be explained by the risk which they ran especially as long as they were anemophilous of not being always fertilised and consequently of not leaving offspring this latter evil the greatest of all to any organism would have been much lessened by their becoming hermaphrodites though with the contingent disadvantage of frequent selffertilisation by what graduated steps an hermaphrodite condition was acquired we do not know but we can see that if a lowly organised form in which the two sexes were represented by somewhat different individuals were to increase by budding either before or after conjugation the two incipient sexes would be capable of appearing by buds on the same stock as occasionally occurs with various characters at the present day the organism would then be in a monoecious condition and this is probably the first step towards hermaphroditism for if very simple male and female flowers on the same stock each consisting of a single stamen or pistil were brought close together and surrounded by a common envelope in nearly the same manner as with the florets of the compositae we should have an hermaphrodite flower  there seems to be no limit to the changes which organisms undergo under changing conditions of life and some hermaphrodite plants descended as we must believe from aboriginally diclinous plants have had their sexes again separated that this has occurred we may infer from the presence of rudimentary stamens in the flowers of some individuals and of rudimentary pistils in the flowers of other individuals for example in lychnis dioica but a conversion of this kind will not have occurred unless crossfertilisation was already assured generally by the agency of insects but why the production of male and female flowers on distinct plants should have been advantageous to the species crossfertilisation having been previously assured is far from obvious a plant might indeed produce twice as many seeds as were necessary to keep up its numbers under new or changed conditions of life and if it did not vary by bearing fewer flowers and did vary in the state of its reproductive organs as often occurs under cultivation a wasteful expenditure of seeds and pollen would be saved by the flowers becoming diclinous  a related point is worth notice i remarked in my origin of species that in britain a much larger proportion of trees and bushes than of herbaceous plants have their sexes separated and so it is according to asa gray and hooker in north america and new zealand 1060 i find in the london catalogue of british plants that there are thirtytwo indigenous trees and bushes in great britain classed under nine families but to err on the safe side i have counted only six species of willows of the thirtytwo trees and bushes nineteen or more than half have their sexes separated and this is an enormous proportion compared with other british plants new zealand abounds with diclinous plants and trees and dr hooker calculates that out of about 756 phanerogamic plants inhabiting the islands no less than 108 are trees belonging to thirtyfive families of these 108 trees fiftytwo or very nearly half have their sexes more or less separated of bushes there are 149 of which sixtyone have their sexes in the same state whilst of the remaining 500 herbaceous plants only 121 or less than a fourth have their sexes separated lastly professor asa gray informs me that in the united states there are 132 native trees belonging to twentyfive families of which ninetyfive belonging to seventeen families have their sexes more or less separated for the greater part decidedly separated it is however doubtful how far this rule holds good generally and it certainly does not do so in australia but i have been assured that the flowers of the prevailing australian trees namely the myrtaceae swarm with insects and if they are dichogamous they would be practically diclinous 1061 with respect to the proteaceae of australia mr bentham journal of the linnean society botany volume 13 1871 pages 58 64 remarks on the various contrivances by which the stigma in the several genera is screened from the action of the pollen from the same flower for instance in synaphea the stigma is held by the eunuch ie one of the stamens which is barren safe from all pollution from her brother anthers and is preserved intact for any pollen that may be inserted by insects and other agencies as far as anemophilous plants are concerned we know that they are apt to have their sexes separated and we can see that it would be an unfavourable circumstance for them to bear their flowers very close to the ground as their pollen is liable to be blown high up in the air 1062 kerner schutzmittel des pollens 1873 page 4 but as the culms of grasses give sufficient elevation we cannot thus account for so many trees and bushes being diclinous we may infer from our previous discussion that a tree bearing numerous hermaphrodite flowers would rarely intercross with another tree except by means of the pollen of a distinct individual being prepotent over the plants own pollen now the separation of the sexes whether the plant were anemophilous are entomophilous would most effectually bar selffertilisation and this may be the cause of so many trees and bushes being diclinous or to put the case in another way a plant would be better fitted for development into a tree if the sexes were separated than if it were hermaphrodite for in the former case its numerous flowers would be less liable to continued selffertilisation but it should also be observed that the long life of a tree or bush permits of the separation of the sexes with much less risk of evil from impregnation occasionally failing and seeds not being produced than in the case of shortlived plants hence it probably is as lecoq has remarked that annual plants are rarely dioecious  finally we have seen reason to believe that the higher plants are descended from extremely low forms which conjugated and that the conjugating individuals differed somewhat from one anotherthe one representing the male and the other the femaleso that plants were aboriginally dioecious at a very early period such lowly organised dioecious plants probably gave rise by budding to monoecious plants with the two sexes borne by the same individual and by a still closer union of the sexes to hermaphrodite plants which are now much the commonest form 1063 there is a considerable amount of evidence that all the higher animals are the descendants of hermaphrodites and it is a curious problem whether such hermaphroditism may not have been the result of the conjugation of two slightly different individuals which represented the two incipient sexes on this view the higher animals may now owe their bilateral structure with all their organs double at an early embryonic period to the fusion or conjugation of two primordial individuals as soon as plants became affixed to the ground their pollen must have been carried by some means from flower to flower at first almost certainly by the wind then by pollendevouring and afterwards by nectarseeking insects during subsequent ages some few entomophilous plants have been again rendered anemophilous and some hermaphrodite plants have had their sexes again separated and we can vaguely see the advantages of such recurrent changes under certain conditions  dioecious plants however fertilised have a great advantage over other plants in their crossfertilisation being assured but this advantage is gained in the case of anemophilous species at the expense of the production of an enormous superfluity of pollen with some risk to them and to entomophilous species of their fertilisation occasionally failing half the individuals moreover namely the males produce no seed and this might possibly be a disadvantage delpino remarks that dioecious plants cannot spread so easily as monoecious and hermaphrodite species for a single individual which happened to reach some new site could not propagate its kind but it may be doubted whether this is a serious evil monoecious plants can hardly fail to be to a large extent dioecious in function owing to the lightness of their pollen and to the wind blowing laterally with the great additional advantage of occasionally or often producing some selffertilised seeds when they are also dichogamous they are necessarily dioecious in function lastly hermaphrodite plants can generally produce at least some selffertilised seeds and they are at the same time capable through the various means specified in this chapter of crossfertilisation when their structure absolutely prevents selffertilisation they are in the same relative position to one another as monoecious and dioecious plants with what may be an advantage namely that every flower is capable of yielding seeds    chapter xi  the habits of insects in relation to the fertilisation of flowers  insects visit the flowers of the same species as long as they can cause of this habit means by which bees recognise the flowers of the same species sudden secretion of nectar nectar of certain flowers unattractive to certain insects industry of bees and the number of flowers visited within a short time perforation of the corolla by bees skill shown in the operation hivebees profit by the holes made by humblebees effects of habit the motive for perforating flowers to save time flowers growing in crowded masses chiefly perforated  bees and various other insects must be directed by instinct to search flowers for nectar and pollen as they act in this manner without instruction as soon as they emerge from the pupa state their instincts however are not of a specialised nature for they visit many exotic flowers as readily as the endemic kinds and they often search for nectar in flowers which do not secrete any and they may be seen attempting to suck it out of nectaries of such length that it cannot be reached by them 111 see on this subject hermann muller befruchtung etc page 427 and sir j lubbocks british wild flowers etc page 20 muller bienen zeitung june 1876 page 119 assigns good reasons for his belief that bees and many other hymenoptera have inherited from some early nectarsucking progenitor greater skill in robbing flowers than that which is displayed by insects belonging to the other orders all kinds of bees and certain other insects usually visit the flowers of the same species as long as they can before going to another species this fact was observed by aristotle with respect to the hivebee more than 2000 years ago and was noticed by dobbs in a paper published in 1736 in the philosophical transactions it may be observed by any one both with hive and humblebees in every flowergarden not that the habit is invariably followed mr bennett watched for several hours many plants of lamium album l purpureum and another labiate plant nepeta glechoma all growing mingled together on a bank near some hives and he found that each bee confined its visits to the same species 112 nature 1874 june 4 page 92 the pollen of these three plants differs in colour so that he was able to test his observations by examining that which adhered to the bodies of the captured bees and he found one kind on each bee  humble and hivebees are good botanists for they know that varieties may differ widely in the colour of their flowers and yet belong to the same species i have repeatedly seen humblebees flying straight from a plant of the ordinary red dictamnus fraxinella to a white variety from one to another very differently coloured variety of delphinium consolida and of primula veris from a dark purple to a bright yellow variety of viola tricolor and with two species of papaver from one variety to another which differed much in colour but in this latter case some of the bees flew indifferently to either species although passing by other genera and thus acted as if the two species were merely varieties hermann muller also has seen hivebees flying from flower to flower of ranunculus bulbosus and arvensis and of trifolium fragiferum and repens and even from blue hyacinths to blue violets 113 bienen zeitung july 1876 page 183  some species of diptera or flies keep to the flowers of the same species with almost as much regularity as do bees and when captured they are found covered with pollen i have seen rhingia rostrata acting in this manner with the flowers of lychnis dioica ajuga reptans and vici sepium volucella plumosa and empis cheiroptera flew straight from flower to flower of myosotis sylvatica dolichopus nigripennis behaved in the same manner with potentilla tormentilla and other diptera with stellaria holostea helianthemum vulgare bellis perennis veronica hederaefolia and chamoedrys but some flies visited indifferently the flowers of these two latter species i have seen more than once a minute thrips with pollen adhering to its body fly from one flower to another of the same kind and one was observed by me crawling about within a convolvulus with four grains of pollen adhering to its head which were deposited on the stigma  fabricius and sprengel state that when flies have once entered the flowers of aristolochia they never escapea statement which i could not believe as in this case the insects would not aid in the crossfertilisation of the plant and this statement has now been shown by hildebrand to be erroneous as the spathes of arum maculatum are furnished with filaments apparently adapted to prevent the exit of insects they resemble in this respect the flowers of aristolochia and on examining several spathes from thirty to sixty minute diptera belonging to three species were found in some of them and many of these insects were lying dead at the bottom as if they had been permanently entrapped in order to discover whether the living ones could escape and carry pollen to another plant i tied in the spring of 1842 a fine muslin bag tightly round a spathe and on returning in an hours time several little flies were crawling about on the inner surface of the bag i then gathered a spathe and breathed hard into it several flies soon crawled out and all without exception were dusted with arum pollen these flies quickly flew away and i distinctly saw three of them fly to another plant about a yard off they alighted on the inner or concave surface of the spathe and suddenly flew down into the flower i then opened this flower and although not a single anther had burst several grains of pollen were lying at the bottom which must have been brought from another plant by one of these flies or by some other insect in another flower little flies were crawling about and i saw them leave pollen on the stigmas  i do not know whether lepidoptera generally keep to the flowers of the same species but i once observed many minute moths i believe lampronia tinea calthella apparently eating the pollen of mercurialis annua and they had the whole front of their bodies covered with pollen i then went to a female plant some yards off and saw in the course of fifteen minutes three of these moths alight on the stigmas lepidoptera are probably often induced to frequent the flowers of the same species whenever these are provided with a long and narrow nectary as in this case other insects cannot suck the nectar which will thus be preserved for those having an elongated proboscis no doubt the yucca moth visits only the flowers whence its name is derived for a most wonderful instinct guides this moth to place pollen on the stigma so that the ovules may be developed on which the larvae feed 114 described by mr riley in the american naturalist volume 7 october 1873with respect to coleoptera i have seen meligethes covered with pollen flying from flower to flower of the same species and this must often occur as according to m brisout many of the species affect only one kind of plant 115 as quoted in american nat may 1873 page 270  it must not be supposed from these several statements that insects strictly confine their visits to the same species they often visit other species when only a few plants of the same kind grow near together in a flowergarden containing some plants of oenothera the pollen of which can easily be recognised i found not only single grains but masses of it within many flowers of mimulus digitalis antirrhinum and linaria other kinds of pollen were likewise detected in these same flowers a large number of the stigmas of a plant of thyme in which the anthers were completely aborted were examined and these stigmas though scarcely larger than a split needle were covered not only with pollen of thyme brought from other plants by the bees but with several other kinds of pollen  that insects should visit the flowers of the same species as long as they can is of great importance to the plant as it favours the crossfertilisation of distinct individuals of the same species but no one will suppose that insects act in this manner for the good of the plant the cause probably lies in insects being thus enabled to work quicker they have just learnt how to stand in the best position on the flower and how far and in what direction to insert their proboscides 116 since these remarks were written i find that hermann muller has come to almost exactly the same conclusion with respect to the cause of insects frequenting as long as they can the flowers of the same species bienen zeitung july 1876 page 182 they act on the same principle as does an artificer who has to make halfadozen engines and who saves time by making consecutively each wheel and part for all of them insects or at least bees seem much influenced by habit in all their manifold operations and we shall presently see that this holds good in their felonious practice of biting holes through the corolla  it is a curious question how bees recognise the flowers of the same species that the coloured corolla is the chief guide cannot be doubted on a fine day when hivebees were incessantly visiting the little blue flowers of lobelia erinus i cut off all the petals of some and only the lower striped petals of others and these flowers were not once again sucked by the bees although some actually crawled over them the removal of the two little upper petals alone made no difference in their visits mr j anderson likewise states that when he removed the corollas of the calceolaria bees never visited the flowers 117 gardeners chronicle 1853 page 534 kurr cut off the nectaries from a large number of flowers of several species and found that the greater number yielded seeds but insects probably would not perceive the loss of the nectary until they had inserted their proboscides into the holes thus formed and in doing so would fertilise the flowers he also removed the whole corolla from a considerable number of flowers and these likewise yielded seeds flowers which are selffertile would naturally produce seeds under these circumstances but i am greatly surprised that delphinium consolida as well as another species of delphinium and viola tricolor should have produced a fair supply of seeds when thus treated but it does not appear that he compared the number of the seeds thus produced with those yielded by unmutilated flowers left to the free access of insects bedeutung der nektarien 1833 pages 123135 on the other hand in some large masses of geranium phaeum which had escaped out of a garden i observed the unusual fact of the flowers continuing to secrete an abundance of nectar after all the petals had fallen off and the flowers in this state were still visited by humblebees but the bees might have learnt that these flowers with all their petals lost were still worth visiting by finding nectar in those with only one or two lost the colour alone of the corolla serves as an approximate guide thus i watched for some time humblebees which were visiting exclusively plants of the whiteflowered spiranthes autumnalis growing on short turf at a considerable distance apart and these bees often flew within a few inches of several other plants with white flowers and then without further examination passed onwards in search of the spiranthes again many hivebees which confined their visits to the common ling calluna vulgaris repeatedly flew towards erica tetralix evidently attracted by the nearly similar tint of their flowers and then instantly passed on in search of the calluna  that the colour of the flower is not the sole guide is clearly shown by the six cases above given of bees which repeatedly passed in a direct line from one variety to another of the same species although they bore very differently coloured flowers i observed also bees flying in a straight line from one clump of a yellowflowered oenothera to every other clump of the same plant in the garden without turning an inch from their course to plants of eschscholtzia and others with yellow flowers which lay only a foot or two on either side in these cases the bees knew the position of each plant in the garden perfectly well as we may infer by the directness of their flight so that they were guided by experience and memory but how did they discover at first that the above varieties with differently coloured flowers belonged to the same species improbable as it may appear they seem at least sometimes to recognise plants even from a distance by their general aspect in the same manner as we should do on three occasions i observed humblebees flying in a perfectly straight line from a tall larkspur delphinium which was in full flower to another plant of the same species at the distance of fifteen yards which had not as yet a single flower open and on which the buds showed only a faint tinge of blue here neither odour nor the memory of former visits could have come into play and the tinge of blue was so faint that it could hardly have served as a guide 118 a fact mentioned by hermann muller die befruchtung etc page 347 shows that bees possess acute powers of vision and discrimination for those engaged in collecting pollen from primula elatior invariably passed by the flowers of the longstyled form in which the anthers are seated low down in the tubular corolla yet the difference in aspect between the longstyled and shortstyled forms is extremely slight  the conspicuousness of the corolla does not suffice to induce repeated visits from insects unless nectar is at the same time secreted together perhaps with some odour emitted i watched for a fortnight many times daily a wall covered with linaria cymbalaria in full flower and never saw a bee even looking at one there was then a very hot day and suddenly many bees were industriously at work on the flowers it appears that a certain degree of heat is necessary for the secretion of nectar for i observed with lobelia erinus that if the sun ceased to shine for only half an hour the visits of the bees slackened and soon ceased an analogous fact with respect to the sweet excretion from the stipules of vicia sativa has been already given as in the case of the linaria so with pedicularis sylvatica polygala vulgaris viola tricolor and some species of trifolium i have watched the flowers day after day without seeing a bee at work and then suddenly all the flowers were visited by many bees now how did so many bees discover at once that the flowers were secreting nectar i presume that it must have been by their odour and that as soon as a few bees began to suck the flowers others of the same and of different kinds observed the fact and profited by it we shall presently see when we treat of the perforation of the corolla that bees are fully capable of profiting by the labour of other species memory also comes into play for as already remarked bees know the position of each clump of flowers in a garden i have repeatedly seen them passing round a corner but otherwise in as straight a line as possible from one plant of fraxinella and of linaria to another and distant one of the same species although owing to the intervention of other plants the two were not in sight of each other  it would appear that either the taste or the odour of the nectar of certain flowers is unattractive to hive or to humblebees or to both for there seems no other reason why certain open flowers which secrete nectar are not visited by them the small quantity of nectar secreted by some of these flowers can hardly be the cause of their neglect as hivebees search eagerly for the minute drops on the glands on the leaves of the prunus laurocerasus even the bees from different hives sometimes visit different kinds of flowers as is said to be the case by mr grant with respect to the polyanthus and viola tricolor 119 gardeners chronicle 1844 page 374 i have known humblebees to visit the flowers of lobelia fulgens in one garden and not in another at the distance of only a few miles the cupful of nectar in the labellum of epipactis latifolia is never touched by hive or humblebees although i have seen them flying close by and yet the nectar has a pleasant taste to us and is habitually consumed by the common wasp as far as i have seen wasps seek for nectar in this country only from the flowers of this epipactis scrophularia aquatica symphoricarpus racemosa 1110 the same fact apparently holds good in italy for delpino says that the flowers of these three plants are alone visited by wasps nettarii estranuziali bulletino entomologico anno 6 and tritoma the two former plants being endemic and the two latter exotic as wasps are so fond of sugar and of any sweet fluid and as they do not disdain the minute drops on the glands of prunus laurocerasus it is a strange fact that they do not suck the nectar of many open flowers which they could do without the aid of a proboscis hivebees visit the flowers of the symphoricarpus and tritoma and this makes it all the stranger that they do not visit the flowers of the epipactis or as far as i have seen those of the scrophularia aquatica although they do visit the flowers of scrophularia nodosa at least in north america 1111 sillimans american journal of science august 1871  the extraordinary industry of bees and the number of flowers which they visit within a short time so that each flower is visited repeatedly must greatly increase the chance of each receiving pollen from a distinct plant when the nectar is in any way hidden bees cannot tell without inserting their proboscides whether it has lately been exhausted by other bees and this as remarked in a former chapter forces them to visit many more flowers than they otherwise would but they endeavour to lose as little time as they can thus in flowers having several nectaries if they find one dry they do not try the others but as i have often observed pass on to another flower they work so industriously and effectually that even in the case of social plants of which hundreds of thousands grow together as with the several kinds of heath every single flower is visited of which evidence will presently be given they lose no time and fly very quickly from plant to plant but i do not know the rate at which hivebees fly humblebees fly at the rate of ten miles an hour as i was able to ascertain in the case of the males from their curious habit of calling at certain fixed points which made it easy to measure the time taken in passing from one place to another  with respect to the number of flowers which bees visit in a given time i observed that in exactly one minute a humblebee visited twentyfour of the closed flowers of the linaria cymbalaria another bee visited in the same time twentytwo flowers of the symphoricarpus racemosa and another seventeen flowers on two plants of a delphinium in the course of fifteen minutes a single flower on the summit of a plant of oenothera was visited eight times by several humblebees and i followed the last of these bees whilst it visited in the course of a few additional minutes every plant of the same species in a large flowergarden in nineteen minutes every flower on a small plant of nemophila insignis was visited twice in one minute six flowers of a campanula were entered by a pollencollecting hivebee and bees when thus employed work slower than when sucking nectar lastly seven flowerstalks on a plant of dictamnus fraxinella were observed on the 15th of june 1841 during ten minutes they were visited by thirteen humblebees each of which entered many flowers on the 22nd the same flowerstalks were visited within the same time by eleven humblebees this plant bore altogether 280 flowers and from the above data taking into consideration how late in the evening humblebees work each flower must have been visited at least thirty times daily and the same flower keeps open during several days the frequency of the visits of bees is also sometimes shown by the manner in which the petals are scratched by their hooked tarsi i have seen large beds of mimulus stachys and lathyrus with the beauty of their flowers thus sadly defaced  perforation of the corolla by bees  i have already alluded to bees biting holes in flowers for the sake of obtaining the nectar they often act in this manner both with endemic and exotic species in many parts of europe in the united states and in the himalaya and therefore probably in all parts of the world the plants the fertilisation of which actually depends on insects entering the flowers will fail to produce seed when their nectar is stolen from the outside and even with those species which are capable of fertilising themselves without any aid there can be no crossfertilisation and this as we know is a serious evil in most cases the extent to which humblebees carry on the practice of biting holes is surprising a remarkable case was observed by me near bournemouth where there were formerly extensive heaths i took a long walk and every now and then gathered a twig of erica tetralix and when i had got a handful all the flowers were examined through a lens this process was repeated many times but though many hundreds were examined i did not succeed in finding a single flower which had not been perforated humblebees were at the time sucking the flowers through these perforations on the following day a large number of flowers were examined on another heath with the same result but here hivebees were sucking through the holes this case is all the more remarkable as the innumerable holes had been made within a fortnight for before that time i saw the bees everywhere sucking in the proper manner at the mouths of the corolla in an extensive flowergarden some large beds of salvia grahami stachys coccinea and pentstemon argutus  had every flower perforated and many scores were examined i have seen whole fields of red clover trifolium pratense in the same state dr ogle found that 90 per cent of the flowers of salvia glutinosa had been bitten in the united states mr bailey says it is difficult to find a blossom of the native gerardia pedicularia without a hole in it and mr gentry in speaking of the introduced wistaria sinensis says that nearly every flower had been perforated 1112 dr ogle pop science review july 1869 page 267 bailey american naturalist november 1873 page 690 gentry ibid may 1875 page 264  as far as i have seen it is always humblebees which first bite the holes and they are well fitted for the work by possessing powerful mandibles but hivebees afterwards profit by the holes thus made dr hermann muller however writes to me that hivebees sometimes bite holes through the flowers of erica tetralix no insects except bees with the single exception of wasps in the case of tritoma have sense enough as far as i have observed to profit by the holes already made even humblebees do not always discover that it would be advantageous to them to perforate certain flowers there is an abundant supply of nectar in the nectary of tropaeolum tricolor yet i have found this plant untouched in more than one garden while the flowers of other plants had been extensively perforated but a few years ago sir j lubbocks gardener assured me that he had seen humblebees boring through the nectary of this tropaeolum muller has observed humblebees trying to suck at the mouths of the flowers of primula elatior and of an aquilegia and failing in their attempts they made holes through the corolla but they often bite holes although they could with very little more trouble obtain the nectar in a legitimate manner by the mouth of the corolla  dr w ogle has communicated to me a curious case he gathered in switzerland 100 flowerstems of the common blue variety of the monkshood aconitum napellus and not a single flower was perforated he then gathered 100 stems of a white variety growing close by and every one of the open flowers had been perforated 1113 dr ogle popular science review july 1869 page 267 bailey american naturalist november 1873 page 690 gentry ibid may 1875 page 264 this surprising difference in the state of the flowers may be attributed with much probability to the blue variety being distasteful to bees from the presence of the acrid matter which is so general in the ranunculaceae and to its absence in the white variety in correlation with the loss of the blue tint according to sprengel this plant is strongly proterandrous 1114 das entdeckte etc page 278 it would therefore be more or less sterile unless bees carried pollen from the younger to the older flowers consequently the white variety the flowers of which were always bitten instead of being properly entered by the bees would fail to yield the full number of seeds and would be a comparatively rare plant as dr ogle informs me was the case  bees show much skill in their manner of working for they always make their holes from the outside close to the spot where the nectar lies hidden within the corolla all the flowers in a large bed of stachys coccinea had either one or two slits made on the upper side of the corolla near the base the flowers of a mirabilis and of salvia coccinea were perforated in the same manner whilst those of salvia grahami in which the calyx is much elongated had both the calyx and the corolla invariably perforated the flowers of pentstemon argutus are broader than those of the plants just named and two holes alongside each other had here always been made just above the calyx in these several cases the perforations were on the upper side but in antirrhinum majus one or two holes had been made on the lower side close to the little protuberance which represents the nectary and therefore directly in front of and close to the spot where the nectar is secreted  but the most remarkable case of skill and judgment known to me is that of the perforation of the flowers of lathyrus sylvestris as described by my son francis 1115 nature january 8 1874 page 189 the nectar in this plant is enclosed within a tube formed by the united stamens which surround the pistil so closely that a bee is forced to insert its proboscis outside the tube but two natural rounded passages or orifices are left in the tube near the base in order that the nectar may be reached by the bees now my son found in sixteen out of twentyfour flowers on this plant and in eleven out of sixteen of those on the cultivated everlasting pea which is either a variety of the same species or a closely allied one that the left passage was larger than the right one and here comes the remarkable pointthe humblebees bite holes through the standardpetal and they always operated on the left side over the passage which is generally the larger of the two my son remarks it is difficult to say how the bees could have acquired this habit whether they discovered the inequality in the size of the nectarholes in sucking the flowers in the proper way and then utilised this knowledge in determining where to gnaw the hole or whether they found out the best situation by biting through the standard at various points and afterwards remembered its situation in visiting other flowers but in either case they show a remarkable power of making use of what they have learnt by experience it seems probable that bees owe their skill in biting holes through flowers of all kinds to their having long practised the instinct of moulding cells and pots of wax or of enlarging their old cocoons with tubes of wax for they are thus compelled to work on the inside and outside of the same object  in the early part of the summer of 1857 i was led to observe during some weeks several rows of the scarlet kidneybean phaseolus multiflorus whilst attending to the fertilisation of this plant and daily saw humble and hivebees sucking at the mouths of the flowers but one day i found several humblebees employed in cutting holes in flower after flower and on the next day every single hivebee without exception instead of alighting on the left wingpetal and sucking the flower in the proper manner flew straight without the least hesitation to the calyx and sucked through the holes which had been made only the day before by the humblebees and they continued this habit for many following days 1116 gardeners chronicle 1857 page 725 mr belt has communicated to me july 28th 1874 a similar case with the sole difference that less than half of the flowers had been perforated by the humblebees nevertheless all the hivebees gave up sucking at the mouths of the flowers and visited exclusively the bitten ones now how did the hivebees find out so quickly that holes had been made instinct seems to be out of the question as the plant is an exotic the holes cannot be seen by bees whilst standing on the wingpetals where they had always previously alighted from the ease with which bees were deceived when the petals of lobelia erinus were cut off it was clear that in this case they were not guided to the nectar by its smell and it may be doubted whether they were attracted to the holes in the flowers of the phaseolus by the odour emitted from them did they perceive the holes by the sense of touch in their proboscides whilst sucking the flowers in the proper manner and then reason that it would save them time to alight on the outside of the flowers and use the holes this seems almost too abstruse an act of reason for bees and it is more probable that they saw the humblebees at work and understanding what they were about imitated them and took advantage of the shorter path to the nectar even with animals high in the scale such as monkeys we should be surprised at hearing that all the individuals of one species within the space of twentyfour hours understood an act performed by a distinct species and profited by it  i have repeatedly observed with various kinds of flowers that all the hive and humblebees which were sucking through the perforations flew to them whether on the upper or under side of the corolla without the least hesitation and this shows how quickly all the individuals within the district had acquired the same knowledge yet habit comes into play to a certain extent as in so many of the other operations of bees dr ogle messrs farrer and belt have observed in the case of phaseolus multiflorus that certain individuals went exclusively to the perforations while others of the same species visited only the mouths of the flowers 1117 dr ogle pop science review april 1870 page 167 mr farrer annals and magazine of natural history 4th series volume 2 1868 page 258 mr belt in a letter to me i noticed in 1861 exactly the same fact with trifolium pratense so persistent is the force of habit that when a bee which is visiting perforated flowers comes to one which has not been bitten it does not go to the mouth but instantly flies away in search of another bitten flower nevertheless i once saw a humblebee visiting the hybrid rhododendron azaloides and it entered the mouths of some flowers and cut holes into the others dr hermann muller informs me that in the same district he has seen some individuals of bombus mastrucatus boring through the calyx and corolla of rhinanthus alecterolophus and others through the corolla alone different species of bees may however sometimes be observed acting differently at the same time on the same plant i have seen hivebees sucking at the mouths of the flowers of the common bean humblebees of one kind sucking through holes bitten in the calyx and humblebees of another kind sucking the little drops of fluid excreted by the stipules mr beal of michigan informs me that the flowers of the missouri currant ribes aureum abound with nectar so that children often suck them and he saw hivebees sucking through holes made by a bird the oriole and at the same time humblebees sucking in the proper manner at the mouths of the flowers 1118 the flowers of the ribes are however sometimes perforated by humblebees and mr bundy says that they were able to bite through and rob seven flowers of their honey in a minute american naturalist 1876 page 238 this statement about the oriole calls to mind what i have before said of certain species of hummingbirds boring holes through the flowers of the brugmansia whilst other species entered by the mouth  the motive which impels bees to gnaw holes through the corolla seems to be the saving of time for they lose much time in climbing into and out of large flowers and in forcing their heads into closed ones they were able to visit nearly twice as many flowers as far as i could judge of a stachys and pentstemon by alighting on the upper surface of the corolla and sucking through the cut holes than by entering in the proper way nevertheless each bee before it has had much practice must lose some time in making each new perforation especially when the perforation has to be made through both calyx and corolla this action therefore implies foresight of which faculty we have abundant evidence in their building operations and may we not further believe that some trace of their social instinct that is of working for the good of other members of the community may here likewise play a part  many years ago i was struck with the fact that humblebees as a general rule perforate flowers only when these grow in large numbers near together in a garden where there were some very large beds of stachys coccinea and of pentstemon argutus every single flower was perforated but i found two plants of the former species growing quite separate with their petals much scratched showing that they had been frequently visited by bees and yet not a single flower was perforated i found also a separate plant of the pentstemon and saw bees entering the mouth of the corolla and not a single flower had been perforated in the following year 1842 i visited the same garden several times on the 19th of july humblebees were sucking the flowers of stachys coccinea and salvia grahami in the proper manner and none of the corollas were perforated on the 7th of august all the flowers were perforated even those on some few plants of the salvia which grew at a little distance from the great bed on the 21st of august only a few flowers on the summits of the spikes of both species remained fresh and not one of these was now bored again in my own garden every plant in several rows of the common bean had many flowers perforated but i found three plants in separate parts of the garden which had sprung up accidentally and these had not a single flower perforated general strachey formerly saw many perforated flowers in a garden in the himalaya and he wrote to the owner to inquire whether this relation between the plants growing crowded and their perforation by the bees there held good and was answered in the affirmative hence it follows that the red clover trifolium pratense and the common bean when cultivated in great masses in fieldsthat erica tetralix growing in large numbers on heathsrows of the scarlet kidneybean in the kitchengardenand masses of any species in the flowergardenare all eminently liable to be perforated  the explanation of this fact is not difficult flowers growing in large numbers afford a rich booty to the bees and are conspicuous from a distance they are consequently visited by crowds of these insects and i once counted between twenty and thirty bees flying about a bed of pentstemon they are thus stimulated to work quickly by rivalry and what is much more important they find a large proportion of the flowers as suggested by my son with their nectaries sucked dry 1119 nature january 8 1874 page 189 they thus waste much time in searching many empty flowers and are led to bite the holes so as to find out as quickly as possible whether there is any nectar present and if so to obtain it  flowers which are partially or wholly sterile unless visited by insects in the proper manner such as those of most species of salvia of trifolium pratense phaseolus multiflorus etc will fail more or less completely to produce seeds if the bees confine their visits to the perforations the perforated flowers of those species which are capable of fertilising themselves will yield only selffertilised seeds and the seedlings will in consequence be less vigorous therefore all plants must suffer in some degree when bees obtain their nectar in a felonious manner by biting holes through the corolla and many species it might be thought would thus be exterminated but here as is so general throughout nature there is a tendency towards a restored equilibrium if a plant suffers from being perforated fewer individuals will be reared and if its nectar is highly important to the bees these in their turn will suffer and decrease in number but what is much more effective as soon as the plant becomes somewhat rare so as not to grow in crowded masses the bees will no longer be stimulated to gnaw holes in the flowers but will enter them in a legitimate manner more seed will then be produced and the seedlings being the product of crossfertilisation will be vigorous so that the species will tend to increase in number to be again checked as soon as the plant again grows in crowded masses    chapter xii  general results  crossfertilisation proved to be beneficial and selffertilisation injurious allied species differ greatly in the means by which crossfertilisation is favoured and selffertilisation avoided the benefits and evils of the two processes depend on the degree of differentiation in the sexual elements the evil effects not due to the combination of morbid tendencies in the parents nature of the conditions to which plants are subjected when growing near together in a state of nature or under culture and the effects of such conditions theoretical considerations with respect to the interaction of differentiated sexual elements practical lessons genesis of the two sexes close correspondence between the effects of crossfertilisation and selffertilisation and of the legitimate and illegitimate unions of heterostyled plants in comparison with hybrid unions  the first and most important of the conclusions which may be drawn from the observations given in this volume is that crossfertilisation is generally beneficial and selffertilisation injurious this is shown by the difference in height weight constitutional vigour and fertility of the offspring from crossed and selffertilised flowers and in the number of seeds produced by the parentplants with respect to the second of these two propositions namely that selffertilisation is generally injurious we have abundant evidence the structure of the flowers in such plants as lobelia ramosa digitalis purpurea etc renders the aid of insects almost indispensable for their fertilisation and bearing in mind the prepotency of pollen from a distinct individual over that from the same individual such plants will almost certainly have been crossed during many or all previous generations so it must be owing merely to the prepotency of foreign pollen with cabbages and various other plants the varieties of which almost invariably intercross when grown together the same inference may be drawn still more surely with respect to those plants such as reseda and eschscholtzia which are sterile with their own pollen but fertile with that from any other individual these several plants must therefore have been crossed during a long series of previous generations and the artificial crosses in my experiments cannot have increased the vigour of the offspring beyond that of their progenitors therefore the difference between the selffertilised and crossed plants raised by me cannot be attributed to the superiority of the crossed but to the inferiority of the selffertilised seedlings due to the injurious effects of selffertilisation  with respect to the first proposition namely that crossfertilisation is generally beneficial we likewise have excellent evidence plants of ipomoea were intercrossed for nine successive generations they were then again intercrossed and at the same time crossed with a plant of a fresh stock that is one brought from another garden and the offspring of this latter cross were to the intercrossed plants in height as 100 to 78 and in fertility as 100 to 51 an analogous experiment with eschscholtzia gave a similar result as far as fertility was concerned in neither of these cases were any of the plants the product of selffertilisation plants of dianthus were selffertilised for three generations and this no doubt was injurious but when these plants were fertilised by a fresh stock and by intercrossed plants of the same stock there was a great difference in fertility between the two sets of seedlings and some difference in their height petunia offers a nearly parallel case with various other plants the wonderful effects of a cross with a fresh stock may be seen in table 7c several accounts have also been published of the extraordinary growth of seedlings from a cross between two varieties of the same species some of which are known never to fertilise themselves so that here neither selffertilisation nor relationship even in a remote degree can have come into play 121 see variation under domestication chapter 19 2nd edition volume 2 page 159 we may therefore conclude that the above two propositions are truethat crossfertilisation is generally beneficial and selffertilisation injurious to the offspring  that certain plants for instance viola tricolor digitalis purpurea sarothamnus scoparius cyclamen persicum etc which have been naturally crossfertilised for many or all previous generations should suffer to an extreme degree from a single act of selffertilisation is a most surprising fact nothing of the kkind has been observed in our domestic animals but then we must remember that the closest possible interbreeding with such animals that is between brothers and sisters cannot be considered as nearly so close a union as that between the pollen and ovules of the same flower whether the evil from selffertilisation goes on increasing during successive generations is not as yet known but we may infer from my experiments that the increase if any is far from rapid after plants have been propagated by selffertilisation for several generations a single cross with a fresh stock restores their pristine vigour and we have a strictly analogous result with our domestic animals 122 ibid chapter 19 2nd edition volume 2 page 159 the good effects of crossfertilisation are transmitted by plants to the next generation and judging from the varieties of the common pea to many succeeding generations but this may merely be that crossed plants of the first generation are extremely vigorous and transmit their vigour like any other character to their successors  notwithstanding the evil which many plants suffer from selffertilisation they can be thus propagated under favourable conditions for many generations as shown by some of my experiments and more especially by the survival during at least half a century of the same varieties of the common pea and sweetpea the same conclusion probably holds good with several other exotic plants which are never or most rarely crossfertilised in this country but all these plants as far as they have been tried profit greatly by a cross with a fresh stock some few plants for instance ophrys apifera have almost certainly been propagated in a state of nature for thousands of generations without having been once intercrossed and whether they would profit by a cross with a fresh stock is not known but such cases ought not to make us doubt that as a general rule crossing is beneficial any more than the existence of plants which in a state of nature are propagated exclusively by rhizomes stolons etc their flowers never producing seeds 123 i have given several cases in my variation under domestication chapter 18 2nd edition volume 2 page 152 their flowers never producing seeds should make us doubt that seminal generation must have some great advantage as it is the common plan followed by nature whether any species has been reproduced asexually from a very remote period cannot of course be ascertained our sole means for forming any judgment on this head is the duration of the varieties of our fruit trees which have been long propagated by grafts or buds andrew knight formerly maintained that under these circumstances they always become weakly but this conclusion has been warmly disputed by others a recent and competent judge professor asa gray leans to the side of andrew knight which seems to me from such evidence as i have been able to collect the more probable view notwithstanding many opposed facts 124 darwiniana essays and reviews pertaining to darwinism 1876 page 338  the means for favouring crossfertilisation and preventing selffertilisation or conversely for favouring selffertilisation and preventing to a certain extent crossfertilisation are wonderfully diversified and it is remarkable that these differ widely in closely allied plantsin the species of the same genus and sometimes in the individuals of the same species 125 hildebrand has insisted strongly to this effect in his valuable observations on the fertilisation of the gramineae monatsbericht k akad berlin october 1872 page 763 it is not rare to find hermaphrodite plants and others with separated sexes within the same genus and it is common to find some of the species dichogamous and others maturing their sexual elements simultaneously the dichogamous genus saxifraga contains proterandrous and proterogynous species 126 dr engler botanische zeitung 1868 page 833 several genera include both heterostyled dimorphic or trimorphic forms and homostyled species ophrys offers a remarkable instance of one species having its structure manifestly adapted for selffertilisation and other species as manifestly adapted for crossfertilisation some congeneric species are quite sterile and others quite fertile with their own pollen from these several causes we often find within the same genus species which do not produce seeds while others produce an abundance when insects are excluded some species bear cleistogene flowers which cannot be crossed as well as perfect flowers whilst others in the same genus never produce cleistogene flowers some species exist under two forms the one bearing conspicuous flowers adapted for crossfertilisation the other bearing inconspicuous flowers adapted for selffertilisation whilst other species in the same genus present only a single form even with the individuals of the same species the degree of selfsterility varies greatly as in reseda with polygamous plants the distribution of the sexes differs in the individuals of the same species the relative period at which the sexual elements in the same flower are mature differs in the varieties of pelargonium and carriere gives several cases showing that the period varies according to the temperature to which the plants are exposed 127 des varieties 1865 page 30  this extraordinary diversity in the means for favouring or preventing cross and selffertilisation in closely allied forms probably depends on the results of both processes being highly beneficial to the species but directly opposed in many ways to one another and dependent on variable conditions selffertilisation assures the production of a large supply of seeds and the necessity or advantage of this will be determined by the average length of life of the plant which largely depends on the amount of destruction suffered by the seeds and seedlings this destruction follows from the most various and variable causes such as the presence of animals of several kinds and the growth of surrounding plants the possibility of crossfertilisation depends mainly on the presence and number of certain insects often of insects belonging to special groups and on the degree to which they are attracted to the flowers of any particular species in preference to other flowersall circumstances likely to change moreover the advantages which follow from crossfertilisation differ much in different plants so that it is probable that allied plants would often profit in different degrees by crossfertilisation under these extremely complex and fluctuating conditions with two somewhat opposed ends to be gained namely the safe propagation of the species and the production of crossfertilised vigorous offspring it is not surprising that allied forms should exhibit an extreme diversity in the means which favour either end if as there is reason to suspect selffertilisation is in some respects beneficial although more than counterbalanced by the advantages derived from a cross with a fresh stock the problem becomes still more complicated  as i only twice experimented on more than a single species in a genus i cannot say whether the crossed offspring of the several species within the same genus differ in their degree of superiority over their selffertilised brethren but i should expect that this would often prove to be the case from what was observed with the two species of lobelia and with the individuals of the same species of nicotiana the species belonging to distinct genera in the same family certainly differ in this respect the effects of cross and selffertilisation may be confined either to the growth or to the fertility of the offspring but generally extends to both qualities there does not seem to exist any close correspondence between the degree to which their offspring profit by this process but we may easily err on this head as there are two means for ensuring crossfertilisation which are not externally perceptible namely selfsterility and the prepotent fertilising influence of pollen from another individual lastly it has been shown in a former chapter that the effect produced by cross and selffertilisation on the fertility of the parentplants does not always correspond with that produced on the height vigour and fertility of their offspring the same remark applies to crossed and selffertilised seedlings when these are used as the parentplants this want of correspondence probably depends at least in part on the number of seeds produced being chiefly determined by the number of the pollentubes which reach the ovules and this will be governed by the reaction between the pollen and the stigmatic secretion or tissues whereas the growth and constitutional vigour of the offspring will be chiefly determined not only by the number of pollentubes reaching the ovules but by the nature of the reaction between the contents of the pollengrains and ovules  there are two other important conclusions which may be deduced from my observations firstly that the advantages of crossfertilisation do not follow from some mysterious virtue in the mere union of two distinct individuals but from such individuals having been subjected during previous generations to different conditions or to their having varied in a manner commonly called spontaneous so that in either case their sexual elements have been in some degree differentiated and secondly that the injury from selffertilisation follows from the want of such differentiation in the sexual elements these two propositions are fully established by my experiments thus when plants of the ipomoea and of the mimulus which had been selffertilised for the seven previous generations and had been kept all the time under the same conditions were intercrossed one with another the offspring did not profit in the least by the cross mimulus offers another instructive case showing that the benefit of a cross depends on the previous treatment of the progenitors plants which had been selffertilised for the eight previous generations were crossed with plants which had been intercrossed for the same number of generations all having been kept under the same conditions as far as possible seedlings from this cross were grown in competition with others derived from the same selffertilised motherplant crossed by a fresh stock and the latter seedlings were to the former in height as 100 to 52 and in fertility as 100 to 4 an exactly parallel experiment was tried on dianthus with this difference that the plants had been selffertilised only for the three previous generations and the result was similar though not so strongly marked the foregoing two cases of the offspring of ipomoea and eschscholtzia derived from a cross with a fresh stock being as much superior to the intercrossed plants of the old stock as these latter were to the selffertilised offspring strongly supports the same conclusion a cross with a fresh stock or with another variety seems to be always highly beneficial whether or not the motherplants have been intercrossed or selffertilised for several previous generations the fact that a cross between two flowers on the same plant does no good or very little good is likewise a strong corroboration of our conclusion for the sexual elements in the flowers on the same plant can rarely have been differentiated though this is possible as flowerbuds are in one sense distinct individuals sometimes varying and differing from one another in structure or constitution thus the proposition that the benefit from crossfertilisation depends on the plants which are crossed having been subjected during previous generations to somewhat different conditions or to their having varied from some unknown cause as if they had been thus subjected is securely fortified on all sides  before proceeding any further the view which has been maintained by several physiologists must be noticed namely that all the evils from breeding animals too closely and no doubt as they would say from the selffertilisation of plants is the result of the increase of some morbid tendency or weakness of constitution common to the closely related parents or to the two sexes of hermaphrodite plants undoubtedly injury has often thus resulted but it is a vain attempt to extend this view to the numerous cases given in my tables it should be remembered that the same motherplant was both selffertilised and crossed so that if she had been unhealthy she would have transmitted half her morbid tendencies to her crossed offspring but plants appearing perfectly healthy some of them growing wild or the immediate offspring of wild plants or vigorous common gardenplants were selected for experiment considering the number of species which were tried it is nothing less than absurd to suppose that in all these cases the motherplants though not appearing in any way diseased were weak or unhealthy in so peculiar a manner that their selffertilised seedlings many hundreds in number were rendered inferior in height weight constitutional vigour and fertility to their crossed offspring moreover this belief cannot be extended to the strongly marked advantages which invariably follow as far as my experience serves from intercrossing the individuals of the same variety or of distinct varieties if these have been subjected during some generations to different conditions  it is obvious that the exposure of two sets of plants during several generations to different conditions can lead to no beneficial results as far as crossing is concerned unless their sexual elements are thus affected that every organism is acted on to a certain extent by a change in its environment will not i presume be disputed it is hardly necessary to advance evidence on this head we can perceive the difference between individual plants of the same species which have grown in somewhat more shady or sunny dry or damp places plants which have been propagated for some generations under different climates or at different seasons of the year transmit different constitutions to their seedlings under such circumstances the chemical constitution of their fluids and the nature of their tissues are often modified 128 numerous cases together with references are given in my variation under domestication chapter 23 2nd edition volume 2 page 264 with respect to animals mr brackenridge a contribution to the theory of diathesis edinburgh 1869 has well shown that the different organs of animals are excited into different degrees of activity by differences of temperature and food and become to a certain extent adapted to them many other such facts could be adduced in short every alteration in the function of a part is probably connected with some corresponding though often quite imperceptible change in structure or composition  whatever affects an organism in any way likewise tends to act on its sexual elements we see this in the inheritance of newly acquired modifications such as those from the increased use or disuse of a part and even from mutilations if followed by disease 129 variation under domestication chapter 12 2nd edition volume 1 page 466 we have abundant evidence how susceptible the reproductive system is to changed conditions in the many instances of animals rendered sterile by confinement so that they will not unite or if they unite do not produce offspring though the confinement may be far from close and of plants rendered sterile by cultivation but hardly any cases afford more striking evidence how powerfully a change in the conditions of life acts on the sexual elements than those already given of plants which are completely selfsterile in one country and when brought to another yield even in the first generation a fair supply of selffertilised seeds  but it may be said granting that changed conditions act on the sexual elements how can two or more plants growing close together either in their native country or in a garden be differently acted on inasmuch as they appear to be exposed to exactly the same conditions although this question has been already considered it deserves further consideration under several points of view in my experiments with digitalis purpurea some flowers on a wild plant were selffertilised and others were crossed with pollen from another plant growing within two or three feets distance the crossed and selffertilised plants raised from the seeds thus obtained produced flowerstems in number as 100 to 47 and in average height as 100 to 70 therefore the cross between these two plants was highly beneficial but how could their sexual elements have been differentiated by exposure to different conditions if the progenitors of the two plants had lived on the same spot during the last score of generations and had never been crossed with any plant beyond the distance of a few feet in all probability their offspring would have been reduced to the same state as some of the plants in my experimentssuch as the intercrossed plants of the ninth generation of ipomoeaor the selffertilised plants of the eighth generation of mimulusor the offspring from flowers on the same plantand in this case a cross between the two plants of digitalis would have done no good but seeds are often widely dispersed by natural means and one of the above two plants or one of their ancestors may have come from a distance from a more shady or sunny dry or moist place or from a different kind of soil containing other organic or inorganic matter we know from the admirable researches of messrs lawes and gilbert that different plants require and consume very different amounts of inorganic matter 1210 journal of the royal agricultural society of england volume 24 part 1 but the amount in the soil would probably not make so great a difference to the several individuals of any particular species as might at first be expected for the surrounding species with different requirements would tend from existing in greater or lesser numbers to keep each species in a sort of equilibrium with respect to what it could obtain from the soil so it would be even with respect to moisture during dry seasons and how powerful is the influence of a little more or less moisture in the soil on the presence and distribution of plants is often well shown in old pasture fields which still retain traces of former ridges and furrows nevertheless as the proportional numbers of the surrounding plants in two neighbouring places is rarely exactly the same the individuals of the same species will be subjected to somewhat different conditions with respect to what they can absorb from the soil it is surprising how the free growth of one set of plants affects others growing mingled with them i allowed the plants on rather more than a square yard of turf which had been closely mown for several years to grow up and nine species out of twenty were thus exterminated but whether this was altogether due to the kinds which grew up robbing the others of nutriment i do not know  seeds often lie dormant for several years in the ground and germinate when brought near the surface by any means as by burrowing animals they would probably be affected by the mere circumstance of having long lain dormant for gardeners believe that the production of double flowers and of fruit is thus influenced seeds moreover which were matured during different seasons will have been subjected during the whole course of their development to different degrees of heat and moisture  it was shown in the last chapter that pollen is often carried by insects to a considerable distance from plant to plant therefore one of the parents or ancestors of our two plants of digitalis may have been crossed by a distant plant growing under somewhat different conditions plants thus crossed often produce an unusually large number of seeds a striking instance of this fact is afforded by the bignonia previously mentioned which was fertilised by fritz muller with pollen from some adjoining plants and set hardly any seed but when fertilised with pollen from a distant plant was highly fertile seedlings from a cross of this kind grow with great vigour and transmit their vigour to their descendants these therefore in the struggle for life will generally beat and exterminate the seedlings from plants which have long grown near together under the same conditions and will thus tend to spread  when two varieties which present wellmarked differences are crossed their descendants in the later generations differ greatly from one another in external characters and this is due to the augmentation or obliteration of some of these characters and to the reappearance of former ones through reversion and so it will be as we may feel almost sure with any slight differences in the constitution of their sexual elements anyhow my experiments indicate that crossing plants which have been long subjected to almost though not quite the same conditions is the most powerful of all the means for retaining some degree of differentiation in the sexual elements as shown by the superiority in the later generations of the intercrossed over the selffertilised seedlings nevertheless the continued intercrossing of plants thus treated does tend to obliterate such differentiation as may be inferred from the lessened benefit derived from intercrossing such plants in comparison with that from a cross with a fresh stock it seems probable as i may add that seeds have acquired their endless curious adaptations for wide dissemination not only that the seedlings would thus be enabled to find new and fitting homes but that the individuals which have been long subjected to the same conditions should occasionally intercross with a fresh stock 1211 see professor hildebrands excellent treatise verbreitungsmittel der pflanzen 1873  from the foregoing several considerations we may i think conclude that in the above case of the digitalis and even in that of plants which have grown for thousands of generations in the same district as must often have occurred with species having a much restricted range we are apt to overestimate the degree to which the individuals have been subjected to absolutely the same conditions there is at least no difficulty in believing that such plants have been subjected to sufficiently distinct conditions to differentiate their sexual elements for we know that a plant propagated for some generations in another garden in the same district serves as a fresh stock and has high fertilising powers the curious cases of plants which can fertilise and be fertilised by any other individual of the same species but are altogether sterile with their own pollen become intelligible if the view here propounded is correct namely that the individuals of the same species growing in a state of nature near together have not really been subjected during several previous generations to quite the same conditions  some naturalists assume that there is an innate tendency in all beings to vary and to advance in organisation independently of external agencies and they would i presume thus explain the slight differences which distinguish all the individuals of the same species both in external characters and in constitution as well as the greater differences in both respects between nearly allied varieties no two individuals can be found quite alike thus if we sow a number of seeds from the same capsule under as nearly as possible the same conditions they germinate at different rates and grow more or less vigorously they resist cold and other unfavourable conditions differently they would in all probability as we know to be the case with animals of the same species be somewhat differently acted on by the same poison or by the same disease they have different powers of transmitting their characters to their offspring and many analogous facts could be given 1212 vilmorin as quoted by verlot des varieties pages 32 38 39 now if it were true that plants growing near together in a state of nature had been subjected during many previous generations to absolutely the same conditions such differences as those just specified would be quite inexplicable but they are to a certain extent intelligible in accordance with the views just advanced  as most of the plants on which i experimented were grown in my garden or in pots under glass a few words must be added on the conditions to which they were exposed as well as on the effects of cultivation when a species is first brought under culture it may or may not be subjected to a change of climate but it is always grown in ground broken up and more or less manured it is also saved from competition with other plants the paramount importance of this latter circumstance is proved by the multitude of species which flourish and multiply in a garden but cannot exist unless they are protected from other plants when thus saved from competition they are able to get whatever they require from the soil probably often in excess and they are thus subjected to a great change of conditions it is probably in chief part owing to this cause that all plants with rare exceptions vary after being cultivated for some generations the individuals which have already begun to vary will intercross one with another by the aid of insects and this accounts for the extreme diversity of character which many of our long cultivated plants exhibit but it should be observed that the result will be largely determined by the degree of their variability and by the frequency of the intercrosses for if a plant varies very little like most species in a state of nature frequent intercrosses tend to give uniformity of character to it  i have attempted to show that with plants growing naturally in the same district except in the unusual case of each individual being surrounded by exactly the same proportional numbers of other species having certain powers of absorption each will be subjected to slightly different conditions this does not apply to the individuals of the same species when cultivated in cleared ground in the same garden but if their flowers are visited by insects they will intercross and this will give to their sexual elements during a considerable number of generations a sufficient amount of differentiation for a cross to be beneficial moreover seeds are frequently exchanged or procured from other gardens having a different kind of soil and the individuals of the same cultivated species will thus be subjected to a change of conditions if the flowers are not visited by our native insects or very rarely so as in the case of the common and sweet pea and apparently in that of the tobacco when kept in a hothouse any differentiation in the sexual elements caused by intercrosses will tend to disappear this appears to have occurred with the plants just mentioned for they were not benefited by being crossed one with another though they were greatly benefited by a cross with a fresh stock  i have been led to the views just advanced with respect to the causes of the differentiation of the sexual elements and of the variability of our garden plants by the results of my various experiments and more especially by the four cases in which extremely inconstant species after having been selffertilised and grown under closely similar conditions for several generations produced flowers of a uniform and constant tint these conditions were nearly the same as those to which plants growing in a garden clear of weeds are subjected if they are propagated by selffertilised seeds on the same spot the plants in pots were however exposed to less severe fluctuations of climate than those out of doors but their conditions though closely uniform for all the individuals of the same generation differed somewhat in the successive generations now under these circumstances the sexual elements of the plants which were intercrossed in each generation retained sufficient differentiation during several years for their offspring to be superior to the selffertilised but this superiority gradually and manifestly decreased as was shown by the difference in the result between a cross with one of the intercrossed plants and with a fresh stock these intercrossed plants tended also in a few cases to become somewhat more uniform in some of their external characters than they were at first with respect to the plants which were selffertilised in each generation their sexual elements apparently lost after some years all differentiation for a cross between them did no more good than a cross between the flowers on the same plant but it is a still more remarkable fact that although the seedlings of mimulus ipomoea dianthus and petunia which were first raised varied excessively in the colour of their flowers their offspring after being selffertilised and grown under uniform conditions for some generations bore flowers almost as uniform in tint as those on a natural species in one case also the plants themselves became remarkably uniform in height  the conclusion that the advantages of a cross depend altogether on the differentiation of the sexual elements harmonises perfectly with the fact that an occasional and slight change in the conditions of life is beneficial to all plants and animals 1213 i have given sufficient evidence on this head in my variation under domestication chapter 18 volume 2 2nd edition page 127 but the offspring from a cross between organisms which have been exposed to different conditions profit in an incomparably higher degree than do young or old beings from a mere change in the conditions in this latter case we never see anything like the effect which generally follows from a cross with another individual especially from a cross with a fresh stock this might perhaps have been expected for the blending together of the sexual elements of two differentiated beings will affect the whole constitution at a very early period of life whilst the organisation is highly flexible we have moreover reason to believe that changed conditions generally act differently on the several parts or organs of the same individual 1214 see for instance brackenridge theory of diathesis edinburgh 1869 and if we may further believe that these now slightly differentiated parts react on one another the harmony between the beneficial effects on the individual due to changed conditions and those due to the interaction of differentiated sexual elements becomes still closer  that wonderfully accurate observer sprengel who first showed how important a part insects play in the fertilisation of flowers called his book the secret of nature displayed yet he only occasionally saw that the object for which so many curious and beautiful adaptations have been acquired was the crossfertilisation of distinct plants and he knew nothing of the benefits which the offspring thus receive in growth vigour and fertility but the veil of secrecy is as yet far from lifted nor will it be until we can say why it is beneficial that the sexual elements should be differentiated to a certain extent and why if the differentiation be carried still further injury follows it is an extraordinary fact that with many species flowers fertilised with their own pollen are either absolutely or in some degree sterile if fertilised with pollen from another flower on the same plant they are sometimes though rarely a little more fertile if fertilised with pollen from another individual or variety of the same species they are fully fertile but if with pollen from a distinct species they are sterile in all possible degrees until utter sterility is reached we thus have a long series with absolute sterility at the two endsat one end due to the sexual elements not having been sufficiently differentiated and at the other end to their having been differentiated in too great a degree or in some peculiar manner  the fertilisation of one of the higher plants depends in the first place on the mutual action of the pollengrains and the stigmatic secretion or tissues and afterwards on the mutual action of the contents of the pollengrains and ovules both actions judging from the increased fertility of the parentplants and from the increased powers of growth in the offspring are favoured by some degree of differentiation in the elements which interact and unite so as to form a new being here we have some analogy with chemical affinity or attraction which comes into play only between atoms or molecules of a different nature as professor miller remarks generally speaking the greater the difference in the properties of two bodies the more intense is their tendency to mutual chemical actionbut between bodies of a similar character the tendency to unite is feeble 1215 elements of chemistry 4th edition 1867 part 1 page 11 dr frankland informs me that similar views with respect to chemical affinity are generally accepted by chemists this latter proposition accords well with the feeble effects of a plants own pollen on the fertility of the motherplant and on the growth of the offspring and the former proposition accords well with the powerful influence in both ways of pollen from an individual which has been differentiated by exposure to changed conditions or by socalled spontaneous variation but the analogy fails when we turn to the negative or weak effects of pollen from one species on a distinct species for although some substances which are extremely dissimilar for instance carbon and chlorine have a very feeble affinity for each other yet it cannot be said that the weakness of the affinity depends in such cases on the extent to which the substances differ it is not known why a certain amount of differentiation is necessary or favourable for the chemical affinity or union of two substances any more than for the fertilisation or union of two organisms  mr herbert spencer has discussed this whole subject at great length and after stating that all the forces throughout nature tend towards an equilibrium remarks that the need of this union of spermcell and germccell is the need for overthrowing this equilibrium and reestablishing active molecular change in the detached germa result which is probably effected by mixing the slightlydifferent physiological units of slightlydifferent individuals 1216 principles of biology volume 1 page 274 1864 in my origin of species published in 1859 i spoke of the good effects from slight changes in the condition of life and from crossfertilisation and of the evil effects from great changes in the conditions and from crossing widely distinct forms ie species as a series of facts connected together by some common but unknown bond which is essentially related to the principle of life but we must not allow this highly generalised view or the analogy of chemical affinity to conceal from us our ignorance we do not know what is the nature or degree of the differentiation in the sexual elements which is favourable for union and what is injurious for union as in the case of distinct species we cannot say why the individuals of certain species profit greatly and others very little by being crossed there are some few species which have been selffertilised for a vast number of generations and yet are vigorous enough to compete successfully with a host of surrounding plants we can form no conception why the advantage from a cross is sometimes directed exclusively to the vegetative system and sometimes to the reproductive system but commonly to both it is equally inconceivable why some individuals of the same species should be sterile whilst others are fully fertile with their own pollen why a change of climate should either lessen or increase the sterility of selfsterile species and why the individuals of some species should be even more fertile with pollen from a distinct species than with their own pollen and so it is with many other facts which are so obscure that we stand in awe before the mystery of life  under a practical point of view agriculturists and horticulturists may learn something from the conclusions at which we have arrived firstly we see that the injury from the close breeding of animals and from the selffertilisation of plants does not necessarily depend on any tendency to disease or weakness of constitution common to the related parents and only indirectly on their relationship in so far as they are apt to resemble each other in all respects including their sexual nature and secondly that the advantages of crossfertilisation depend on the sexual elements of the parents having become in some degree differentiated by the exposure of their progenitors to different conditions or from their having intercrossed with individuals thus exposed or lastly from what we call in our ignorance spontaneous variation he therefore who wishes to pair closely related animals ought to keep them under conditions as different as possible some few breeders guided by their keen powers of observation have acted on this principle and have kept stocks of the same animals at two or more distant and differently situated farms they have then coupled the individuals from these farms with excellent results 1217 variation of animals and plants under domestication chapter 17 2nd edition volume 2 pages 98 105 this same plan is also unconsciously followed whenever the males reared in one place are let out for propagation to breeders in other places as some kinds of plants suffer much more from selffertilisation than do others so it probably is with animals from too close interbreeding the effects of close interbreeding on animals judging again from plants would be deterioration in general vigour including fertility with no necessary loss of excellence of form and this seems to be the usual result  it is a common practice with horticulturists to obtain seeds from another place having a very different soil so as to avoid raising plants for a long succession of generations under the same conditions but with all the species which freely intercross by aid of insects or the wind it would be an incomparably better plan to obtain seeds of the required variety which had been raised for some generations under as different conditions as possible and sow them in alternate rows with seeds matured in the old garden the two stocks would then intercross with a thorough blending of their whole organisations and with no loss of purity to the variety and this would yield far more favourable results than a mere exchange of seeds we have seen in my experiments how wonderfully the offspring profited in height weight hardiness and fertility by crosses of this kind for instance plants of ipomoea thus crossed were to the intercrossed plants of the same stock with which they grew in competition as 100 to 78 in height and as 100 to 51 in fertility and plants of eschscholtzia similarly compared were as 100 to 45 in fertility in comparison with selffertilised plants the results are still more striking thus cabbages derived from a cross with a fresh stock were to the selffertilised as 100 to 22 in weight  florists may learn from the four cases which have been fully described that they have the power of fixing each fleeting variety of colour if they will fertilise the flowers of the desired kind with their own pollen for halfadozen generations and grow the seedlings under the same conditions but a cross with any other individual of the same variety must be carefully prevented as each has its own peculiar constitution after a dozen generations of selffertilisation it is probable that the new variety would remain constant even if grown under somewhat different conditions and there would no longer be any necessity to guard against intercrosses between the individuals of the same variety  with respect to mankind my son george has endeavoured to discover by a statistical investigation whether the marriages of first cousins are at all injurious although this is a degree of relationship which would not be objected to in our domestic animals and he has come to the conclusion from his own researches and those of dr mitchell that the evidence as to any evil thus caused is conflicting but on the whole points to its being very small from the facts given in this volume we may infer that with mankind the marriages of nearly related persons some of whose parents and ancestors had lived under very different conditions would be much less injurious than that of persons who had always lived in the same place and followed the same habits of life nor can i see reason to doubt that the widely different habits of life of men and women in civilised nations especially amongst the upper classes would tend to counterbalance any evil from marriages between healthy and somewhat closely related persons  under a theoretical point of view it is some gain to science to know that numberless structures in hermaphrodite plants and probably in hermaphrodite animals are special adaptations for securing an occasional cross between two individuals and that the advantages from such a cross depend altogether on the beings which are united or their progenitors having had their sexual elements somewhat differentiated so that the embryo is benefited in the same manner as is a mature plant or animal by a slight change in its conditions of life although in a much higher degree  another and more important result may be deduced from my observations eggs and seeds are highly serviceable as a means of dissemination but we now know that fertile eggs can be produced without the aid of the male there are also many other methods by which organisms can be propagated asexually why then have the two sexes been developed and why do males exist which cannot themselves produce offspring the answer lies as i can hardly doubt in the great good which is derived from the fusion of two somewhat differentiated individuals and with the exception of the lowest organisms this is possible only by means of the sexual elements these consisting of cells separated from the body containing the germs of every part and capable of being fused completely together  it has been shown in the present volume that the offspring from the union of two distinct individuals especially if their progenitors have been subjected to very different conditions have an immense advantage in height weight constitutional vigour and fertility over the selffertilised offspring from one of the same parents and this fact is amply sufficient to account for the development of the sexual elements that is for the genesis of the two sexes  it is a different question why the two sexes are sometimes combined in the same individual and are sometimes separated as with many of the lowest plants and animals the conjugation of two individuals which are either quite similar or in some degree different is a common phenomenon it seems probable as remarked in the last chapter that the sexes were primordially separate the individual which receives the contents of the other may be called the female and the other which is often smaller and more locomotive may be called the male though these sexual names ought hardly to be applied as long as the whole contents of the two forms are blended into one the object gained by the two sexes becoming united in the same hermaphrodite form probably is to allow of occasional or frequent selffertilisation so as to ensure the propagation of the species more especially in the case of organisms affixed for life to the same spot there does not seem to be any great difficulty in understanding how an organism formed by the conjugation of two individuals which represented the two incipient sexes might have given rise by budding first to a monoecious and then to an hermaphrodite form and in the case of animals even without budding to an hermaphrodite form for the bilateral structure of animals perhaps indicates that they were aboriginally formed by the fusion of two individuals  it is a more difficult problem why some plants and apparently all the higher animals after becoming hermaphrodites have since had their sexes reseparated this separation has been attributed by some naturalists to the advantages which follow from a division of physiological labour the principle is intelligible when the same organ has to perform at the same time diverse functions but it is not obvious why the male and female glands when placed in different parts of the same compound or simple individual should not perform their functions equally well as when placed in two distinct individuals in some instances the sexes may have been reseparated for the sake of preventing too frequent selffertilisation but this explanation does not seem probable as the same end might have been gained by other and simpler means for instance dichogamy it may be that the production of the male and female reproductive elements and the maturation of the ovules was too great a strain and expenditure of vital force for a single individual to withstand if endowed with a highly complex organisation and that at the same time there was no need for all the individuals to produce young and consequently that no injury on the contrary good resulted from half of them or the males failing to produce offspring  there is another subject on which some light is thrown by the facts given in this volume namely hybridisation it is notorious that when distinct species of plants are crossed they produce with the rarest exceptions fewer seeds than the normal number this unproductiveness varies in different species up to sterility so complete that not even an empty capsule is formed and all experimentalists have found that it is much influenced by the conditions to which the crossed species are subjected the pollen of each species is strongly prepotent over that of any other species so that if a plants own pollen is placed on the stigma some time after foreign pollen has been applied to it any effect from the latter is quite obliterated it is also notorious that not only the parent species but the hybrids raised from them are more or less sterile and that their pollen is often in a more or less aborted condition the degree of sterility of various hybrids does not always strictly correspond with the degree of difficulty in uniting the parent forms when hybrids are capable of breeding inter se their descendants are more or less sterile and they often become still more sterile in the later generations but then close interbreeding has hitherto been practised in all such cases the more sterile hybrids are sometimes much dwarfed in stature and have a feeble constitution other facts could be given but these will suffice for us naturalists formerly attributed all these results to the difference between species being fundamentally distinct from that between the varieties of the same species and this is still the verdict of some naturalists  the results of my experiments in selffertilising and crossfertilising the individuals or the varieties of the same species are strikingly analogous with those just given though in a reversed manner with the majority of species flowers fertilised with their own pollen yield fewer sometimes much fewer seeds than those fertilised with pollen from another individual or variety some selffertilised flowers are absolutely sterile but the degree of their sterility is largely determined by the conditions to which the parent plants have been exposed as was well exemplified in the case of eschscholtzia and abutilon the effects of pollen from the same plant are obliterated by the prepotent influence of pollen from another individual or variety although the latter may have been placed on the stigma some hours afterwards the offspring from selffertilised flowers are themselves more or less sterile sometimes highly sterile and their pollen is sometimes in an imperfect condition but i have not met with any case of complete sterility in selffertilised seedlings as is so common with hybrids the degree of their sterility does not correspond with that of the parentplants when first selffertilised the offspring of selffertilised plants suffer in stature weight and constitutional vigour more frequently and in a greater degree than do the hybrid offspring of the greater number of crossed species decreased height is transmitted to the next generation but i did not ascertain whether this applies to decreased fertility  i have elsewhere shown that by uniting in various ways dimorphic or trimorphic heterostyled plants which belong to the same undoubted species we get another series of results exactly parallel with those from crossing distinct species 1218 journal of the linnean society botany volume 10 1867 page 393 plants illegitimately fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant belonging to the same form yield fewer often much fewer seeds than they do when legitimately fertilised with pollen from a plant belonging to a distinct form they sometimes yield no seed not even an empty capsule like a species fertilised with pollen from a distinct genus the degree of sterility is much affected by the conditions to which the plants have been subjected 1219 journal of the linnean society botany volume 8 1864 page 180 the pollen from a distinct form is strongly prepotent over that from the same form although the former may have been placed on the stigma many hours afterwards the offspring from a union between plants of the same form are more or less sterile like hybrids and have their pollen in a more or less aborted condition and some of the seedlings are as barren and as dwarfed as the most barren hybrid they also resemble hybrids in several other respects which need not here be specified in detailsuch as their sterility not corresponding in degree with that of the parent plantsthe unequal sterility of the latter when reciprocally unitedand the varying sterility of the seedlings raised from the same seedcapsule  we thus have two grand classes of cases giving results which correspond in the most striking manner with those which follow from the crossing of socalled true and distinct species with respect to the difference between seedlings raised from cross and selffertilised flowers there is good evidence that this depends altogether on whether the sexual elements of the parents have been sufficiently differentiated by exposure to different conditions or by spontaneous variation it is probable that nearly the same conclusion may be extended to heterostyled plants but this is not the proper place for discussing the origin of the longstyled shortstyled and midstyled forms which all belong to the same species as certainly as do the two sexes of the same species we have therefore no right to maintain that the sterility of species when first crossed and of their hybrid offspring is determined by some cause fundamentally different from that which determines the sterility of the individuals both of ordinary and of heterostyled plants when united in various ways nevertheless i am aware that it will take many years to remove this prejudice  there is hardly anything more wonderful in nature than the sensitiveness of the sexual elements to external influences and the delicacy of their affinities we see this in slight changes in the conditions of life being favourable to the fertility and vigour of the parents while certain other and not great changes cause them to be quite sterile without any apparent injury to their health we see how sensitive the sexual elements of those plants must be which are completely sterile with their own pollen but are fertile with that of any other individual of the same species such plants become either more or less selfsterile if subjected to changed conditions although the change may be far from great the ovules of a heterostyled trimorphic plant are affected very differently by pollen from the three sets of stamens belonging to the same species with ordinary plants the pollen of another variety or merely of another individual of the same variety is often strongly prepotent over its own pollen when both are placed at the same time on the same stigma in those great families of plants containing many thousand allied species the stigma of each distinguishes with unerring certainty its own pollen from that of every other species  there can be no doubt that the sterility of distinct species when first crossed and of their hybrid offspring depends exclusively on the nature or affinities of their sexual elements we see this in the want of any close correspondence between the degree of sterility and the amount of external difference in the species which are crossed and still more clearly in the wide difference in the results of crossing reciprocally the same two speciesthat is when species a is crossed with pollen from b and then b is crossed with pollen from a bearing in mind what has just been said on the extreme sensitiveness and delicate affinities of the reproductive system why should we feel any surprise at the sexual elements of those forms which we call species having been differentiated in such a manner that they are incapable or only feebly capable of acting on one another we know that species have generally lived under the same conditions and have retained their own proper characters for a much longer period than varieties longcontinued domestication eliminates as i have shown in my variation under domestication the mutual sterility which distinct species lately taken from a state of nature almost always exhibit when intercrossed and we can thus understand the fact that the most different domestic races of animals are not mutually sterile but whether this holds good with cultivated varieties of plants is not known though some facts indicate that it does the elimination of sterility through longcontinued domestication may probably be attributed to the varying conditions to which our domestic animals have been subjected and no doubt it is owing to this same cause that they withstand great and sudden changes in their conditions of life with far less loss of fertility than do natural species from these several considerations it appears probable that the difference in the affinities of the sexual elements of distinct species on which their mutual incapacity for breeding together depends is caused by their having been habituated for a very long period each to its own conditions and to the sexual elements having thus acquired firmly fixed affinities however this may be with the two great classes of cases before us namely those relating to the selffertilisation and crossfertilisation of the individuals of the same species and those relating to the illegitimate and legitimate unions of heterostyled plants it is quite unjustifiable to assume that the sterility of species when first crossed and of their hybrid offspring indicates that they differ in some fundamental manner from the varieties or individuals of the same species    index  abutilon darwinii selfsterile in brazil moderately
