11695257	the lone star ranger  by zane grey              to           captain john hughes           and his texas rangers   it may seem strange to you that out of all the stories i heard on the rio grande i should choose as first that of buck duaneoutlaw and gunman  but indeed ranger coffees story of the last of the duanes has haunted me and i have given full rein to imagination and have retold it in my own way it deals with the old lawthe old border daystherefore it is better first soon perchance i shall have the pleasure of writing of the border of today which in joe sitters laconic speech shore is most as bad an wild as ever  in the north and east there is a popular idea that the frontier of the west is a thing long past and remembered now only in stories as i think of this i remember ranger sitter when he made that remark while he grimly stroked an unhealed bullet wound and i remember the giant vaughn that typical son of stalwart texas sitting there quietly with bandaged head his thoughtful eye boding ill to the outlaw who had ambushed him only a few months have passed since thenwhen i had my memorable sojourn with youand yet in that short time russell and moore have crossed the divide like rangers  gentlemeni have the honor to dedicate this book to you and the hope that it shall fall to my lot to tell the world the truth about a strange unique and misunderstood body of menthe texas rangerswho made the great lone star state habitable who never know peaceful rest and sleep who are passing who surely will not be forgotten and will some day come into their own  zane grey     book i the outlaw    chapter i  so it was in him thenan inherited fighting instinct a driving intensity to kill he was the last of the duanes that old fighting stock of texas but not the memory of his dead father nor the pleading of his softvoiced mother nor the warning of this uncle who stood before him now had brought to buck duane so much realization of the dark passionate strain in his blood it was the recurrence a hundredfold increased in power of a strange emotion that for the last three years had arisen in him  yes cal bains in town full of bad whisky an huntin for you repeated the elder man gravely  its the second time muttered duane as if to himself  son you cant avoid a meetin leave town till cal sobers up he aint got it in for you when hes not drinkin  but whats he want me for demanded duane to insult me again i wont stand that twice  hes got a fever thats rampant in texas these days my boy he wants gunplay if he meets you hell try to kill you  here it stirred in duane again that bursting gush of blood like a wind of flame shaking all his inner being and subsiding to leave him strangely chilled  kill me what for he asked  lord knows there aint any reason but whats that to do with most of the shootin these days didnt five cowboys over to everalls kill one another dead all because they got to jerkin at a quirt among themselves an cal has no reason to love you his girl was sweet on you  i quit when i found out she was his girl  i reckon she aint quit but never mind her or reasons cals here just drunk enough to be ugly hes achin to kill somebody hes one of them fourflush gunfighters hed like to be thought bad theres a lot of wild cowboys whore ambitious for a reputation they talk about how quick they are on the draw t hey ape bland an king fisher an hardin an all the big outlaws they make threats about joinin the gangs along the rio grande they laugh at the sheriffs an brag about how theyd fix the rangers cals sure not much for you to bother with if you only keep out of his way  you mean for me to run asked duane in scorn  i reckon i wouldnt put it that way just avoid him buck im not afraid cal would get you if you met down there in town youve your fathers eye an his slick hand with a gun what im most afraid of is that youll kill bain  duane was silent letting his uncles earnest words sink in trying to realize their significance  if texas ever recovers from that fool war an kills off these outlaws why a young man will have a lookout went on the uncle youre twentythree now an a powerful sight of a fine fellow barrin your temper youve a chance in life but if you go gunfightin if you kill a man youre ruined then youll kill another itll be the same old story an the rangers would make you an outlaw the rangers mean law an order for texas this evenbreak business doesnt work with them if you resist arrest theyll kill you if you submit to arrest then you go to jail an mebbe you hang  id never hang muttered duane darkly  i reckon you wouldnt replied the old man youd be like your father he was ever ready to drawtoo ready in times like these with the texas rangers enforcin the law your dad would have been driven to the river an son im afraid youre a chip off the old block cant you hold inkeep your temperrun away from trouble because itll only result in you gettin the worst of it in the end your father was killed in a streetfight an it was told of him that he shot twice after a bullet had passed through his heart think of the terrible nature of a man to be able to do that if you have any such blood in you never give it a chance  what you say is all very well uncle returned duane but the only way out for me is to run and i wont do it cal bain and his outfit have already made me look like a coward he says im afraid to come out and face him a man simply cant stand that in this country besides cal would shoot me in the back some day if i didnt face him  well then whatre you goin to do inquired the elder man  i havent decidedyet  no but youre comin to it mighty fast that damned spell is workin in you youre different today i remember how you used to be moody an lose your temper an talk wild never was much afraid of you then but now youre gettin cool an quiet an you think deep an i dont like the light in your eye it reminds me of your father  i wonder what dad would say to me today if he were alive and here said duane  what do you think what could you expect of a man who never wore a glove on his right hand for twenty years  well hed hardly have said much dad never talked but he would have done a lot and i guess ill go downtown and let cal bain find me  then followed a long silence during which duane sat with downcast eyes and the uncle appeared lost in sad thought of the future presently he turned to duane with an expression that denoted resignation and yet a spirit which showed wherein they were of the same blood  youve got a fast horsethe fastest i know of in this country after you meet bain hurry back home ill have a saddlebag packed for you and the horse ready  with that he turned on his heel and went into the house leaving duane to revolve in his mind his singular speech buck wondered presently if he shared his uncles opinion of the result of a meeting between himself and bain his thoughts were vague but on the instant of final decision when he had settled with himself that he would meet bain such a storm of passion assailed him that he felt as if he was being shaken with ague yet it was all internal inside his breast for his hand was like a rock and for all he could see not a muscle about him quivered he had no fear of bain or of any other man but a vague fear of himself of this strange force in him made him ponder and shake his head it was as if he had not all to say in this matter there appeared to have been in him a reluctance to let himself go and some voice some spirit from a distance something he was not accountable for had compelled him that hour of duanes life was like years of actual living and in it he became a thoughtful man  he went into the house and buckled on his belt and gun the gun was a colt45 sixshot and heavy with an ivory handle he had packed it on and off for five years before that it had been used by his father there were a number of notches filed in the bulge of the ivory handle this gun was the one his father had fired twice after being shot through the heart and his hand had stiffened so tightly upon it in the deathgrip that his fingers had to be pried open it had never been drawn upon any man since it had come into duanes possession but the cold bright polish of the weapon showed how it had been used duane could draw it with inconceivable rapidity and at twenty feet he could split a card pointing edgewise toward him  duane wished to avoid meeting his mother fortunately as he thought she was away from home he went out and down the path toward the gate the air was full of the fragrance of blossoms and the melody of birds outside in the road a neighbor woman stood talking to a countryman in a wagon they spoke to him and he heard but did not reply then he began to stride down the road toward the town  wellston was a small town but important in that unsettled part of the great state because it was the tradingcenter of several hundred miles of territory on the main street there were perhaps fifty buildings some brick some frame mostly adobe and onethird of the lot and by far the most prosperous were saloons from the road duane turned into this street it was a wide thoroughfare lined by hitchingrails and saddled horses and vehicles of various kinds duanes eye ranged down the street taking in all at a glance particularly persons moving leisurely up and down not a cowboy was in sight duane slackened his stride and by the time he reached sol whites place which was the first saloon he was walking slowly several people spoke to him and turned to look back after they had passed he paused at the door of whites saloon took a sharp survey of the interior then stepped inside  the saloon was large and cool full of men and noise and smoke the noise ceased upon his entrance and the silence ensuing presently broke to the clink of mexican silver dollars at a monte table sol white who was behind the bar straightened up when he saw duane then without speaking he bent over to rinse a glass all eyes except those of the mexican gamblers were turned upon duane and these glances were keen speculative questioning these men knew bain was looking for trouble they probably had heard his boasts but what did duane intend to do several of the cowboys and ranchers present exchanged glances duane had been weighed by unerring texas instinct by men who all packed guns the boy was the son of his father whereupon they greeted him and returned to their drinks and cards sol white stood with his big red hands out upon the bar he was a tall rawboned texan with a long mustache waxed to sharp points  howdy buck was his greeting to duane he spoke carelessly and averted his dark gaze for an instant  howdy sol replied duane slowly say sol i hear theres a gent in town looking for me bad  reckon there is buck replied white he came in heah aboot an hour ago shore he was some riled an aroarin for gore told me confidential a certain party had given you a white silk scarf an he was hellbent on wearin it home spotted red  anybody with him queried duane  burt an sam outcalt an a little cowpuncher i never seen before theyall was coaxin trim to leave town but hes looked on the flowin glass buck an hes heah for keeps  why doesnt sheriff oaks lock him up if hes that bad  oaks went away with the rangers theres been another raid at fleshers ranch the king fisher gang likely an so the towns shore wide open  duane stalked outdoors and faced down the street he walked the whole length of the long block meeting many peoplefarmers ranchers clerks merchants mexicans cowboys and women it was a singular fact that when he turned to retrace his steps the street was almost empty he had not returned a hundred yards on his way when the street was wholly deserted a few heads protruded from doors and around corners that main street of wellston saw some such situation every few days if it was an instinct for texans to fight it was also instinctive for them to sense with remarkable quickness the signs of a coming gunplay rumor could not fly so swiftly in less than ten minutes everybody who had been on the street or in the shops knew that buck duane had come forth to meet his enemy  duane walked on when he came to within fifty paces of a saloon he swerved out into the middle of the street stood there for a moment then went ahead and back to the sidewalk he passed on in this way the length of the block sol white was standing in the door of his saloon  buck im atippin you off he said quick and lowvoiced cal bains over at everalls if hes ahuntin you bad as he brags hell show there  duane crossed the street and started down notwithstanding whites statement duane was wary and slow at every door nothing happened and he traversed almost the whole length of the block without seeing a person everalls place was on the corner  duane knew himself to be cold steady he was conscious of a strange fury that made him want to leap ahead he seemed to long for this encounter more than anything he had ever wanted but vivid as were his sensations he felt as if in a dream  before he reached everalls he heard loud voices one of which was raised high then the short door swung outward as if impelled by a vigorous hand a bowlegged cowboy wearing wooley chaps burst out upon the sidewalk at sight of duane he seemed to bound into the air and he uttered a savage roar  duane stopped in his tracks at the outer edge of the sidewalk perhaps a dozen rods from everalls door  if bain was drunk he did not show it in his movement he swaggered forward rapidly closing up the gap red sweaty disheveled and hatless his face distorted and expressive of the most malignant intent he was a wild and sinister figure he had already killed a man and this showed in his demeanor his hands were extended before him the right hand a little lower than the left at every step he bellowed his rancor in speech mostly curses gradually he slowed his walk then halted a good twentyfive paces separated the men  wont nothin make you draw you he shouted fiercely  im waitin on you cal replied duane  bains right hand stiffenedmoved duane threw his gun as a boy throws a ball underhanda draw his father had taught him he pulled twice his shots almost as one bains big colt boomed while it was pointed downward and he was falling his bullet scattered dust and gravel at duanes feet he fell loosely without contortion  in a flash all was reality for duane he went forward and held his gun ready for the slightest movement on the part of bain but bain lay upon his back and all that moved were his breast and his eyes how strangely the red had left his faceand also the distortion the devil that had showed in bain was gone he was sober and conscious he tried to speak but failed his eyes expressed something pitifully human they changedrolledset blankly  duane drew a deep breath and sheathed his gun he felt calm and cool glad the fray was over one violent expression burst from him the fool  when he looked up there were men around him  plumb center said one  another a cowboy who evidently had just left the gamingtable leaned down and pulled open bains shirt he had the ace of spades in his hand he laid it on bains breast and the black figure on the card covered the two bulletholes just over bains heart  duane wheeled and hurried away he heard another man say  reckon cal got what he deserved buck duanes first gunplay like father like son    chapter ii  a thought kept repeating itself to duane and it was that he might have spared himself concern through his imagining how awful it would be to kill a man he had no such feeling now he had rid the community of a drunken bragging quarrelsome cowboy  when he came to the gate of his home and saw his uncle there with a mettlesome horse saddled with canteen rope and bags all in place a subtle shock pervaded his spirit it had slipped his mindthe consequence of his act but sight of the horse and the look of his uncle recalled the fact that he must now become a fugitive an unreasonable anger took hold of him  the dd fool he exclaimed hotly meeting bain wasnt much uncle jim he dusted my boots thats all and for that ive got to go on the dodge  son you killed himthen asked the uncle huskily  yes i stood over himwatched him die i did as i would have been done by  i knew it long ago i saw it comin but now we cant stop to cry over spilt blood youve got to leave town an this part of the country  mother exclaimed duane  shes away from home you cant wait ill break it to herwhat she always feared  suddenly duane sat down and covered his face with his hands  my god uncle what have i done his broad shoulders shook  listen son an remember what i say replied the elder man earnestly dont ever forget youre not to blame im glad to see you take it this way because maybe youll never grow hard an callous youre not to blame this is texas youre your fathers son these are wild times the law as the rangers are laying it down now cant change life all in a minute even your mother whos a good true woman has had her share in making you what you are this moment for she was one of the pioneersthe fightin pioneers of this state those years of wild times before you was born developed in her instinct to fight to save her life her children an that instinct has cropped out in you it will be many years before it dies out of the boys born in texas  im a murderer said duane shuddering  no son youre not an you never will be but youve got to be an outlaw till time makes it safe for you to come home  an outlaw  i said it if we had money an influence wed risk a trial but weve neither an i reckon the scaffold or jail is no place for buckley duane strike for the wild country an wherever you go an whatever you dobe a man live honestly if thats possible if it isnt be as honest as you can if you have to herd with outlaws try not to become bad there are outlaws who re not all badmany who have been driven to the river by such a deal as this you had when you get among these men avoid brawls dont drink dont gamble i neednt tell you what to do if it comes to gunplay as likely it will you cant come home when this thing is lived down if that time ever comes ill get word into the unsettled country itll reach you some day thats all remember be a man goodby  duane with blurred sight and contracting throat gripped his uncles hand and bade him a wordless farewell then he leaped astride the black and rode out of town  as swiftly as was consistent with a care for his steed duane put a distance of fifteen or eighteen miles behind him with that he slowed up and the matter of riding did not require all his faculties he passed several ranches and was seen by men this did not suit him and he took an old trail across country it was a flat region with a poor growth of mesquite and pricklypear cactus occasionally he caught a glimpse of low hills in the distance he had hunted often in that section and knew where to find grass and water when he reached this higher ground he did not however halt at the first favorable campingspot but went on and on once he came out upon the brow of a hill and saw a considerable stretch of country beneath him it had the gray sameness characterizing all that he had traversed he seemed to want to see wide spacesto get a glimpse of the great wilderness lying somewhere beyond to the southwest it was sunset when he decided to camp at a likely spot he came across he led the horse to water and then began searching through the shallow valley for a suitable place to camp he passed by old campsites that he well remembered these however did not strike his fancy this time and the significance of the change in him did not occur at the moment at last he found a secluded spot under cover of thick mesquites and oaks at a goodly distance from the old trail he took saddle and pack off the horse he looked among his effects for a hobble and finding that his uncle had failed to put one in he suddenly remembered that he seldom used a hobble and never on this horse he cut a few feet off the end of his lasso and used that the horse unused to such hampering of his free movements had to be driven out upon the grass  duane made a small fire prepared and ate his supper this done ending the work of that day he sat down and filled his pipe twilight had waned into dusk a few wan stars had just begun to show and brighten above the low continuous hum of insects sounded the evening carol of robins presently the birds ceased their singing and then the quiet was more noticeable when night set in and the place seemed all the more isolated and lonely for that duane had a sense of relief  it dawned upon him all at once that he was nervous watchful sleepless the fact caused him surprise and he began to think back to take note of his late actions and their motives the change one day had wrought amazed him he who had always been free easy happy especially when out alone in the open had become in a few short hours bound serious preoccupied the silence that had once been sweet now meant nothing to him except a medium whereby he might the better hear the sounds of pursuit the loneliness the night the wild that had always been beautiful to him now only conveyed a sense of safety for the present he watched he listened he thought he felt tired yet had no inclination to rest he intended to be off by dawn heading toward the southwest had he a destination it was vague as his knowledge of that great waste of mesquite and rock bordering the rio grande somewhere out there was a refuge for he was a fugitive from justice an outlaw  this being an outlaw then meant eternal vigilance no home no rest no sleep no content no life worth the living he must be a lone wolf or he must herd among men obnoxious to him if he worked for an honest living he still must hide his identity and take risks of detection if he did not work on some distant outlying ranch how was he to live the idea of stealing was repugnant to him the future seemed gray and somber enough and he was twentythree years old  why had this hard life been imposed upon him  the bitter question seemed to start a strange iciness that stole along his veins what was wrong with him he stirred the few sticks of mesquite into a last flickering blaze he was cold and for some reason he wanted some light the black circle of darkness weighed down upon him closed in around him suddenly he sat bolt upright and then froze in that position he had heard a step it was behind himnoon the side some one was there he forced his hand down to his gun and the touch of cold steel was another icy shock then he waited but all was silentsilent as only a wilderness arroyo can be with its low murmuring of wind in the mesquite had he heard a step he began to breathe again  but what was the matter with the light of his campfire it had taken on a strange green luster and seemed to be waving off into the outer shadows duane heard no step saw no movement nevertheless there was another present at that campfire vigil duane saw him he lay there in the middle of the green brightness prostrate motionless dying cal bain his features were wonderfully distinct clearer than any cameo more sharply outlined than those of any picture it was a hard face softening at the threshold of eternity the red tan of sun the coarse signs of drunkenness the ferocity and hate so characteristic of bain were no longer there this face represented a different bain showed all that was human in him fading fading as swiftly as it blanched white the lips wanted to speak but had not the power the eyes held an agony of thought they revealed what might have been possible for this man if he livedthat he saw his mistake too late then they rolled set blankly and closed in death  that haunting visitation left duane sitting there in a cold sweat a remorse gnawing at his vitals realizing the curse that was on him he divined that never would he be able to keep off that phantom he remembered how his father had been eternally pursued by the furies of accusing guilt how he had never been able to forget in work or in sleep those men he had killed  the hour was late when duanes mind let him sleep and then dreams troubled him in the morning he bestirred himself so early that in the gray gloom he had difficulty in finding his horse day had just broken when he struck the old trail again  he rode hard all morning and halted in a shady spot to rest and graze his horse in the afternoon he took to the trail at an easy trot the country grew wilder bald rugged mountains broke the level of the monotonous horizon about three in the afternoon he came to a little river which marked the boundary line of his hunting territory  the decision he made to travel upstream for a while was owing to two facts the river was high with quicksand bars on each side and he felt reluctant to cross into that region where his presence alone meant that he was a marked man the bottomlands through which the river wound to the southwest were more inviting than the barrens he had traversed the rest or that day he rode leisurely upstream at sunset he penetrated the brakes of willow and cottonwood to spend the night it seemed to him that in this lonely cover he would feel easy and content but he did not every feeling every imagining he had experienced the previous night returned somewhat more vividly and accentuated by newer ones of the same intensity and color  in this kind of travel and camping he spent three more days during which he crossed a number of trails and one road where cattlestolen cattle probablyhad recently passed thus time exhausted his supply of food except salt pepper coffee and sugar of which he had a quantity there were deer in the brakes but as he could not get close enough to kill them with a revolver he had to satisfy himself with a rabbit he knew he might as well content himself with the hard fare that assuredly would be his lot  somewhere up this river there was a village called huntsville it was distant about a hundred miles from wellston and had a reputation throughout southwestern texas he had never been there the fact was this reputation was such that honest travelers gave the town a wide berth duane had considerable money for him in his possession and he concluded to visit huntsville if he could find it and buy a stock of provisions  the following day toward evening he happened upon a road which he believed might lead to the village there were a good many fresh horsetracks in the sand and these made him thoughtful nevertheless he followed the road proceeding cautiously he had not gone very far when the sound of rapid hoofbeats caught his ears they came from his rear in the darkening twilight he could not see any great distance back along the road voices however warned him that these riders whoever they were had approached closer than he liked to go farther down the road was not to be thought of so he turned a little way in among the mesquites and halted hoping to escape being seen or heard as he was now a fugitive it seemed every man was his enemy and pursuer  the horsemen were fast approaching presently they were abreast of duanes position so near that he could hear the creak of saddles the clink of spurs  shore he crossed the river below said one man  i reckon youre right bill hes slipped us replied another  rangers or a posse of ranchers in pursuit of a fugitive the knowledge gave duane a strange thrill certainly they could not have been hunting him but the feeling their proximity gave him was identical to what it would have been had he been this particular hunted man he held his breath he clenched his teeth he pressed a quieting hand upon his horse suddenly he became aware that these horsemen had halted they were whispering he could just make out a dark group closely massed what had made them halt so suspiciously  youre wrong bill said a man in a low but distinct voice  the idee of hearin a hoss heave youre wussn a ranger and youre hellbent on killin that rustler now i say lets go home and eat  wal ill just take a look at the sand replied the man called bill  duane heard the clink of spurs on steel stirrup and the thud of boots on the ground there followed a short silence which was broken by a sharply breathed exclamation  duane waited for no more they had found his trail he spurred his horse straight into the brush at the second crashing bound there came yells from the road and then shots duane heard the hiss of a bullet close by his ear and as it struck a branch it made a peculiar singing sound these shots and the proximity of that lead missile roused in duane a quick hot resentment which mounted into a passion almost ungovernable he must escape yet it seemed that he did not care whether he did or not something grim kept urging him to halt and return the fire of these men after running a couple of hundred yards he raised himself from over the pommel where he had bent to avoid the stinging branches and tried to guide his horse in the dark shadows under mesquites and cottonwoods he was hard put to it to find open passage however he succeeded so well and made such little noise that gradually he drew away from his pursuers the sound of their horses crashing through the thickets died away duane reined in and listened he had distanced them probably they would go into camp till daylight then follow his tracks he started on again walking his horse and peered sharply at the ground so that he might take advantage of the first trail he crossed it seemed a long while until he came upon one he followed it until a late hour when striking the willow brakes again and hence the neighborhood of the river he picketed his horse and lay down to rest but he did not sleep his mind bitterly revolved the fate that had come upon him he made efforts to think of other things but in vain  every moment he expected the chill the sense of loneliness that yet was ominous of a strange visitation the peculiarly imagined lights and shades of the nightthese things that presaged the coming of cal bain doggedly duane fought against the insidious phantom he kept telling himself that it was just imagination that it would wear off in time still in his heart he did not believe what he hoped but he would not give up he would not accept the ghost of his victim as a reality  gray dawn found him in the saddle again headed for the river half an hour of riding brought him to the dense chaparral and willow thickets these he threaded to come at length to the ford it was a gravel bottom and therefore an easy crossing once upon the opposite shore he reined in his horse and looked darkly back this action marked his acknowledgment of his situation he had voluntarily sought the refuge of the outlaws he was beyond the pale a bitter and passionate curse passed his lips as he spurred his horse into the brakes on that alien shore  he rode perhaps twenty miles not sparing his horse nor caring whether or not he left a plain trail  let them hunt me he muttered  when the heat of the day began to be oppressive and hunger and thirst made themselves manifest duane began to look about him for a place to halt for the noonhours the trail led into a road which was hard packed and smooth from the tracks of cattle he doubted not that he had come across one of the roads used by border raiders he headed into it and had scarcely traveled a mile when turning a curve he came pointblank upon a single horseman riding toward him both riders wheeled their mounts sharply and were ready to run and shoot back not more than a hundred paces separated them they stood then for a moment watching each other  mawnin stranger called the man dropping his hand from his hip  howdy replied duane shortly  they rode toward each other closing half the gap then they halted again  i seen you aint no ranger called the rider an shore i aint none  he laughed loudly as if he had made a joke  howd you know i wasnt a ranger asked duane curiously somehow he had instantly divined that his horseman was no officer or even a rancher trailing stolen stock  wal said the fellow starting his horse forward at a walk a rangerd never git ready to run the other way from one man  he laughed again he was small and wiry slouchy of attire and armed to the teeth and he bestrode a fine bay horse he had quick dancing brown eyes at once frank and bold and a coarse bronzed face evidently he was a goodnatured ruffian  duane acknowledged the truth of the assertion and turned over in his mind how shrewdly the fellow had guessed him to be a hunted man  my names luke stevens an i hail from the river whore you said this stranger  duane was silent  i reckon youre buck duane went on stevens i heerd you was a damn bad man with a gun  this time duane laughed not at the doubtful compliment but at the idea that the first outlaw he met should know him here was proof of how swiftly facts about gunplay traveled on the texas border  wal buck said stevens in a friendly manner i aint presumin on your time or company i see youre headin fer the river but will you stop long enough to stake a feller to a bite of grub  im out of grub and pretty hungry myself admitted duane  been pushin your hoss i see wal i reckon youd better stock up before you hit thet stretch of country  he made a wide sweep of his right arm indicating the southwest and there was that in his action which seemed significant of a vast and barren region  stock up queried duane thoughtfully  shore a feller has jest got to eat i can rustle along without whisky but not without grub thets what makes it so embarrassin travelin these parts dodgin your shadow now im on my way to mercer its a little twobit town up the river a ways im goin to pack out some grub  stevenss tone was inviting evidently he would welcome duanes companionship but he did not openly say so duane kept silence however and then stevens went on  stranger in this here country twos a crowd its safer i never was much on this lonewolf dodgin though ive done it of necessity it takes a damn good man to travel alone any length of time why ive been thet sick i was jest achin fer some ranger to come along an plug me give me a pardner any day now mebbe youre not thet kind of a feller an im shore not presumin to ask but i just declares myself sufficient  you mean youd like me to go with you asked duane  stevens grinned wal i should smile id be particular proud to be braced with a man of your reputation  see here my good fellow thats all nonsense declared duane in some haste  shore i think modesty becomin to a youngster replied stevens i hate a brag an ive no use fer these fourflush cowboys thet re always lookin fer trouble an talkin gunplay buck i dont know much about you but every man whos lived along the texas border remembers a lot about your dad it was expected of you i reckon an much of your rep was established before you thronged your gun i jest heerd thet you was lightnin on the draw an when you cut loose with a gun why the figger on the ace of spades would cover your cluster of bulletholes thets the word thets gone down the border its the kind of reputation most sure to fly far an swift ahead of a man in this country an the safest too ill gamble on thet its the land of the draw i see now youre only a boy though youre shore a strappin husky one now buck im not a spring chicken an ive been long on the dodge mebbe a little of my society wont hurt you none youll need to learn the country  there was something sincere and likable about this outlaw  i dare say youre right replied duane quietly and ill go to mercer with you  next moment he was riding down the road with stevens duane had never been much of a talker and now he found speech difficult but his companion did not seem to mind that he was a jocose voluble fellow probably glad now to hear the sound of his own voice duane listened and sometimes he thought with a pang of the distinction of name and heritage of blood his father had left to him    chapter iii  late that day a couple of hours before sunset duane and stevens having rested their horses in the shade of some mesquites near the town of mercer saddled up and prepared to move  buck as were lookin fer grub an not trouble i reckon youd better hang up out here stevens was saying as he mounted you see towns an sheriffs an rangers are always lookin fer new fellers gone bad they sort of forget most of the old boys except those as are plumb bad now nobody in mercer will take notice of me reckon theres been a thousand men run into the river country to become outlaws since yours truly you jest wait here an be ready to ride hard mebbe my besettin sin will go operatin in spite of my good intentions in which case therell be  his pause was significant he grinned and his brown eyes danced with a kind of wild humor  stevens have you got any money asked duane  money exclaimed luke blankly say i havent owned a twobit piece sincewal fer some time  ill furnish money for grub returned duane and for whisky too providing you hurry back herewithout making trouble  shore youre a downright good pard declared stevens in admiration as he took the money i give my word buck an im here to say i never broke it yet lay low an look fer me back quick  with that he spurred his horse and rode out of the mesquites toward the town at that distance about a quarter of a mile mercer appeared to be a cluster of low adobe houses set in a grove of cottonwoods pastures of alfalfa were dotted by horses and cattle duane saw a sheepherder driving in a meager flock  presently stevens rode out of sight into the town duane waited hoping the outlaw would make good his word probably not a quarter of an hour had elapsed when duane heard the clear reports of a winchester rifle the clatter of rapid hoofbeats and yells unmistakably the kind to mean danger for a man like stevens duane mounted and rode to the edge of the mesquites  he saw a cloud of dust down the road and a bay horse running fast stevens apparently had not been wounded by any of the shots for he had a steady seat in his saddle and his riding even at that moment struck duane as admirable he carried a large pack over the pommel and he kept looking back the shots had ceased but the yells increased duane saw several men running and waving their arms then he spurred his horse and got into a swift stride so stevens would not pass him presently the outlaw caught up with him stevens was grinning but there was now no fun in the dancing eyes it was a devil that danced in them his face seemed a shade paler  was jest comin out of the store yelled stevens run plumb into a rancherwho knowed me he opened up with a rifle think theyll chase us  they covered several miles before there were any signs of pursuit and when horsemen did move into sight out of the cottonwoods duane and his companion steadily drew farther away  no hosses in thet bunch to worry us called out stevens  duane had the same conviction and he did not look back again he rode somewhat to the fore and was constantly aware of the rapid thudding of hoofs behind as stevens kept close to him at sunset they reached the willow brakes and the river duanes horse was winded and lashed with sweat and lather it was not until the crossing had been accomplished that duane halted to rest his animal stevens was riding up the low sandy bank he reeled in the saddle with an exclamation of surprise duane leaped off and ran to the outlaws side  stevens was pale and his face bore beads of sweat the whole front of his shirt was soaked with blood  youre shot cried duane  wal who n hell said i wasnt would you mind givin me a lifton this here pack  duane lifted the heavy pack down and then helped stevens to dismount the outlaw had a bloody foam on his lips and he was spitting blood  oh why didnt you say so cried duane i never thought you seemed all right  wal luke stevens may be as gabby as an old woman but sometimes he doesnt say anythin it wouldnt have done no good  duane bade him sit down removed his shirt and washed the blood from his breast and back stevens had been shot in the breast fairly low down and the bullet had gone clear through him his ride holding himself and that heavy pack in the saddle had been a feat little short of marvelous duane did not see how it had been possible and he felt no hope for the outlaw but he plugged the wounds and bound them tightly  fellers name was brown stevens said me an him fell out over a hoss i stole from him over in huntsville we had a shootinscrape then wal as i was straddlin my hoss back there in mercer i seen this brown an seen him before he seen me could have killed him too but i wasnt breakin my word to you i kind of hoped he wouldnt spot me but he didan fust shot he got me here what do you think of this hole  its pretty bad replied duane and he could not look the cheerful outlaw in the eyes  i reckon it is wal ive had some bad wounds i lived over guess mebbe i can stand this one now buck get me some place in the brakes leave me some grub an water at my hand an then you clear out  leave you here alone asked duane sharply  shore you see i cant keep up with you brown an his friends will foller us across the river a ways youve got to think of number one in this game  what would you do in my case asked duane curiously  wal i reckon id clear out an save my hide replied stevens  duane felt inclined to doubt the outlaws assertion for his own part he decided his conduct without further speech first he watered the horses filled canteens and water bag and then tied the pack upon his own horse that done he lifted stevens upon his horse and holding him in the saddle turned into the brakes being careful to pick out hard or grassy ground that left little signs of tracks just about dark he ran across a trail that stevens said was a good one to take into the wild country  reckon wed better keep right on in the darktill i drop concluded stevens with a laugh  all that night duane gloomy and thoughtful attentive to the wounded outlaw walked the trail and never halted till daybreak he was tired then and very hungry stevens seemed in bad shape although he was still spirited and cheerful duane made camp the outlaw refused food but asked for both whisky and water then he stretched out  buck will you take off my boots he asked with a faint smile on his pallid face  duane removed them wondering if the outlaw had the thought that he did not want to die with his boots on stevens seemed to read his mind  buck my old daddy used to say thet i was born to be hanged but i wasntan dyin with your boots on is the next wust way to croak  youve a chance toto get over this said duane  shore but i want to be correct about the bootsan say pard if i do go over jest you remember thet i was appreciatin of your kindness  then he closed his eyes and seemed to sleep  duane could not find water for the horses but there was an abundance of dewwet grass upon which he hobbled them after that was done he prepared himself a muchneeded meal the sun was getting warm when he lay down to sleep and when he awoke it was sinking in the west stevens was still alive for he breathed heavily the horses were in sight all was quiet except the hum of insects in the brush duane listened awhile then rose and went for the horses  when he returned with them he found stevens awake brighteyed cheerful as usual and apparently stronger  wal buck im still with you an good fer another nights ride he said guess about all i need now is a big pull on thet bottle help me will you there thet was bully i aint swallowin my blood this evenin mebbe ive bled all there was in me  while duane got a hurried meal for himself packed up the little outfit and saddled the horses stevens kept on talking he seemed to be in a hurry to tell duane all about the country another night ride would put them beyond fear of pursuit within striking distance of the rio grande and the hidingplaces of the outlaws  when it came time for mounting the horses stevens said reckon you can pull on my boots once more in spite of the laugh accompanying the words duane detected a subtle change in the outlaws spirit  on this night travel was facilitated by the fact that the trail was broad enough for two horses abreast enabling duane to ride while upholding stevens in the saddle  the difficulty most persistent was in keeping the horses in a walk they were used to a trot and that kind of gait would not do for stevens the red died out of the west a pale afterglow prevailed for a while darkness set in then the broad expanse of blue darkened and the stars brightened after a while stevens ceased talking and drooped in his saddle duane kept the horses going however and the slow hours wore away duane thought the quiet night would never break to dawn that there was no end to the melancholy brooding plain but at length a grayness blotted out the stars and mantled the level of mesquite and cactus  dawn caught the fugitives at a green campingsite on the bank of a rocky little stream stevens fell a dead weight into duanes arms and one look at the haggard face showed duane that the outlaw had taken his last ride he knew it too yet that cheerfulness prevailed  buck my feet are orful tired packin them heavy boots he said and seemed immensely relieved when duane had removed them  this matter of the outlaws boots was strange duane thought he made stevens as comfortable as possible then attended to his own needs and the outlaw took up the thread of his conversation where he had left off the night before  this trail splits up a ways from here an every branch of it leads to a hole where youll find mena few mebbe like yourselfsome like mean gangs of nogood hossthieves rustlers an such its easy livin buck i reckon though that youll not find it easy youll never mix in youll be a lone wolf i seen that right off wal if a man can stand the loneliness an if hes quick on the draw mebbe lonewolfin it is the best shore i dont know but these fellers in here will be suspicious of a man who goes it alone if they get a chance theyll kill you  stevens asked for water several times he had forgotten or he did not want the whisky his voice grew perceptibly weaker  be quiet said duane talking uses up your strength  aw ill talk tillim done he replied doggedly see here pard you can gamble on what im tellin you an itll be useful from this camp wellyoull meet men right along an none of them will be honest men all the same some are bettern others ive lived along the river fer twelve years theres three big gangs of outlaws king fisheryou know him i reckon fer hes half the time livin among respectable folks king is a pretty good feller itll do to tie up with him ant his gang now theres cheseldine who hangs out in the rim rock way up the river hes an outlaw chief i never seen him though i stayed once right in his camp late years hes got rich an keeps back pretty well hid but blandi knowed bland fer years an i havent any use fer him bland has the biggest gang you aint likely to miss strikin his place sometime or other hes got a regular town i might say shore theres some gamblin an gunfightin goin on at blands camp all the time bland has killed some twenty men an thets not countin greasers  here stevens took another drink and then rested for a while  you aint likely to get on with bland he resumed presently youre too strappin big an goodlookin to please the chief fer hes got women in his camp then hed be jealous of your possibilities with a gun shore i reckon hed be careful though blands no fool an he loves his hide i reckon any of the other gangs would be better fer you when you aint goin it alone  apparently that exhausted the fund of information and advice stevens had been eager to impart he lapsed into silence and lay with closed eyes meanwhile the sun rose warm the breeze waved the mesquites the birds came down to splash in the shallow stream duane dozed in a comfortable seat by and by something roused him stevens was once more talking but with a changed tone  fellers namewas brown he rambled we fell outover a hoss i stole from himin huntsville he stole it fuss browns one of them sneaksafraid of the openhe steals an pretends to be honest say buck mebbe youll meet brown some dayyou an me are pards now  ill remember if i ever meet him said duane  that seemed to satisfy the outlaw presently he tried to lift his head but had not the strength a strange shade was creeping across the bronzed rough face  my feet are pretty heavy shore you got my boots off  duane held them up but was not certain that stevens could see them the outlaw closed his eyes again and muttered incoherently then he fell asleep duane believed that sleep was final the day passed with duane watching and waiting toward sundown stevens awoke and his eyes seemed clearer duane went to get some fresh water thinking his comrade would surely want some when he returned stevens made no sign that he wanted anything there was something bright about him and suddenly duane realized what it meant  pard youstuckto me the outlaw whispered  duane caught a hint of gladness in the voice he traced a faint surprise in the haggard face stevens seemed like a little child  to duane the moment was sad elemental big with a burden of mystery he could not understand  duane buried him in a shallow arroyo and heaped up a pile of stones to mark the grave that done he saddled his comrades horse hung the weapons over the pommel and mounting his own steed he rode down the trail in the gathering twilight    chapter iv  two days later about the middle of the forenoon duane dragged the two horses up the last ascent of an exceedingly rough trail and found himself on top of the rim rock with a beautiful green valley at his feet the yellow sluggish rio grande shining in the sun and the great wild mountainous barren of mexico stretching to the south  duane had not fallen in with any travelers he had taken the likeliestlooking trail he had come across where it had led him he had not the slightest idea except that here was the river and probably the inclosed valley was the retreat of some famous outlaw  no wonder outlaws were safe in that wild refuge duane had spent the last two days climbing the roughest and most difficult trail he had ever seen from the looks of the descent he imagined the worst part of his travel was yet to come not improbably it was two thousand feet down to the river the wedgeshaped valley green with alfalfa and cottonwood and nestling down amid the bare walls of yellow rock was a delight and a relief to his tired eyes eager to get down to a level and to find a place to rest duane began the descent  the trail proved to be the kind that could not be descended slowly he kept dodging rocks which his horses loosed behind him and in a short time he reached the valley entering at the apex of the wedge a stream of clear water tumbled out of the rocks here and most of it ran into irrigationditches his horses drank thirstily and he drank with that fullness and gratefulness common to the desert traveler finding sweet water then he mounted and rode down the valley wondering what would be his reception  the valley was much larger than it had appeared from the high elevation well watered green with grass and tree and farmed evidently by good hands it gave duane a considerable surprise horses and cattle were everywhere every clump of cottonwoods surrounded a small adobe house duane saw mexicans working in the fields and horsemen going to and fro presently he passed a house bigger than the others with a porch attached a woman young and pretty he thought watched him from a door no one else appeared to notice him  presently the trail widened into a road and that into a kind of square lined by a number of adobe and log buildings of rudest structure within sight were horses dogs a couple of steers mexican women with children and white men all of whom appeared to be doing nothing his advent created no interest until he rode up to the white men who were lolling in the shade of a house this place evidently was a store and saloon and from the inside came a lazy hum of voices  as duane reined to a halt one of the loungers in the shade rose with a loud exclamation  bust me if thet aint lukes hoss  the others accorded their interest if not assent by rising to advance toward duane  how about it euchre aint thet lukes bay queried the first man  plain as your nose replied the fellow called euchre  there aint no doubt about thet then laughed another fer bosomers nose is shore plain on the landscape  these men lined up before duane and as he coolly regarded them he thought they could have been recognized anywhere as desperadoes the man called bosomer who had stepped forward had a forbidding face which showed yellow eyes an enormous nose and a skin the color of dust with a thatch of sandy hair  stranger who are you an where in the hell did you git thet bay hoss he demanded his yellow eyes took in stevenss horse then the weapons hung on the saddle and finally turned their glinting hard light upward to duane  duane did not like the tone in which he had been addressed and he remained silent at least half his mind seemed busy with curious interest in regard to something that leaped inside him and made his breast feel tight he recognized it as that strange emotion which had shot through him often of late and which had decided him to go out to the meeting with bain only now it was different more powerful  stranger who are you asked another man somewhat more civilly  my names duane replied duane curtly  an howd you come by the hoss  duane answered briefly and his words were followed by a short silence during which the men looked at him bosomer began to twist the ends of his beard  reckon hes dead all right or nobodyd hev his hoss an guns presently said euchre  mister duane began bosomer in low stinging tones i happen to be luke stevenss sidepardner  duane looked him over from dusty wornout boots to his slouchy sombrero that look seemed to inflame bosomer  an i want the hoss an them guns he shouted  you or anybody else can have them for all i care i just fetched them in but the pack is mine replied duane and say i befriended your pard if you cant use a civil tongue youd better cinch it  civil haw haw rejoined the outlaw i dont know you how do we know you didnt plug stevens an stole his hoss an jest happened to stumble down here  youll have to take my word thats all replied duane sharply  i aint takin your word savvy thet an i was lukes pard  with that bosomer wheeled and pushing his companions aside he stamped into the saloon where his voice broke out in a roar  duane dismounted and threw his bridle  stranger bosomer is shore hotheaded said the man euchre he did not appear unfriendly nor were the others hostile  at this juncture several more outlaws crowded out of the door and the one in the lead was a tall man of stalwart physique his manner proclaimed him a leader he had a long face a flaming red beard and clear cold blue eyes that fixed in close scrutiny upon duane he was not a texan in truth duane did not recognize one of these outlaws as native to his state  im bland said the tall man authoritatively whore you and whatre you doing here  duane looked at bland as he had at the others this outlaw chief appeared to be reasonable if he was not courteous duane told his story again this time a little more in detail  i believe you replied bland at once think i know when a fellow is lying  i reckon youre on the right trail put in euchre thet about luke wantin his boots took offthet satisfies me luke hed a mortal dread of dyin with his boots on  at this sally the chief and his men laughed  you said duanebuck duane queried bland are you a son of that duane who was a gunfighter some years back  yes replied duane  never met him and glad i didnt said bland with a grim humor so you got in trouble and had to go on the dodge what kind of trouble  had a fight  fight do you mean gunplay questioned bland he seemed eager curious speculative  yes it ended in gunplay im sorry to say answered duane  guess i neednt ask the son of duane if he killed his man went on bland ironically well im sorry you bucked against trouble in my camp but as it is i guess youd be wise to make yourself scarce  do you mean im politely told to move on asked duane quietly  not exactly that said bland as if irritated if this isnt a free place there isnt one on earth every man is equal here do you want to join my band  no i dont  well even if you did i imagine that wouldnt stop bosomer hes an ugly fellow hes one of the few gunmen ive met who wants to kill somebody all the time most men like that are fourflushes but bosomer is all one color and thats red merely for your own sake i advise you to hit the trail  thanks but if thats all ill stay returned duane even as he spoke he felt that he did not know himself  bosomer appeared at the door pushing men who tried to detain him and as he jumped clear of a last reaching hand he uttered a snarl like an angry dog manifestly the short while he had spent inside the saloon had been devoted to drinking and talking himself into a frenzy bland and the other outlaws quickly moved aside letting duane stand alone when bosomer saw duane standing motionless and watchful a strange change passed quickly in him he halted in his tracks and as he did that the men who had followed him out piled over one another in their hurry to get to one side  duane saw all the swift action felt intuitively the meaning of it and in bosomers sudden change of front the outlaw was keen and he had expected a shrinking or at least a frightened antagonist duane knew he was neither he felt like iron and yet thrill after thrill ran through him it was almost as if this situation had been one long familiar to him somehow he understood this yelloweyed bosomer the outlaw had come out to kill him and now though somewhat checked by the stand of a stranger he still meant to kill like so many desperadoes of his ilk he was victim of a passion to kill for the sake of killing duane divined that no sudden animosity was driving bosomer it was just his chance in that moment murder would have been joy to him very likely he had forgotten his pretext for a quarrel very probably his faculties were absorbed in conjecture as to duanes possibilities  but he did not speak a word he remained motionless for a long moment his eyes pale and steady his right hand like a claw  that instant gave duane a power to read in his enemys eyes the thought that preceded action but duane did not want to kill another man still he would have to fight and he decided to cripple bosomer when bosomers hand moved duanes gun was spouting fire two shots onlyboth from duanes gunand the outlaw fell with his right arm shattered bosomer cursed harshly and floundered in the dust trying to reach the gun with his left hand his comrades however seeing that duane would not kill unless forced closed in upon bosomer and prevented any further madness on his part    chapter v  of the outlaws present euchre appeared to be the one most inclined to lend friendliness to curiosity and he led duane and the horses away to a small adobe shack he tied the horses in an open shed and removed their saddles then gathering up stevenss weapons he invited his visitor to enter the house  it had two roomswindows without coveringsbare floors one room contained blankets weapons saddles and bridles the other a stone fireplace rude table and bench two bunks a box cupboard and various blackened utensils  make yourself to home as long as you want to stay said euchre i aint rich in this worlds goods but i own whats here an youre welcome  thanks ill stay awhile and rest im pretty well played out replied duane  euchre gave him a keen glance  go ahead an rest ill take your horses to grass euchre left duane alone in the house duane relaxed then and mechanically he wiped the sweat from his face he was laboring under some kind of a spell or shock which did not pass off quickly when it had worn away he took off his coat and belt and made himself comfortable on the blankets and he had a thought that if he rested or slept what difference would it make on the morrow no rest no sleep could change the gray outlook of the future he felt glad when euchre came bustling in and for the first time he took notice of the outlaw  euchre was old in years what little hair he had was gray his face cleanshaven and full of wrinkles his eyes were half shut from long gazing through the sun and dust he stooped but his thin frame denoted strength and endurance still unimpaired  hey a drink or a smoke he asked  duane shook his head he had not been unfamiliar with whisky and he had used tobacco moderately since he was sixteen but now strangely he felt a disgust at the idea of stimulants he did not understand clearly what he felt there was that vague idea of something wild in his blood something that made him fear himself  euchre wagged his old head sympathetically reckon you feel a little sick when it comes to shootin i run whats your age  im twentythree replied duane  euchre showed surprise youre only a boy i thought you thirty anyways buck i heard what you told bland an puttin thet with my own figgerin i reckon youre no criminal yet throwin a gun in selfdefensethet aint no crime  duane finding relief in talking told more about himself  huh replied the old man ive been on this river fer years an ive seen hundreds of boys come in on the dodge most of them though was no good an thet kind dont last long this river country has been an is the refuge fer criminals from all over the states ive bunked with bank cashiers forgers plain thieves an outanout murderers all of which had no bizness on the texas border fellers like bland are exceptions hes no texanyou seen thet the gang he rules here come from all over an theyre tough cusses you can bet on thet they live fat an easy if it wasnt fer the fightin among themselves theyd shore grow populous the rim rock is no place for a peaceable decent feller i heard you tell bland you wouldnt join his gang thetll not make him take a likin to you have you any money  not much replied duane  could you live by gamblin are you any good at cards  no  you wouldnt steal hosses or rustle cattle  no  when your moneys gone hown hell will you live there aint any work a decent feller could do you cant herd with greasers why blands men would shoot at you in the fields whatll you do son  god knows replied duane hopelessly ill make my money last as long as possiblethen starve  wal im pretty pore but youll never starve while i got anythin  here it struck duane againthat something human and kind and eager which he had seen in stevens duanes estimate of outlaws had lacked this quality he had not accorded them any virtues to him as to the outside world they had been merely vicious men without one redeeming feature  im much obliged to you euchre replied duane but of course i wont live with any one unless i can pay my share  have it any way you like my son said euchre goodhumoredly you make a fire an ill set about gettin grub im a sourdough buck thet man doesnt live who can beat my bread  how do you ever pack supplies in here asked duane thinking of the almost inaccessible nature of the valley  some comes across from mexico an the rest down the river thet river trip is a bird its moren five hundred miles to any supply point bland has mozos greaser boatmen sometimes too he gets supplies in from downriver you see bland sells thousands of cattle in cuba an all this stock has to go down by boat to meet the ships  where on earth are the cattle driven down to the river asked duane  thets not my secret replied euchre shortly fact is i dont know ive rustled cattle for bland but he never sent me through the rim rock with them  duane experienced a sort of pleasure in the realization that interest had been stirred in him he was curious about bland and his gang and glad to have something to think about for every once in a while he had a sensation that was almost like a pang he wanted to forget in the next hour he did forget and enjoyed helping in the preparation and eating of the meal euchre after washing and hanging up the several utensils put on his hat and turned to go out  come along or stay here as you want he said to duane  ill stay rejoined duane slowly  the old outlaw left the room and trudged away whistling cheerfully  duane looked around him for a book or paper anything to read but all the printed matter he could find consisted of a few words on cartridgeboxes and an advertisement on the back of a tobaccopouch there seemed to be nothing for him to do he had rested he did not want to lie down any more he began to walk to and fro from one end of the room to the other and as he walked he fell into the lately acquired habit of brooding over his misfortune  suddenly he straightened up with a jerk unconsciously he had drawn his gun standing there with the bright cold weapon in his hand he looked at it in consternation how had he come to draw it with difficulty he traced his thoughts backward but could not find any that was accountable for his act he discovered however that he had a remarkable tendency to drop his hand to his gun that might have come from the habit long practice in drawing had given him likewise it might have come from a subtle sense scarcely thought of at all of the late close and inevitable relation between that weapon and himself he was amazed to find that bitter as he had grown at fate the desire to live burned strong in him if he had been as unfortunately situated but with the difference that no man wanted to put him in jail or take his life he felt that this burning passion to be free to save himself might not have been so powerful life certainly held no bright prospects for him already he had begun to despair of ever getting back to his home but to give up like a whitehearted coward to let himself be handcuffed and jailed to run from a drunken bragging cowboy or be shot in cold blood by some border brute who merely wanted to add another notch to his gunthese things were impossible for duane because there was in him the temper to fight in that hour he yielded only to fate and the spirit inborn in him hereafter this gun must be a living part of him right then and there he returned to a practice he had long discontinuedthe draw it was now a stern bitter deadly business with him he did not need to fire the gun for accuracy was a gift and had become assured swiftness on the draw however could be improved and he set himself to acquire the limit of speed possible to any man he stood still in his tracks he paced the room he sat down lay down put himself in awkward positions and from every position he practiced throwing his gunpracticed it till he was hot and tired and his arm ached and his hand burned that practice he determined to keep up every day it was one thing at least that would help pass the weary hours  later he went outdoors to the cooler shade of the cottonwoods from this point he could see a good deal of the valley under different circumstances duane felt that he would have enjoyed such a beautiful spot euchres shack sat against the first rise of the slope of the wall and duane by climbing a few rods got a view of the whole valley assuredly it was an outlaw settle meet he saw a good many mexicans who of course were hand and glove with bland also he saw enormous flatboats crude of structure moored along the banks of the river the rio grande rolled away between high bluffs a cable sagging deep in the middle was stretched over the wide yellow stream and an old scow evidently used as a ferry lay anchored on the far shore  the valley was an ideal retreat for an outlaw band operating on a big scale pursuit scarcely need be feared over the broken trails of the rim rock and the open end of the valley could be defended against almost any number of men coming down the river access to mexico was easy and quick what puzzled duane was how bland got cattle down to the river and he wondered if the rustler really did get rid of his stolen stock by use of boats  duane must have idled considerable time up on the hill for when he returned to the shack euchre was busily engaged around the campfire  wal glad to see you aint so pale about the gills as you was he said by way of greeting pitch in an well soon have grub ready theres shore one consolin fact round this here camp  whats that asked duane  plenty of good juicy beef to eat an it doesnt cost a short bit  but it costs hard rides and trouble bad conscience and life too doesnt it  i aint shore about the bad conscience mine never bothered me none an as for life why thets cheap in texas  who is bland asked duane quickly changing the subject what do you know about him  we dont know who he is or where he hails from replied euchre thets always been somethin to interest the gang he must have been a young man when he struck texas now hes middleaged i remember how years ago he was softspoken an not rough in talk or act like he is now bland aint likely his right name he knows a lot he can doctor you an hes shore a knowin feller with tools hes the kind thet rules men outlaws are always ridin in here to join his gang an if it hadnt been fer the gamblin an gunplay hed have a thousand men around him  how many in his gang now  i reckon theres short of a hundred now the number varies then bland has several small camps up an down the river also he has men back on the cattleranges  how does he control such a big force asked duane especially when his bands composed of bad men luke stevens said he had no use for bland and i heard once somewhere that bland was a devil  thets it he is a devil hes as hard as flint violent in temper never made any friends except his righthand men dave rugg an chess alloway blandll shoot at a wink hes killed a lot of fellers an some fer nothin the reason thet outlaws gather round him an stick is because hes a safe refuge an then hes well heeled bland is rich they say he has a hundred thousand pesos hid somewhere an lots of gold but hes free with money he gambles when hes not off with a shipment of cattle he throws money around an the fact is theres always plenty of money where he is thets what holds the gang dirty bloody money  its a wonder he hasnt been killed all these years on the border exclaimed duane  wal replied euchre dryly hes been quicker on the draw than the other fellers who hankered to kill him thets all  euchres reply rather chilled duanes interest for the moment such remarks always made his mind revolve round facts pertaining to himself  speakin of this here swift wrist game went on euchre theres been considerable talk in camp about your throwin of a gun you know buck thet among us fellersus hunted menthere aint anythin calculated to rouse respect like a slick hand with a gun i heard bland say this afternoonan he said it seriouslike an speculativethet hed never seen your equal he was watchin of you close he said an just couldnt follow your hand when you drawed all the fellers who seen you meet bosomer had somethin to say bo was about as handy with a gun as any man in this camp barrin chess alloway an mebbe bland himself chess is the captain with a coltor he was an he shore didnt like the references made about your speed bland was honest in acknowledgin it but he didnt like it neither some of the fellers allowed your draw might have been just accident but most of them figgered different an they all shut up when bland told who an what your dad was pears to me i once seen your dad in a gunscrape over at santone years ago wal i put my oar in today among the fellers an i says what ails you locoed gents did young duane budge an inch when bo came roarin out blood in his eye wasnt he cool an quiet steady of lips an werent his eyes readin bos mind an thet lightnin drawcant youall see thets a family gift  euchres narrow eyes twinkled and he gave the dough he was rolling a slap with his flourwhitened hand manifestly he had proclaimed himself a champion and partner of duanes with all the pride an old man could feel in a young one whom he admired  wal he resumed presently thets your introduction to the border buck an your card was a high trump youll be let severely alone by real gunfighters an men like bland alloway rugg an the bosses of the other gangs after all these real men are men you know an onless you cross them theyre no more likely to interfere with you than you are with them but theres a sight of fellers like bosomer in the river country theyll all want your game an every town you ride into will scare up some cowpuncher full of booze or a longhaired fourflush gunman or a sheriffan these men will be playin to the crowd an yellin for your blood thets the texas of it youll have to hide fer ever in the brakes or youll have to kill such men buck i reckon this aint cheerful news to a decent chap like you im only tellin you because ive taken a likin to you an i seen right off thet you aint borderwise lets eat now an afterward well go out so the gang can see youre not hidin  when duane went out with euchre the sun was setting behind a blue range of mountains across the river in mexico the valley appeared to open to the southwest it was a tranquil beautiful scene somewhere in a house near at hand a woman was singing and in the road duane saw a little mexican boy driving home some cows one of which wore a bell the sweet happy voice of a woman and a whistling barefoot boythese seemed utterly out of place here  euchre presently led to the square and the row of rough houses duane remembered he almost stepped on a wide imprint in the dust where bosomer had confronted him and a sudden fury beset him that he should be affected strangely by the sight of it  lets have a look in here said euchre  duane had to bend his head to enter the door he found himself in a very large room inclosed by adobe walls and roofed with brush it was full of rude benches tables seats at one corner a number of kegs and barrels lay side by side in a rack a mexican boy was lighting lamps hung on posts that sustained the log rafters of the roof  the only feller whos goin to put a close eye on you is benson said euchre he runs the place an sells drinks the gang calls him jackrabbit benson because hes always got his eye peeled an his ear cocked dont notice him if he looks you over buck benson is scared to death of every newcomer who rustles into blands camp an the reason i take it is because hes done somebody dirt hes hidin not from a sheriff or ranger men who hide from them dont act like jackrabbit benson hes hidin from some guy whos huntin him to kill him wal im always expectin to see some feller ride in here an throw a gun on benson cant say id be grieved  duane casually glanced in the direction indicated and he saw a spare gaunt man with a face strikingly white beside the red and bronze and dark skins of the men around him it was a cadaverous face the black mustache hung down a heavy lock of black hair dropped down over the brow deepset hollow staring eyes looked out piercingly the man had a restless alert nervous manner he put his hands on the board that served as a bar and stared at duane but when he met duanes glance he turned hurriedly to go on serving out liquor  what have you got against him inquired duane as he sat down beside euchre he asked more for something to say than from real interest what did he care about a mean haunted cravenfaced criminal  wal mebbe im crossgrained replied euchre apologetically shore an outlaw an rustler such as me cant be touchy but i never stole nothin but cattle from some rancher who never missed em anyway thet sneak bensonhe was the means of puttin a little girl in blands way  girl queried duane now with real attention  shore blands great on women ill tell you about this girl when we get out of here some of the gang are goin to be sociable an i cant talk about the chief  during the ensuing halfhour a number of outlaws passed by duane and euchre halted for a greeting or sat down for a moment they were all gruff loudvoiced merry and goodnatured duane replied civilly and agreeably when he was personally addressed but he refused all invitations to drink and gamble evidently he had been accepted in a way as one of their clan no one made any hint of an allusion to his affair with bosomer duane saw readily that euchre was well liked one outlaw borrowed money from him another asked for tobacco  by the time it was dark the big room was full of outlaws and mexicans most of whom were engaged at monte these gamblers especially the mexicans were intense and quiet the noise in the place came from the drinkers the loungers duane had seen gamblingresortssome of the famous ones in san antonio and el paso a few in border towns where license went unchecked but this place of jackrabbit bensons impressed him as one where guns and knives were accessories to the game to his perhaps rather distinguishing eye the most prominent thing about the gamesters appeared to be their weapons on several of the tables were piles of silvermexican pesosas large and high as the crown of his hat there were also piles of gold and silver in united states coin duane needed no experienced eyes to see that betting was heavy and that heavy sums exchanged hands the mexicans showed a sterner obsession an intenser passion some of the americans staked freely nonchalantly as befitted men to whom money was nothing these latter were manifestly winning for there were brother outlaws there who wagered coin with grudging sullen greedy eyes boisterous talk and laughter among the drinking men drowned except at intervals the low brief talk of the gamblers the clink of coin sounded incessantly sometimes just low steady musical rings and again when a pile was tumbled quickly there was a silvery crash here an outlaw pounded on a table with the butt of his gun there another noisily palmed a roll of dollars while he studied his opponents face the noises however in bensons den did not contribute to any extent to the sinister aspect of the place that seemed to come from the grim and reckless faces from the bent intent heads from the dark lights and shades there were bright lights but these served only to make the shadows and in the shadows lurked unrestrained lust of gain a spirit ruthless and reckless a something at once suggesting lawlessness theft murder and hell  blands not here tonight euchre was saying he left today on one of his trips takin alloway an some others but his other man rugg hes here see him standin with them three fellers all close to benson ruggs the little bowlegged man with the half of his face shot off hes oneeyed but he can shore see out of the one hes got an darn me theres hardin you know him hes got an outlaw gang as big as blands hardin is standin next to benson see how quiet an unassumin he looks yes thets hardin he comes here once in a while to see bland theyre friends whichs shore strange do you see thet greaser therethe one with gold an lace on his sombrero thets manuel a mexican bandit hes a great gambler comes here often to drop his coin next to him is bill marrthe feller with the bandana round his head bill rode in the other day with some fresh bulletholes hes been shot moren any feller i ever heard of hes full of lead funny because bills no troublehunter an like me hed rather run than shoot but hes the best rustler blands gota grand rider an a wonder with cattle an see the towheaded youngster thets kid fuller the kid of blands gang fuller has hit the pace hard an he wont last the year out on the border he killed his sweethearts father got run out of staceytown took to stealin hosses an next hes here with bland another boy gone wrong an now shore a hard nut  euchre went on calling duanes attention to other men just as he happened to glance over them any one of them would have been a marked man in a respectable crowd here each took his place with more or less distinction according to the record of his past wild prowess and his present possibilities duane realizing that he was tolerated there received in careless friendly spirit by this terrible class of outcasts experienced a feeling of revulsion that amounted almost to horror was his being there not an ugly dream what had he in common with such ruffians then in a flash of memory came the painful proofhe was a criminal in sight of texas law he too was an outcast  for the moment duane was wrapped up in painful reflections but euchres heavy hand clapping with a warning hold on his arm brought him back to outside things  the hum of voices the clink of coin the loud laughter had ceased there was a silence that manifestly had followed some unusual word or action sufficient to still the room it was broken by a harsh curse and the scrape of a bench on the floor some man had risen  you stacked the cards you  say that twice another voice replied so different in its cool ominous tone from the other  ill say it twice returned the first gamester in hot haste ill say it three times ill whistle it are you deaf you lightfingered gent you stacked the cards  silence ensued deeper than before pregnant with meaning for all that duane saw not an outlaw moved for a full moment then suddenly the room was full of disorder as men rose and ran and dived everywhere  run or duck yelled euchre close to duanes ear with that he dashed for the door duane leaped after him they ran into a jostling mob heavy gunshots and hoarse yells hurried the crowd duane was with pellmell out into the darkness there they all halted and several peeped in at the door  who was the kid callin asked one outlaw  bud marsh replied another  i reckon them fust shots was buds adios kid it was comin to him went on yet another  how many shots  three or four i counted  three heavy an one light thet light one was the kids38 listen theres the kid hollerin now he aint cashed anyway  at this juncture most of the outlaws began to file back into the room duane thought he had seen and heard enough in bensons den for one night and he started slowly down the walk presently euchre caught up with him  nobody hurt much whichs shore some strange he said the kidyoung fuller thet i was tellin you abouthe was drinkin an losin lost his nut too callin bud marsh thet way buds as straight at cards as any of em somebody grabbed bud who shot into the roof an fullers arm was knocked up he only hit a greaser    chapter vi  next morning duane found that a moody and despondent spell had fastened on him wishing to be alone he went out and walked a trail leading round the river bluff he thought and thought after a while he made out that the trouble with him probably was that he could not resign himself to his fate he abhorred the possibility chance seemed to hold in store for him he could not believe there was no hope but what to do appeared beyond his power to tell  duane had intelligence and keenness enough to see his perilthe danger threatening his character as a man just as much as that which threatened his life he cared vastly more he discovered for what he considered honor and integrity than he did for life he saw that it was bad for him to be alone but it appeared lonely months and perhaps years inevitably must be his another thing puzzled him in the bright light of day he could not recall the state of mind that was his at twilight or dusk or in the dark night by day these visitations became to him what they really werephantoms of his conscience he could dismiss the thought of them then he could scarcely remember or believe that this strange feat of fancy or imagination had troubled him pained him made him sleepless and sick  that morning duane spent an unhappy hour wrestling decision out of the unstable condition of his mind but at length he determined to create interest in all that he came across and so forget himself as much as possible he had an opportunity now to see just what the outlaws life really was he meant to force himself to be curious sympathetic clearsighted and he would stay there in the valley until its possibilities had been exhausted or until circumstances sent him out upon his uncertain way  when he returned to the shack euchre was cooking dinner  say buck ive news for you he said and his tone conveyed either pride in his possession of such news or pride in duane feller named bradley rode in this mornin hes heard some about you told about the ace of spades they put over the bullet holes in thet cowpuncher bain you plugged then there was a rancher shot at a waterhole twenty miles south of wellston reckon you didnt do it  no i certainly did not replied duane  wal you get the blame it aint nothin for a feller to be saddled with gunplays he never made an buck if you ever get famous as seems likely youll be blamed for many a crime the borderll make an outlaw an murderer out of you wal thets enough of thet ive more news youre goin to be popular  popular what do you mean  i met blands wife this mornin she seen you the other day when you rode in she shore wants to meet you an so do some of the other women in camp they always want to meet the new fellers whove just come in its lonesome for women here an they like to hear news from the towns  well euchre i dont want to be impolite but id rather not meet any women rejoined duane  i was afraid you wouldnt dont blame you much women are hell i was hopin though you might talk a little to thet poor lonesome kid  what kid inquired duane in surprise  didnt i tell you about jenniethe girl blands holdin herethe one jackrabbit benson had a hand in stealin  you mentioned a girl thats all tell me now replied duane abruptly  wal i got it this way mebbe its straight an mebbe it aint some years ago benson made a trip over the river to buy mescal an other drinks hell sneak over there once in a while an as i get it he run across a gang of greasers with some gringo prisoners i dont know but i reckon there was some barterin perhaps murderin anyway benson fetched the girl back she was more dead than alive but it turned out she was only starved an scared half to death she hadnt been harmed i reckon she was then about fourteen years old bensons idee he said was to use her in his den sellin drinks an the like but i never went much on jackrabbits word bland seen the kid right off and took herbought her from benson you can gamble bland didnt do thet from notions of chivalry i aint gainsayin however but thet jennie was better off with kate bland shes been hard on jennie but shes kept bland an the other men from treatin the kid shameful late jennie has growed into an allfired pretty girl an kate is powerful jealous of her i can see hell brewin over there in blands cabin thets why i wish youd come over with me blands hardly ever home his wifes invited you shore if she gets sweet on you as she has onwal thet d complicate matters but youd get to see jennie an mebbe you could help her mind i aint hintin nothin im just wantin to put her in your way youre a man an can think fer yourself i had a baby girl once an if shed lived she be as big as jennie now an by gawd i wouldnt want her here in blands camp  ill go euchre take me over replied duane he felt euchres eyes upon him the old outlaw however had no more to say  in the afternoon euchre set off with duane and soon they reached blands cabin duane remembered it as the one where he had seen the pretty woman watching him ride by he could not recall what she looked like the cabin was the same as the other adobe structures in the valley but it was larger and pleasantly located rather high up in a grove of cottonwoods in the windows and upon the porch were evidences of a womans hand through the open door duane caught a glimpse of bright mexican blankets and rugs  euchre knocked upon the side of the door  is that you euchre asked a girls voice low hesitatingly the tone of it rather deep and with a note of fear struck duane he wondered what she would be like  yes its me jennie wheres mrs bland answered euchre  she went over to degers theres somebody sick replied the girl  euchre turned and whispered something about luck the snap of the outlaws eyes was added significance to duane  jennie come out or let us come in heres the young man i was tellin you about euchre said  oh i cant i look soso  never mind how you look interrupted the outlaw in a whisper it aint no time to care fer thet heres young duane jennie hes no rustler no thief hes different come out jennie an mebbe hell  euchre did not complete his sentence he had spoken low with his glance shifting from side to side  but what he said was sufficient to bring the girl quickly she appeared in the doorway with downcast eyes and a stain of red in her white cheek she had a pretty sad face and bright hair  dont be bashful jennie said euchre you an duane have a chance to talk a little now ill go fetch mrs bland but i wont be hurryin  with that euchre went away through the cottonwoods  im glad to meet you missmiss jennie said duane euchre didnt mention your last name he asked me to come over to  duanes attempt at pleasantry halted short when jennie lifted her lashes to look at him some kind of a shock went through duane her gray eyes were beautiful but it had not been beauty that cut short his speech he seemed to see a tragic struggle between hope and doubt that shone in her piercing gaze she kept looking and duane could not break the silence it was no ordinary moment  what did you come here for she asked at last  to see you replied duane glad to speak  why  welleuchre thoughthe wanted me to talk to you cheer you up a bit replied duane somewhat lamely the earnest eyes embarrassed him  euchres good hes the only person in this awful place whos been good to me but hes afraid of bland he said you were different who are you  duane told her  youre not a robber or rustler or murderer or some bad man come here to hide  no im not replied duane trying to smile  then why are you here  im on the dodge you know what that means i got in a shootingscrape at home and had to run off when it blows over i hope to go back  but you cant be honest here  yes i can  oh i know what these outlaws are yes youre different she kept the strained gaze upon him but hope was kindling and the hard lines of her youthful face were softening  something sweet and warm stirred deep in duane as he realized the unfortunate girl was experiencing a birth of trust in him  o god maybe youre the man to save meto take me away before its too late  duanes spirit leaped  maybe i am he replied instantly  she seemed to check a blind impulse to run into his arms her cheek flamed her lips quivered her bosom swelled under her ragged dress then the glow began to fade doubt once more assailed her  it cant be youre onlyafter me too like blandlike all of them  duanes long arms went out and his hands clasped her shoulders he shook her  look at mestraight in the eye there are decent men havent you a fathera brother  theyre deadkilled by raiders we lived in dimmit county i was carried away jennie replied hurriedly she put up an appealing hand to him forgive me i believei know youre good it was onlyi live so much in fearim half crazyive almost forgotten what good men are like mister duane youll help me  yes jennie i will tell me how what must i do have you any plan  oh no but take me away  ill try said duane simply that wont be easy though i must have time to think you must help me there are many things to consider horses food trails and then the best time to make the attempt are you watchedkept prisoner  no i could have run off lots of times but i was afraid id only have fallen into worse hands euchre has told me that mrs bland beats me half starves me but she has kept me from her husband and these other dogs shes been as good as that and im grateful she hasnt done it for love of me though she always hated me and lately shes growing jealous there was a man came here by the name of spenceso he called himself he tried to be kind to me but she wouldnt let him she was in love with him shes a bad woman bland finally shot spence and that ended that shes been jealous ever since i hear her fighting with bland about me she swears shell kill me before he gets me and bland laughs in her face then ive heard chess alloway try to persuade bland to give me to him but bland doesnt laugh then just lately before bland went away things almost came to a head i couldnt sleep i wished mrs bland would kill me ill certainly kill myself if they ruin me duane you must be quick if youd save me  i realize that replied he thoughtfully i think my difficulty will be to fool mrs bland if she suspected me shed have the whole gang of outlaws on me at once  she would that youve got to be carefuland quick  what kind of woman is she inquired duane  shesshes brazen ive heard her with her lovers they get drunk sometimes when blands away shes got a terrible temper shes vain she likes flattery oh you could fool her easy enough if youd lower yourself toto  to make love to her interrupted duane  jennie bravely turned shamed eyes to meet his  my girl id do worse than that to get you away from here he said bluntly  butduane she faltered and again she put out the appealing hand bland will kill you  duane made no reply to this he was trying to still a rising strange tumult in his breast the old emotionthe rush of an instinct to kill he turned cold all over  chess alloway will kill you if bland doesnt went on jennie with her tragic eyes on duanes  maybe he will replied duane it was difficult for him to force a smile but he achieved one  oh better take me off at once she said save me without risking so muchwithout making love to mrs bland  surely if i can there i see euchre coming with a woman  thats her oh she mustnt see me with you  waita moment whispered duane as jennie slipped indoors weve settled it dont forget ill find some way to get word to you perhaps through euchre meanwhile keep up your courage remember ill save you somehow well try strategy first whatever you see or hear me do dont think less of me  jennie checked him with a gesture and a wonderful gray flash of eyes  ill bless you with every drop of blood in my heart she whispered passionately  it was only as she turned away into the room that duane saw she was lame and that she wore mexican sandals over bare feet  he sat down upon a bench on the porch and directed his attention to the approaching couple the trees of the grove were thick enough for him to make reasonably sure that mrs bland had not seen him talking to jennie when the outlaws wife drew near duane saw that she was a tall strong fullbodied woman rather goodlooking with a fullblown bold attractiveness duane was more concerned with her expression than with her good looks and as she appeared unsuspicious he felt relieved the situation then took on a singular zest  euchre came up on the porch and awkwardly introduced duane to mrs bland she was young probably not over twentyfive and not quite so prepossessing at close range her eyes were large rather prominent and brown in color her mouth too was large with the lips full and she had white teeth  duane took her proffered hand and remarked frankly that he was glad to meet her  mrs bland appeared pleased and her laugh which followed was loud and rather musical  mr duanebuck duane euchre said didnt he she asked  buckley corrected duane the nicknames not of my choosing  im certainly glad to meet you buckley duane she said as she took the seat duane offered her sorry to have been out kid fullers lying over at degers you know he was shot last night hes got fever today when blands away i have to nurse all these shotup boys and it sure takes my time have you been waiting here alone didnt see that slattern girl of mine  she gave him a sharp glance the woman had an extraordinary play of feature duane thought and unless she was smiling was not pretty at all  ive been alone replied duane havent seen anybody but a sicklooking girl with a bucket and she ran when she saw me  that was jen said mrs bland shes the kid we keep here and she sure hardly pays her keep did euchre tell you about her  now that i think of it he did say something or other  what did he tell you about me bluntly asked mrs bland  wal kate replied euchre speaking for himself you neednt worry none for i told buck nothin but compliments  evidently the outlaws wife liked euchre for her keen glance rested with amusement upon him  as for jen ill tell you her story some day went on the woman its a common enough story along this river euchre here is a tenderhearted old fool and jen has taken him in  wal seein as youve got me figgered correct replied euchre dryly ill go in an talk to jennie if i may  certainly go ahead jen calls you her best friend said mrs bland amiably youre always fetching some mexican stuff and thats why i guess  when euchre had shuffled into the house mrs bland turned to duane with curiosity and interest in her gaze  bland told me about you  what did he say queried duane in pretended alarm  oh you neednt think hes done you dirt blands not that kind of a man he said kate theres a young fellow in camprode in here on the dodge hes no criminal and he refused to join my band wish he would slickest hand with a gun ive seen for many a day id like to see him and chess meet out there in the road then bland went on to tell how you and bosomer came together  what did you say inquired duane as she paused  me why i asked him what you looked like she replied gayly  well went on duane  magnificent chap bland said bigger than any man in the valley just a great blueeyed sunburned boy  humph exclaimed duane im sorry he led you to expect somebody worth seeing  but im not disappointed she returned archly duane are you going to stay long here in camp  yes till i run out of money and have to move why  mrs blands face underwent one of the singular changes the smiles and flushes and glances all that had been coquettish about her had lent her a certain attractiveness almost beauty and youth but with some powerful emotion she changed and instantly became a woman of discontent duane imagined of deep violent nature  ill tell you duane she said earnestly im sure glad if you mean to bide here awhile im a miserable woman duane im an outlaws wife and i hate him and the life i have to lead i come of a good family in brownsville i never knew bland was an outlaw till long after he married me we were separated at times and i imagined he was away on business but the truth came out bland shot my own cousin who told me my family cast me off and i had to flee with bland i was only eighteen then ive lived here since i never see a decent woman or man i never hear anything about my old home or folks or friends im buried hereburied alive with a lot of thieves and murderers can you blame me for being glad to see a young fellowa gentlemanlike the boys i used to go with i tell you it makes me feel fulli want to cry im sick for somebody to talk to i have no children thank god if i had id not stay here im sick of this hole im lonely  there appeared to be no doubt about the truth of all this genuine emotion checked then halted the hurried speech she broke down and cried it seemed strange to duane that an outlaws wifeand a woman who fitted her consort and the wild nature of their surroundingsshould have weakness enough to weep duane believed and pitied her  im sorry for you he said  dont be sorry for me she said that only makes me see thethe difference between you and me and dont pay any attention to what these outlaws say about me theyre ignorant they couldnt understand me youll hear that bland killed men who ran after me but thats a lie bland like all the other outlaws along this river is always looking for somebody to kill he swears not but i dont believe him he explains that gunplay gravitates to men who are the real thingthat it is provoked by the fourflushes the bad men i dont know all i know is that somebody is being killed every other day he hated spence before spence ever saw me  would bland object if i called on you occasionally inquired duane  no he wouldnt he likes me to have friends ask him yourself when he comes back the trouble has been that two or three of his men fell in love with me and when half drunk got to fighting youre not going to do that  im not going to get half drunk thats certain replied duane  he was surprised to see her eyes dilate then glow with fire before she could reply euchre returned to the porch and that put an end to the conversation  duane was content to let the matter rest there and had little more to say euchre and mrs bland talked and joked while duane listened he tried to form some estimate of her character manifestly she had suffered a wrong if not worse at blands hands she was bitter morbid overemotional if she was a liar which seemed likely enough she was a frank one and believed herself she had no cunning the thing which struck duane so forcibly was that she thirsted for respect in that better than in her weakness of vanity he thought he had discovered a trait through which he could manage her  once while he was revolving these thoughts he happened to glance into the house and deep in the shadow of a corner he caught a pale gleam of jennies face with great staring eyes on him she had been watching him listening to what he said he saw from her expression that she had realized what had been so hard for her to believe watching his chance he flashed a look at her and then it seemed to him the change in her face was wonderful  later after he had left mrs bland with a meaning adiosmanana and was walking along beside the old outlaw he found himself thinking of the girl instead of the woman and of how he had seen her face blaze with hope and gratitude    chapter vii  that night duane was not troubled by ghosts haunting his waking and sleeping hours he awoke feeling bright and eager and grateful to euchre for having put something worth while into his mind during breakfast however he was unusually thoughtful working over the idea of how much or how little he would confide in the outlaw he was aware of euchres scrutiny  wal began the old man at last howd you make out with the kid  kid inquired duane tentatively  jennie i mean whatd you an she talk about  we had a little chat you know you wanted me to cheer her up  euchre sat with coffeecup poised and narrow eyes studying duane  reckon you cheered her all right what im afeared of is mebbe you done the job too well  how so  wal when i went in to jen last night i thought she was half crazy she was burstin with excitement an the look in her eyes hurt me she wouldnt tell me a darn word you said but she hung onto my hands an showed every way without speakin how she wanted to thank me fer bringin you over buck it was plain to me thet youd either gone the limit or else youd been kinder prodigal of cheer an hope id hate to think youd led jennie to hope moren ever would come true  euchre paused and as there seemed no reply forthcoming he went on  buck ive seen some outlaws whose word was good mine is you can trust me i trusted you didnt i takin you over there an puttin you wise to my tryin to help thet poor kid  thus enjoined by euchre duane began to tell the conversations with jennie and mrs bland word for word long before he had reached an end euchre set down the coffeecup and began to stare and at the conclusion of the story his face lost some of its red color and beads of sweat stood out thickly on his brow  wal if thet doesnt floor me he ejaculated blinking at duane young man i figgered you was some swift an sure to make your mark on this river but i reckon i missed your real caliber so thets what it means to be a man i guess id forgot wal im old an even if my heart was in the right place i never was built fer big stunts do you know what itll take to do all you promised jen  i havent any idea replied duane gravely  youll have to pull the wool over kate blands eyes ant even if she falls in love with you whichs shore likely thet wont be easy an shed kill you in a minnit buck if she ever got wise you aint mistaken her none are you  not me euchre shes a woman id fear her more than any man  wal youll have to kill bland an chess alloway an rugg an mebbe some others before you can ride off into the hills with thet girl  why cant we plan to be nice to mrs bland and then at an opportune time sneak off without any gunplay  dont see how on earth returned euchre earnestly when blands away he leaves all kinds of spies an scouts watchin the valley trails theyve all got rifles you couldnt git by them but when the boss is home theres a difference only of course him an chess keep their eyes peeled they both stay to home pretty much except when theyre playin monte or poker over at bensons so i say the best bet is to pick out a good time in the afternoon drift over carelesslike with a couple of hosses choke mrs bland or knock her on the head take jennie with you an make a rush to git out of the valley if you had luck you might pull thet stunt without throwin a gun but i reckon the best figgerin would include dodgin some lead an leavin at least bland or alloway dead behind you im figgerin of course thet when they come home an find out youre visitin kate frequent theyll jest naturally look fer results chess dont like you fer no reason except youre swift on the drawmebbe swifter n him thets the hell of this gunplay business no one can ever tell whos the swifter of two gunmen till they meet thet fact holds a fascination mebbe youll learn some day bland would treat you civil onless there was reason not to an then i dont believe hed invite himself to a meetin with you hed set chess or rugg to put you out of the way still blands no coward an if you came across him at a bad moment youd have to be quicker n you was with bosomer  all right ill meet what comes said duane quickly the great point is to have horses ready and pick the right moment then rush the trick through  thets the only chance fer success an you cant do it alone  ill have to i wouldnt ask you to help me leave you behind  wal ill take my chances replied euchre gruffly im goin to help jennie you can gamble your last peso on thet theres only four men in this camp who would shoot mebland an his righthand pards an thet rabbitfaced benson if you happened to put out bland and chess id stand a good show with the other two anyway im old an tiredwhats the difference if i do git plugged i can risk as much as you buck even if i am afraid of gunplay you said correct hosses ready the right minnit then rush the trick thet much s settled now lets figger all the little details  they talked and planned though in truth it was euchre who planned duane who listened and agreed while awaiting the return of bland and his lieutenants it would be well for duane to grow friendly with the other outlaws to sit in a few games of monte or show a willingness to spend a little money the two schemers were to call upon mrs bland every dayeuchre to carry messages of cheer and warning to jennie duane to blind the elder woman at any cost these preliminaries decided upon they proceeded to put them into action  no hard task was it to win the friendship of the most of those goodnatured outlaws they were used to men of a better order than theirs coming to the hidden camps and sooner or later sinking to their lower level besides with them everything was easy come easy go that was why life itself went on so carelessly and usually ended so cheaply there were men among them however that made duane feel that terrible inexplicable wrath rise in his breast he could not bear to be near them he could not trust himself he felt that any instant a word a deed something might call too deeply to that instinct he could no longer control jackrabbit benson was one of these men because of him and other outlaws of his ilk duane could scarcely ever forget the reality of things this was a hidden valley a robbers den a rendezvous for murderers a wild place stained red by deeds of wild men and because of that there was always a charged atmosphere the merriest idlest most careless moment might in the flash of an eye end in ruthless and tragic action in an assemblage of desperate characters it could not be otherwise the terrible thing that duane sensed was this the valley was beautiful sunny fragrant a place to dream in the mountaintops were always blue or gold rimmed the yellow river slid slowly and majestically by the birds sang in the cottonwoods the horses grazed and pranced children played and women longed for love freedom happiness the outlaws rode in and out free with money and speech they lived comfortably in their adobe homes smoked gambled talked laughed whiled away the idle hoursand all the time life there was wrong and the simplest moment might be precipitated by that evil into the most awful of contrasts duane felt rather than saw a dark brooding shadow over the valley  then without any solicitation or encouragement from duane the bland woman fell passionately in love with him his conscience was never troubled about the beginning of that affair she launched herself it took no great perspicuity on his part to see that and the thing which evidently held her in check was the newness the strangeness and for the moment the allsatisfying fact of his respect for her duane exerted himself to please to amuse to interest to fascinate her and always with deference that was his strong point and it had made his part easy so far he believed he could carry the whole scheme through without involving himself any deeper  he was playing at a game of loveplaying with life and deaths sometimes he trembled not that he feared bland or alloway or any other man but at the deeps of life he had come to see into he was carried out of his old mood not once since this daring motive had stirred him had he been haunted by the phantom of bain beside his bed rather had he been haunted by jennies sad face her wistful smile her eyes he never was able to speak a word to her what little communication he had with her was through euchre who carried short messages but he caught glimpses of her every time he went to the bland house she contrived somehow to pass door or window to give him a look when chance afforded and duane discovered with surprise that these moments were more thrilling to him than any with mrs bland often duane knew jennie was sitting just inside the window and then he felt inspired in his talk and it was all made for her so at least she came to know him while as yet she was almost a stranger jennie had been instructed by euchre to listen to understand that this was duanes only chance to help keep her mind from constant worry to gather the import of every word which had a double meaning  euchre said that the girl had begun to wither under the strain to burn up with intense hope which had flamed within her but all the difference duane could see was a paler face and darker more wonderful eyes the eyes seemed to be entreating him to hurry that time was flying that soon it might be too late then there was another meaning in them a light a strange fire wholly inexplicable to duane it was only a flash gone in an instant but he remembered it because he had never seen it in any other womans eyes and all through those waiting days he knew that jennies face and especially the warm fleeting glance she gave him was responsible for a subtle and gradual change in him this change he fancied was only that through remembrance of her he got rid of his pale sickening ghosts  one day a careless mexican threw a lighted cigarette up into the brush matting that served as a ceiling for bensons den and there was a fire which left little more than the adobe walls standing the result was that while repairs were being made there was no gambling and drinking time hung very heavily on the hands of some twoscore outlaws days passed by without a brawl and blands valley saw more successive hours of peace than ever before duane however found the hours anything but empty he spent more time at mrs blands he walked miles on all the trails leading out of the valley he had a care for the condition of his two horses  upon his return from the latest of these tramps euchre suggested that they go down to the river to the boatlanding  ferry couldnt run ashore this mornin said euchre river gettin low an sandbars makin it hard fer hosses theres a greaser freightwagon stuck in the mud i reckon we might hear news from the freighters blands supposed to be in mexico  nearly all the outlaws in camp were assembled on the riverbank lolling in the shade of the cottonwoods the heat was oppressive not an outlaw offered to help the freighters who were trying to dig a heavily freighted wagon out of the quicksand few outlaws would work for themselves let alone for the despised mexicans  duane and euchre joined the lazy group and sat down with them euchre lighted a black pipe and drawing his hat over his eyes lay back in comfort after the manner of the majority of the outlaws but duane was alert observing thoughtful he never missed anything it was his belief that any moment an idle word might be of benefit to him moreover these rough men were always interesting  blands been chased across the river said one  new hes deliverin cattle to thet cuban ship replied another  big deal on hey  some big rugg says the boss hed an order fer fifteen thousand  say that orderll take a year to fill  new hardin is in cahoots with bland between em theyll fill orders bigger n thet  wondered what hardin was rustlin in here fer  duane could not possibly attend to all the conversation among the outlaws he endeavored to get the drift of talk nearest to him  kid fullers goin to cash said a sandywhiskered little outlaw  so jim was tellin me bloodpoison aint it thet hole wasnt bad but he took the fever rejoined a comrade  deger says the kid might pull through if he hed nursin  wal kate bland aint nursin any shotup boys these days she hasnt got time  a laugh followed this sally then came a penetrating silence some of the outlaws glanced goodnaturedly at duane they bore him no ill will manifestly they were aware of mrs blands infatuation  pete pears to me youve said thet before  shore wal its happened before  this remark drew louder laughter and more significant glances at duane he did not choose to ignore them any longer  boys poke all the fun you like at me but dont mention any ladys name again my hand is nervous and itchy these days  he smiled as he spoke and his speech was drawled but the good humor in no wise weakened it then his latter remark was significant to a class of men who from inclination and necessity practiced at gundrawing until they wore callous and sore places on their thumbs and inculcated in the very deeps of their nervous organization a habit that made even the simplest and most innocent motion of the hand end at or near the hip there was something remarkable about a gunfighters hand it never seemed to be gloved never to be injured never out of sight or in an awkward position  there were grizzled outlaws in that group some of whom had many notches on their gunhandles and they with their comrades accorded duane silence that carried conviction of the regard in which he was held  duane could not recall any other instance where he had let fall a familiar speech to these men and certainly he had never before hinted of his possibilities he saw instantly that he could not have done better  orful hot aint it remarked bill black presently bill could not keep quiet for long he was a typical texas desperado had never been anything else he was stoopshouldered and bowlegged from much riding a wiry little man all muscle with a square head a hard face partly black from scrubby beard and red from sun and a bright roving cruel eye his shirt was open at the neck showing a grizzled breast  is there any guy in this heah outfit sport enough to go swimmin he asked  my gawd bill you aint agoin to wash exclaimed a comrade  this raised a laugh in which black joined but no one seemed eager to join him in a bath  laziest outfit i ever rustled with went on bill discontentedly nuthin to do say if nobody wants to swim maybe some of youll gamble  he produced a dirty pack of cards and waved them at the motionless crowd  bill youre too good at cards replied a lanky outlaw  now jasper you say thet powerful sweet an you look sweet er i might take it to heart replied black with a sudden change of tone  here it was againthat upflashing passion what jasper saw fit to reply would mollify the outlaw or it would not there was an even balance  no offense bill said jasper placidly without moving  bill grunted and forgot jasper but he seemed restless and dissatisfied duane knew him to be an inveterate gambler and as bensons place was out of runningorder black was like a fish on dry land  wal if youall are afraid of the cairds what will you bet on he asked in disgust  bill ill play you a game of mumbly peg fer two bits replied one  black eagerly accepted betting to him was a serious matter the game obsessed him not the stakes he entered into the mumbly peg contest with a thoughtful mien and a corded brow he won other comrades tried their luck with him and lost finally when bill had exhausted their supply of twobit pieces or their desire for that particular game he offered to bet on anything  see thet turtledove there he said pointing ill bet hell scare at one stone or he wont five pesos hell fly or he wont fly when some one chucks a stone wholl take me up  that appeared to be more than the gambling spirit of several outlaws could withstand  take thet easy money said one  whos goin to chuck the stone asked another  anybody replied bill  wal ill bet you i can scare him with one stone said the first outlaw  were in on thet jim to fire the darnick chimed in the others  the money was put up the stone thrown the turtledove took flight to the great joy of all the outlaws except bill  ill bet youall hell come back to thet tree inside of five minnits he offered imperturbably  hereupon the outlaws did not show any laziness in their alacrity to cover bills money as it lay on the grass somebody had a watch and they all sat down dividing attention between the timepiece and the tree the minutes dragged by to the accompaniment of various jocular remarks anent a fool and his money when four and threequarter minutes had passed a turtledove alighted in the cottonwood then ensued an impressive silence while bill calmly pocketed the fifty dollars  but it hadnt the same dove exclaimed one outlaw excitedly this nis smaller dustier not so purple  bill eyed the speaker loftily  wal youll have to ketch the other one to prove thet sabe pard now ill bet any gent heah the fifty i won thet i can scare thet dove with one stone  no one offered to take his wager  wal then ill bet any of you even money thet you cant scare him with one stone  not proof against this chance the outlaws made up a purse in no wise disconcerted by bills contemptuous allusions to their banding together the stone was thrown the dove did not fly thereafter in regard to that bird bill was unable to coax or scorn his comrades into any kind of wager  he tried them with a multiplicity of offers and in vain then he appeared at a loss for some unusual and seductive wager presently a little ragged mexican boy came along the river trail a particularly starved and poorlooking little fellow bill called to him and gave him a handful of silver coins speechless dazed he went his way hugging the money  ill bet he drops some before he gits to the road declared bill ill bet he runs hurry you fourflush gamblers  bill failed to interest any of his companions and forthwith became sullen and silent strangely his good humor departed in spite of the fact that he had won considerable  duane watching the disgruntled outlaw marveled at him and wondered what was in his mind these men were more variable than children as unstable as water as dangerous as dynamite  bill ill bet you ten you cant spill whatevers in the bucket thet peons packin said the outlaw called jim  blacks head came up with the action of a hawk about to swoop  duane glanced from black to the road where he saw a crippled peon carrying a tin bucket toward the river this peon was a halfwitted indian who lived in a shack and did odd jobs for the mexicans duane had met him often  jim ill take you up replied black  something perhaps a harshness in his voice caused duane to whirl he caught a leaping gleam in the outlaws eye  aw bill thets too fur a shot said jasper as black rested an elbow on his knee and sighted over the long heavy colt the distance to the peon was about fifty paces too far for even the most expert shot to hit a moving object so small as a bucket  duane marvelously keen in the alignment of sights was positive that black held too high another look at the hard face now tense and dark with blood confirmed duanes suspicion that the outlaw was not aiming at the bucket at all duane leaped and struck the leveled gun out of his hand another outlaw picked it up  black fell back astounded deprived of his weapon he did not seem the same man or else he was cowed by duanes significant and formidable front sullenly he turned away without even asking for his gun    chapter viii  what a contrast duane thought the evening of that day presented to the state of his soul  the sunset lingered in golden glory over the distant mexican mountains twilight came slowly a faint breeze blew from the river cool and sweet the late cooing of a dove and the tinkle of a cowbell were the only sounds a serene and tranquil peace lay over the valley  inside duanes body there was strife this third facing of a desperate man had thrown him off his balance it had not been fatal but it threatened so much the better side of his nature seemed to urge him to die rather than to go on fighting or opposing ignorant unfortunate savage men but the perversity of him was so great that it dwarfed reason conscience he could not resist it he felt something dying in him he suffered hope seemed far away despair had seized upon him and was driving him into a reckless mood when he thought of jennie  he had forgotten her he had forgotten that he had promised to save her he had forgotten that he meant to snuff out as many lives as might stand between her and freedom the very remembrance sheered off his morbid introspection she made a difference how strange for him to realize that he felt grateful to her he had been forced into outlawry she had been stolen from her people and carried into captivity they had met in the river fastness he to instil hope into her despairing life she to be the means perhaps of keeping him from sinking to the level of her captors he became conscious of a strong and beating desire to see her talk with her  these thoughts had run through his mind while on his way to mrs blands house he had let euchre go on ahead because he wanted more time to compose himself darkness had about set in when he reached his destination there was no light in the house mrs bland was waiting for him on the porch  she embraced him and the sudden violent unfamiliar contact sent such a shock through him that he all but forgot the deep game he was playing she however in her agitation did not notice his shrinking from her embrace and the tender incoherent words that flowed with it he gathered that euchre had acquainted her of his action with black  he might have killed you she whispered more clearly and if duane had ever heard love in a voice he heard it then it softened him after all she was a woman weak fated through her nature unfortunate in her experience of life doomed to unhappiness and tragedy he met her advance so far that he returned the embrace and kissed her emotion such as she showed would have made any woman sweet and she had a certain charm it was easy even pleasant to kiss her but duane resolved that whatever her abandonment might become he would not go further than the lie she made him act  buck you love me she whispered  yesyes he burst out eager to get it over and even as he spoke he caught the pale gleam of jennies face through the window he felt a shame he was glad she could not see did she remember that she had promised not to misunderstand any action of his what did she think of him seeing him out there in the dusk with this bold woman in his arms somehow that dim sight of jennies pale face the big dark eyes thrilled him inspired him to his hard task of the present  listen dear he said to the woman and he meant his words for the girl im going to take you away from this outlaw den if i have to kill bland alloway rugganybody who stands in my path you were dragged here you are goodi know it theres happiness for you somewherea home among good people who will care for you just wait till  his voice trailed off and failed from excess of emotion kate bland closed her eyes and leaned her head on his breast duane felt her heart beat against his and conscience smote him a keen blow if she loved him so much but memory and understanding of her character hardened him again and he gave her such commiseration as was due her sex and no more  boy thats good of you she whispered but its too late im done for i cant leave bland all i ask is that you love me a little and stop your gunthrowing  the moon had risen over the eastern bulge of dark mountain and now the valley was flooded with mellow light and shadows of cottonwoods wavered against the silver  suddenly the clipclop clipclop of hoofs caused duane to raise his head and listen horses were coming down the road from the head of the valley the hour was unusual for riders to come in presently the narrow moonlit lane was crossed at its far end by black moving objects two horses duane discerned  its bland whispered the woman grasping duane with shaking hands you must run no hed see you that d be worse its bland i know his horses trot  but you said he wouldnt mind my calling here protested duane euchres with me itll be all right  maybe so she replied with visible effort at selfcontrol manifestly she had a great fear of bland if i could only think  then she dragged duane to the door pushed him in  euchre come out with me duane you stay with the girl ill tell bland youre in love with her jen if you give us away ill wring your neck  the swift action and fierce whisper told duane that mrs bland was herself again duane stepped close to jennie who stood near the window neither spoke but her hands were outstretched to meet his own they were small trembling hands cold as ice he held them close trying to convey what he feltthat he would protect her she leaned against him and they looked out of the window duane felt calm and sure of himself his most pronounced feeling besides that for the frightened girl was a curiosity as to how mrs bland would rise to the occasion he saw the riders dismount down the lane and wearily come forward a boy led away the horses euchre the old fox was talking loud and with remarkable ease considering what he claimed was his natural cowardice  that was way back in the sixties about the time of the war he was saying rustlin cattle wasnt nuthin then to what it is now an times is rougher these days this gunthrowin has come to be a disease men have an itch for the draw same as they used to have fer poker the only real gambler outside of greasers we ever had here was bill an i presume bill is burnin now  the approaching outlaws hearing voices halted a rod or so from the porch then mrs bland uttered an exclamation ostensibly meant to express surprise and hurried out to meet them she greeted her husband warmly and gave welcome to the other man duane could not see well enough in the shadow to recognize blands companion but he believed it was alloway  dogtired we are and starved said bland heavily whos here with you  thats euchre on the porch duane is inside at the window with jen replied mrs bland  duane he exclaimed then he whispered lowsomething duane could not catch  why i asked him to come said the chiefs wife she spoke easily and naturally and made no change in tone jen has been ailing she gets thinner and whiter every day duane came here one day with euchre saw jen and went loony over her pretty face same as all you men so i let him come  bland cursed low and deep under his breath the other man made a violent action of some kind and apparently was quieted by a restraining hand  kate you let duane make love to jennie queried bland incredulously  yes i did replied the wife stubbornly why not jens in love with him if he takes her away and marries her she can be a decent woman  bland kept silent a moment then his laugh pealed out loud and harsh  chess did you get that well by god what do you think of my wife  shes lyin or shes crazy replied alloway and his voice carried an unpleasant ring  mrs bland promptly and indignantly told her husbands lieutenant to keep his mouth shut  ho ho ho rolled out blands laugh  then he led the way to the porch his spurs clinking the weapons he was carrying rattling and he flopped down on a bench  how are you boss asked euchre  hello old man im well but all in  alloway slowly walked on to the porch and leaned against the rail he answered euchres greeting with a nod then he stood there a dark silent figure  mrs blands full voice in eager questioning had a tendency to ease the situation bland replied briefly to her reporting a remarkably successful trip  duane thought it time to show himself he had a feeling that bland and alloway would let him go for the moment they were plainly nonplussed and alloway seemed sullen brooding jennie whispered duane that was clever of mrs bland well keep up the deception any day now be ready  she pressed close to him and a barely audible hurry came breathing into his ear  good night jennie he said aloud hope you feel better tomorrow  then he stepped out into the moonlight and spoke bland returned the greeting and though he was not amiable he did not show resentment  met jasper as i rode in said bland presently he told me you made bill black mad and theres liable to be a fight what did you go off the handle about  duane explained the incident im sorry i happened to be there he went on it wasnt my business  scurvy trick that d been muttered bland you did right all the same duane i want you to stop quarreling with my men if you were one of usthatd be different i cant keep my men from fighting but im not called on to let an outsider hang around my camp and plug my rustlers  i guess ill have to be hitting the trail for somewhere said duane  why not join my band youve got a bad start already duane and if i know this border youll never be a respectable citizen again youre a born killer i know every bad man on this frontier more than one of them have told me that something exploded in their brain and when sense came back there lay another dead man its not so with me ive done a little shooting too but i never wanted to kill another man just to rid myself of the last one my dead men dont sit on my chest at night thats the gunfighters trouble hes crazy he has to kill a new manhes driven to it to forget the last one  but im no gunfighter protested duane circumstances made me  no doubt interrupted bland with a laugh circumstances made me a rustler you dont know yourself youre young youve got a temper your father was one of the most dangerous men texas ever had i dont see any other career for you instead of going it alonea lone wolf as the texans saywhy not make friends with other outlaws youll live longer  euchre squirmed in his seat  boss ive been givin the boy egzactly thet same line of talk thets why i took him in to bunk with me if he makes pards among us there wont be any more trouble an hed be a grand feller fer the gang ive seen wild bill hickok throw a gun an billy the kid an hardin an chess hereall the fastest men on the border an with apologies to present company im here to say duane has them all skinned his draw is different you cant see how he does it  euchres admiring praise served to create an effective little silence alloway shifted uneasily on his feet his spurs jangling faintly and did not lift his head bland seemed thoughtful  thats about the only qualification i have to make me eligible for your band said duane easily  its good enough replied bland shortly will you consider the idea  ill think it over good night  he left the group followed by euchre when they reached the end of the lane and before they had exchanged a word bland called euchre back duane proceeded slowly along the moonlit road to the cabin and sat down under the cottonwoods to wait for euchre the night was intense and quiet a low hum of insects giving the effect of a congestion of life the beauty of the soaring moon the ebony canons of shadow under the mountain the melancholy serenity of the perfect night made duane shudder in the realization of how far aloof he now was from enjoyment of these things never again so long as he lived could he be natural his mind was clouded his eye and ear henceforth must register impressions of nature but the joy of them had fled  still as he sat there with a foreboding of more and darker work ahead of him there was yet a strange sweetness left to him and it lay in thought of jennie the pressure of her cold little hands lingered in his he did not think of her as a woman and he did not analyze his feelings he just had vague dreamy thoughts and imaginations that were interspersed in the constant and stern revolving of plans to save her  a shuffling step roused him euchres dark figure came crossing the moonlit grass under the cottonwoods the moment the outlaw reached him duane saw that he was laboring under great excitement it scarcely affected duane he seemed to be acquiring patience calmness strength  bland kept you pretty long he said  wait till i git my breath replied euchre he sat silent a little while fanning himself with a sombrero though the night was cool and then he went into the cabin to return presently with a lighted pipe  fine night he said and his tone further acquainted duane with euchres quaint humor fine night for loveaffairs by gum  id noticed that rejoined duane dryly  wal im a son of a gun if i didnt stand an watch bland choke his wife till her tongue stuck out an she got black in the face  no ejaculated duane  hope to die if i didnt buck listen to this here yarn when i got back to the porch i seen bland was wakin up hed been too fagged out to figger much alloway an kate had gone in the house where they lit up the lamps i heard kates high voice but alloway never chirped hes not the talkin kind an hes damn dangerous when hes thet way bland asked me some questions right from the shoulder i was ready for them an i swore the moon was green cheese he was satisfied bland always trusted me an liked me too i reckon i hated to lie black thet way but hes a hard man with bad intentions toward jennie an id doublecross him any day  then we went into the house jennie had gone to her little room an bland called her to come out she said she was undressin an he ordered her to put her clothes back on then buck his next move was some surprisin he deliberately thronged a gun on kate yes sir he pointed his big blue colt right at her an he says  ive a mind to blow out your brains  go ahead says kate cool as could be  you lied to me he roars  kate laughed in his face bland slammed the gun down an made a grab fer her she fought him but wasnt a match fer him an he got her by the throat he choked her till i thought she was strangled alloway made him stop she flopped down on the bed an gasped fer a while when she come to them hardshelled cusses went after her trying to make her give herself away i think bland was jealous he suspected shed got thick with you an was foolin him i reckon thets a sore feelin fer a man to haveto guess pretty nice but not to be sure bland gave it up after a while an then he cussed an raved at her one sayin of his is worth pinnin in your sombrero it aint nuthin to kill a man i dont need much fer thet but i want to know you hussy  then he went in an dragged poor jen out shed had time to dress he was so mad he hurt her sore leg you know jen got thet injury fightin off one of them devils in the dark an when i seen bland twist herhurt heri had a queer hot feelin deep down in me an fer the only time in my life i wished i was a gunfighter  wal jen amazed me she was whitern a sheet an her eyes were big and stary but she had nerve fust time i ever seen her show any  jennie he said my wife said duane came here to see you i believe shes lyin i think shes been carryin on with him an i want to know if shes been an you tell me the truth ill let you go ill send you out to huntsville where you can communicate with your friends ill give you money  thet must hev been a hell of a minnit fer kate bland if evet i seen death in a mans eye i seen it in blands he loves her thets the strange part of it  has duane been comin here to see my wife bland asked fiercelike  no said jennie  hes been after you  yes  he has fallen in love with you kate said thet  iim noti dont knowhe hasnt told me  but youre in love with him  yes she said an buck if you only could have seen her she thronged up her head an her eyes were full of fire bland seemed dazed at sight of her an alloway why thet little skunk of an outlaw cried right out he was hit plumb center hes in love with jen an the look of her then was enough to make any feller quit he jest slunk out of the room i told you mebbe thet hed been tryin to git bland to marry jen to him so even a tough like alloway can love a woman  bland stamped up an down the room he sure was dyin hard  jennie he said once more turnin to her you swear in fear of your life thet youre tellin truth kates not in love with duane shes let him come to see you theres been nuthin between them  no i swear answered jennie an bland sat down like a man licked  go to bed you whitefaced bland choked on some word or othera bad one i reckonan he positively shook in his chair  jennie went then an kate began to have hysterics an your uncle euchre ducked his nut out of the door an come home  duane did not have a word to say at the end of euchres long harangue he experienced relief as a matter of fact he had expected a good deal worse he thrilled at the thought of jennie perjuring herself to save that abandoned woman what mysteries these feminine creatures were  wal theres where our little deal stands now resumed euchre meditatively you know buck as well as me thet if youd been some feller who hadnt shown he was a wonder with a gun youd now be full of lead if youd happen to kill bland an alloway i reckon youd be as safe on this here border as you would in santone such is gun fame in this land of the draw    chapter ix  both men were awake early silent with the premonition of trouble ahead thoughtful of the fact that the time for the longplanned action was at hand it was remarkable that a man as loquacious as euchre could hold his tongue so long and this was significant of the deadly nature of the intended deed during breakfast he said a few words customary in the service of food at the conclusion of the meal he seemed to come to an end of deliberation  buck the sooner the better now he declared with a glint in his eye the more time we use up now the less surprised blandll be  im ready when you are replied duane quietly and he rose from the table  wal saddle up then went on euchre gruffly tie on them two packs i made one fer each saddle you cant tellmebbe either hoss will be carryin double its good theyre both big strong hosses guess thet wasnt a wise move of your uncle euchresbringin in your hosses an havin them ready  euchre i hope youre not going to get in bad here im afraid you are let me do the rest now said duane  the old outlaw eyed him sarcastically  thet d be turrible now wouldnt it if you want to know why im in bad already i didnt tell you thet alloway called me last night hes gettin wise pretty quick  euchre youre going with me queried duane suddenly divining the truth  wal i reckon either to hell or safe over the mountain i wisht i was a gunfighter i hate to leave here without takin a peg at jackrabbit benson now buck you do some hard figgerin while i go nosin round its pretty early which s all the better  euchre put on his sombrero and as he went out duane saw that he wore a gunandcartridge belt it was the first time duane had ever seen the outlaw armed  duane packed his few belongings into his saddlebags and then carried the saddles out to the corral an abundance of alfalfa in the corral showed that the horses had fared well they had gotten almost fat during his stay in the valley he watered them put on the saddles loosely cinched and then the bridles his next move was to fill the two canvas waterbottles that done he returned to the cabin to wait  at the moment he felt no excitement or agitation of any kind there was no more thinking and planning to do the hour had arrived and he was ready he understood perfectly the desperate chances he must take his thoughts became confined to euchre and the surprising loyalty and goodness in the hardened old outlaw time passed slowly duane kept glancing at his watch he hoped to start the thing and get away before the outlaws were out of their beds finally he heard the shuffle of euchres boots on the hard path the sound was quicker than usual  when euchre came around the corner of the cabin duane was not so astounded as he was concerned to see the outlaw white and shaking sweat dripped from him he had a wild look  luck ourssofur buck he panted  you dont look it replied duane  im turrible sick jest killed a man fust one i ever killed  who asked duane startled  jackrabbit benson an sick as i am im gloryin in it i went nosin round up the road saw alloway goin into degers hes thick with the degers reckon hes askin questions anyway i was sure glad to see him away from blands an he didnt see me when i dropped into bensons there wasnt nobody there but jackrabbit an some greasers he was startin to work benson never had no use fer me an he up an said he wouldnt give a twobit piece fer my life i asked him why  youre doublecrossin the boss an chess he said  jack what d you give fer your own life i asked him  he straightened up surprised an meanlookin an i let him have it plumb center he wilted an the greasers run i reckon ill never sleep again but i had to do it  duane asked if the shot had attracted any attention outside  i didnt see anybody but the greasers an i sure looked sharp comin back i cut across through the cottonwoods past blands cabin i meant to keep out of sight but somehow i had an idee i might find out if bland was awake yet sure enough i run plumb into beppo the boy who tends blands hosses beppo likes me an when i inquired of his boss he said bland had been up all night fightin with the senora an buck heres how i figger bland couldnt let up last night he was sore an he went after kate again tryin to wear her down jest as likely he might have went after jennie with wuss intentions anyway he an kate must have had it hot an heavy were pretty lucky  it seems so well im going said duane tersely  lucky i should smiler blands been up all night after a most draggin ride home hell be fagged out this mornin sleepy sore an he wont be expectin hell before breakfast now you walk over to his house meet him how you like thets your game but im suggestin if he comes out an you want to parley you can jest say youd thought over his proposition an was ready to join his band or you aint youll have to kill him an it d save time to go fer your gun on sight might be wise too fer its likely hell do thet same  how about the horses  ill fetch them an come along about two minnits behind you pears to me you ought to have the job done an jennie outside by the time i git there once on them hosses we can ride out of camp before alloway or anybody else gits into action jennie aint much heavier than a rabbit thet big black will carry you both  all right but once more let me persuade you to staynot to mix any more in this said duane earnestly  nope im goin you heard what benson told me alloway wouldnt give me the benefit of any doubts buck a last wordlook out fer thet bland woman  duane merely nodded and then saying that the horses were ready he strode away through the grove accounting for the short cut across grove and field it was about five minutes walk up to blands house to duane it seemed long in time and distance and he had difficulty in restraining his pace as he walked there came a gradual and subtle change in his feelings again he was going out to meet a man in conflict he could have avoided this meeting but despite the fact of his courting the encounter he had not as yet felt that hot inexplicable rush of blood the motive of this deadly action was not personal and somehow that made a difference  no outlaws were in sight he saw several mexican herders with cattle blue columns of smoke curled up over some of the cabins the fragrant smell of it reminded duane of his home and cutting wood for the stove he noted a cloud of creamy mist rising above the river dissolving in the sunlight  then he entered blands lane  while yet some distance from the cabin he heard loud angry voices of man and woman bland and kate still quarreling he took a quick survey of the surroundings there was now not even a mexican in sight then he hurried a little halfway down the lane he turned his head to peer through the cottonwoods this time he saw euchre coming with the horses there was no indication that the old outlaw might lose his nerve at the end duane had feared this  duane now changed his walk to a leisurely saunter he reached the porch and then distinguished what was said inside the cabin  if you do bland by heaven ill fix you and her that was panted out in kate blands full voice  let me looser im going in there i tell you replied bland hoarsely  what for  i want to make a little love to her ha ha itll be fun to have the laugh on her new lover  you lie cried kate bland  im not saying what ill do to her afterward his voice grew hoarser with passion let me go now  no no i wont let you go youll choke thethe truth out of heryoull kill her  the truth hissed bland  yes i lied jen lied but she lied to save me you needntmurder herfor that  bland cursed horribly then followed a wrestling sound of bodies in violent straining contactthe scrape of feetthe jangle of spursa crash of sliding table or chair and then the cry of a woman in pain  duane stepped into the open door inside the room kate bland lay half across a table where she had been flung and she was trying to get to her feet blands back was turned he had opened the door into jennies room and had one foot across the threshold duane caught the girls low shuddering cry then he called out loud and clear  with catlike swiftness bland wheeled then froze on the threshold his sight quick as his action caught duanes menacing unmistakable position  blands big frame filled the door he was in a bad place to reach for his gun but he would not have time for a step duane read in his eyes the desperate calculation of chances for a fleeting instant bland shifted his glance to his wife then his whole body seemed to vibrate with the swing of his arm  duane shot him he fell forward his gun exploding as it hit into the floor and dropped loose from stretching fingers duane stood over him stooped to turn him on his back bland looked up with clouded gaze then gasped his last  duane youve killed him cried kate bland huskily i knew youd have to  she staggered against the wall her eyes dilating her strong hands clenching her face slowly whitening she appeared shocked half stunned but showed no grief  jennie called duane sharply  ohduane came a halting reply  yes come out hurry  she came out with uneven steps seeing only him and she stumbled over blands body duane caught her arm swung her behind him he feared the woman when she realized how she had been duped his action was protective and his movement toward the door equally as significant  duane cried mrs bland  it was no time for talk duane edged on keeping jennie behind him at that moment there was a pounding of ironshod hoofs out in the lane kate bland bounded to the door when she turned back her amazement was changing to realization  where re you taking jen she cried her voice like a mans get out of my way replied duane his look perhaps without speech was enough for her in an instant she was transformed into a fury  you hound all the time you were fooling me you made love to me you let me believeyou swore you loved me now i see what was queer about you all for that girl but you cant have her youll never leave here alive give me that girl let meget at her shell never win any more men in this camp  she was a powerful woman and it took all duanes strength to ward off her onslaughts she clawed at jennie over his upheld arm every second her fury increased  help help help she shrieked in a voice that must have penetrated to the remotest cabin in the valley  let go let go cried duane low and sharp he still held his gun in his right hand and it began to be hard for him to ward the woman off his coolness had gone with her shriek for help let go he repeated and he shoved her fiercely  suddenly she snatched a rifle off the wall and backed away her strong hands fumbling at the lever as she jerked it down throwing a shell into the chamber and cocking the weapon duane leaped upon her he struck up the rifle as it went off the powder burning his face  jennie run out get on a horse he said  jennie flashed out of the door  with an iron grasp duane held to the riflebarrel he had grasped it with his left hand and he gave such a pull that he swung the crazed woman off the floor but he could not loose her grip she was as strong as he  kate let go  he tried to intimidate her she did not see his gun thrust in her face or reason had given way to such an extent to passion that she did not care she cursed her husband had used the same curses and from her lips they seemed strange unsexed more deadly like a tigress she fought him her face no longer resembled a womans the evil of that outlaw life the wildness and rage the meaning to kill was even in such a moment terribly impressed upon duane  he heard a cry from outsidea mans cry hoarse and alarming  it made him think of loss of time this demon of a woman might yet block his plan  let go he whispered and felt his lips stiff in the grimness of that instant he relaxed his hold on the riflebarrel  with sudden redoubled irresistible strength she wrenched the rifle down and discharged it duane felt a blowa shocka burning agony tearing through his breast then in a frenzy he jerked so powerfully upon the rifle that he threw the woman against the wall she fell and seemed stunned  duane leaped back whirled flew out of the door to the porch the sharp cracking of a gun halted him he saw jennie holding to the bridle of his bay horse euchre was astride the other and he had a colt leveled and he was firing down the lane then came a single shot heavier and euchres ceased he fell from the horse  a swift glance back showed to duane a man coming down the lane chess alloway his gun was smoking he broke into a run then in an instant he saw duane and tried to check his pace as he swung up his arm but that slight pause was fatal duane shot and alloway was falling when his gun went off his bullet whistled close to duane and thudded into the cabin  duane bounded down to the horses jennie was trying to hold the plunging bay euchre lay flat on his back dead a bullethole in his shirt his face set hard and his hands twisted round gun and bridle  jennie youve nerve all right cried duane as he dragged down the horse she was holding up with you now there never mindlong stirrups hang on somehow  he caught his bridle out of euchres clutching grip and leaped astride the frightened horses jumped into a run and thundered down the lane into the road duane saw men running from cabins he heard shouts but there were no shots fired jennie seemed able to stay on her horse but without stirrups she was thrown about so much that duane rode closer and reached out to grasp her arm  thus they rode through the valley to the trail that led up over the steep and broken rim rock as they began to climb duane looked back no pursuers were in sight  jennie were going to get away he cried exultation for her in his voice  she was gazing horrorstricken at his breast as in turning to look back he faced her  oh duane your shirts all bloody she faltered pointing with trembling fingers  with her words duane became aware of two thingsthe hand he instinctively placed to his breast still held his gun and he had sustained a terrible wound  duane had been shot through the breast far enough down to give him grave apprehension of his life the cleancut hole made by the bullet bled freely both at its entrance and where it had come out but with no signs of hemorrhage he did not bleed at the mouth however he began to cough up a reddishtinged foam  as they rode on jennie with pale face and mute lips looked at him  im badly hurt jennie he said but i guess ill stick it out  the womandid she shoot you  yes she was a devil euchre told me to look out for her i wasnt quick enough  you didnt have toto shivered the girl  no no he replied  they did not stop climbing while duane tore a scarf and made compresses which he bound tightly over his wounds the fresh horses made fast time up the rough trail from open places duane looked down when they surmounted the steep ascent and stood on top of the rim rock with no signs of pursuit down in the valley and with the wild broken fastnesses before them duane turned to the girl and assured her that they now had every chance of escape  butyourwound she faltered with dark troubled eyes i seethe blooddripping from your back  jennie ill take a lot of killing he said  then he became silent and attended to the uneven trail he was aware presently that he had not come into blands camp by this route but that did not matter any trail leading out beyond the rim rock was safe enough what he wanted was to get far away into some wild retreat where he could hide till he recovered from his wound he seemed to feel a fire inside his breast and his throat burned so that it was necessary for him to take a swallow of water every little while he began to suffer considerable pain which increased as the hours went by and then gave way to a numbness from that time on he had need of his great strength and endurance gradually he lost his steadiness and his keen sight and he realized that if he were to meet foes or if pursuing outlaws should come up with him he could make only a poor stand so he turned off on a trail that appeared seldom traveled  soon after this move he became conscious of a further thickening of his senses he felt able to hold on to his saddle for a while longer but he was failing then he thought he ought to advise jennie so in case she was left alone she would have some idea of what to do  jennie ill give out soon he said noi dont meanwhat you think but ill drop soon my strengths going if i dieyou ride back to the main trail hide and rest by day ride at night that trail goes to water i believe you could get across the nueces where some rancher will take you in  duane could not get the meaning of her incoherent reply he rode on and soon he could not see the trail or hear his horse he did not know whether they traveled a mile or many times that far but he was conscious when the horse stopped and had a vague sense of falling and feeling jennies arms before all became dark to him  when consciousness returned he found himself lying in a little hut of mesquite branches it was well built and evidently some years old there were two doors or openings one in front and the other at the back duane imagined it had been built by a fugitiveone who meant to keep an eye both ways and not to be surprised duane felt weak and had no desire to move where was he anyway a strange intangible sense of time distance of something far behind weighed upon him sight of the two packs euchre had made brought his thought to jennie what had become of her there was evidence of her work in a smoldering fire and a little blackened coffeepot probably she was outside looking after the horses or getting water he thought he heard a step and listened but he felt tired and presently his eyes closed and he fell into a doze  awakening from this he saw jennie sitting beside him in some way she seemed to have changed when he spoke she gave a start and turned eagerly to him  duane she cried  hello howre you jennie and how am i he said finding it a little difficult to talk  oh im all right she replied and youve come toyour wounds healed but youve been sick fever i guess i did all i could  duane saw now that the difference in her was a whiteness and tightness of skin a hollowness of eye a look of strain  fever how long have we been here he asked  she took some pebbles from the crown of his sombrero and counted them  nine nine days she answered  nine days he exclaimed incredulously but another look at her assured him that she meant what she said ive been sick all the time you nursed me  yes  blands men didnt come along here  no  where are the horses  i keep them grazing down in a gorge back of here theres good grass and water  have you slept any  a little lately i couldnt keep awake  good lord i should think not youve had a time of it sitting here day and night nursing me watching for the outlaws come tell me all about it  theres nothing much to tell  i want to know anyway just what you didhow you felt  i cant remember very well she replied simply we must have ridden forty miles that day we got away you bled all the time toward evening you lay on your horses neck when we came to this place you fell out of the saddle i dragged you in here and stopped your bleeding i thought youd die that night but in the morning i had a little hope i had forgotten the horses but luckily they didnt stray far i caught them and kept them down in the gorge when your wounds closed and you began to breathe stronger i thought youd get well quick it was fever that put you back you raved a lot and that worried me because i couldnt stop you anybody trailing us could have heard you a good ways i dont know whether i was scared most then or when you were quiet and it was so dark and lonely and still all around every day i put a stone in your hat  jennie you saved my life said duane  i dont know maybe i did all i knew how to do she replied you saved minemore than my life  their eyes met in a long gaze and then their hands in a close clasp  jennie were going to get away he said with gladness ill be well in a few days you dont know how strong i am well hide by day and travel by night i can get you across the river  and then she asked  well find some honest rancher  and then she persisted  why he began slowly thats as far as my thoughts ever got it was pretty hard i tell you to assure myself of so much it means your safety youll tell your story youll be sent to some village or town and taken care of until a relative or friend is notified  and you she inquired in a strange voice  duane kept silence  what will you do she went on  jennie ill go back to the brakes i darent show my face among respectable people im an outlaw  youre no criminal she declared with deep passion  jennie on this border the little difference between an out law and a criminal doesnt count for much  you wont go back among those terrible men you with your gentleness and sweetnessall thats good about you oh duane dontdont go  i cant go back to the outlaws at least not blands band no ill go alone ill lonewolf it as they say on the border what else can i do jennie  oh i dont know couldnt you hide couldnt you slip out of texasgo far away  i could never get out of texas without being arrested i could hide but a man must live never mind about me jennie  in three days duane was able with great difficulty to mount his horse during daylight by short relays he and jennie rode back to the main trail where they hid again till he had rested then in the dark they rode out of the canons and gullies of the rim rock and early in the morning halted at the first water to camp  from that point they traveled after nightfall and went into hiding during the day once across the nueces river duane was assured of safety for her and great danger for himself they had crossed into a country he did not know somewhere east of the river there were scattered ranches but he was as liable to find the rancher in touch with the outlaws as he was likely to find him honest duane hoped his good fortune would not desert him in this last service to jennie next to the worry of that was realization of his condition he had gotten up too soon he had ridden too far and hard and now he felt that any moment he might fall from his saddle at last far ahead over a barren mesquitedotted stretch of dusty ground he espied a patch of green and a little flat red ranchhouse he headed his horse for it and turned a face he tried to make cheerful for jennies sake she seemed both happy and sorry  when near at hand he saw that the rancher was a thrifty farmer and thrift spoke for honesty there were fields of alfalfa fruittrees corrals windmill pumps irrigationditches all surrounding a neat little adobe house some children were playing in the yard the way they ran at sight of duane hinted of both the loneliness and the fear of their isolated lives duane saw a woman come to the door then a man the latter looked keenly then stepped outside he was a sandyhaired freckled texan  howdy stranger he called as duane halted get down you an your woman say now air you sick or shot or what let me  duane reeling in his saddle bent searching eyes upon the rancher he thought he saw good will kindness honesty he risked all on that one sharp glance then he almost plunged from the saddle  the rancher caught him helped him to a bench  martha come out here he called this mans sick no hes shot or i dont know bloodstains  jennie had slipped off her horse and to duanes side duane appeared about to faint  air you his wife asked the rancher  no im only a girl he saved from outlaws oh hes so paler duane duane  buck duane exclaimed the rancher excitedly the man who killed bland an alloway say i owe him a good turn an ill pay it young woman  the ranchers wife came out and with a manner at once kind and practical essayed to make duane drink from a flask he was not so far gone that he could not recognize its contents which he refused and weakly asked for water when that was given him he found his voice  yes im duane ive only overdone myselfjust all in the wounds i got at blands are healing will you take this girl inhide her awhile till the excitements over among the outlaws  i shore will replied the texan  thanks ill remember youill square it  what re you goin to do  ill rest a bitthen go back to the brakes  young man you aint in any shape to travel see hereany rustlers on your trail  i think we gave blands gang the slip  good ill tell you what ill take you in along with the girl an hide both of you till you get well itll be safe my nearest neighbor is five miles off we dont have much company  you risk a great deal both outlaws and rangers are hunting me said duane  never seen a ranger yet in these parts an have always got along with outlaws mebbe exceptin bland i tell you i owe you a good turn  my horses might betray you added duane  ill hide them in a place where theres water an grass nobody goes to it come now let me help you indoors  duanes last fading sensations of that hard day were the strange feel of a bed a relief at the removal of his heavy boots and of jennies soft cool hands on his hot face  he lay ill for three weeks before he began to mend and it was another week then before he could walk out a little in the dusk of the evenings after that his strength returned rapidly and it was only at the end of this long siege that he recovered his spirits during most of his illness he had been silent moody  jennie ill be riding off soon he said one evening i cant impose on this good man andrews much longer ill never forget his kindness his wife tooshes been so good to us yes jennie you and i will have to say goodby very soon  dont hurry away she replied  lately jennie had appeared strange to him she had changed from the girl he used to see at mrs blands house he took her reluctance to say goodby as another indication of her regret that he must go back to the brakes yet somehow it made him observe her more closely she wore a plain white dress made from material mrs andrews had given her sleep and good food had improved her if she had been pretty out there in the outlaw den now she was more than that but she had the same paleness the same strained look the same dark eyes full of haunting shadows after duanes realization of the change in her he watched her more with a growing certainty that he would be sorry not to see her again  its likely we wont ever see each other again he said thats strange to think of weve been through some hard days and i seem to have known you a long time  jennie appeared shy almost sad so duane changed the subject to something less personal  andrews returned one evening from a several days trip to huntsville  duane everybodys talkie about how you cleaned up the bland outfit he said important and full of news its some exaggerated accordin to what you told me but youve shore made friends on this side of the nueces i reckon there aint a town where you wouldnt find people to welcome you huntsville you know is some divided in its ideas half the people are crooked likely enough all them who was so loud in praise of you are the crookedest for instance i met king fisher the boss outlaw of these parts well king thinks hes a decent citizen he was tellin me what a grand job yours was for the border an honest cattlemen now that bland and alloway are done for king fisher will find rustlin easier theres talk of hardin movie his camp over to blands but i dont know how true it is i reckon there aint much to it in the past when a big outlaw chief went under his band almost always broke up an scattered theres no one left who could run thet outfit  did you hear of any outlaws hunting me asked duane  nobody from blands outfit is huntin you thets shore replied andrews fisher said there never was a hoss straddled to go on your trail nobody had any use for bland anyhow his men would be afraid to trail you an you could go right in to huntsville where youd be some popular reckon youd be safe too except when some of them fool saloon loafers or bad cowpunchers would try to shoot you for the glory in it them kind of men will bob up everywhere you go duane  ill be able to ride and take care of myself in a day or two went on duane then ill goid like to talk to you about jennie  shes welcome to a home here with us  thank you andrews youre a kind man but i want jennie to get farther away from the rio grande shed never be safe here besides she may be able to find relatives she has some though she doesnt know where they are  all right duane whatever you think best i reckon now youd better take her to some town go north an strike for shelbyville or crockett thems both good towns ill tell jennie the names of men wholl help her you neednt ride into town at all  which place is nearer and how far is it  shelbyville i reckon about two days ride poor stock country so you aint liable to meet rustlers all the same better hit the trail at night an go careful  at sunset two days later duane and jennie mounted their horses and said goodby to the rancher and his wife andrews would not listen to duanes thanks  i tell you im beholden to you yet he declared  well what can i do for you asked duane i may come along here again some day  get down an come in then or youre no friend of mine i reckon there aint nothin i can think ofi just happen to remember here he led duane out of earshot of the women and went on in a whisper buck i used to be welltodo got skinned by a man named brownrodney brown he lives in huntsville an hes my enemy i never was much on fightin or id fixed him brown ruined mestole all i had hes a hoss an cattle thief an he has pull enough at home to protect him i reckon i neednt say any more  is this brown a man who shot an outlaw named stevens queried duane curiously  shore hes the same i heard thet story brown swears he plugged stevens through the middle but the outlaw rode off an nobody ever knew for shore  luke stevens died of that shot i buried him said duane  andrews made no further comment and the two men returned to the women  the main road for about three miles then where it forks take the lefthand road and keep on straight that what you said andrews  shore an good luck to you both  duane and jennie trotted away into the gathering twilight at the moment an insistent thought bothered duane both luke stevens and the rancher andrews had hinted to duane to kill a man named brown duane wished with all his heart that they had not mentioned it let alone taken for granted the execution of the deed what a bloody place texas was men who robbed and men who were robbed both wanted murder it was in the spirit of the country duane certainly meant to avoid ever meeting this rodney brown and that very determination showed duane how dangerous he really wasto men and to himself sometimes he had a feeling of how little stood between his sane and better self and a self utterly wild and terrible he reasoned that only intelligence could save himonly a thoughtful understanding of his danger and a hold upon some ideal  then he fell into low conversation with jennie holding out hopeful views of her future and presently darkness set in the sky was overcast with heavy clouds there was no air moving the heat and oppression threatened storm by and by duane could not see a rod in front of him though his horse had no difficulty in keeping to the road duane was bothered by the blackness of the night traveling fast was impossible and any moment he might miss the road that led off to the left so he was compelled to give all his attention to peering into the thick shadows ahead as good luck would have it he came to higher ground where there was less mesquite and therefore not such impenetrable darkness and at this point he came to where the road split  once headed in the right direction he felt easier in mind to his annoyance however a fine misty rain set in jennie was not well dressed for wet weather and for that matter neither was he his coat which in that dry warm climate he seldom needed was tied behind his saddle and he put it on jennie  they traveled on the rain fell steadily if anything growing thicker duane grew uncomfortably wet and chilly jennie however fared somewhat better by reason of the heavy coat the night passed quickly despite the discomfort and soon a gray dismal rainy dawn greeted the travelers  jennie insisted that he find some shelter where a fire could be built to dry his clothes he was not in a fit condition to risk catching cold in fact duanes teeth were chattering to find a shelter in that barren waste seemed a futile task quite unexpectedly however they happened upon a deserted adobe cabin situated a little off the road not only did it prove to have a dry interior but also there was firewood water was available in pools everywhere however there was no grass for the horses  a good fire and hot food and drink changed the aspect of their condition as far as comfort went and jennie lay down to sleep for duane however there must be vigilance this cabin was no hidingplace the rain fell harder all the time and the wind changed to the north its a norther all right muttered duane two or three days and he felt that his extraordinary luck had not held out still one point favored him and it was that travelers were not likely to come along during the storm jennie slept while duane watched the saving of this girl meant more to him than any task he had ever assumed first it had been partly from a human feeling to succor an unfortunate woman and partly a motive to establish clearly to himself that he was no outlaw lately however had come a different sense a strange one with something personal and warm and protective in it  as he looked down upon her a slight slender girl with bedraggled dress and disheveled hair her face pale and quiet a little stern in sleep and her long dark lashes lying on her cheek he seemed to see her fragility her prettiness her femininity as never before but for him she might at that very moment have been a broken ruined girl lying back in that cabin of the blands the fact gave him a feeling of his importance in this shifting of her destiny she was unharmed still young she would forget and be happy she would live to be a good wife and mother somehow the thought swelled his heart his act deathdealing as it had been was a noble one and helped him to hold on to his drifting hopes hardly once since jennie had entered into his thought had those ghosts returned to torment him  tomorrow she would be gone among good kind people with a possibility of finding her relatives he thanked god for that nevertheless he felt a pang  she slept more than half the day duane kept guard always alert whether he was sitting standing or walking the rain pattered steadily on the roof and sometimes came in gusty flurries through the door the horses were outside in a shed that afforded poor shelter and they stamped restlessly duane kept them saddled and bridled  about the middle of the afternoon jennie awoke they cooked a meal and afterward sat beside the little fire she had never been in his observation of her anything but a tragic figure an unhappy girl the farthest removed from serenity and poise that characteristic capacity for agitation struck him as stronger in her this day he attributed it however to the long strain the suspense nearing an end yet sometimes when her eyes were on him she did not seem to be thinking of her freedom of her future  this time tomorrow youll be in shelbyville he said  where will you be she asked quickly  me oh ill be making tracks for some lonesome place he replied  the girl shuddered  ive been brought up in texas i remember what a hard lot the men of my family had but poor as they were they had a roof over their heads a hearth with a fire a warm bedsomebody to love them and you duaneoh my god what must your life be you must ride and hide and watch eternally no decent food no pillow no friendly word no clean clothes no womans hand horses guns trails rocks holesthese must be the important things in your life you must go on riding hiding killing until you meet  she ended with a sob and dropped her head on her knees duane was amazed deeply touched  my girl thank you for that thought of me he said with a tremor in his voice you dont know how much that means to me  she raised her face and it was tearstained eloquent beautiful  ive heard tellthe best of men go to the bad out there you wont promise me you wont i neverknew any manlike you iiwe may never see each other againafter today ill never forget you ill pray for you and ill never give up trying toto do something dont despair its never too late it was my hope that kept me aliveout there at blandsbefore you came i was only a poor weak girl but if i could hopeso can you stay away from men be a lone wolf fight for your life stick out your exileand maybesome day  then she lost her voice duane clasped her hand and with feeling as deep as hers promised to remember her words in her despair for him she had spoken wisdompointed out the only course  duanes vigilance momentarily broken by emotion had no sooner reasserted itself than he discovered the bay horse the one jennie rode had broken his halter and gone off the soft wet earth had deadened the sound of his hoofs his tracks were plain in the mud there were clumps of mesquite in sight among which the horse might have strayed it turned out however that he had not done so  duane did not want to leave jennie alone in the cabin so near the road so he put her up on his horse and bade her follow the rain had ceased for the time being though evidently the storm was not yet over the tracks led up a wash to a wide flat where mesquite prickly pear and thornbush grew so thickly that jennie could not ride into it duane was thoroughly concerned he must have her horse time was flying it would soon be night he could not expect her to scramble quickly through that brake on foot therefore he decided to risk leaving her at the edge of the thicket and go in alone  as he went in a sound startled him was it the breaking of a branch he had stepped on or thrust aside he heard the impatient pound of his horses hoofs then all was quiet still he listened not wholly satisfied he was never satisfied in regard to safety he knew too well that there never could be safety for him in this country  the bay horse had threaded the aisles of the thicket duane wondered what had drawn him there certainly it had not been grass for there was none presently he heard the horse tramping along and then he ran the mud was deep and the sharp thorns made going difficult he came up with the horse and at the same moment crossed a multitude of fresh horsetracks  he bent lower to examine them and was alarmed to find that they had been made very recently even since it had ceased raining they were tracks of wellshod horses duane straightened up with a cautious glance all around his instant decision was to hurry back to jennie but he had come a goodly way through the thicket and it was impossible to rush back once or twice he imagined he heard crashings in the brush but did not halt to make sure certain he was now that some kind of danger threatened  suddenly there came an unmistakable thump of horses hoofs off somewhere to the fore then a scream rent the air it ended abruptly duane leaped forward tore his way through the thorny brake he heard jennie cry againan appealing call quickly hushed it seemed more to his right and he plunged that way he burst into a glade where a smoldering fire and ground covered with footprints and tracks showed that campers had lately been rushing across this he broke his passage out to the open but he was too late his horse had disappeared jennie was gone there were no riders in sight there was no sound there was a heavy trail of horses going north jennie had been carried offprobably by outlaws duane realized that pursuit was out of the questionthat jennie was lost    chapter x  a hundred miles from the haunts most familiar with duanes deeds far up where the nueces ran a trickling clear stream between yellow cliffs stood a small deserted shack of covered mesquite poles it had been made long ago but was well preserved a door faced the overgrown trail and another faced down into a gorge of dense thickets on the border fugitives from law and men who hid in fear of some one they had wronged never lived in houses with only one door  it was a wild spot lonely not fit for human habitation except for the outcast he perhaps might have found it hard to leave for most of the other wild nooks in that barren country down in the gorge there was neverfailing sweet water grass all the year round cool shady retreats deer rabbits turkeys fruit and miles and miles of narrowtwisting deep canon full of broken rocks and impenetrable thickets the scream of the panther was heard there the squall of the wildcat the cough of the jaguar innumerable bees buzzed in the spring blossoms and it seemed scattered honey to the winds all day there was continuous song of birds that of the mockingbird loud and sweet and mocking above the rest  on clear daysand rare indeed were cloudy dayswith the subsiding of the wind at sunset a hush seemed to fall around the little hut fardistant dimblue mountains stood goldrimmed gradually to fade with the shading of light  at this quiet hour a man climbed up out of the gorge and sat in the westward door of the hut this lonely watcher of the west and listener to the silence was duane and this hut was the one where three years before jennie had nursed him back to life  the killing of a man named sellers and the combination of circumstances that had made the tragedy a memorable regret had marked if not a change at least a cessation in duanes activities he had trailed sellers to kill him for the supposed abducting of jennie he had trailed him long after he had learned sellers traveled alone duane wanted absolute assurance of jennies death vague rumors a few words here and there unauthenticated stories were all duane had gathered in years to substantiate his beliefthat jennie died shortly after the beginning of her second captivity but duane did not know surely sellers might have told him duane expected if not to force it from him at the end to read it in his eyes but the bullet went too unerringly it locked his lips and fixed his eyes  after that meeting duane lay long at the ranchhouse of a friend and when he recovered from the wound sellers had given him he started with two horses and a pack for the lonely gorge on the nueces there he had been hidden for months a prey to remorse a dreamer a victim of phantoms  it took work for him to find subsistence in that rocky fastness and work action helped to pass the hours but he could not work all the time even if he had found it to do then in his idle moments and at night his task was to live with the hell in his mind  the sunset and the twilight hour made all the rest bearable the little hut on the rim of the gorge seemed to hold jennies presence it was not as if he felt her spirit if it had been he would have been sure of her death he hoped jennie had not survived her second misfortune and that intense hope had burned into belief if not surety upon his return to that locality on the occasion of his first visit to the hut he had found things just as they had left them and a poor faded piece of ribbon jennie had used to tie around her bright hair no wandering outlaw or traveler had happened upon the lonely spot which further endeared it to duane  a strange feature of this memory of jennie was the freshness of itthe failure of years toil strife deathdealing to dim itto deaden the thought of what might have been he had a marvelous gift of visualization he could shut his eyes and see jennie before him just as clearly as if she had stood there in the flesh for hours he did that dreaming dreaming of life he had never tasted and now never would taste he saw jennies slender graceful figure the old brown ragged dress in which he had seen her first at blands her little feet in mexican sandals her fine hands coarsened by work her round arms and swelling throat and her pale sad beautiful face with its staring dark eyes he remembered every look she had given him every word she had spoken to him every time she had touched him he thought of her beauty and sweetness of the few things which had come to mean to him that she must have loved him and he trained himself to think of these in preference to her life at blands the escape with him and then her recapture because such memories led to bitter fruitless pain he had to fight suffering because it was eating out his heart  sitting there eyes wide open he dreamed of the old homestead and his whitehaired mother he saw the old home life sweetened and filled by dear new faces and added joys go on before his eyes with him a part of it  then in the inevitable reaction in the reflux of bitter reality he would send out a voiceless cry no less poignant because it was silent poor fool no i shall never see mother againnever go homenever have a home i am duane the lone wolf oh god i wish it were over these dreams torture me what have i to do with a mother a home a wife no brighthaired boy no darkeyed girl will ever love me i am an outlaw an outcast dead to the good and decent world i am alonealone better be a callous brute or better dead i shall go mad thinking man what is left to you a hidingplace like a wolfslonely silent days lonely nights with phantoms or the trail and the road with their bloody tracks and then the hard ride the sleepless hungry ride to some hole in rocks or brakes what hellish thing drives me why cant i end it all what is left only that damned unquenchable spirit of the gunfighter to liveto hang on to miserable lifeto have no fear of death yet to cling like a leachto die as gunfighters seldom die with boots off bain you were first and youre long avenged id change with you and sellers you were last and youre avenged and you othersyoure avenged lie quiet in your graves and give me peace  but they did not lie quiet in their graves and give him peace  a group of specters trooped out of the shadows of dusk and gathering round him escorted him to his bed  when duane had been riding the trails passionbent to escape pursuers or passionbent in his search the constant action and toil and exhaustion made him sleep but when in hiding as time passed gradually he required less rest and sleep and his mind became more active little by little his phantoms gained hold on him and at length but for the saving power of his dreams they would have claimed him utterly  how many times he had said to himself i am an intelligent man im not crazy im in full possession of my faculties all this is fancyimaginationconscience ive no work no duty no ideal no hopeand my mind is obsessed thronged with images and these images naturally are of the men with whom i have dealt i cant forget them they come back to me hour after hour and when my tortured mind grows weak then maybe im not just right till the mood wears out and lets me sleep  so he reasoned as he lay down in his comfortable camp the night was starbright above the canonwalls darkly shadowing down between them the insects hummed and chirped and thrummed a continuous thick song low and monotonous slowrunning water splashed softly over stones in the streambed from far down the canon came the mournful hoot of an owl the moment he lay down thereby giving up action for the day all these things weighed upon him like a great heavy mantle of loneliness in truth they did not constitute loneliness  and he could no more have dispelled thought than he could have reached out to touch a cold bright star  he wondered how many outcasts like him lay under this starstudded velvety sky across the fifteen hundred miles of wild country between el paso and the mouth of the river a vast wild territorya refuge for outlaws somewhere he had heard or read that the texas rangers kept a book with names and records of outlawsthree thousand known outlaws yet these could scarcely be half of that unfortunate horde which had been recruited from all over the states duane had traveled from camp to camp den to den hidingplace to hidingplace and he knew these men most of them were hopeless criminals some were avengers a few were wronged wanderers and among them occasionally was a man human in his way honest as he could be not yet lost to good  but all of them were akin in one sensetheir outlawry and that starry night they lay with their dark faces up some in packs like wolves others alone like the gray wolf who knew no mate it did not make much difference in duanes thought of them that the majority were steeped in crime and brutality more often than not stupid from rum incapable of a fine feeling just lost wild dogs  duane doubted that there was a man among them who did not realize his moral wreck and ruin he had met poor half witted wretches who knew it he believed he could enter into their minds and feel the truth of all their livesthe hardened outlaw coarse ignorant bestial who murdered as bill black had murdered who stole for the sake of stealing who craved money to gamble and drink defiantly ready for death and like that terrible outlaw helm who cried out on the scaffold let her rip  the wild youngsters seeking notoriety and reckless adventure the cowboys with a notch on their guns with boastful pride in the knowledge that they were marked by rangers the crooked men from the north defaulters forgers murderers all palefaced flatchested men not fit for that wilderness and not surviving the dishonest cattlemen hand and glove with outlaws driven from their homes the old grizzled bowlegged genuine rustlersall these duane had come in contact with had watched and known and as he felt with them he seemed to see that as their lives were bad sooner or later to end dismally or tragically so they must pay some kind of earthly penaltyif not of conscience then of fear if not of fear then of that most terrible of all things to restless active menpain the pang of flesh and bone  duane knew for he had seen them pay best of all moreover he knew the internal life of the gunfighter of that select but by no means small class of which he was representative the world that judged him and his kind judged him as a machine a killingmachine with only mind enough to hunt to meet to slay another man it had taken three endless years for duane to understand his own father duane knew beyond all doubt that the gunfighters like bland like alloway like sellers men who were evil and had no remorse no spiritual accusing nemesis had something far more torturing to mind more haunting more murderous of rest and sleep and peace and that something was abnormal fear of death duane knew this for he had shot these men he had seen the quick dark shadow in eyes the presentiment that the will could not control and then the horrible certainty these men must have been in agony at every meeting with a possible or certain foemore agony than the hot rend of a bullet they were haunted too haunted by this fear by every victim calling from the grave that nothing was so inevitable as death which lurked behind every corner hid in every shadow lay deep in the dark tube of every gun these men could not have a friend they could not love or trust a woman they knew their one chance of holding on to life lay in their own distrust watchfulness dexterity and that hope by the very nature of their lives could not be lasting they had doomed themselves what then could possibly have dwelt in the depths of their minds as they went to their beds on a starry night like this with mystery in silence and shadow with time passing surely and the dark future and its secret approaching every hourwhat then but hell  the hell in duanes mind was not fear of man or fear of death he would have been glad to lay down the burden of life providing death came naturally many times he had prayed for it but that overdeveloped superhuman spirit of defense in him precluded suicide or the inviting of an enemys bullet sometimes he had a vague scarcely analyzed idea that this spirit was what had made the southwest habitable for the white man  every one of his victims singly and collectively returned to him for ever it seemed in cold passionless accusing domination of these haunted hours they did not accuse him of dishonor or cowardice or brutality or murder they only accused him of death it was as if they knew more than when they were alive had learned that life was a divine mysterious gift not to be taken they thronged about him with their voiceless clamoring drifted around him with their fading eyes    chapter xi  after nearly six months in the nueces gorge the loneliness and inaction of his life drove duane out upon the trails seeking anything rather than to hide longer alone a prey to the scourge of his thoughts the moment he rode into sight of men a remarkable transformation occurred in him a strange warmth stirred in hima longing to see the faces of people to hear their voicesa pleasurable emotion sad and strange but it was only a precursor of his old bitter sleepless and eternal vigilance when he hid alone in the brakes he was safe from all except his deeper better self when he escaped from this into the haunts of men his force and will went to the preservation of his life  mercer was the first village he rode into he had many friends there mercer claimed to owe duane a debt on the outskirts of the village there was a grave overgrown by brush so that the rudelettered post which marked it was scarcely visible to duane as he rode by he had never read the inscription but he thought now of hardin no other than the erstwhile ally of bland for many years hardin had harassed the stockmen and ranchers in and around mercer on an evil day for him he or his outlaws had beaten and robbed a man who once succored duane when sore in need duane met hardin in the little plaza of the village called him every name known to border men taunted him to draw and killed him in the act  duane went to the house of one jones a texan who had known his father and there he was warmly received the feel of an honest hand the voice of a friend the prattle of children who were not afraid of him or his gun good wholesome food and change of clothesthese things for the time being made a changed man of duane to be sure he did not often speak the price of his head and the weight of his burden made him silent but eagerly he drank in all the news that was told him in the years of his absence from home he had never heard a word about his mother or uncle those who were his real friends on the border would have been the last to make inquiries to write or receive letters that might give a clue to duanes whereabouts  duane remained all day with this hospitable jones and as twilight fell was loath to go and yielded to a pressing invitation to remain overnight it was seldom indeed that duane slept under a roof early in the evening while duane sat on the porch with two awed and heroworshiping sons of the house jones returned from a quick visit down to the postoffice summarily he sent the boys off he labored under intense excitement  duane theres rangers in town he whispered its all over town too that youre here you rode in long after sunup lots of people saw you i dont believe theres a man or boy that d squeal on you but the women might they gossip and these rangers are handsome fellowsdevils with the women  what company of rangers asked duane quickly  company a under captain macnelly that new ranger he made a big name in the war and since hes been in the ranger service hes done wonders hes cleaned up some bad places south and hes working north  macnelly ive heard of him describe him to me  slightbuilt chap but wiry and tough clean face black mustache and hair sharp black eyes hes got a look of authority macnellys a fine man duane belongs to a good southern family id hate to have him look you up  duane did not speak  macnellys got nerve and his rangers are all experienced men if they find out youre here theyll come after you macnellys no gunfighter but he wouldnt hesitate to do his duty even if he faced sure death which he would in this case duane you mustnt meet captain macnelly your record is clean if it is terrible you never met a ranger or any officer except a rotten sheriff now and then like rod brown  still duane kept silence he was not thinking of danger but of the fact of how fleeting must be his stay among friends  ive already fixed up a pack of grub went on jones ill slip out to saddle your horse you watch here  he had scarcely uttered the last word when soft swift footsteps sounded on the hard path a man turned in at the gate the light was dim yet clean enough to disclose an unusually tall figure when it appeared nearer he was seen to be walking with both arms raised hands high he slowed his stride  does burt jones live here he asked in a low hurried voice  i reckon im burt what can i do for you replied jones  the stranger peered around stealthily came closer still with his hands up  it is known that buck duane is here captain macnellys camping on the river just out of town he sends word to duane to come out there after dark  the stranger wheeled and departed as swiftly and strangely as he had come  bust me duane whatever do you make of that exclaimed jones  a new one on me replied duane thoughtfully  first fool thing i ever heard of macnelly doing cant make head nor tails of it id have said offhand that macnelly wouldnt doublecross anybody he struck me as a square man sand all through but hell he must mean treachery i cant see anything else in that deal  maybe the captain wants to give me a fair chance to surrender without bloodshed observed duane pretty decent of him if he meant that  he invites you out to his camp after dark something strange about this duane but macnellys a new man out here he does some queer things perhaps hes getting a swelled head well whatever his intentions his presence around mercer is enough for us duane you hit the road and put some miles between you the amiable captain before daylight tomorrow ill go out there and ask him what in the devil he meant  that messenger he senthe was a ranger said duane  sure he was and a nervy one it must have taken sand to come bracing you that way duane the fellow didnt pack a gun ill swear to that pretty odd this trick but you cant trust it hit the road duane  a little later a black horse with muffled hoofs bearing a tall dark rider who peered keenly into every shadow trotted down a pasture lane back of joness house turned into the road and then breaking into swifter gait rapidly left mercer behind  fifteen or twenty miles out duane drew rein in a forest of mesquite dismounted and searched about for a glade with a little grass here he staked his horse on a long lariat and using his saddle for a pillow his saddleblanket for covering he went to sleep  next morning he was off again working south during the next few days he paid brief visits to several villages that lay in his path and in each some one particular friend had a piece of news to impart that made duane profoundly thoughtful a ranger had made a quiet unobtrusive call upon these friends and left this message tell buck duane to ride into captain macnellys camp some time after night  duane concluded and his friends all agreed with him that the new rangers main purpose in the nueces country was to capture or kill buck duane and that this message was simply an original and striking ruse the daring of which might appeal to certain outlaws  but it did not appeal to duane his curiosity was aroused it did not however tempt him to any foolhardy act he turned southwest and rode a hundred miles until he again reached the sparsely settled country here he heard no more of rangers it was a barren region he had never but once ridden through and that ride had cost him dear he had been compelled to shoot his way out outlaws were not in accord with the few ranchers and their cowboys who ranged there he learned that both outlaws and mexican raiders had long been at bitter enmity with these ranchers being unfamiliar with roads and trails duane had pushed on into the heart of this district when all the time he really believed he was traveling around it a rifleshot from a ranchhouse a deliberate attempt to kill him because he was an unknown rider in those parts discovered to duane his mistake and a hard ride to get away persuaded him to return to his old methods of hiding by day and traveling by night  he got into rough country rode for three days without covering much ground but believed that he was getting on safer territory twice he came to a wide bottomland green with willow and cottonwood and thick as chaparral somewhere through the middle of which ran a river he decided must be the lower nueces  one evening as he stole out from a covert where he had camped he saw the lights of a village he tried to pass it on the left but was unable to because the brakes of this bottomland extended in almost to the outskirts of the village and he had to retrace his steps and go round to the right wire fences and horses in pasture made this a task so it was well after midnight before he accomplished it he made ten miles or more then by daylight and after that proceeded cautiously along a road which appeared to be well worn from travel he passed several thickets where he would have halted to hide during the day but for the fact that he had to find water  he was a long while in coming to it and then there was no thicket or clump of mesquite near the waterhole that would afford him covert so he kept on  the country before him was ridgy and began to show cottonwoods here and there in the hollows and yucca and mesquite on the higher ground as he mounted a ridge he noted that the road made a sharp turn and he could not see what was beyond it he slowed up and was making the turn which was downhill between high banks of yellow clay when his mettlesome horse heard something to frighten him or shied at something and bolted  the few bounds he took before duanes iron arm checked him were enough to reach the curve one flashing glance showed duane the open once more a little valley below with a wide shallow rocky stream a clump of cottonwoods beyond a somber group of men facing him and two dark limp strangely grotesque figures hanging from branches  the sight was common enough in southwest texas but duane had never before found himself so unpleasantly close  a hoarse voice pealed out by hell theres another one  stranger ride down an account fer yourself yelled another  hands up  thets right jack dont take no chances plug him  these remarks were so swiftly uttered as almost to be continuous duane was wheeling his horse when a rifle cracked the bullet struck his left forearm and he thought broke it for he dropped the rein the frightened horse leaped another bullet whistled past duane then the bend in the road saved him probably from certain death like the wind his fleet steed wend down the long hill  duane was in no hurry to look back he knew what to expect his chief concern of the moment was for his injured arm he found that the bones were still intact but the wound having been made by a soft bullet was an exceedingly bad one blood poured from it giving the horse his head duane wound his scarf tightly round the holes and with teeth and hand tied it tightly that done he looked back over his shoulder  riders were making the dust fly on the hillside road there were more coming round the cut where the road curved the leader was perhaps a quarter of a mile back and the others strung out behind him duane needed only one glance to tell him that they were fast and hardriding cowboys in a land where all riders were good they would not have owned any but strong swift horses moreover it was a district where ranchers had suffered beyond all endurance the greed and brutality of outlaws duane had simply been so unfortunate as to run right into a lynching party at a time of all times when any stranger would be in danger and any outlaw put to his limit to escape with his life  duane did not look back again till he had crossed the ridgy piece of ground and had gotten to the level road he had gained upon his pursuers when he ascertained this he tried to save his horse to check a little that killing gait this horse was a magnificent animal big strong fast but his endurance had never been put to a grueling test and that worried duane his life had made it impossible to keep one horse very long at a time and this one was an unknown quantity  duane had only one planthe only plan possible in this caseand that was to make the riverbottoms where he might elude his pursuers in the willow brakes fifteen miles or so would bring him to the river and this was not a hopeless distance for any good horse if not too closely pressed duane concluded presently that the cowboys behind were losing a little in the chase because they were not extending their horses it was decidedly unusual for such riders to save their mounts duane pondered over this looking backward several times to see if their horses were stretched out they were not and the fact was disturbing only one reason presented itself to duanes conjecturing and it was that with him headed straight on that road his pursuers were satisfied not to force the running he began to hope and look for a trail or a road turning off to right or left there was none a rough mesquitedotted and yuccaspired country extended away on either side duane believed that he would be compelled to take to this hard going one thing was certainhe had to go round the village the river however was on the outskirts of the village and once in the willows he would be safe  dustclouds far ahead caused his alarm to grow he watched with his eyes strained he hoped to see a wagon a few stray cattle but no he soon descried several horsemen shots and yells behind him attested to the fact that his pursuers likewise had seen these newcomers on the scene more than a mile separated these two parties yet that distance did not keep them from soon understanding each other duane waited only to see this new factor show signs of sudden quick action and then with a muttered curse he spurred his horse off the road into the brush  he chose the right side because the river lay nearer that way there were patches of open sandy ground between clumps of cactus and mesquite and he found that despite a zigzag course he made better time it was impossible for him to locate his pursuers they would come together he decided and take to his tracks  what then was his surprise and dismay to run out of a thicket right into a low ridge of rough broken rock impossible to get a horse over he wheeled to the left along its base the sandy ground gave place to a harder soil where his horse did not labor so here the growths of mesquite and cactus became scanter affording better travel but poor cover he kept sharp eyes ahead and as he had expected soon saw moving dustclouds and the dark figures of horses they were half a mile away and swinging obliquely across the flat which fact proved that they had entertained a fair idea of the country and the fugitives difficulty  without an instants hesitation duane put his horse to his best efforts straight ahead he had to pass those men when this was seemingly made impossible by a deep wash from which he had to turn duane began to feel cold and sick was this the end always there had to be an end to an outlaws career he wanted then to ride straight at these pursuers but reason outweighed instinct he was fleeing for his life nevertheless the strongest instinct at the time was his desire to fight  he knew when these three horsemen saw him and a moment afterward he lost sight of them as he got into the mesquite again he meant now to try to reach the road and pushed his mount severely though still saving him for a final burst rocks thickets bunches of cactus washesall operated against his following a straight line almost he lost his bearings and finally would have ridden toward his enemies had not good fortune favored him in the matter of an open burnedover stretch of ground  here he saw both groups of pursuers one on each side and almost within gunshot their sharp yells as much as his cruel spurs drove his horse into that pace which now meant life or death for him and never had duane bestrode a gamer swifter stancher beast he seemed about to accomplish the impossible in the dragging sand he was far superior to any horse in pursuit and on this sandy open stretch he gained enough to spare a little in the brush beyond heated now and thoroughly terrorized he kept the pace through thickets that almost tore duane from his saddle something weighty and grim eased off duane he was going to get out in front the horse had speed fire stamina  duane dashed out into another open place dotted by few trees and here right in his path within pistolrange stood horsemen waiting they yelled they spurred toward him but did not fire at him he turned his horsefaced to the right only one thing kept him from standing his ground to fight it out he remembered those dangling limp figures hanging from the cottonwoods these ranchers would rather hang an outlaw than do anything they might draw all his fire and then capture him his horror of hanging was so great as to be all out of proportion compared to his gunfighters instinct of selfpreservation  a race began then a dusty crashing drive through gray mesquite duane could scarcely see he was so blinded by stinging branches across his eyes the hollow wind roared in his ears he lost his sense of the nearness of his pursuers but they must have been close did they shoot at him he imagined he heard shots but that might have been the cracking of dead snags his left arm hung limp almost useless he handled the rein with his right and most of the time he hung low over the pommel the gray walls flashing by him the whip of twigs the rush of wind the heavy rapid pound of hoofs the violent motion of his horsethese vied in sensation with the smart of sweat in his eyes the rack of his wound the cold sick cramp in his stomach with these also was dull raging fury he had to run when he wanted to fight it took all his mind to force back that bitter hate of himself of his pursuers of this race for his useless life  suddenly he burst out of a line of mesquite into the road a long stretch of lonely road how fiercely with hot strange joy he wheeled his horse upon it then he was sweeping along sure now that he was out in front his horse still had strength and speed but showed signs of breaking presently duane looked back pursuershe could not count how manywere loping along in his rear he paid no more attention to them and with teeth set he faced ahead grimmer now in his determination to foil them  he passed a few scattered ranchhouses where horses whistled from corrals and men curiously watched him fly past he saw one rancher running and he felt intuitively that this fellow was going to join in the chase duanes steed pounded on not noticeably slower but with a lack of former smoothness with a strained convulsive jerking stride which showed he was almost done  sight of the village ahead surprised duane he had reached it sooner than he expected then he made a discoveryhe had entered the zone of wire fences as he dared not turn back now he kept on intending to ride through the village looking backward he saw that his pursuers were half a mile distant too far to alarm any villagers in time to intercept him in his flight as he rode by the first houses his horse broke and began to labor duane did not believe he would last long enough to go through the village  saddled horses in front of a store gave duane an idea not by any means new and one he had carried out successfully before as he pulled in his heaving mount and leaped off a couple of ranchers came out of the place and one of them stepped to a cleanlimbed fiery bay he was about to get into his saddle when he saw duane and then he halted a foot in the stirrup  duane strode forward grasped the bridle of this mans horse  mines donebut not killed he panted trade with me  wal stranger im shore always ready to trade drawled the man but aint you a little swift  duane glanced back up the road his pursuers were entering the village  im duanebuck duane he cried menacingly will you trade hurry  the rancher turning white dropped his foot from the stirrup and fell back  i reckon ill trade he said  bounding up duane dug spurs into the bays flanks the horse snorted in fright plunged into a run he was fresh swift half wild duane flashed by the remaining houses on the street out into the open but the road ended at that village or else led out from some other quarter for he had ridden straight into the fields and from them into rough desert when he reached the cover of mesquite once more he looked back to find six horsemen within rifleshot of him and more coming behind them  his new horse had not had time to get warm before duane reached a high sandy bluff below which lay the willow brakes as far as he could see extended an immense flat strip of redtinged willow how welcome it was to his eye he felt like a hunted wolf that weary and lame had reached his hole in the rocks zigzagging down the soft slope he put the bay to the dense wall of leaf and branch but the horse balked  there was little time to lose dismounting he dragged the stubborn beast into the thicket this was harder and slower work than duane cared to risk if he had not been rushed he might have had better success so he had to abandon the horsea circumstance that only such sore straits could have driven him to then he went slipping swiftly through the narrow aisles  he had not gotten under cover any too soon for he heard his pursuers piling over the bluff loudvoiced confident brutal they crashed into the willows  hi sid heahs your hoss called one evidently to the man duane had forced into a trade  say if you locoed gentsll hold up a little ill tell you somethin replied a voice from the bluff  come on sid we got him corralled said the first speaker  wal mebbe an if you hev its liable to be damn hot thet feller was buck duane  absolute silence followed that statement presently it was broken by a rattling of loose gravel and then low voices  he cant git across the river i tell you came to duanes ears hes corralled in the brake i know thet hole  then duane gliding silently and swiftly through the willows heard no more from his pursuers he headed straight for the river threading a passage through a willow brake was an old task for him many days and nights had gone to the acquiring of a skill that might have been envied by an indian  the rio grande and its tributaries for the most of their length in texas ran between wide low flat lands covered by a dense growth of willow cottonwood mesquite prickly pear and other growths mingled with the willow and altogether they made a matted tangled copse a thicket that an inexperienced man would have considered impenetrable from above these wild brakes looked green and red from the inside they were gray and yellowa striped wall trails and glades were scarce there were a few deerrunways and sometimes little paths made by peccariesthe jabali or wild pigs of mexico the ground was clay and unusually dry sometimes baked so hard that it left no imprint of a track where a growth of cottonwood had held back the encroachment of the willows there usually was thick grass and underbrush the willows were short slender poles with stems so close together that they almost touched and with the leafy foliage forming a thick covering the depths of this brake duane had penetrated was a silent dreamy strange place in the middle of the day the light was weird and dim when a breeze fluttered the foliage then slender shafts and spears of sunshine pierced the green mantle and danced like gold on the ground  duane had always felt the strangeness of this kind of place and likewise he had felt a protecting harboring something which always seemed to him to be the sympathy of the brake for a hunted creature any unwounded creature strong and resourceful was safe when he had glided under the low rustling green roof of this wild covert it was not hard to conceal tracks the springy soil gave forth no sound and men could hunt each other for weeks pass within a few yards of each other and never know it the problem of sustaining life was difficult but then hunted men and animals survived on very little  duane wanted to cross the river if that was possible and keeping in the brake work his way upstream till he had reached country more hospitable remembering what the man had said in regard to the river duane had his doubts about crossing but he would take any chance to put the river between him and his hunters he pushed on his left arm had to be favored as he could scarcely move it using his right to spread the willows he slipped sideways between them and made fast time there were narrow aisles and washes and holes low down and paths brushed by animals all of which he took advantage of running walking crawling stooping any way to get along to keep in a straight line was not easyhe did it by marking some bright sunlit stem or tree ahead and when he reached it looked straight on to mark another his progress necessarily grew slower for as he advanced the brake became wilder denser darker mosquitoes began to whine about his head he kept on without pause deepening shadows under the willows told him that the afternoon was far advanced he began to fear he had wandered in a wrong direction finally a strip of light ahead relieved his anxiety and after a toilsome penetration of still denser brush he broke through to the bank of the river  he faced a wide shallow muddy stream with brakes on the opposite bank extending like a green and yellow wall duane perceived at a glance the futility of his trying to cross at this point everywhere the sluggish water raved quicksand bars in fact the bed of the river was all quicksand and very likely there was not a foot of water anywhere he could not swim he could not crawl he could not push a log across any solid thing touching that smooth yellow sand would be grasped and sucked down to prove this he seized a long pole and reaching down from the high bank thrust it into the stream right there near shore there apparently was no bottom to the treacherous quicksand he abandoned any hope of crossing the river probably for miles up and down it would be just the same as here before leaving the bank he tied his hat upon the pole and lifted enough water to quench his thirst then he worked his way back to where thinner growth made advancement easier and kept on upstream till the shadows were so deep he could not see feeling around for a place big enough to stretch out on he lay down for the time being he was as safe there as he would have been beyond in the rim rock he was tired though not exhausted and in spite of the throbbing pain in his arm he dropped at once into sleep    chapter xii  some time during the night duane awoke a stillness seemingly so thick and heavy as to have substance blanketed the black willow brake he could not see a star or a branch or treetrunk or even his hand before his eyes he lay there waiting listening sure that he had been awakened by an unusual sound ordinary noises of the night in the wilderness never disturbed his rest his faculties like those of old fugitives and hunted creatures had become trained to a marvelous keenness a long low breath of slow wind moaned through the willows passed away some stealthy softfooted beast trotted by him in the darkness there was a rustling among dry leaves a fox barked lonesomely in the distance but none of these sounds had broken his slumber  suddenly piercing the stillness came a bay of a bloodhound quickly duane sat up chilled to his marrow the action made him aware of his crippled arm then came other bays lower more distant silence enfolded him again all the more oppressive and menacing in his suspense bloodhounds had been put on his trail and the leader was not far away all his life duane had been familiar with bloodhounds and he knew that if the pack surrounded him in this impenetrable darkness he would be held at bay or dragged down as wolves dragged a stag rising to his feet prepared to flee as best he could he waited to be sure of the direction he should take  the leader of the hounds broke into cry again a deep fulltoned ringing bay strange ominous terribly significant in its power it caused a cold sweat to ooze out all over duanes body he turned from it and with his uninjured arm outstretched to feel for the willows he groped his way along as it was impossible to pick out the narrow passages he had to slip and squeeze and plunge between the yielding stems he made such a crashing that he no longer heard the baying of the hounds he had no hope to elude them he meant to climb the first cottonwood that he stumbled upon in his blind flight but it appeared he never was going to be lucky enough to run against one often he fell sometimes flat at others upheld by the willows what made the work so hard was the fact that he had only one arm to open a clump of closegrowing stems and his feet would catch or tangle in the narrow crotches holding him fast he had to struggle desperately it was as if the willows were clutching hands his enemies fiendishly impeding his progress he tore his clothes on sharp branches and his flesh suffered many a prick but in a terrible earnestness he kept on until he brought up hard against a cottonwood tree  there he leaned and rested he found himself as nearly exhausted as he had ever been wet with sweat his hands torn and burning his breast laboring his legs stinging from innumerable bruises while he leaned there to catch his breath he listened for the pursuing hounds for a long time there was no sound from them this however did not deceive him into any hopefulness there were bloodhounds that bayed often on a trail and others that ran mostly silent the former were more valuable to their owner and the latter more dangerous to the fugitive presently duanes ears were filled by a chorus of short ringing yelps the pack had found where he had slept and now the trail was hot satisfied that they would soon overtake him duane set about climbing the cottonwood which in his condition was difficult of ascent  it happened to be a fairly large tree with a fork about fifteen feet up and branches thereafter in succession duane climbed until he got above the enshrouding belt of blackness a pale gray mist hung above the brake and through it shone a line of dim lights duane decided these were bonfires made along the bluff to render his escape more difficult on that side away round in the direction he thought was north he imagined he saw more fires but as the mist was thick he could not be sure while he sat there pondering the matter listening for the hounds the mist and the gloom on one side lightened and this side he concluded was east and meant that dawn was near satisfying himself on this score he descended to the first branch of the tree  his situation now though still critical did not appear to be so hopeless as it had been the hounds would soon close in on him and he would kill them or drive them away it was beyond the bounds of possibility that any men could have followed running hounds through that brake in the night the thing that worried duane was the fact of the bonfires he had gathered from the words of one of his pursuers that the brake was a kind of trap and he began to believe there was only one way out of it and that was along the bank where he had entered and where obviously all night long his pursuers had kept fires burning further conjecture on this point however was interrupted by a crashing in the willows and the rapid patter of feet  underneath duane lay a gray foggy obscurity he could not see the ground nor any object but the black trunk of the tree sight would not be needed to tell him when the pack arrived with a pattering rush through the willows the hounds reached the tree and then high above crash of brush and thud of heavy paws rose a hideous clamor duanes pursuers far off to the south would hear that and know what it meant and at daybreak perhaps before they would take a short cut across the brake guided by the baying of hounds that had treed their quarry  it wanted only a few moments however till duane could distinguish the vague forms of the hounds in the gray shadow below still he waited he had no shots to spare and he knew how to treat bloodhounds gradually the obscurity lightened and at length duane had good enough sight of the hounds for his purpose his first shot killed the huge brute leader of the pack then with unerring shots he crippled several others that stopped the baying piercing howls arose the pack took fright and fled its course easily marked by the howls of the crippled members duane reloaded his gun and making certain all the hounds had gone he descended to the ground and set off at a rapid pace to the northward  the mist had dissolved under a rising sun when duane made his first halt some miles north of the scene where he had waited for the hounds a barrier to further progress in shape of a precipitous rocky bluff rose sheer from the willow brake he skirted the base of the cliff where walking was comparatively easy around in the direction of the river he reached the end finally to see there was absolutely no chance to escape from the brake at that corner it took extreme labor attended by some hazard and considerable pain to his arm to get down where he could fill his sombrero with water after quenching his thirst he had a look at his wound it was caked over with blood and dirt when washed off the arm was seen to be inflamed and swollen around the bullethole he bathed it experiencing a soothing relief in the cool water then he bandaged it as best he could and arranged a sling round his neck this mitigated the pain of the injured member and held it in a quiet and restful position where it had a chance to begin mending  as duane turned away from the river he felt refreshed his great strength and endurance had always made fatigue something almost unknown to him however tramping on foot day and night was as unusual to him as to any other riders of the southwest and it had begun to tell on him retracing his steps he reached the point where he had abruptly come upon the bluff and here he determined to follow along its base in the other direction until he found a way out or discovered the futility of such effort  duane covered ground rapidly from time to time he paused to listen but he was always listening and his eyes were ever roving this alertness had become second nature with him so that except in extreme cases of caution he performed it while he pondered his gloomy and fateful situation such habit of alertness and thought made time fly swiftly  by noon he had rounded the wide curve of the brake and was facing south the bluff had petered out from a high mountainous wall to a low abutment of rock but it still held to its steep rough nature and afforded no crack or slope where quick ascent could have been possible he pushed on growing warier as he approached the dangerzone finding that as he neared the river on this side it was imperative to go deeper into the willows in the afternoon he reached a point where he could see men pacing to and fro on the bluff this assured him that whatever place was guarded was one by which he might escape he headed toward these men and approached to within a hundred paces of the bluff where they were there were several men and several boys all armed and after the manner of texans taking their task leisurely farther down duane made out black dots on the horizon of the bluffline and these he concluded were more guards stationed at another outlet probably all the available men in the district were on duty texans took a grim pleasure in such work duane remembered that upon several occasions he had served such duty himself  duane peered through the branches and studied the lay of the land for several hundred yards the bluff could be climbed he took stock of those careless guards they had rifles and that made vain any attempt to pass them in daylight he believed an attempt by night might be successful and he was swiftly coming to a determination to hide there till dark and then try it when the sudden yelping of a dog betrayed him to the guards on the bluff  the dog had likely been placed there to give an alarm and he was lustily true to his trust duane saw the men run together and begin to talk excitedly and peer into the brake which was a signal for him to slip away under the willows he made no noise and he assured himself he must be invisible nevertheless he heard shouts then the cracking of rifles and bullets began to zip and swish through the leafy covert the day was hot and windless and duane concluded that whenever he touched a willow stem even ever so slightly it vibrated to the top and sent a quiver among the leaves through this the guards had located his position once a bullet hissed by him another thudded into the ground before him this shooting loosed a rage in duane he had to fly from these men and he hated them and himself because of it always in the fury of such moments he wanted to give back shot for shot but he slipped on through the willows and at length the rifles ceased to crack  he sheered to the left again in line with the rocky barrier and kept on wondering what the next mile would bring  it brought worse for he was seen by sharpeyed scouts and a hot fusillade drove him to run for his life luckily to escape with no more than a bulletcreased shoulder  later that day still undaunted he sheered again toward the trapwall and found that the nearer he approached to the place where he had come down into the brake the greater his danger to attempt to run the blockade of that trail by day would be fatal he waited for night and after the brightness of the fires had somewhat lessened he assayed to creep out of the brake he succeeded in reaching the foot of the bluff here only a bank and had begun to crawl stealthily up under cover of a shadow when a hound again betrayed his position retreating to the willows was as perilous a task as had ever confronted duane and when he had accomplished it right under what seemed a hundred blazing rifles he felt that he had indeed been favored by providence this time men followed him a goodly ways into the brake and the ripping of lead through the willows sounded on all sides of him  when the noise of pursuit ceased duane sat down in the darkness his mind clamped between two thingswhether to try again to escape or wait for possible opportunity he seemed incapable of decision his intelligence told him that every hour lessened his chances for escape he had little enough chance in any case and that was what made another attempt so desperately hard still it was not love of life that bound him there would come an hour sooner or later when he would wrench decision out of this chaos of emotion and thought but that time was not yet he had remained quiet long enough to cool off and recover from his run he found that he was tired he stretched out to rest but the swarms of vicious mosquitoes prevented sleep this corner of the brake was low and near the river a breedingground for the bloodsuckers they sang and hummed and whined around him in an everincreasing horde he covered his head and hands with his coat and lay there patiently that was a long and wretched night morning found him still strong physically but in a dreadful state of mind  first he hurried for the river he could withstand the pangs of hunger but it was imperative to quench thirst his wound made him feverish and therefore more than usually hot and thirsty again he was refreshed that morning he was hard put to it to hold himself back from attempting to cross the river if he could find a light log it was within the bounds of possibility that he might ford the shallow water and bars of quicksand but not yet wearily doggedly he faced about toward the bluff  all that day and all that night all the next day and all the next night he stole like a hunted savage from river to bluff and every hour forced upon him the bitter certainty that he was trapped  duane lost track of days of events he had come to an evil pass there arrived an hour when closely pressed by pursuers at the extreme southern corner of the brake he took to a dense thicket of willows driven to what he believed was his last stand  if only these human bloodhounds would swiftly close in on him let him fight to the last bitter gasp and have it over but these hunters eager as they were to get him had care of their own skins they took few risks they had him cornered  it was the middle of the day hot dusty oppressive threatening storm like a snake duane crawled into a little space in the darkest part of the thicket and lay still men had cut him off from the bluff from the river seemingly from all sides but he heard voices only from in front and toward his left even if his passage to the river had not been blocked it might just as well have been  come on fellersdown hyar called one man from the bluff  got him corralled at last shouted another  reckon ye neednt be too shore we thought thet moren once taunted another  i seen him i tell you  aw thet was a deer  but bill found fresh tracks an blood on the willows  if hes winged we neednt hurry  hold on thar you boys came a shout in authoritative tones from farther up the bluff go slow youall air gittin foolish at the end of a long chase  thets right colonel hold em back theres nothin shorer than somebodyll be stoppin lead pretty quick hell be huntin us soon  lets surround this corner an starve him out  fire the brake  how clearly all this talk pierced duanes ears in it he seemed to hear his doom this then was the end he had always expected which had been close to him before yet never like now  by god whispered duane the thing for me to do nowis go outmeet them  that was prompted by the fighting the killing instinct in him in that moment it had almost superhuman power if he must die that was the way for him to die what else could be expected of buck duane he got to his knees and drew his gun with his swollen and almost useless hand he held what spare ammunition he had left he ought to creep out noiselessly to the edge of the willows suddenly face his pursuers then while there was a beat left in his heart kill kill kill these men all had rifles the fight would be short but the marksmen did not live on earth who could make such a fight go wholly against him confronting them suddenly he could kill a man for every shot in his gun  thus duane reasoned so he hoped to accept his fateto meet this end but when he tried to step forward something checked him he forced himself yet he could not go the obstruction that opposed his will was as insurmountable as it had been physically impossible for him to climb the bluff  slowly he fell back crouched low and then lay flat the grim and ghastly dignity that had been his a moment before fell away from him he lay there stripped of his last shred of selfrespect he wondered was he afraid had he the last of the duaneshad he come to feel fear no never in all his wild life had he so longed to go out and meet men face to face it was not fear that held him back he hated this hiding this eternal vigilance this hopeless life the damnable paradox of the situation was that if he went out to meet these men there was absolutely no doubt of his doom if he clung to his covert there was a chance a merest chance for his life these pursuers dogged and unflagging as they had been were mortally afraid of him it was his fame that made them cowards duanes keenness told him that at the very darkest and most perilous moment there was still a chance for him and the blood in him the temper of his father the years of his outlawry the pride of his unsought and hated career the nameless inexplicable something in him made him accept that slim chance  waiting then became a physical and mental agony he lay under the burning sun parched by thirst laboring to breathe sweating and bleeding his uncaredfor wound was like a redhot prong in his flesh blotched and swollen from the neverending attack of flies and mosquitoes his face seemed twice its natural size and it ached and stung  on one side then was this physical torture on the other the old hell terribly augmented at this crisis in his mind it seemed that thought and imagination had never been so swift if death found him presently how would it come would he get decent burial or be left for the peccaries and the coyotes would his people ever know where he had fallen how wretched how miserable his state it was cowardly it was monstrous for him to cling longer to this doomed life then the hate in his heart the hellish hate of these men on his trailthat was like a scourge he felt no longer human he had degenerated into an animal that could think his heart pounded his pulse beat his breast heaved and this internal strife seemed to thunder into his ears he was now enacting the tragedy of all crippled starved hunted wolves at bay in their dens only his tragedy was infinitely more terrible because he had mind enough to see his plight his resemblance to a lonely wolf bloodyfanged dripping snarling fireeyed in a last instinctive defiance  mounted upon the horror of duanes thought was a watching listening intensity so supreme that it registered impressions which were creations of his imagination he heard stealthy steps that were not there he saw shadowy moving figures that were only leaves a hundred times when he was about to pull trigger he discovered his error yet voices came from a distance and steps and crackings in the willows and other sounds real enough but duane could not distinguish the real from the false there were times when the wind which had arisen sent a hot pattering breath down the willow aisles and duane heard it as an approaching army  this straining of duanes faculties brought on a reaction which in itself was a respite he saw the sun darkened by thick slow spreading clouds a storm appeared to be coming how slowly it moved the air was like steam if there broke one of those dark violent storms common though rare to the country duane believed he might slip away in the fury of wind and rain hope that seemed unquenchable in him resurged again he hailed it with a bitterness that was sickening  then at a rustling step he froze into the old strained attention he heard a slow patter of soft feet a tawny shape crossed a little opening in the thicket it was that of a dog the moment while that beast came into full view was an age the dog was not a bloodhound and if he had a trail or a scent he seemed to be at fault on it duane waited for the inevitable discovery any kind of a huntingdog could have found him in that thicket voices from outside could be heard urging on the dog rover they called him duane sat up at the moment the dog entered the little shaded covert duane expected a yelping a baying or at least a bark that would tell of his hidingplace a strange relief swiftly swayed over duane the end was near now he had no further choice let them comea quick fierce exchange of shotsand then this torture past he waited for the dog to give the alarm  but the dog looked at him and trotted by into the thicket without a yelp duane could not believe the evidence of his senses he thought he had suddenly gone deaf he saw the dog disappear heard him running to and fro among the willows getting farther and farther away till all sound from him ceased  thars rover called a voice from the bluffside hes been through thet black patch  nary a rabbit in there replied another  bah thet pups no good scornfully growled another man put a hound at thet clump of willows  fires the game burn the brake before the rain comes  the voices droned off as their owners evidently walked up the ridge  then upon duane fell the crushing burden of the old waiting watching listening spell after all it was not to end just now his chance still persistedlooked a little brighterled him on perhaps to forlorn hope  all at once twilight settled quickly down upon the willow brake or else duane noted it suddenly he imagined it to be caused by the approaching storm but there was little movement of air or cloud and thunder still muttered and rumbled at a distance the fact was the sun had set and at this time of overcast sky night was at hand  duane realized it with the awakening of all his old force he would yet elude his pursuers that was the moment when he seized the significance of all these fortunate circumstances which had aided him without haste and without sound he began to crawl in the direction of the river it was not far and he reached the bank before darkness set in there were men up on the bluff carrying wood to build a bonfire for a moment he half yielded to a temptation to try to slip along the rivershore close in under the willows but when he raised himself to peer out he saw that an attempt of this kind would be liable to failure at the same moment he saw a roughhewn plank lying beneath him lodged against some willows the end of the plank extended in almost to a point beneath him quick as a flash he saw where a desperate chance invited him then he tied his gun in an oilskin bag and put it in his pocket  the bank was steep and crumbly he must not break off any earth to splash into the water there was a willow growing back some few feet from the edge of the bank cautiously he pulled it down bent it over the water so that when he released it there would be no springing back then he trusted his weight to it with his feet sliding carefully down the bank he went into the water almost up to his knees felt the quicksand grip his feet then leaning forward till he reached the plank he pulled it toward him and lay upon it  without a sound one end went slowly under water and the farther end appeared lightly braced against the overhanging willows very carefully then duane began to extricate his right foot from the sucking sand it seemed as if his foot was incased in solid rock but there was a movement upward and he pulled with all the power he dared use it came slowly and at length was free the left one he released with less difficulty the next few moments he put all his attention on the plank to ascertain if his weight would sink it into the sand the far end slipped off the willows with a little splash and gradually settled to rest upon the bottom but it sank no farther and duanes greatest concern was relieved however as it was manifestly impossible for him to keep his head up for long he carefully crawled out upon the plank until he could rest an arm and shoulder upon the willows  when he looked up it was to find the night strangely luminous with fires there was a bonfire on the extreme end of the bluff another a hundred paces beyond a great flare extended over the brake in that direction duane heard a roaring on the wind and he knew his pursuers had fired the willows he did not believe that would help them much the brake was dry enough but too green to burn readily and as for the bonfires he discovered that the men probably having run out of wood were keeping up the light with oil and stuff from the village a dozen men kept watch on the bluff scarcely fifty paces from where duane lay concealed by the willows they talked cracked jokes sang songs and manifestly considered this outlawhunting a great lark as long as the bright light lasted duane dared not move he had the patience and the endurance to wait for the breaking of the storm and if that did not come then the early hour before dawn when the gray fog and gloom were over the river  escape was now in his grasp he felt it and with that in his mind he waited strong as steel in his conviction capable of withstanding any strain endurable by the human frame  the wind blew in puffs grew wilder and roared through the willows carrying bright sparks upward thunder rolled down over the river and lightning began to flash then the rain fell in heavy sheets but not steadily the flashes of lightning and the broad flares played so incessantly that duane could not trust himself out on the open river certainly the storm rather increased the watchfulness of the men on the bluff he knew how to wait and he waited grimly standing pain and cramp and chill the storm wore away as desultorily as it had come and the long night set in there were times when duane thought he was paralyzed others when he grew sick giddy weak from the strained posture the first paling of the stars quickened him with a kind of wild joy he watched them grow paler dimmer disappear one by one a shadow hovered down rested upon the river and gradually thickened the bonfire on the bluff showed as through a foggy veil the watchers were mere groping dark figures  duane aware of how cramped he had become from long inaction began to move his legs and uninjured arm and body and at length overcame a paralyzing stiffness then digging his hand in the sand and holding the plank with his knees he edged it out into the river inch by inch he advanced until clear of the willows looking upward he saw the shadowy figures of the men on the bluff he realized they ought to see him feared that they would but he kept on cautiously noiselessly with a heartnumbing slowness from time to time his elbow made a little gurgle and splash in the water try as he might he could not prevent this it got to be like the hollow roar of a rapid filling his ears with mocking sound there was a perceptible current out in the river and it hindered straight advancement inch by inch he crept on expecting to hear the bang of rifles the spattering of bullets he tried not to look backward but failed the fire appeared a little dimmer the moving shadows a little darker  once the plank stuck in the sand and felt as if it were settling bringing feet to aid his hand he shoved it over the treacherous place this way he made faster progress the obscurity of the river seemed to be enveloping him when he looked back again the figures of the men were coalescing with the surrounding gloom the fires were streaky blurred patches of light but the sky above was brighter dawn was not far off  to the west all was dark with infinite care and implacable spirit and waning strength duane shoved the plank along and when at last he discerned the black border of bank it came in time he thought to save him he crawled out rested till the gray dawn broke and then headed north through the willows    chapter xiii  how long duane was traveling out of that region he never knew but he reached familiar country and found a rancher who had before befriended him here his arm was attended to he had food and sleep and in a couple of weeks he was himself again  when the time came for duane to ride away on his endless trail his friend reluctantly imparted the information that some thirty miles south near the village of shirley there was posted at a certain crossroad a reward for buck duane dead or alive duane had heard of such notices but he had never seen one his friends reluctance and refusal to state for what particular deed this reward was offered roused duanes curiosity he had never been any closer to shirley than this ranchers home doubtless some postoffice burglary some gunshooting scrape had been attributed to him and he had been accused of worse deeds abruptly duane decided to ride over there and find out who wanted him dead or alive and why  as he started south on the road he reflected that this was the first time he had ever deliberately hunted trouble introspection awarded him this knowledge during that last terrible flight on the lower nueces and while he lay abed recuperating he had changed a fixed immutable hopeless bitterness abided with him he had reached the end of his rope all the power of his mind and soul were unavailable to turn him back from his fate  that fate was to become an outlaw in every sense of the term to be what he was credited with beingthat is to say to embrace evil he had never committed a crime he wondered now was crime close to him he reasoned finally that the desperation of crime had been forced upon him if not its motive and that if driven there was no limit to his possibilities he understood now many of the hitherto inexplicable actions of certain noted outlawswhy they had returned to the scene of the crime that had outlawed them why they took such strangely fatal chances why life was no more to them than a breath of wind why they rode straight into the jaws of death to confront wronged men or hunting rangers vigilantes to laugh in their very faces it was such bitterness as this that drove these men  toward afternoon from the top of a long hill duane saw the green fields and trees and shining roofs of a town he considered must be shirley and at the bottom of the hill he came upon an intersecting road there was a placard nailed on the crossroad signpost duane drew rein near it and leaned close to read the faded print 1000 reward for buck duane dead or alive peering closer to read the finer more faded print duane learned that he was wanted for the murder of mrs jeff aiken at her ranch near shirley the month september was named but the date was illegible the reward was offered by the womans husband whose name appeared with that of a sheriffs at the bottom of the placard  duane read the thing twice when he straightened he was sick with the horror of his fate wild with passion at those misguided fools who could believe that he had harmed a woman then he remembered kate bland and as always when she returned to him he quaked inwardly years before word had gone abroad that he had killed her and so it was easy for men wanting to fix a crime to name him perhaps it had been done often probably he bore on his shoulders a burden of numberless crimes  a dark passionate fury possessed him it shook him like a storm shakes the oak when it passed leaving him cold with clouded brow and piercing eye his mind was set spurring his horse he rode straight toward the village  shirley appeared to be a large pretentious country town a branch of some railroad terminated there the main street was wide bordered by trees and commodious houses and many of the stores were of brick a large plaza shaded by giant cottonwood trees occupied a central location  duane pulled his running horse and halted him plunging and snorting before a group of idle men who lounged on benches in the shade of a spreading cottonwood how many times had duane seen just that kind of lazy shirtsleeved texas group not often however had he seen such placid lolling goodnatured men change their expression their attitude so swiftly his advent apparently was momentous they evidently took him for an unusual visitor so far as duane could tell not one of them recognized him had a hint of his identity  he slid off his horse and threw the bridle  im buck duane he said i saw that placardout there on a signpost its a damn lie somebody find this man jeff aiken i want to see him  his announcement was taken in absolute silence that was the only effect he noted for he avoided looking at these villagers the reason was simple enough duane felt himself overcome with emotion there were tears in his eyes he sat down on a bench put his elbows on his knees and his hands to his face for once he had absolutely no concern for his fate this ignominy was the last straw  presently however he became aware of some kind of commotion among these villagers he heard whisperings low hoarse voices then the shuffle of rapid feet moving away all at once a violent hand jerked his gun from its holster when duane rose a gaunt man livid of face shaking like a leaf confronted him with his own gun  hands up thar you buck duane he roared waving the gun  that appeared to be the cue for pandemonium to break loose duane opened his lips to speak but if he had yelled at the top of his lungs he could not have made himself heard in weary disgust he looked at the gaunt man and then at the others who were working themselves into a frenzy he made no move however to hold up his hands the villagers surrounded him emboldened by finding him now unarmed then several men lay hold of his arms and pinioned them behind his back resistance was useless even if duane had had the spirit some one of them fetched his halter from his saddle and with this they bound him helpless  people were running now from the street the stores the houses old men cowboys clerks boys ranchers came on the trot the crowd grew the increasing clamor began to attract women as well as men a group of girls ran up then hung back in fright and pity  the presence of cowboys made a difference they split up the crowd got to duane and lay hold of him with rough businesslike hands one of them lifted his fists and roared at the frenzied mob to fall back to stop the racket he beat them back into a circle but it was some little time before the hubbub quieted down so a voice could be heard  shut up will youall he was yelling give us a chance to hear somethin easy nowsoho there aint nobody goin to be hurt thets right everybody quiet now lets see whats come off  this cowboy evidently one of authority or at least one of strong personality turned to the gaunt man who still waved duanes gun  abe put the gun down he said it might go off here give it to me now whats wrong whos this roped gent an whats he done  the gaunt fellow who appeared now about to collapse lifted a shaking hand and pointed  thet thar fellerhes buck duane he panted  an angry murmur ran through the surrounding crowd  the rope the rope throw it over a branch string him up cried an excited villager  buck duane buck duane  hang him  the cowboy silenced these cries  abe how do you know this fellow is buck duane he asked sharply  whyhe said so replied the man called abe  what came the exclamation incredulously  its a tarnal fact panted abe waving his hands importantly he was an old man and appeared to be carried away with the significance of his deed he like to rid his hoss right over usall then he jumped off says he was buck duane an he wanted to see jeff aiken bad  this speech caused a second commotion as noisy though not so enduring as the first when the cowboy assisted by a couple of his mates had restored order again some one had slipped the nooseend of duanes rope over his head  up with him screeched a wildeyed youth  the mob surged closer was shoved back by the cowboys  abe if you aint drunk or crazy tell thet over ordered abes interlocutor  with some show of resentment and more of dignity abe reiterated his former statement  if hes buck duane hown hell did you get hold of his gun bluntly queried the cowboy  whyhe set down tharan he kind of hid his face on his hand an i grabbed his gun an got the drop on him  what the cowboy thought of this was expressed in a laugh his mates likewise grinned broadly then the leader turned to duane  stranger i reckon youd better speak up for yourself he said  that stilled the crowd as no command had done  im buck duane all right said duane quietly it was this way  the big cowboy seemed to vibrate with a shock all the ruddy warmth left his face his jaw began to bulge the corded veins in his neck stood out in knots in an instant he had a hard stern strange look he shot out a powerful hand that fastened in the front of duanes blouse  somethin queer here but if youre duane youre sure in bad any fool ought to know that you mean it then  yes  rode in to shoot up the town eh same old stunt of you gunfighters meant to kill the man who offered a reward wanted to see jeff aiken bad huh  no replied duane your citizen here misrepresented things he seems a little off his head  reckon he is somebody is thats sure you claim buck duane then an all his doings  im duane yes but i wont stand for the blame of things i never did thats why im here i saw that placard out there offering the reward until now i never was within half a days ride of this town im blamed for what i never did i rode in here told who i was asked somebody to send for jeff aiken  an then you set down an let this old guy throw your own gun on you queried the cowboy in amazement  i guess thats it replied duane  well its powerful strange if youre really buck duane  a man elbowed his way into the circle  its duane i recognize him i seen him in moren one place he said sibert you can rely on what i tell you i dont know if hes locoed or what but i do know hes the genuine buck duane any one whod ever seen him onct would never forget him  what do you want to see aiken for asked the cowboy sibert  i want to face him and tell him i never harmed his wife  why  because im innocent thats all  suppose we send for aiken an he hears you an doesnt believe you what then  if he wont believe mewhy then my cases so badid be better off dead  a momentary silence was broken by sibert  if this isnt a queer deal boys reckon wed better send for jeff  somebody went fer him hell be comin soon replied a man  duane stood a head taller than that circle of curious faces he gazed out above and beyond them it was in this way that he chanced to see a number of women on the outskirts of the crowd some were old with hard faces like the men some were young and comely and most of these seemed agitated by excitement or distress they cast fearful pitying glances upon duane as he stood there with that noose round his neck women were more human than men duane thought he met eyes that dilated seemed fascinated at his gaze but were not averted it was the old women who were voluble loud in expression of their feelings  near the trunk of the cottonwood stood a slender woman in white duanes wandering glance rested upon her her eyes were riveted upon him a softhearted woman probably who did not want to see him hanged  thar comes jeff aiken now called a man loudly  the crowd shifted and trampled in eagerness  duane saw two men coming fast one of whom in the lead was of stalwart build he had a gun in his hand and his manner was that of fierce energy  the cowboy sibert thrust open the jostling circle of men  hold on jeff he called and he blocked the man with the gun he spoke so low duane could not hear what he said and his form hid aikens face at that juncture the crowd spread out closed in and aiken and sibert were caught in the circle there was a pushing forward a pressing of many bodies hoarse cries and flinging handsagain the insane tumult was about to break outthe demand for an outlaws blood the call for a wild justice executed a thousand times before on texass bloody soil  sibert bellowed at the dark encroaching mass the cowboys with him beat and cuffed in vain  jeff will you listen broke in sibert hurriedly his hand on the other mans arm  aiken nodded coolly duane who had seen many men in perfect control of themselves under circumstances like these recognized the spirit that dominated aiken he was white cold passionless there were lines of bitter grief deep round his lips if duane ever felt the meaning of death he felt it then  sure this s your game aiken said sibert but hear me a minute reckon theres no doubt about this man bein buck duane he seen the placard out at the crossroads he rides in to shirley he says hes buck duane an hes lookin for jeff aiken thats all clear enough you know how these gunfighters go lookin for trouble but heres what stumps me duane sits down there on the bench and lets old abe strickland grab his gun ant get the drop on him moren that he gives me some strange talk about how if he couldnt make you believe hes innocent hed better be dead you see for yourself duane aint drunk or crazy or locoed he doesnt strike me as a man who rode in here huntin blood so i reckon youd better hold on till you hear what he has to say  then for the first time the drawnfaced hungryeyed giant turned his gaze upon duane he had intelligence which was not yet subservient to passion moreover he seemed the kind of man duane would care to have judge him in a critical moment like this  listen said duane gravely with his eyes steady on aikens im buck duane i never lied to any man in my life i was forced into outlawry ive never had a chance to leave the country ive killed men to save my own life i never intentionally harmed any woman i rode thirty miles todaydeliberately to see what this reward was who made it what for when i read the placard i went sick to the bottom of my soul so i rode in here to find youto tell you this i never saw shirley before today it was impossible for me to havekilled your wife last september i was two hundred miles north of here on the upper nueces i can prove that men who know me will tell you i couldnt murder a woman i havent any idea why such a deed should be laid at my hands its just that wild border gossip i have no idea what reasons you have for holding me responsible i only knowyoure wrong youve been deceived and see here aiken you understand im a miserable man im about broken i guess i dont care any more for life for anything if you cant look me in the eyes man to man and believe what i saywhy by god you can kill me  aiken heaved a great breath  buck duane whether im impressed or not by what you say neednt matter youve had accusers justly or unjustly as will soon appear the thing is we can prove you innocent or guilty my girl lucy saw my wifes assailant  he motioned for the crowd of men to open up  somebodyyou sibertgo for lucy thatll settle this thing  duane heard as a man in an ugly dream the faces around him the hum of voices all seemed far off his life hung by the merest thread yet he did not think of that so much as of the brand of a womanmurderer which might be soon sealed upon him by a frightened imaginative child  the crowd trooped apart and closed again duane caught a blurred image of a slight girl clinging to siberts hand he could not see distinctly aiken lifted the child whispered soothingly to her not to be afraid then he fetched her closer to duane  lucy tell me did you ever see this man before asked aiken huskily and low is he the onewho came in the house that daystruck you downand dragged mama  aikens voice failed  a lightning flash seemed to clear duanes blurred sight he saw a pale sad face and violet eyes fixed in gloom and horror upon his no terrible moment in duanes life ever equaled this one of silenceof suspense  its aint him cried the child  then sibert was flinging the noose off duanes neck and unwinding the bonds round his arms the spellbound crowd awoke to hoarse exclamations  see there my locoed gents how easy youd hang the wrong man burst out the cowboy as he made the ropeend hiss youall are a lot of wise rangers haw haw  he freed duane and thrust the bonehandled gun back in duanes holster  you abe there reckon you pulled a stunt but dont try the like again and men ill gamble theres a hell of a lot of bad work buck duanes named forwhich all he never done clear away there wheres his hoss duane the roads open out of shirley  sibert swept the gaping watchers aside and pressed duane toward the horse which another cowboy held mechanically duane mounted felt a lift as he went up then the cowboys hard face softened in a smile  i reckon it aint uncivil of me to sayhit that road quick he said frankly  he led the horse out of the crowd aiken joined him and between them they escorted duane across the plaza the crowd appeared irresistibly drawn to follow  aiken paused with his big hand on duanes knee in it unconsciously probably he still held the gun  duane a word with you he said i believe youre not so black as youve been painted i wish there was time to say more tell me this anyway do you know the ranger captain macnelly  i do not replied duane in surprise  i met him only a week ago over in fairfield went on aiken hurriedly he declared you never killed my wife i didnt believe himargued with him we almost had hard words over it nowim sorry the last thing he said was if you ever see duane dont kill him send him into my camp after dark he meant something strange whati cant say but he was right and i was wrong if lucy had batted an eye id have killed you still i wouldnt advise you to hunt up macnellys camp hes clever maybe he believes theres no treachery in his new ideas of ranger tactics i tell you for all its worth goodby may god help you further as he did this day  duane said goodby and touched the horse with his spurs  so long buck called sibert with that frank smile breaking warm over his brown face and he held his sombrero high    chapter xiv  when duane reached the crossing of the roads the name fairfield on the signpost seemed to be the thing that tipped the oscillating balance of decision in favor of that direction  he answered here to unfathomable impulse if he had been driven to hunt up jeff aiken now he was called to find this unknown ranger captain in duanes state of mind clear reasoning common sense or keenness were out of the question he went because he felt he was compelled  dusk had fallen when he rode into a town which inquiry discovered to be fairfield captain macnellys camp was stationed just out of the village limits on the other side  no one except the boy duane questioned appeared to notice his arrival like shirley the town of fairfield was large and prosperous compared to the innumerable hamlets dotting the vast extent of southwestern texas as duane rode through being careful to get off the main street he heard the tolling of a churchbell that was a melancholy reminder of his old home  there did not appear to be any camp on the outskirts of the town but as duane sat his horse peering around and undecided what further move to make he caught the glint of flickering lights through the darkness heading toward them he rode perhaps a quarter of a mile to come upon a grove of mesquite the brightness of several fires made the surrounding darkness all the blacker duane saw the moving forms of men and heard horses he advanced naturally expecting any moment to be halted  who goes there came the sharp call out of the gloom  duane pulled his horse the gloom was impenetrable  one manalone replied duane  a stranger  yes  what do you want  im trying to find the ranger camp  youve struck it whats your errand  i want to see captain macnelly  get down and advance slow dont move your hands its dark but i can see  duane dismounted and leading his horse slowly advanced a few paces he saw a dully bright objecta gunbefore he discovered the man who held it a few more steps showed a dark figure blocking the trail here duane halted  come closer stranger lets have a look at you the guard ordered curtly  duane advanced again until he stood before the man here the rays of light from the fires flickered upon duanes face  reckon youre a stranger all right whats your name and your business with the captain  duane hesitated pondering what best to say  tell captain macnelly im the man hes been asking to ride into his campafter dark finally said duane  the ranger bent forward to peer hard at this night visitor his manner had been alert and now it became tense  come here one of you men quick he called without turning in the least toward the campfire  hello whats up pickens came the swift reply it was followed by a rapid thud of boots on soft ground a dark form crossed the gleams from the firelight then a ranger loomed up to reach the side of the guard duane heard whispering the purport of which he could not catch the second ranger swore under his breath then he turned away and started back  here ranger before you go understand this my visit is peacefulfriendly if youll let it be mind i was asked to come hereafter dark  duanes clear penetrating voice carried far the listening rangers at the campfire heard what he said  ho pickens tell that fellow to wait replied an authoritative voice then a slim figure detached itself from the dark moving group at the campfire and hurried out  better be foxy cap shouted a ranger in warning  shut upall of you was the reply  this officer obviously captain macnelly soon joined the two rangers who were confronting duane he had no fear he strode straight up to duane  im macnelly he said if youre my man dont mention your nameyet  all this seemed so strange to duane in keeping with much that had happened lately  i met jeff aiken today said duane he sent me  youve met aiken exclaimed macnelly sharp eager low by all thats bully then he appeared to catch himself to grow restrained  men fall back leave us alone a moment  the rangers slowly withdrew  buck duane its you he whispered eagerly  yes  if i give my word youll not be arrestedyoull be treated fairlywill you come into camp and consult with me  certainly  duane im sure glad to meet you went on macnelly and he extended his hand  amazed and touched scarcely realizing this actuality duane gave his hand and felt no unmistakable grip of warmth  it doesnt seem natural captain macnelly but i believe im glad to meet you said duane soberly  you will be now well go back to camp keep your identity mum for the present  he led duane in the direction of the campfire  pickers go back on duty he ordered and beeson you look after this horse  when duane got beyond the line of mesquite which had hid a good view of the campsite he saw a group of perhaps fifteen rangers sitting around the fires near a long low shed where horses were feeding and a small adobe house at one side  weve just had grub but ill see you get some then well talk said macnelly ive taken up temporary quarters here have a rustler job on hand now when youve eaten come right into the house  duane was hungry but he hurried through the ample supper that was set before him urged on by curiosity and astonishment the only way he could account for his presence there in a rangers camp was that macnelly hoped to get useful information out of him still that would hardly have made this captain so eager there was a mystery here and duane could scarcely wait for it to be solved while eating he had bent keen eyes around him after a first quiet scrutiny the rangers apparently paid no more attention to him they were all veterans in serviceduane saw thatand rugged powerful men of iron constitution despite the occasional joke and sally of the more youthful members and a general conversation of campfire nature duane was not deceived about the fact that his advent had been an unusual and striking one which had caused an undercurrent of conjecture and even consternation among them these rangers were too well trained to appear openly curious about their captains guest if they had not deliberately attempted to be oblivious of his presence duane would have concluded they thought him an ordinary visitor somehow of use to macnelly as it was duane felt a suspense that must have been due to a hint of his identity  he was not long in presenting himself at the door of the house  come in and have a chair said macnelly motioning for the one other occupant of the room to rise leave us russell and close the door ill be through these reports right off  macnelly sat at a table upon which was a lamp and various papers seen in the light he was a finelooking soldierly man of about forty years darkhaired and darkeyed with a bronzed face shrewd stern strong yet not wanting in kindliness he scanned hastily over some papers fussed with them and finally put them in envelopes without looking up he pushed a cigarcase toward duane and upon duanes refusal to smoke he took a cigar rose to light it at the lampchimney and then settling back in his chair he faced duane making a vain attempt to hide what must have been the fulfilment of a longnourished curiosity  duane ive been hoping for this for two years he began  duane smiled a littlea smile that felt strange on his face he had never been much of a talker and speech here seemed more than ordinarily difficult  macnelly must have felt that  he looked long and earnestly at duane and his quick nervous manner changed to grave thoughtfulness  ive lots to say but where to begin he mused duane youve had a hard life since you went on the dodge i never met you before dont know what you looked like as a boy but i can see whatwell even ranger life isnt all roses  he rolled his cigar between his lips and puffed clouds of smoke  ever hear from home since you left wellston he asked abruptly  no  never a word  not one replied duane sadly  thats tough im glad to be able to tell you that up to just lately your mother sister uncleall your folks i believewere well ive kept posted but havent heard lately  duane averted his face a moment hesitated till the swelling left his throat and then said its worth what i went through today to hear that  i can imagine how you feel about it when i was in the warbut lets get down to the business of this meeting  he pulled his chair close to duanes  youve had word more than once in the last two years that i wanted to see you  three times i remember replied duane  why didnt you hunt me up  i supposed you imagined me one of those gunfighters who couldnt take a dare and expected me to ride up to your camp and be arrested  that was natural i suppose went on macnelly you didnt know me otherwise you would have come ive been a long time getting to you but the nature of my job as far as youre concerned made me cautious duane youre aware of the hard name you bear all over the southwest  once in a while im jarred into realizing replied duane  its the hardest barring murrell and cheseldine on the texas border but theres this difference murrell in his day was known to deserve his infamous name cheseldine in his day also but ive found hundreds of men in southwest texas whore your friends who swear you never committed a crime the farther south i get the clearer this becomes what i want to know is the truth have you ever done anything criminal tell me the truth duane it wont make any difference in my plan and when i say crime i mean what i would call crime or any reasonable texan  that way my hands are clean replied duane  you never held up a man robbed a store for grub stole a horse when you needed him badnever anything like that  somehow i always kept out of that just when pressed the hardest  duane im damn glad macnelly exclaimed gripping duanes hand glad for you mothers sakel but all the same in spite of this you are a texas outlaw accountable to the state youre perfectly aware that under existing circumstances if you fell into the hands of the law youd probably hang at least go to jail for a long term  thats what kept me on the dodge all these years replied duane  certainly macnelly removed his cigar his eyes narrowed and glittered the muscles along his brown cheeks set hard and tense he leaned closer to duane laid sinewy pressing fingers upon duanes knee  listen to this he whispered hoarsely if i place a pardon in your handmake you a free honest citizen once more clear your name of infamy make your mother your sister proud of youwill you swear yourself to a service any service i demand of you  duane sat stock still stunned  slowly more persuasively with show of earnest agitation captain macnelly reiterated his startling query  my god burst from duane whats this macnelly you cant be in earnest  never more so in my life ive a deep game im playing it square what do you say  he rose to his feet duane as if impelled rose with him ranger and outlaw then locked eyes that searched each others souls in macnellys duane read truth strong fiery purpose hope even gladness and a fugitive mounting assurance of victory  twice duane endeavored to speak failed of all save a hoarse incoherent sound until forcing back a flood of speech he found a voice  any service every service macnelly i give my word said duane  a light played over macnellys face warming out all the grim darkness he held out his hand duane met it with his in a clasp that men unconsciously give in moments of stress  when they unclasped and duane stepped back to drop into a chair macnelly fumbled for another cigarhe had bitten the other into shredsand lighting it as before he turned to his visitor now calm and cool he had the look of a man who had justly won something at considerable cost his next move was to take a long leather case from his pocket and extract from it several folded papers  heres your pardon from the governor he said quietly youll see when you look it over that its conditional when you sign this paper i have here the condition will be met  he smoothed out the paper handed duane a pen ran his forefinger along a dotted line  duanes hand was shaky years had passed since he had held a pen it was with difficulty that he achieved his signature buckley duanehow strange the name looked  right here ends the career of buck duane outlaw and gunfighter said macnelly and seating himself he took the pen from duanes fingers and wrote several lines in several places upon the paper then with a smile he handed it to duane  that makes you a member of company a texas rangers  so thats it burst out duane a light breaking in upon his bewilderment you want me for ranger service  sure thats it replied the captain dryly now to hear what that service is to be ive been a busy man since i took this job and as you may have heard ive done a few things i dont mind telling you that political influence put me in here and that up austin way theres a good deal of friction in the department of state in regard to whether or not the ranger service is any goodwhether it should be discontinued or not im on the party side whos defending the ranger service i contend that its made texas habitable well its been up to me to produce results so far i have been successful my great ambition is to break up the outlaw gangs along the river i have never ventured in there yet because ive been waiting to get the lieutenant i needed you of course are the man i had in mind its my idea to start way up the rio grande and begin with cheseldine hes the strongest the worst outlaw of the times hes more than rustler its cheseldine and his gang who are operating on the banks theyre doing bankrobbing thats my private opinion but its not been backed up by any evidence cheseldine doesnt leave evidences hes intelligent cunning no one seems to have seen himto know what he looks like i assume of course that you are a stranger to the country he dominates its five hundred miles west of your ground theres a little town over there called fairdale its the nest of a rustler gang they rustle and murder at will nobody knows who the leader is i want you to find out well whatever way you decide is best you will proceed to act upon you are your own boss you know such men and how they can be approached you will take all the time needed if its months it will be necessary for you to communicate with me and that will be a difficult matter for cheseldine dominates several whole counties you must find some way to let me know when i and my rangers are needed the plan is to break up cheseldines gang its the toughest job on the border arresting him alone isnt to be heard of he couldnt be brought out killing him isnt much better for his select men the ones he operates with are as dangerous to the community as he is we want to kill or jail this choice selection of robbers and break up the rest of the gang to find them to get among them somehow to learn their movements to lay your trap for us rangers to springthat duane is your service to me and god knows its a great one  i have accepted it replied duane  your work will be secret you are now a ranger in my service but no one except the few i choose to tell will know of it until we pull off the job you will simply be buck duane till it suits our purpose to acquaint texas with the fact that youre a ranger youll see theres no date on that paper no one will ever know just when you entered the service perhaps we can make it appear that all or most of your outlawry has really been good service to the state at that ill believe itll turn out so  macnelly paused a moment in his rapid talk chewed his cigar drew his brows together in a dark frown and went on no man on the border knows so well as you the deadly nature of this service its a thousand to one that youll be killed id say there was no chance at all for any other man beside you your reputation will go far among the outlaws maybe that and your nerve and your gunplay will pull you through im hoping so but its a long long chance against your ever coming back  thats not the point said duane but in case i get killed out therewhat  leave that to me interrupted captain macnelly your folks will know at once of your pardon and your ranger duty if you lose your life out there ill see your name clearedthe service you render known you can rest assured of that  i am satisfied replied duane thats so much more than ive dared to hope  well its settled then ill give you money for expenses youll start as soon as you likethe sooner the better i hope to think of other suggestions especially about communicating with me  long after the lights were out and the low hum of voices had ceased round the campfire duane lay wide awake eyes staring into the blackness marveling over the strange events of the day he was humble grateful to the depths of his soul a huge and crushing burden had been lifted from his heart he welcomed this hazardous service to the man who had saved him thought of his mother and sister and uncle jim of his home of old friends came rushing over him the first time in years that he had happiness in the memory the disgrace he had put upon them would now be removed and in the light of that his wasted life of the past and its probable tragic end in future service as atonement changed their aspects and as he lay there with the approach of sleep finally dimming the vividness of his thought so full of mystery shadowy faces floated in the blackness around him haunting him as he had always been haunted  it was broad daylight when he awakened macnelly was calling him to breakfast outside sounded voices of men crackling of fires snorting and stamping of horses the barking of dogs duane rolled out of his blankets and made good use of the soap and towel and razor and brush near by on a benchthings of rare luxury to an outlaw on the ride the face he saw in the mirror was as strange as the past he had tried so hard to recall then he stepped to the door and went out  the rangers were eating in a circle round a tarpaulin spread upon the ground  fellows said macnelly shake hands with buck duane hes on secret ranger service for me service thatll likely make you all hump soon mind you keep mum about it  the rangers surprised duane with a roaring greeting the warmth of which he soon divined was divided between pride of his acquisition to their ranks and eagerness to meet that violent service of which their captain hinted they were jolly wild fellows with just enough gravity in their welcome to show duane their respect and appreciation while not forgetting his lonewolf record when he had seated himself in that circle now one of them a feeling subtle and uplifting pervaded him  after the meal captain macnelly drew duane aside  heres the money make it go as far as you can better strike straight for el paso snook around there and hear things then go to valentine thats near the river and within fifty miles or so of the edge of the rim rock somewhere up there cheseldine holds fort somewhere to the north is the town fairdale but he doesnt hide all the time in the rocks only after some daring raid or holdup cheseldines got border towns on his staff or scared of him and these places we want to know about especially fairdale write me care of the adjutant at austin i dont have to warn you to be careful where you mail letters ride a hundred two hundred miles if necessary or go clear to el paso  macnelly stopped with an air of finality and then duane slowly rose  ill start at once he said extending his hand to the captain i wishid like to thank you  hell man dont thank me replied macnelly crushing the proffered hand ive sent a lot of good men to their deaths and maybe youre another but as ive said youve one chance in a thousand and by heaven id hate to be cheseldine or any other man you were trailing no not goodbyadios duane may we meet again     book ii the ranger    chapter xv  west of the pecos river texas extended a vast wild region barren in the north where the llano estacado spread its shifting sands fertile in the south along the rio grande a railroad marked an undeviating course across five hundred miles of this country and the only villages and towns lay on or near this line of steel unsettled as was this western texas and despite the acknowledged dominance of the outlaw bands the pioneers pushed steadily into it first had come the lone rancher then his neighbors in near and far valleys then the hamlets at last the railroad and the towns and still the pioneers came spreading deeper into the valleys farther and wider over the plains it was mesquitedotted cactuscovered desert but rich soil upon which water acted like magic there was little grass to an acre but there were millions of acres the climate was wonderful cattle flourished and ranchers prospered  the rio grande flowed almost due south along the western boundary for a thousand miles and then weary of its course turned abruptly north to make what was called the big bend the railroad running west cut across this bend and all that country bounded on the north by the railroad and on the south by the river was as wild as the staked plains it contained not one settlement across the face of this big bend as if to isolate it stretched the ord mountain range of which mount ord cathedral mount and elephant mount raised bleak peaks above their fellows in the valleys of the foothills and out across the plains were ranches and farther north villages and the towns of alpine and marfa  like other parts of the great lone star state this section of texas was a world in itselfa world where the riches of the rancher were ever enriching the outlaw the village closest to the gateway of this outlawinfested region was a little place called ord named after the dark peak that loomed some miles to the south it had been settled originally by mexicansthere were still the ruins of adobe missionsbut with the advent of the rustler and outlaw many inhabitants were shot or driven away so that at the height of ords prosperity and evil sway there were but few mexicans living there and these had their choice between holding handandglove with the outlaws or furnishing target practice for that wild element  toward the close of a day in september a stranger rode into ord and in a community where all men were remarkable for one reason or another he excited interest his horse perhaps received the first and most engaging attentionhorses in that region being apparently more important than men this particular horse did not attract with beauty at first glance he seemed ugly but he was a giant black as coal rough despite the care manifestly bestowed upon him long of body ponderous of limb huge in every way a bystander remarked that he had a grand head true if only his head had been seen he would have been a beautiful horse like men horses show what they are in the shape the size the line the character of the head this one denoted fire speed blood loyalty and his eyes were as soft and dark as a womans his face was solid black except in the middle of his forehead where there was a round spot of white  say mister mind tellin me his name asked a ragged urchin with born love of a horse in his eyes  bullet replied the rider  thet theres fer the white mark aint it whispered the youngster to another say aint he a whopper biggest hoss i ever seen  bullet carried a huge black silverornamented saddle of mexican make a lariat and canteen and a small pack rolled into a tarpaulin  this rider apparently put all care of appearances upon his horse his apparel was the ordinary jeans of the cowboy without vanity and it was torn and travelstained his boots showed evidence of an intimate acquaintance with cactus like his horse this man was a giant in stature but rangier not so heavily built otherwise the only striking thing about him was his somber face with its piercing eyes and hair white over the temples he packed two guns both low downbut that was too common a thing to attract notice in the big bend a close observer however would have noted a singular factthis riders right hand was more bronzed more weatherbeaten than his left he never wore a glove on that right hand  he had dismounted before a ramshackle structure that bore upon its wide highboarded front the sign hotel there were horsemen coming and going down the wide street between its rows of old stores saloons and houses ord certainly did not look enterprising americans had manifestly assimilated much of the leisure of the mexicans the hotel had a wide platform in front and this did duty as porch and sidewalk upon it and leaning against a hitchingrail were men of varying ages most of them slovenly in old jeans and slouched sombreros some were booted belted and spurred no man there wore a coat but all wore vests the guns in that group would have outnumbered the men  it was a crowd seemingly too lazy to be curious good nature did not appear to be wanting but it was not the frank and boisterous kind natural to the cowboy or rancher in town for a day these men were idlers what else perhaps was easy to conjecture certainly to this arriving stranger who flashed a keen eye over them they wore an atmosphere never associated with work  presently a tall man with a drooping sandy mustache leisurely detached himself from the crowd  howdy stranger he said  the stranger had bent over to loosen the cinches he straightened up and nodded then im thirsty  that brought a broad smile to faces it was characteristic greeting one and all trooped after the stranger into the hotel it was a dark illsmelling barn of a place with a bar as high as a short mans head a bartender with a scarred face was serving drinks  line up gents said the stranger  they piled over one another to get to the bar with coarse jests and oaths and laughter none of them noted that the stranger did not appear so thirsty as he had claimed to be in fact though he went through the motions he did not drink at all  my names jim fletcher said the tall man with the drooping sandy mustache he spoke laconically nevertheless there was a tone that showed he expected to be known something went with that name the stranger did not appear to be impressed  my name might be blazes but it aint he replied what do you call this burg  stranger this heah metropoles bears the handle ord is thet new to you  he leaned back against the bar and now his little yellow eyes clear as crystal flawless as a hawks fixed on the stranger other men crowded close forming a circle curious ready to be friendly or otherwise according to how the tall interrogator marked the newcomer  sure ords a little strange to me off the railroad some aint it funny trails hereabouts  how fur was you goin  i reckon i was goin as far as i could replied the stranger with a hard laugh  his reply had subtle reaction on that listening circle some of the men exchanged glances fletcher stroked his drooping mustache seemed thoughtful but lost something of that piercing scrutiny  wal ords the jumpinoff place he said presently sure youve heerd of the big bend country  i sure have an was makin tracks fer it replied the stranger  fletcher turned toward a man in the outer edge of the group knell come in heah  this individual elbowed his way in and was seen to be scarcely more than a boy almost pale beside those bronzed men with a long expressionless face thin and sharp  knell this heahs fletcher wheeled to the stranger whatd you call yourself  id hate to mention what ive been callin myself lately  this sally fetched another laugh the stranger appeared cool careless indifferent perhaps he knew as the others present knew that this show of fletchers this pretense of introduction was merely talk while he was looked over  knell stepped up and it was easy to see from the way fletcher relinquished his part in the situation that a man greater than he had appeared upon the scene  any business here he queried curtly when he spoke his expressionless face was in strange contrast with the ring the quality the cruelty of his voice this voice betrayed an absence of humor of friendliness of heart  nope replied the stranger  know anybody hereabouts  nary one  jest ridin through  yep  slopin fer back country eh  there came a pause the stranger appeared to grow a little resentful and drew himself up disdainfully  wal considerin youall seem so damn friendly an oncurious down here in this big bend country i dont mind sayin yesi am in on the dodge he replied with deliberate sarcasm  from west of ordout el paso way mebbe  sure  ahuh thet so knells words cut the air stilled the room youre from way down the river thets what they say down thereon the dodge stranger youre a liar  with swift clink of spur and thump of boot the crowd split leaving knell and the stranger in the center  wild breed of that ilk never made a mistake in judging a mans nerve knell had cut out with the trenchant call and stood ready the stranger suddenly lost his every semblance to the rough and easy character before manifest in him he became bronze that situation seemed familiar to him his eyes held a singular piercing light that danced like a compassneedle  sure i lied he said so i aint takin offense at the way you called me im lookin to make friends not enemies you dont strike me as one of them fourflushes achin to kill somebody but if you arego ahead an open the ball you see i never throw a gun on them fellers till they go fer theirs  knell coolly eyed his antagonist his strange face not changing in the least yet somehow it was evident in his look that here was metal which rang differently from what he had expected invited to start a fight or withdraw as he chose knell proved himself big in the manner characteristic of only the genuine gunman  stranger i pass he said and turning to the bar he ordered liquor  the tension relaxed the silence broke the men filled up the gap the incident seemed closed jim fletcher attached himself to the stranger and now both respect and friendliness tempered his asperity  wal fer want of a better handle ill call you dodge he said  dodges as good as any gents line up againan if you cant be friendly be careful  such was buck duanes debut in the little outlaw hamlet of ord  duane had been three months out of the nueces country at el paso he bought the finest horse he could find and armed and otherwise outfitted to suit him he had taken to unknown trails leisurely he rode from town to town village to village ranch to ranch fitting his talk and his occupation to the impression he wanted to make upon different people whom he met he was in turn a cowboy a rancher a cattleman a stockbuyer a boomer a landhunter and long before he reached the wild and inhospitable ord he had acted the part of an outlaw drifting into new territory he passed on leisurely because he wanted to learn the lay of the country the location of villages and ranches the work habit gossip pleasures and fears of the people with whom he came in contact the one subject most impelling to himoutlawshe never mentioned but by talking all around it sifting the old ranch and cattle story he acquired a knowledge calculated to aid his plot in this game time was of no moment if necessary he would take years to accomplish his task the stupendous and perilous nature of it showed in the slow wary preparation when he heard fletchers name and faced knell he knew he had reached the place he sought ord was a hamlet on the fringe of the grazing country of doubtful honesty from which surely winding trails led down into that free and neverdisturbed paradise of outlawsthe big bend  duane made himself agreeable yet not too much so to fletcher and several other men disposed to talk and drink and eat and then after having a care for his horse he rode out of town a couple of miles to a grove he had marked and there well hidden he prepared to spend the night this proceeding served a double purposehe was safer and the habit would look well in the eyes of outlaws who would be more inclined to see in him the lonewolf fugitive  long since duane had fought out a battle with himself won a hardearned victory his outer life the action was much the same as it had been but the inner life had tremendously changed he could never become a happy man he could never shake utterly those haunting phantoms that had once been his despair and madness but he had assumed a task impossible for any man save one like him he had felt the meaning of it grow strangely and wonderfully and through that flourished up consciousness of how passionately he now clung to this thing which would blot out his former infamy the iron fetters no more threatened his hands the iron door no more haunted his dreams he never forgot that he was free strangely too along with this feeling of new manhood there gathered the force of imperious desire to run these chief outlaws to their dooms he never called them outlawsbut rustlers thieves robbers murderers criminals he sensed the growth of a relentless driving passion and sometimes he feared that more than the newly acquired zeal and pride in this ranger service it was the old terrible inherited killing instinct lifting its hydrahead in new guise but of that he could not be sure he dreaded the thought he could only wait  another aspect of the change in duane neither passionate nor driving yet not improbably even more potent of new significance to life was the imperceptible return of an old love of nature dead during his outlaw days  for years a horse had been only a machine of locomotion to carry him from place to place to beat and spur and goad mercilessly in flight now this giant black with his splendid head was a companion a friend a brother a loved thing guarded jealously fed and trained and ridden with an intense appreciation of his great speed and endurance for years the daytime with its birth of sunrise on through long hours to the ruddy close had been used for sleep or rest in some rocky hole or willow brake or deserted hut had been hated because it augmented danger of pursuit because it drove the fugitive to lonely wretched hiding now the dawn was a greeting a promise of another day to ride to plan to remember and sun wind cloud rain skyall were joys to him somehow speaking his freedom for years the night had been a black space during which he had to ride unseen along the endless trails to peer with cateyes through gloom for the moving shape that ever pursued him now the twilight and the dusk and the shadows of grove and canon darkened into night with its train of stars and brought him calm reflection of the days happenings of the morrows possibilities perhaps a sad brief procession of the old phantoms then sleep for years canons and valleys and mountains had been looked at as retreats that might be dark and wild enough to hide even an outlaw now he saw these features of the great desert with something of the eyes of the boy who had once burned for adventure and life among them  this night a wonderful afterglow lingered long in the west and against the goldenred of clear sky the bold black head of mount ord reared itself aloft beautiful but aloof sinister yet calling small wonder that duane gazed in fascination upon the peak somewhere deep in its corrugated sides or lost in a rugged canon was hidden the secret stronghold of the master outlaw cheseldine all down along the ride from el paso duane had heard of cheseldine of his band his fearful deeds his cunning his widely separated raids of his flitting here and there like a jackolantern but never a word of his den never a word of his appearance  next morning duane did not return to ord he struck off to the north riding down a rough slowdescending road that appeared to have been used occasionally for cattledriving as he had ridden in from the west this northern direction led him into totally unfamiliar country while he passed on however he exercised such keen observation that in the future he would know whatever might be of service to him if he chanced that way again  the rough wild brushcovered slope down from the foothills gradually leveled out into plain a magnificent grazing country upon which till noon of that day duane did not see a herd of cattle or a ranch about that time he made out smoke from the railroad and after a couple of hours riding he entered a town which inquiry discovered to be bradford it was the largest town he had visited since marfa and he calculated must have a thousand or fifteen hundred inhabitants not including mexicans he decided this would be a good place for him to hold up for a while being the nearest town to ord only forty miles away so he hitched his horse in front of a store and leisurely set about studying bradford  it was after dark however that duane verified his suspicions concerning bradford the town was awake after dark and there was one long row of saloons dancehalls gamblingresorts in full blast duane visited them all and was surprised to see wildness and license equal to that of the old river camp of blands in its palmiest days here it was forced upon him that the farther west one traveled along the river the sparser the respectable settlements the more numerous the hard characters and in consequence the greater the element of lawlessness duane returned to his lodginghouse with the conviction that macnellys task of cleaning up the big bend country was a stupendous one yet he reflected a company of intrepid and quickshooting rangers could have soon cleaned up this bradford  the innkeeper had one other guest that night a long blackcoated and widesombreroed texan who reminded duane of his grandfather this man had penetrating eyes a courtly manner and an unmistakable leaning toward companionship and mintjuleps the gentleman introduced himself as colonel webb of marfa and took it as a matter of course that duane made no comment about himself  sir its all one to me he said blandly waving his hand i have traveled texas is free and this frontier is one where its healthier and just as friendly for a man to have no curiosity about his companion you might be cheseldine of the big bend or you might be judge little of el pasoits all one to me i enjoy drinking with you anyway  duane thanked him conscious of a reserve and dignity that he could not have felt or pretended three months before and then as always he was a good listener colonel webb told among other things that he had come out to the big bend to look over the affairs of a deceased brother who had been a rancher and a sheriff of one of the towns fairdale by name  found no affairs no ranch not even his grave said colonel webb and i tell you sir if hells any tougher than this fairdale i dont want to expiate my sins there  fairdale i imagine sheriffs have a hard row to hoe out here replied duane trying not to appear curious  the colonel swore lustily  my brother was the only honest sheriff fairdale ever had it was wonderful how long he lasted but he had nerve he could throw a gun and he was on the square then he was wise enough to confine his work to offenders of his own town and neighborhood he let the riding outlaws alone else he wouldnt have lasted at all what this frontier needs sir is about six companies of texas rangers  duane was aware of the colonels close scrutiny  do you know anything about the service he asked  i used to ten years ago when i lived in san antonio a fine body of men sir and the salvation of texas  governor stone doesnt entertain that opinion said duane  here colonel webb exploded manifestly the governor was not his choice for a chief executive of the great state he talked politics for a while and of the vast territory west of the pecos that seemed never to get a benefit from austin he talked enough for duane to realize that here was just the kind of intelligent wellinformed honest citizen that he had been trying to meet he exerted himself thereafter to be agreeable and interesting and he saw presently that here was an opportunity to make a valuable acquaintance if not a friend  im a stranger in these parts said duane finally what is this outlaw situation you speak of  its damnable sir and unbelievable not rustling any more but just wholesale herdstealing in which some big cattlemen supposed to be honest are equally guilty with the outlaws on this border you know the rustler has always been able to steal cattle in any numbers but to get rid of big bunchesthats the hard job the gang operating between here and valentine evidently have not this trouble nobody knows where the stolen stock goes but im not alone in my opinion that most of it goes to several big stockmen they ship to san antonio austin new orleans also to el paso if you travel the stockroad between here and marfa and valentine youll see dead cattle all along the line and stray cattle out in the scrub the herds have been driven fast and far and stragglers are not rounded up  wholesale business eh remarked duane who are theseerbig stockbuyers  colonel webb seemed a little startled at the abrupt query he bent his penetrating gaze upon duane and thoughtfully stroked his pointed beard  names of course ill not mention opinions are one thing direct accusation another this is not a healthy country for the informer  when it came to the outlaws themselves colonel webb was disposed to talk freely duane could not judge whether the colonel had a hobby of that subject or the outlaws were so striking in personality and deed that any man would know all about them the great name along the river was cheseldine but it seemed to be a name detached from an individual no person of veracity known to colonel webb had ever seen cheseldine and those who claimed that doubtful honor varied so diversely in descriptions of the chief that they confused the reality and lent to the outlaw only further mystery strange to say of an outlaw leader as there was no one who could identify him so there was no one who could prove he had actually killed a man blood flowed like water over the big bend country and it was cheseldine who spilled it yet the fact remained there were no eyewitnesses to connect any individual called cheseldine with these deeds of violence but in striking contrast to this mystery was the person character and coldblooded action of poggin and knell the chiefs lieutenants they were familiar figures in all the towns within two hundred miles of bradford knell had a record but as gunman with an incredible list of victims poggin was supreme if poggin had a friend no one ever heard of him there were a hundred stories of his nerve his wonderful speed with a gun his passion for gambling his love of a horsehis cold implacable inhuman wiping out of his path any man that crossed it  cheseldine is a name a terrible name said colonel webb sometimes i wonder if hes not only a name in that case where does the brains of this gang come from no there must be a master craftsman behind this border pillage a master capable of handling those terrors poggin and knell of all the thousands of outlaws developed by western texas in the last twenty years these three are the greatest in southern texas down between the pecos and the nueces there have been and are still many bad men but i doubt if any outlaw there possibly excepting buck duane ever equaled poggin youve heard of this duane  yes a little replied duane quietly im from southern texas buck duane then is known out here  why man where isnt his name known returned colonel webb ive kept track of his record as i have all the others of course duane being a lone outlaw is somewhat of a mystery also but not like cheseldine out here there have drifted many stories of duane horrible some of them but despite them a sort of romance clings to that nueces outlaw hes killed three great outlaw leaders i believebland hardin and the other i forgot hardin was known in the big bend had friends there bland had a hard name at del rio  then this man duane enjoys rather an unusual repute west of the pecos inquired duane  hes considered more of an enemy to his kind than to honest men i understand duane had many friends that whole counties swear by himsecretly of course for hes a hunted outlaw with rewards on his head his fame in this country appears to hang on his matchless gunplay and his enmity toward outlaw chiefs ive heard many a rancher say i wish to god that buck duane would drift out here id give a hundred pesos to see him and poggin meet its a singular thing stranger how jealous these great outlaws are of each other  yes indeed all about them is singular replied duane has cheseldines gang been busy lately  no this section has been free of rustling for months though theres unexplained movements of stock probably all the stock thats being shipped now was rustled long ago cheseldine works over a wide section too wide for news to travel inside of weeks then sometimes hes not heard of at all for a spell these lulls are pretty surely indicative of a big storm sooner or later and cheseldines deals as they grow fewer and farther between certainly get bigger more daring there are some people who think cheseldine had nothing to do with the bankrobberies and trainholdups during the last few years in this country but thats poor reasoning the jobs have been too well done too surely covered to be the work of greasers or ordinary outlaws  whats your view of the outlook hows all this going to wind up will the outlaw ever be driven out asked duane  never there will always be outlaws along the rio grande all the armies in the world couldnt comb the wild brakes of that fifteen hundred miles of river but the sway of the outlaw such as is enjoyed by these great leaders will sooner or later be past the criminal element flock to the southwest but not so thick and fast as the pioneers besides the outlaws kill themselves and the ranchers are slowly rising in wrath if not in action that will come soon if they only had a leader to start the fight but that will come theres talk of vigilantes the same hat were organized in california and are now in force in idaho so far its only talk but the time will come and the days of cheseldine and poggin are numbered  duane went to bed that night exceedingly thoughtful the long trail was growing hot this voluble colonel had given him new ideas it came to duane in surprise that he was famous along the upper rio grande assuredly he would not long be able to conceal his identity he had no doubt that he would soon meet the chiefs of this clever and bold rustling gang he could not decide whether he would be safer unknown or known in the latter case his one chance lay in the fatality connected with his name in his power to look it and act it duane had never dreamed of any sleuthhound tendency in his nature but now he felt something like one above all others his mind fixed on pogginpoggin the brute the executor of cheseldines will but mostly upon poggin the gunman this in itself was a warning to duane he felt terrible forces at work within him there was the stern and indomitable resolve to make macnellys boast good to the governor of the stateto break up cheseldines gang yet this was not in duanes mind before a strange grim and deadly instinctwhich he had to drive away for fear he would find in it a passion to kill poggin not for the state nor for his word to macnelly but for himself had his fathers blood and the hard years made duane the kind of man who instinctively wanted to meet poggin he was sworn to macnellys service and he fought himself to keep that and that only in his mind  duane ascertained that fairdale was situated two days ride from bradford toward the north there was a stage which made the journey twice a week  next morning duane mounted his horse and headed for fairdale he rode leisurely as he wanted to learn all he could about the country there were few ranches the farther he traveled the better grazing he encountered and strange to note the fewer herds of cattle  it was just sunset when he made out a cluster of adobe houses that marked the halfway point between bradford and fairdale here duane had learned was stationed a comfortable inn for wayfarers  when he drew up before the inn the landlord and his family and a number of loungers greeted him laconically  beat the stage in hey remarked one  there she comes now said another joel shore is drivin tonight  far down the road duane saw a cloud of dust and horses and a lumbering coach when he had looked after the needs of his horse he returned to the group before the inn they awaited the stage with that interest common to isolated people presently it rolled up a large mudbespattered and dusty vehicle littered with baggage on top and tied on behind a number of passengers alighted three of whom excited duanes interest one was a tall dark strikinglooking man and the other two were ladies wearing long gray ulsters and veils duane heard the proprietor of the inn address the man as colonel longstreth and as the party entered the inn duanes quick ears caught a few words which acquainted him with the fact that longstreth was the mayor of fairdale  duane passed inside himself to learn that supper would soon be ready at table he found himself opposite the three who had attracted his attention  ruth i envy the lucky cowboys longstreth was saying  ruth was a curlyheaded girl with gray or hazel eyes  im crazy to ride bronchos she said  duane gathered she was on a visit to western texas the other girls deep voice sweet like a bell made duane regard her closer she had beauty as he had never seen it in another woman she was slender but the development of her figure gave duane the impression she was twenty years old or more she had the most exquisite hands duane had ever seen she did not resemble the colonel who was evidently her father she looked tired quiet even melancholy a finely chiseled oval face clear olivetinted skin long eyes set wide apart and black as coal beautiful to look into a slender straight nose that had something nervous and delicate about it which made duane think of a thoroughbred and a mouth by no means small but perfectly curved and hair like jetall these features proclaimed her beauty to duane duane believed her a descendant of one of the old french families of eastern texas he was sure of it when she looked at him drawn by his rather persistent gaze there were pride fire and passion in her eyes duane felt himself blushing in confusion his stare at her had been rude perhaps but unconscious how many years had passed since he had seen a girl like her thereafter he kept his eyes upon his plate yet he seemed to be aware that he had aroused the interest of both girls  after supper the guests assembled in a big sittingroom where an open fire place with blazing mesquite sticks gave out warmth and cheery glow duane took a seat by a table in the corner and finding a paper began to read presently when he glanced up he saw two darkfaced men strangers who had not appeared before and were peering in from a doorway when they saw duane had observed them they stepped back out of sight  it flashed over duane that the strangers acted suspiciously in texas in the seventies it was always bad policy to let strangers go unheeded duane pondered a moment then he went out to look over these two men the doorway opened into a patio and across that was a little dingy dimlighted barroom here duane found the innkeeper dispensing drinks to the two strangers they glanced up when he entered and one of them whispered he imagined he had seen one of them before in texas where outdoor men were so rough bronzed bold and sometimes grim of aspect it was no easy task to pick out the crooked ones but duanes years on the border had augmented a natural instinct or gift to read character or at least to sense the evil in men and he knew at once that these strangers were dishonest  hey somethin one of them asked leering both looked duane up and down  no thanks i dont drink duane replied and returned their scrutiny with interest hows tricks in the big bend  both men stared it had taken only a close glance for duane to recognize a type of ruffian most frequently met along the river these strangers had that stamp and their surprise proved he was right here the innkeeper showed signs of uneasiness and seconded the surprise of his customers no more was said at the instant and the two rather hurriedly went out  say boss do you know those fellows duane asked the innkeeper  nope  which way did they come  now i think of it them fellers rid in from both corners today he replied and he put both hands on the bar and looked at duane they nooned heah comin from bradford they said an trailed in after the stage  when duane returned to the sittingroom colonel longstreth was absent also several of the other passengers miss ruth sat in the chair he had vacated and across the table from her sat miss longstreth duane went directly to them  excuse me said duane addressing them i want to tell you there are a couple of roughlooking men here ive just seen them they mean evil tell your father to be careful lock your doorsbar your windows tonight  oh cried ruth very low ray do you hear  thank you well be careful said miss longstreth gracefully the rich color had faded in her cheek i saw those men watching you from that door they had such bright black eyes is there really dangerhere  i think so was duanes reply  soft swift steps behind him preceded a harsh voice hands up  no man quicker than duane to recognize the intent in those words his hands shot up miss ruth uttered a little frightened cry and sank into her chair miss longstreth turned white her eyes dilated both girls were staring at some one behind duane  turn around ordered the harsh voice  the big dark stranger the bearded one who had whispered to his comrade in the barroom and asked duane to drink had him covered with a cocked gun he strode forward his eyes gleaming pressed the gun against him and with his other hand dove into his inside coat pocket and tore out his roll of bills then he reached low at duanes hip felt his gun and took it then he slapped the other hip evidently in search of another weapon that done he backed away wearing an expression of fiendish satisfaction that made duane think he was only a common thief a novice at this kind of game  his comrade stood in the door with a gun leveled at two other men who stood there frightened speechless  git a move on bill called this fellow and he took a hasty glance backward a stamp of hoofs came from outside of course the robbers had horses waiting the one called bill strode across the room and with brutal careless haste began to prod the two men with his weapon and to search them the robber in the doorway called rustle and disappeared  duane wondered where the innkeeper was and colonel longstreth and the other two passengers the bearded robber quickly got through with his searching and from his growls duane gathered he had not been well remunerated then he wheeled once more duane had not moved a muscle stood perfectly calm with his arms high the robber strode back with his bloodshot eyes fastened upon the girls miss longstreth never flinched but the little girl appeared about to faint  dont yap there he said low and hard he thrust the gun close to ruth then duane knew for sure that he was no knight of the road but a plain cutthroat robber danger always made duane exult in a kind of cold glow but now something hot worked within him he had a little gun in his pocket the robber had missed it and he began to calculate chances  any money jewelry diamonds ordered the ruffian fiercely  miss ruth collapsed then he made at miss longstreth she stood with her hands at her breast evidently the robber took this position to mean that she had valuables concealed there but duane fancied she had instinctively pressed her hands against a throbbing heart  come out with it he said harshly reaching for her  dont dare touch me she cried her eyes ablaze she did not move she had nerve  it made duane thrill he saw he was going to get a chance waiting had been a science with him but here it was hard miss ruth had fainted and that was well miss longstreth had fight in her which fact helped duane yet made injury possible to her she eluded two lunges the man made at her then his rough hand caught her waist and with one pull ripped it asunder exposing her beautiful shoulder white as snow  she cried out the prospect of being robbed or even killed had not shaken miss longstreths nerve as had this brutal tearing off of half her waist  the ruffian was only turned partially away from duane for himself he could have waited no longer but for her that gun was still held dangerously upward close to her duane watched only that then a bellow made him jerk his head colonel longstreth stood in the doorway in a magnificent rage he had no weapon strange how he showed no fear he bellowed something again  duanes shifting glance caught the robbers sudden movement it was a kind of start he seemed stricken duane expected him to shoot longstreth instead the hand that clutched miss longstreths torn waist loosened its hold the other hand with its cocked weapon slowly dropped till it pointed to the floor that was duanes chance  swift as a flash he drew his gun and fired thud went his bullet and he could not tell on the instant whether it hit the robber or went into the ceiling then the robbers gun boomed harmlessly he fell with blood spurting over his face duane realized he had hit him but the small bullet had glanced  miss longstreth reeled and might have fallen had duane not supported her it was only a few steps to a couch to which he half led half carried her then he rushed out of the room across the patio through the bar to the yard nevertheless he was cautious in the gloom stood a saddled horse probably the one belonging to the fellow he had shot his comrade had escaped returning to the sittingroom duane found a condition approaching pandemonium  the innkeeper rushed in pitchfork in hands evidently he had been out at the barn he was now shouting to find out what had happened joel the stagedriver was trying to quiet the men who had been robbed the woman wife of one of the men had come in and she had hysterics the girls were still and white the robber bill lay where he had fallen and duane guessed he had made a fair shot after all and lastly the thing that struck duane most of all was longstreths rage he never saw such passion like a caged lion longstreth stalked and roared there came a quieter moment in which the innkeeper shrilly protested  man whatre you ravin aboot nobodys hurt an thets lucky i swear to god i hadnt nothin to do with them fellers  i ought to kill you anyhow replied longstreth and his voice now astounded duane it was so full of power  upon examination duane found that his bullet had furrowed the robbers temple torn a great piece out of his scalp and as duane had guessed had glanced he was not seriously injured and already showed signs of returning consciousness  drag him out of here ordered longstreth and he turned to his daughter  before the innkeeper reached the robber duane had secured the money and gun taken from him and presently recovered the property of the other men joel helped the innkeeper carry the injured man somewhere outside  miss longstreth was sitting white but composed upon the couch where lay miss ruth who evidently had been carried there by the colonel duane did not think she had wholly lost consciousness and now she lay very still with eyes dark and shadowy her face pallid and wet the colonel now that he finally remembered his womenfolk seemed to be gentle and kind he talked soothingly to miss ruth made light of the adventure said she must learn to have nerve out here where things happened  can i be of any service asked duane solicitously  thanks i guess theres nothing you can do talk to these frightened girls while i go see whats to be done with that thickskulled robber he replied and telling the girls that there was no more danger he went out  miss longstreth sat with one hand holding her torn waist in place the other she extended to duane he took it awkwardly and he felt a strange thrill  you saved my life she said in grave sweet seriousness  no no duane exclaimed he might have struck you hurt you but no more  i saw murder in his eyes he thought i had jewels under my dress i couldnt bear his touch the beast id have fought surely my life was in peril  did you kill him asked miss ruth who lay listening  oh no hes not badly hurt  im very glad hes alive said miss longstreth shuddering  my intention was bad enough duane went on it was a ticklish place for me you see he was half drunk and i was afraid his gun might go off fool careless he was  yet you say you didnt save me miss longstreth returned quickly  well let it go at that duane responded i saved you something  tell me all about it asked miss ruth who was fast recovering  rather embarrassed duane briefly told the incident from his point of view  then you stood there all the time with your hands up thinking of nothingwatching for nothing except a little moment when you might draw your gun asked miss ruth  i guess thats about it he replied  cousin said miss longstreth thoughtfully it was fortunate for us that this gentleman happened to be here papa scoutslaughs at danger he seemed to think there was no danger yet he raved after it came  go with us all the way to fairdaleplease asked miss ruth sweetly offering her hand i am ruth herbert and this is my cousin ray longstreth  im traveling that way replied duane in great confusion he did not know how to meet the situation  colonel longstreth returned then and after bidding duane a good night which seemed rather curt by contrast to the graciousness of the girls he led them away  before going to bed duane went outside to take a look at the injured robber and perhaps to ask him a few questions to duanes surprise he was gone and so was his horse the innkeeper was dumfounded he said that he left the fellow on the floor in the barroom  had he come to inquired duane  sure he asked for whisky  did he say anything else  not to me i heard him talkin to the father of them girls  you mean colonel longstreth  i reckon he sure was some riled wasnt he jest as if i was to blame fer that twobit of a holdup  what did you make of the old gents rage asked duane watching the innkeeper he scratched his head dubiously he was sincere and duane believed in his honesty  wal im doggoned if i know what to make of it but i reckon hes either crazy or got more nerve than most texans  more nerve maybe duane replied show me a bed now innkeeper  once in bed in the dark duane composed himself to think over the several events of the evening he called up the details of the holdup and carefully revolved them in mind the colonels wrath under circumstances where almost any texan would have been cool nonplussed duane and he put it down to a choleric temperament he pondered long on the action of the robber when longstreths bellow of rage burst in upon him this ruffian as bold and mean a type as duane had ever encountered had from some cause or other been startled from whatever point duane viewed the mans strange indecision he could come to only one conclusionhis start his check his fear had been that of recognition duane compared this effect with the suddenly acquired sense he had gotten of colonel longstreths powerful personality why had that desperate robber lowered his gun and stood paralyzed at sight and sound of the mayor of fairdale this was not answerable there might have been a number of reasons all to colonel longstreths credit but duane could not understand longstreth had not appeared to see danger for his daughter even though she had been roughly handled and had advanced in front of a cocked gun duane probed deep into this singular fact and he brought to bear on the thing all his knowledge and experience of violent texas life and he found that the instant colonel longstreth had appeared on the scene there was no further danger threatening his daughter why that likewise duane could not answer then his rage duane concluded had been solely at the idea of his daughter being assaulted by a robber this deduction was indeed a thoughtdisturber but duane put it aside to crystallize and for more careful consideration  next morning duane found that the little town was called sanderson it was larger than he had at first supposed he walked up the main street and back again just as he arrived some horsemen rode up to the inn and dismounted and at this juncture the longstreth party came out duane heard colonel longstreth utter an exclamation then he saw him shake hands with a tall man longstreth looked surprised and angry and he spoke with force but duane could not hear what it was he said the fellow laughed yet somehow he struck duane as sullen until suddenly he espied miss longstreth then his face changed and he removed his sombrero duane went closer  floyd did you come with the teams asked longstreth sharply  not me i rode a horse good and hard was the reply  humph ill have a word to say to you later then longstreth turned to his daughter ray heres the cousin ive told you about you used to play with him ten years agofloyd lawson floyd my daughterand my niece ruth herbert  duane always scrutinized every one he met and now with a dangerous game to play with a consciousness of longstreths unusual and significant personality he bent a keen and searching glance upon this floyd lawson  he was under thirty yet gray at his templesdark smoothshaven with lines left by wildness dissipation shadows under dark eyes a mouth strong and bitter and a square china reckless careless handsome sinister face strangely losing the hardness when he smiled the grace of a gentleman clung round him seemed like an echo in his mellow voice duane doubted not that he like many a young man had drifted out to the frontier where rough and wild life had wrought sternly but had not quite effaced the mark of good family  colonel longstreth apparently did not share the pleasure of his daughter and his niece in the advent of this cousin something hinged on this meeting duane grew intensely curious but as the stage appeared ready for the journey he had no further opportunity to gratify it    chapter xvi  duane followed the stage through the town out into the open on to a wide hardpacked road showing years of travel it headed northwest to the left rose a range of low bleak mountains he had noted yesterday and to the right sloped the mesquitepatched sweep of ridge and flat the driver pushed his team to a fast trot which gait surely covered ground rapidly  the stage made three stops in the forenoon one at a place where the horses could be watered the second at a chuckwagon belonging to cowboys who were riding after stock and the third at a small cluster of adobe and stone houses constituting a hamlet the driver called longstreth named after the colonel from that point on to fairdale there were only a few ranches each one controlling great acreage  early in the afternoon from a ridgetop duane sighted fairdale a green patch in the mass of gray for the barrens of texas it was indeed a fair sight but he was more concerned with its remoteness from civilization than its beauty at that time in the early seventies when the vast western third of texas was a wilderness the pioneer had done wonders to settle there and establish places like fairdale  it needed only a glance for duane to pick out colonel longstreths ranch the house was situated on the only elevation around fairdale and it was not high nor more than a few minutes walk from the edge of the town it was a low flatroofed structure made of red adobe bricks and covered what appeared to be fully an acre of ground all was green about it except where the fenced corrals and numerous barns or sheds showed gray and red  duane soon reached the shady outskirts of fairdale and entered the town with mingled feelings of curiosity eagerness and expectation the street he rode down was a main one and on both sides of the street was a solid row of saloons resorts hotels saddled horses stood hitched all along the sidewalk in two long lines with a buckboard and team here and there breaking the continuity this block was busy and noisy  from all outside appearances fairdale was no different from other frontier towns and duanes expectations were scarcely realized as the afternoon was waning he halted at a little inn a boy took charge of his horse duane questioned the lad about fairdale and gradually drew to the subject most in mind  colonel longstreth has a big outfit eh  reckon he has replied the lad doan know how many cowboys theyre always comin and goin i aint acquainted with half of them  much movement of stock these days  stocks always movin he replied with a queer look  rustlers  but he did not follow up that look with the affirmative duane expected  lively place i hearfairdale is  aint so lively as sanderson but its bigger  yes i heard it was fellow down there was talking about two cowboys who were arrested  sure i heered all about that joe bean an brick higginsthey belong heah but they aint heah much longstreths boys  duane did not want to appear overinquisitive so he turned the talk into other channels  after getting supper duane strolled up and down the main street when darkness set in he went into a hotel bought cigars sat around and watched then he passed out and went into the next place this was of rough crude exterior but the inside was comparatively pretentious and ablaze with lights it was full of men coming and goinga dustybooted crowd that smelled of horses and smoke duane sat down for a while with wide eyes and open ears then he hunted up the bar where most of the guests had been or were going he found a great square room lighted by six huge lamps a bar at one side and all the floorspace taken up by tables and chairs this was the only gambling place of any size in southern texas in which he had noted the absence of mexicans there was some cardplaying going on at this moment duane stayed in there for a while and knew that strangers were too common in fairdale to be conspicuous then he returned to the inn where he had engaged a room  duane sat down on the steps of the dingy little restaurant two men were conversing inside and they had not noticed duane  laramie whats the strangers name asked one  he didnt say replied the other  sure was a strappin big man struck me a little odd he did no cattleman him howd you size him  well like one of them cool easy quiet texans whos been lookin for a man for yearsto kill him when he found him  right you are laramie and between you an me i hope hes lookin for long  ssh interrupted laramie you must be half drunk to go talkie that way  thereafter they conversed in too low a tone for duane to hear and presently laramies visitor left duane went inside and making himself agreeable began to ask casual questions about fairdale laramie was not communicative  duane went to his room in a thoughtful frame of mind had laramies visitor meant he hoped some one had come to kill longstreth duane inferred just that from the interrupted remark there was something wrong about the mayor of fairdale duane felt it and he felt also if there was a crooked and dangerous man it was this floyd lawson the innkeeper laramie would be worth cultivating and last in duanes thoughts that night was miss longstreth he could not help thinking of herhow strangely the meeting with her had affected him it made him remember that longpast time when girls had been a part of his life what a sad and dark and endless void lay between that past and the present he had no right even to dream of a beautiful woman like ray longstreth that conviction however did not dispel her indeed it seemed perversely to make her grow more fascinating duane grew conscious of a strange unaccountable hunger a something that was like a pang in his breast  next day he lounged about the inn he did not make any overtures to the taciturn proprietor duane had no need of hurry now he contented himself with watching and listening and at the close of that day he decided fairdale was what macnelly had claimed it to be and that he was on the track of an unusual adventure the following day he spent in much the same way though on one occasion he told laramie he was looking for a man the innkeeper grew a little less furtive and reticent after that he would answer casual queries and it did not take duane long to learn that laramie had seen better daysthat he was now broken bitter and hard some one had wronged him  several days passed duane did not succeed in getting any closer to laramie but he found the idlers on the corners and in front of the stores unsuspicious and willing to talk it did not take him long to find out that fairdale stood parallel with huntsville for gambling drinking and fighting the street was always lined with dusty saddled horses the town full of strangers money appeared more abundant than in any place duane had ever visited and it was spent with the abandon that spoke forcibly of easy and crooked acquirement duane decided that sanderson bradford and ord were but notorious outposts to this fairdale which was a secret center of rustlers and outlaws and what struck duane strangest of all was the fact that longstreth was mayor here and held court daily duane knew intuitively before a chance remark gave him proof that this court was a sham a farce and he wondered if it were not a blind this wonder of his was equivalent to suspicion of colonel longstreth and duane reproached himself then he realized that the reproach was because of the daughter inquiry had brought him the fact that ray longstreth had just come to live with her father longstreth had originally been a planter in louisiana where his family had remained after his advent in the west he was a rich rancher he owned half of fairdale he was a cattlebuyer on a large scale floyd lawson was his lieutenant and associate in deals  on the afternoon of the fifth day of duanes stay in fairdale he returned to the inn from his usual stroll and upon entering was amazed to have a roughlooking young fellow rush by him out of the door inside laramie was lying on the floor with a bloody bruise on his face he did not appear to be dangerously hurt  bo snecker he hit me and went after the cashdrawer said laramie laboring to his feet  are you hurt much queried duane  i guess not but bo neednt to have soaked me ive been robbed before without that  well ill take a look after bo replied duane  he went out and glanced down the street toward the center of the town he did not see any one he could take for the innkeepers assailant then he looked up the street and he saw the young fellow about a block away hurrying along and gazing back  duane yelled for him to stop and started to go after him snecker broke into a run then duane set out to overhaul him there were two motives in duanes actionone of anger and the other a desire to make a friend of this man laramie whom duane believed could tell him much  duane was light on his feet and he had a giant stride he gained rapidly upon snecker who turning this way and that could not get out of sight then he took to the open country and ran straight for the green hill where longstreths house stood duane had almost caught snecker when he reached the shrubbery and trees and there eluded him but duane kept him in sight in the shade on the paths and up the road into the courtyard and he saw snecker go straight for longstreths house  duane was not to be turned back by that singular as it was he did not stop to consider it seemed enough to know that fate had directed him to the path of this rancher longstreth duane entered the first open door on that side of the court it opened into a corridor which led into a plaza it had wide smooth stone porches and flowers and shrubbery in the center duane hurried through to burst into the presence of miss longstreth and a number of young people evidently she was giving a little party  lawson stood leaning against one of the pillars that supported the porch roof at sight of duane his face changed remarkably expressing amazement consternation then fear  in the quick ensuing silence miss longstreth rose white as her dress the young women present stared in astonishment if they were not equally perturbed there were cowboys present who suddenly grew intent and still by these things duane gathered that his appearance must be disconcerting he was panting he wore no hat or coat his big gunsheath showed plainly at his hip  sight of miss longstreth had an unaccountable effect upon duane he was plunged into confusion for the moment he saw no one but her  miss longstrethi cameto searchyour house panted duane  he hardly knew what he was saying yet the instant he spoke he realized that that should have been the last thing for him to say he had blundered but he was not used to women and this darkeyed girl made him thrill and his heart beat thickly and his wits go scattering  search my house exclaimed miss longstreth and red succeeded the white in her cheeks she appeared astonished and angry what for why how dare you this is unwarrantable  a manbo sneckerassaulted and robbed jim laramie replied duane hurriedly i chased snecker heresaw him run into the house  here oh sir you must be mistaken we have seen no one in the absence of my father im mistress here ill not permit you to search  lawson appeared to come out of his astonishment he stepped forward  ray dont be bothered now he said to his cousin this fellows making a bluff ill settle him see here mister you clear out  i want snecker hes here and im going to get him replied duane quietly  bah thats all a bluff sneered lawson im on to your game you just wanted an excuse to break in hereto see my cousin again when you saw the company you invented that excuse now be off or itll be the worse for you  duane felt his face burn with a tide of hot blood almost he felt that he was guilty of such motive had he not been unable to put this ray longstreth out of his mind there seemed to be scorn in her eyes now and somehow that checked his embarrassment  miss longstreth will you let me search the house he asked  no  theni regret to sayill do so without your permission  youll not dare she flashed she stood erect her bosom swelling  pardon me yes i will  who are you she demanded suddenly  im a texas ranger replied duane  a texas ranger she echoed  floyd lawsons dark face turned pale  miss longstreth i dont need warrants to search houses said duane im sorry to annoy you id prefer to have your permission a ruffian has taken refuge herein your fathers house hes hidden somewhere may i look for him  if you are indeed a ranger  duane produced his papers miss longstreth haughtily refused to look at them  miss longstreth ive come to make fairdale a safer cleaner better place for women and children i dont wonder at your resentment but to doubt meinsult me some day you may be sorry  floyd lawson made a violent motion with his hands  all stuff cousin go on with your party ill take a couple of cowboys and go with thisthis texas ranger  thanks said duane coolly as he eyed lawson perhaps youll be able to find snecker quicker than i could  what do you mean demanded lawson and now he grew livid evidently he was a man of fierce quick passions  dont quarrel said miss longstreth floyd you go with him please hurry ill be nervous tillthe mans found or youre sure theres not one  they started with several cowboys to search the house they went through the rooms searching calling out peering into dark places it struck duane more than forcibly that lawson did all the calling he was hurried too tried to keep in the lead duane wondered if he knew his voice would be recognized by the hiding man be that as it might it was duane who peered into a dark corner and then with a gun leveled said come out  he came forth into the flarea tall slim darkfaced youth wearing sombrero blouse and trousers duane collared him before any of the others could move and held the gun close enough to make him shrink but he did not impress duane as being frightened just then nevertheless he had a clammy face the pallid look of a man who had just gotten over a shock he peered into duanes face then into that of the cowboy next to him then into lawsons and if ever in duanes life he beheld relief it was then that was all duane needed to know but he meant to find out more if he could  whore you asked duane quietly  bo snecker he said  whatd you hide here for  he appeared to grow sullen  reckoned id be as safe in longstreths as anywheres  ranger whatll you do with him lawson queried as if uncertain now the capture was made  ill see to that replied duane and he pushed snecker in front of him out into the court  duane had suddenly conceived the idea of taking snecker before mayor longstreth in the court  when duane arrived at the hall where court was held there were other men there a dozen or more and all seemed excited evidently news of duane had preceded him longstreth sat at a table up on a platform near him sat a thickset grizzled man with deep eyes and this was hanford owens county judge to the right stood a tall angular yellowfaced fellow with a drooping sandy mustache conspicuous on his vest was a huge silver shield this was gorsech one of longstreths sheriffs there were four other men whom duane knew by sight several whose faces were familiar and half a dozen strangers all dusty horsemen  longstreth pounded hard on the table to be heard mayor or not he was unable at once to quell the excitement gradually however it subsided and from the last few utterances before quiet was restored duane gathered that he had intruded upon some kind of a meeting in the hall  whatd you break in here for demanded longstreth  isnt this the court arent you the mayor of fairdale interrogated duane his voice was clear and loud almost piercing  yes replied longstreth like flint he seemed yet duane felt his intense interest  ive arrested a criminal said duane  arrested a criminal ejaculated longstreth you whore you  im a ranger replied duane  a significant silence ensued  i charge snecker with assault on laramie and attempted robberyif not murder hes had a shady past here as this court will know if it keeps a record  whats this i hear about you bo get up and speak for yourself said longstreth gruffly  snecker got up not without a furtive glance at duane and he had shuffled forward a few steps toward the mayor he had an evil front but not the boldness even of a rustler  it aint so longstreth he began loudly i went in laramies place fer grub some feller i never seen before come in from the hall an hit laramie an wrestled him on the floor i went out then this big ranger chased me an fetched me here i didnt do nothin this rangers hankerin to arrest somebody thets my hunch longstreth  longstreth said something in an undertone to judge owens and that worthy nodded his great bushy head  bo youre discharged said longstreth bluntly now the rest of you clear out of here  he absolutely ignored the ranger that was his rebuff to duanehis slap in the face to an interfering ranger service if longstreth was crooked he certainly had magnificent nerve duane almost decided he was above suspicion but his nonchalance his air of finality his authoritative assurancethese to duanes keen and practiced eyes were in significant contrast to a certain tenseness of line about his mouth and a slow paling of his olive skin in that momentary lull duanes scrutiny of longstreth gathered an impression of the mans intense curiosity  then the prisoner snecker with a cough that broke the spell of silence shuffled a couple of steps toward the door  hold on called duane the call halted snecker as if it had been a bullet  longstreth i saw snecker attack laramie said duane his voice still ringing what has the court to say to that  the court has this to say west of the pecos well not aid any ranger service we dont want you out here fairdale doesnt need you  thats a lie longstreth retorted duane ive letters from fairdale citizens all begging for ranger service  longstreth turned white the veins corded at his temples he appeared about to burst into rage he was at a loss for quick reply  floyd lawson rushed in and up to the table the blood showed black and thick in his face his utterance was incoherent his uncontrollable outbreak of temper seemed out of all proportion to any cause he should reasonably have had for anger longstreth shoved him back with a curse and a warning glare  wheres your warrant to arrest snecker shouted longstreth  i dont need warrants to make arrests longstreth youre ignorant of the power of texas rangers  youll come none of your damned ranger stunts out here ill block you  that passionate reply of longstreths was the signal duane had been waiting for he had helped on the crisis he wanted to force longstreths hand and show the town his stand  duane backed clear of everybody  men i call on you all cried duane piercingly i call on you to witness the arrest of a criminal prevented by longstreth mayor of fairdale it will be recorded in the report to the adjutantgeneral at austin longstreth youll never prevent another arrest  longstreth sat white with working jaw  longstreth youve shown your hand said duane in a voice that carried far and held those who heard any honest citizen of fairdale can now see whats plainyours is a damn poor hand youre going to hear me call a spade a spade in the two years youve been mayor youve never arrested one rustler strange when fairdales a nest for rustlers youve never sent a prisoner to del rio let alone to austin you have no jail there have been nine murders during your officeinnumerable streetfights and holdups not one arrest but you have ordered arrests for trivial offenses and have punished these out of all proportion there have been lawsuits in your courtsuits over waterrights cattle deals property lines strange how in these lawsuits you or lawson or other men close to you were always involved strange how it seems the law was stretched to favor your interest  duane paused in his cold ringing speech in the silence both outside and inside the hall could be heard the deep breathing of agitated men longstreth was indeed a study yet did he betray anything but rage at this interloper  longstreth heres plain talk for you and fairdale went on duane i dont accuse you and your court of dishonesty i say strange law here has been a farce the motive behind all this laxity isnt plain to meyet but i call your hand    chapter xvii  duane left the hall elbowed his way through the crowd and went down the street he was certain that on the faces of some men he had seen illconcealed wonder and satisfaction he had struck some kind of a hot trait and he meant to see where it led it was by no means unlikely that cheseldine might be at the other end duane controlled a mounting eagerness but ever and anon it was shot through with a remembrance of ray longstreth he suspected her father of being not what he pretended he might very probably would bring sorrow and shame to this young woman the thought made him smart with pain she began to haunt him and then he was thinking more of her beauty and sweetness than of the disgrace he might bring upon her some strange emotion long locked inside duanes heart knocked to be heard to be let out he was troubled  upon returning to the inn he found laramie there apparently none the worse for his injury  how are you laramie he asked  reckon im feelin as well as could be expected replied laramie his head was circled by a bandage that did not conceal the lump where he had been struck he looked pale but was bright enough  that was a good crack snecker gave you remarked duane  i aint accusin bo remonstrated laramie with eyes that made duane thoughtful  well i accuse him i caught himtook him to longstreths court but they let him go  laramie appeared to be agitated by this intimation of friendship  see here laramie went on duane in some parts of texas its policy to be closemouthed policy and healthpreserving between ourselves i want you to know i lean on your side of the fence  laramie gave a quick start presently duane turned and frankly met his gaze he had startled laramie out of his habitual set taciturnity but even as he looked the light that might have been amaze and joy faded out of his face leaving it the same old mask still duane had seen enough like a bloodhound he had a scent  talking about work laramie whod you say snecker worked for  i didnt say  well say so now cant you laramie youre powerful peevish today its that bump on your head who does snecker work for  when he works at all which sure aint often he rides for longstreth  humph seems to me that longstreths the whole circus round fairdale i was some sore the other day to find i was losing good money at longstreths faro game sure if id won i wouldnt have been soreha ha but i was surprised to hear some one say longstreth owned the hope so joint  he owns considerable property hereabouts replied laramie constrainedly  humph again laramie like every other fellow i meet in this town youre afraid to open your trap about longstreth get me straight laramie i dont care a damn for colonel mayor longstreth and for cause id throw a gun on him just as quick as on any rustler in pecos  talks cheap replied laramie making light of his bluster but the red was deeper in his face  sure i know that duane said and usually i dont talk then its not well known that longstreth owns the hope so  reckon its known in pecos all right but longstreths name isnt connected with the hope so blandy runs the place  that blandy his faro games crooked or im a locoed bronch not that we dont have lots of crooked farodealers a fellow can stand for them but blandys mean backhanded never looks you in the eyes that hope so place ought to be run by a good fellow like you laramie  thanks replied he and duane imagined his voice a little husky didnt you hear i used to run it  no did you duane said quickly  i reckon i built the place made additions twice owned it for eleven years  well ill be doggoned it was indeed duanes turn to be surprised and with the surprise came a glimmering im sorry youre not there now did you sell out  no just lost the place  laramie was bursting for relief nowto talk to tell sympathy had made him soft  it was two years agotwo years last march he went on i was in a big cattle deal with longstreth we got the stockan my share eighteen hundred head was rustled off i owed longstreth he pressed me it come to a lawsuitan iwas ruined  it hurt duane to look at laramie he was white and tears rolled down his cheeks duane saw the bitterness the defeat the agony of the man he had failed to meet his obligations nevertheless he had been swindled all that he suppressed all that would have been passion had the mans spirit not been broken lay bare for duane to see he had now the secret of his bitterness but the reason he did not openly accuse longstreth the secret of his reticence and fearthese duane thought best to try to learn at some later time  hard luck it certainly was tough duane said but youre a good loser and the wheel turns now laramie heres what i need your advice ive got a little money but before i lose it i want to invest some buy some stock or buy an interest in some ranchers herd what i want you to steer me on is a good square rancher or maybe a couple of ranchers if there happen to be two honest ones ha ha no deals with ranchers who ride in the dark with rustlers ive a hunch fairdale is full of them now laramie youve been here for years sure you must know a couple of men above suspicion  thank god i do he replied feelingly frank morton an si zimmer my friends an neighbors all my prosperous days an friends still you can gamble on frank and si but if you want advice from medont invest money in stock now  why  because any new feller buyin stock these days will be rustled quicker n he can say jack robinson the pioneers the new cattlementhese are easy pickin for the rustlers lord knows all the ranchers are easy enough pickin but the new fellers have to learn the ropes they dont know anythin or anybody an the old ranchers are wise an sore theyd fight if they  what duane put in as he paused if they knew who was rustling the stock  nope  if they had the nerve  not thet so much  what then whatd make them fight  a leader  howdy thar jim boomed a big voice  a man of great bulk with a ruddy merry face entered the room  hello morton replied laramie id introduce you to my guest here but i dont know his name  haw haw thets all right few men out hyar go by their right names  say morton put in duane laramie gave me a hunch youd be a good man to tie to now ive a little money and before i lose it id like to invest it in stock  morton smiled broadly  im on the square duane said bluntly if you fellows never size up your neighbors any better than you have sized mewell you wont get any richer  it was enjoyment for duane to make his remarks to these men pregnant with meaning morton showed his pleasure his interest but his faith held aloof  ive got some money will you let me in on some kind of deal will you start me up as a stockman with a little herd all my own  wal stranger to come out flatfooted youd be foolish to buy cattle now i dont want to take your money an see you lose out better go back across the pecos where the rustlers aint so strong i havent had moren twentyfive hundred herd of stock for ten years the rustlers let me hang on to a breedin herd kind of them aint it  sort of kind all i hear is rustlers morton replied duane with impatience you see i havent ever lived long in a rustlerrun county who heads the gang anyway  morton looked at duane with a curiously amused smile then snapped his big jaw as if to shut in impulsive words  look here morton it stands to reason no matter how strong these rustlers are how hidden their work however involved with supposedly honest menthey cant last  they come with the pioneers an theyll last till thars a single steer left he declared  well if you take that view of circumstances i just figure you as one of the rustlers  morton looked as if he were about to brain duane with the butt of his whip his anger flashed by then evidently as unworthy of him and something striking him as funny he boomed out a laugh  its not so funny duane went on if youre going to pretend a yellow streak what else will i think  pretend he repeated  sure i know men of nerve and here theyre not any different from those in other places i say if you show anything like a lack of sand its all bluff by nature youve got nerve there are a lot of men around fairdale whore afraid of their shadowsafraid to be out after darkafraid to open their mouths but youre not one so i say if you claim these rustlers will last youre pretending lack of nerve just to help the popular idea along for they cant last what you need out here is some new blood savvy what i mean  wal i reckon i do he replied looking as if a storm had blown over him stranger ill look you up the next time i come to town  then he went out  laramie had eyes like flint striking fire  he breathed a deep breath and looked around the room before his gaze fixed again on duane  wal he replied speaking low youve picked the right men now who in the hell are you  reaching into the inside pocket of his buckskin vest duane turned the lining out a starshaped bright silver object flashed as he shoved it pocket and all under jims hard eyes  ranger he whispered cracking the table with his fist you sure rung true to me  laramie do you know whos boss of this secret gang of rustlers hereabouts asked duane bluntly it was characteristic of him to come sharp to the point his voicesomething deep easy cool about himseemed to steady laramie  no replied laramie  does anybody know went on duane  wal i reckon theres not one honest native who knows  but you have your suspicions  we have  give me your idea about this crowd that hangs round the saloonsthe regulars  jest a bad lot replied laramie with the quick assurance of knowledge most of them have been here years others have drifted in some of them work odd times they rustle a few steers steal rob anythin for a little money to drink an gamble jest a bad lot  have you any idea whether cheseldine and his gang are associated with this gang here  lord knows ive always suspected them the same gang none of us ever seen cheseldinean thets strange when knell poggin panhandle smith blossom kane and fletcher they all ride here often no poggin doesnt come often but the others do for thet matter theyre around all over west of the pecos  now im puzzled over this said duane why do menapparently honest menseem to be so closemouthed here is that a fact or only my impression  its a sure fact replied laramie darkly men have lost cattle an property in fairdalelost them honestly or otherwise as hasnt been proved an in some cases when they talkedhinted a littlethey was found dead apparently held up an robbed but dead dead men dont talk thets why were close mouthed  duane felt a dark somber sternness rustling cattle was not intolerable western texas had gone on prospering growing in spite of the hordes of rustlers ranging its vast stretches but a cold secret murderous hold on a little struggling community was something too strange too terrible for men to stand long  the ranger was about to speak again when the clatter of hoofs interrupted him horses halted out in front and one rider got down floyd lawson entered he called for tobacco  if his visit surprised laramie he did not show any evidence but lawson showed rage as he saw the ranger and then a dark glint flitted from the eyes that shifted from duane to laramie and back again duane leaned easily against the counter  say that was a bad break of yours lawson said if you come fooling round the ranch again therell be hell  it seemed strange that a man who had lived west of the pecos for ten years could not see in duane something which forbade that kind of talk it certainly was not nerve lawson showed men of courage were seldom intolerant with the matchless nerve that characterized the great gunmen of the day there was a cool unobtrusive manner a speech brief almost gentle certainly courteous lawson was a hotheaded louisianian of french extraction a man evidently who had never been crossed in anything and who was strong brutal passionate which qualities in the face of a situation like this made him simply a fool  im saying again you used your ranger bluff just to get near ray longstreth lawson sneered mind you if you come up there again therell be hell  youre right but not the kind you think duane retorted his voice sharp and cold  ray longstreth wouldnt stoop to know a dirty bloodtracker like you said lawson hotly he did not seem to have a deliberate intention to rouse duane the man was simply rancorous jealous ill call you right you cheap bluffer you fourflush you damned interfering conceited ranger  lawson ill not take offense because you seem to be championing your beautiful cousin replied duane in slow speech but let me return your compliment youre a fine southerner why youre only a cheap fourflushdamned bullheaded rustler  duane hissed the last word then for him there was the truth in lawsons working passionblackened face  lawson jerked moved meant to draw but how slow duane lunged forward his long arm swept up and lawson staggered backward knocking table and chairs to fall hard in a halfsitting posture against the wall  dont draw warned duane  lawson git away from your gun yelled laramie  but lawson was crazed with fury he tugged at his hip his face corded with purple welts malignant murderous duane kicked the gun out of his hand lawson got up raging and rushed out  laramie lifted his shaking hands  whatd you wing him for he wailed he was drawin on you kickin men like him wont do out here  that bullheaded fool will roar and butt himself with all his gang right into our hands hes just the man ive needed to meet besides shooting him would have been murder  murder exclaimed laramie  yes for me replied duane  that may be truewhoever you arebut if lawsons the man you think he is hell begin thet secret underground bizness why lawson wont sleep of nights now he an longstreth have always been after me  laramie what are your eyes for demanded duane watch out and now here see your friend morton tell him this game grows hot together you approach four or five men you know well and can absolutely trust i may need your help  then duane went from place to place corner to corner bar to bar watching listening recording the excitement had preceded him and speculation was rife he thought best to keep out of it after dark he stole up to longstreths ranch the evening was warm the doors were open and in the twilight the only lamps that had been lit were in longstreths big sittingroom at the far end of the house when a buckboard drove up and longstreth and lawson alighted duane was well hidden in the bushes so well screened that he could get but a fleeting glimpse of longstreth as he went in for all duane could see he appeared to be a calm and quiet man intense beneath the surface with an air of dignity under insult duanes chance to observe lawson was lost they went into the house without speaking and closed the door  at the other end of the porch close under a window was an offset between step and wall and there in the shadow duane hid so duane waited there in the darkness with patience born of many hours of hiding  presently a lamp was lit and duane heard the swish of skirts  somethings happened surely ruth he heard miss longstreth say anxiously papa just met me in the hall and didnt speak he seemed pale worried  cousin floyd looked like a thundercloud said ruth for once he didnt try to kiss me somethings happened well ray this had been a bad day  oh dear ruth what can we do these are wild men floyd makes life miserable for me and he teases you unmer  i dont call it teasing floyd wants to spoon declared ruth emphatically hed run after any woman  a fine compliment to me cousin ruth laughed ray  i dont care replied ruth stubbornly its so hes mushy and when hes been drinking and tries to kiss mei hate him  there were steps on the hall floor  hello girls sounded out lawsons voice minus its usual gaiety  floyd whats the matter asked ray presently i never saw papa as he is tonight nor you soso worried tell me what has happened  well ray we had a jar today replied lawson with a blunt expressive laugh  jar echoed both the girls curiously  we had to submit to a damnable outrage added lawson passionately as if the sound of his voice augmented his feeling listen girls ill tell youall about it he coughed cleared his throat in a way that betrayed he had been drinking  duane sunk deeper into the shadow of his covert and stiffening his muscles for a protected spell of rigidity prepared to listen with all acuteness and intensity just one word from this lawson inadvertently uttered in a moment of passion might be the word duane needed for his clue  it happened at the town hall began lawson rapidly your father and judge owens and i were there in consultation with three ranchers from out of town then that damned ranger stalked in dragging snecker the fellow who hid here in the house he had arrested snecker for alleged assault on a restaurantkeeper named laramie snecker being obviously innocent he was discharged then this ranger began shouting his insults law was a farce in fairdale the court was a farce there was no law your fathers office as mayor should be impeached he made arrests only for petty offenses he was afraid of the rustlers highwaymen murderers he was afraid orhe just let them alone he used his office to cheat ranchers and cattlemen in lawsuits all this the ranger yelled for every one to hear a damnable outrage your father ray insulted in his own court by a rowdy ranger  oh cried ray longstreth in mingled distress and anger  the ranger service wants to rule western texas went on lawson these rangers are all a low set many of them worse than the outlaws they hunt some of them were outlaws and gunfighters before they became rangers this is one of the worst of the lot hes keen intelligent smooth and that makes him more to be feared for he is to be feared he wanted to kill he would kill if your father had made the least move he would have shot him hes a coldnerved devilthe born gunman my god any instant i expected to see your father fall dead at my feet  oh floyd the unspeakable ruffian cried ray longstreth passionately  you see ray this fellow like all rangers seeks notoriety he made that play with snecker just for a chance to rant against your father he tried to inflame all fairdale against him that about the lawsuits was the worst damn him hell make us enemies  what do you care for the insinuations of such a man said ray longstreth her voice now deep and rich with feeling after a moments thought no one will be influenced by them do not worry floyd tell papa not to worry surely after all these years he cant be injured in reputation byby an adventurer  yes he can be injured replied floyd quickly the frontier is a queer place there are many bitter men heremen who have failed at ranching and your father has been wonderfully successful the ranger has dropped poison and itll spread    chapter xviii  strangers rode into fairdale and other hardlooking customers new to duane if not to fairdale helped to create a charged and waiting atmosphere the saloons did unusual business and were never closed respectable citizens of the town were awakened in the early dawn by rowdies carousing in the streets  duane kept pretty close under cover during the day he did not entertain the opinion that the first time he walked downstreet he would be a target for guns things seldom happened that way and when they did happen so it was more accident than design but at night he was not idle he met laramie morton zimmer and others of like character a secret club had been formed and all the members were ready for action duane spent hours at night watching the house where floyd lawson stayed when he was not up at longstreths at night he was visited or at least the house was by strange men who were swift stealthy mysteriousall that kindly disposed friends or neighbors would not have been duane had not been able to recognize any of these night visitors and he did not think the time was ripe for a bold holdingup of one of them nevertheless he was sure such an event would discover lawson or some one in that house to be in touch with crooked men  laramie was right not twentyfour hours after his last talk with duane in which he advised quick action he was found behind the little bar of his restaurant with a bullethole in his breast dead no one could be found who had heard a shot it had been deliberate murder for upon the bar had been left a piece of paper rudely scrawled with a pencil all friends of rangers look for the same  this roused duane his first move however was to bury laramie none of laramies neighbors evinced any interest in the dead man or the unfortunate family he had left duane saw that these neighbors were held in check by fear mrs laramie was ill the shock of her husbands death was hard on her and she had been left almost destitute with five children duane rented a small adobe house on the outskirts of town and moved the family into it then he played the part of provider and nurse and friend  after several days duane went boldly into town and showed that he meant business it was his opinion that there were men in fairdale secretly glad of a rangers presence what he intended to do was food for great speculation a company of militia could not have had the effect upon the wild element of fairdale that duanes presence had it got out that he was a gunman lightning swift on the draw it was death to face him he had killed thirty menwildest rumor of allit was actually said of him he had the gunskill of buck duane or of poggin  at first there had not only been great conjecture among the vicious element but also a very decided checking of all kinds of action calculated to be conspicuous to a keeneyed ranger at the tables at the bars and loungingplaces duane heard the remarks whos thet ranger after whatll he do fust off is he waitin fer somebody whos goin to draw on him fustan go to hell jest about how soon will he be found somewheres full of lead  when it came out somewhere that duane was openly cultivating the honest stayathome citizens to array them in time against the other element then fairdale showed its wolfteeth several times duane was shot at in the dark and once slightly injured rumor had it that poggin the gunman was coming to meet him but the lawless element did not rise up in a mass to slay duane on sight it was not so much that the enemies of the law awaited his next move but just a slowness peculiar to the frontier the ranger was in their midst he was interesting if formidable he would have been welcomed at cardtables at the bars to play and drink with the men who knew they were under suspicion there was a rude kind of good humor even in their open hostility  besides one ranger or a company of rangers could not have held the undivided attention of these men from their games and drinks and quarrels except by some decided move excitement greed appetite were rife in them duane marked however a striking exception to the usual run of strangers he had been in the habit of seeing snecker had gone or was under cover again duane caught a vague rumor of the coming of poggin yet he never seemed to arrive moreover the goingson among the habitues of the resorts and the cowboys who came in to drink and gamble were unusually mild in comparison with former conduct this lull however did not deceive duane it could not last the wonder was that it had lasted so long  duane went often to see mrs laramie and her children one afternoon while he was there he saw miss longstreth and ruth ride up to the door they carried a basket evidently they had heard of mrs laramies trouble duane felt strangely glad but he went into an adjoining room rather than meet them  mrs laramie ive come to see you said miss longstreth cheerfully  the little room was not very light there being only one window and the doors but duane could see plainly enough mrs laramie lay hollowchecked and haggard on a bed once she had evidently been a woman of some comeliness the ravages of trouble and grief were there to read in her worn face it had not however any of the hard and bitter lines that had characterized her husbands  duane wondered considering that longstreth had ruined laramie how mrs laramie was going to regard the daughter of an enemy  so youre granger longstreths girl queried the woman with her bright black eyes fixed on her visitor  yes replied miss longstreth simply this is my cousin ruth herbert weve come to nurse you take care of the children help you in any way youll let us  there was a long silence  well you look a little like longstreth finally said mrs laramie but youre not at all like him you must take after your mother miss longstreth i dont know if i canif i ought accept anything from you your father ruined my husband  yes i know replied the girl sadly thats all the more reason you should let me help you pray dont refuse it willmean so much to me  if this poor stricken woman had any resentment it speedily melted in the warmth and sweetness of miss longstreths manner duanes idea was that the impression of ray longstreths beauty was always swiftly succeeded by that of her generosity and nobility at any rate she had started well with mrs laramie and no sooner had she begun to talk to the children than both they and the mother were won the opening of that big basket was an event poor starved little beggars duanes feelings seemed too easily roused hard indeed would it have gone with jim laramies slayer if he could have laid eyes on him then however miss longstreth and ruth after the nature of tender and practical girls did not appear to take the sad situation to heart the havoc was wrought in that household  the needs now were cheerfulness kindness help actionand these the girls furnished with a spirit that did duane good  mrs laramie who dressed this baby presently asked miss longstreth duane peeped in to see a dilapidated youngster on her knee that sight if any other was needed completed his full and splendid estimate of ray longstreth and wrought strangely upon his heart  the ranger replied mrs laramie  the ranger exclaimed miss longstreth  yes hes taken care of us all sincesince mrs laramie choked  oh so youve had no help but his replied miss longstreth hastily no women too bad ill send some one mrs laramie and ill come myself  itll be good of you went on the older woman you see jim had few friendsthat is right in town and theyve been afraid to help usafraid theyd get what poor jim  thats awful burst out miss longstreth passionately a brave lot of friends mrs laramie dont you worry any more well take care of you here ruth help me whatever is the matter with babys dress  manifestly miss longstreth had some difficulty in subduing her emotion  why its on hind side before declared ruth i guess mr ranger hasnt dressed many babies  he did the best he could said mrs laramie lord only knows what would have become of us  then he isis something more than a ranger queried miss longstreth with a little break in her voice  hes more than i can tell replied mrs laramie he buried jim he paid our debts he fetched us here he bought food for us he cooked for us and fed us he washed and dressed the baby he sat with me the first two nights after jims death when i thought id die myself hes so kind so gentle so patient he has kept me up just by being near sometimes id wake from a doze an seeing him there id know how false were all these tales jim heard about him and believed at first why he plays with the children justjust like any good man might when he has the baby up i just cant believe hes a bloody gunman as they say hes good but he isnt happy he has such sad eyes he looks far off sometimes when the children climb round him they love him his life is sad nobody need tell mehe sees the good in things once he said somebody had to be a ranger well i say thank god for a ranger like him  duane did not want to hear more so he walked into the room  it was thoughtful of you duane said womankind are needed here i could do so little mrs laramie you look better already im glad and heres baby all clean and white baby what a time i had trying to puzzle out the way your clothes went on well mrs laramie didnt i tell youfriends would come so will the brighter side  yes ive more faith than i had replied mrs laramie granger longstreths daughter has come to me there for a while after jims death i thought id sink we have nothing how could i ever take care of my little ones but im gaining courage to  mrs laramie do not distress yourself any more said miss longstreth i shall see you are well cared for i promise you  miss longstreth thats fine exclaimed duane its what id haveexpected of you  it must have been sweet praise to her for the whiteness of her face burned out in a beautiful blush  and its good of you too miss herbert to come added duane let me thank you both im glad i have you girls as allies in part of my lonely task here more than glad for the sake of this good woman and the little ones but both of you be careful about coming here alone theres risk and now ill be going goodby mrs laramie ill drop in again tonight goodby  mr ranger wait called miss longstreth as he went out she was white and wonderful she stepped out of the door close to him  i have wronged you she said impulsively  miss longstreth how can you say that he returned  i believed what my father and floyd lawson said about you now i seei wronged you  you make me very glad but miss longstreth please dont speak of wronging me i have been aa gunman i am a rangerand much said of me is true my duty is hard on otherssometimes on those who are innocent alas but god knows that duty is hard too on me  i did wrong you if you entered my home again i would think it an honor i  pleaseplease dont miss longstreth interrupted duane  but sir my conscience flays me she went on there was no other sound like her voice will you take my hand will you forgive me  she gave it royally while the other was there pressing at her breast duane took the proffered hand he did not know what else to do  then it seemed to dawn upon him that there was more behind this white sweet noble intensity of her than just the making amends for a fancied or real wrong duane thought the man did not live on earth who could have resisted her then  i honor you for your goodness to this unfortunate woman she said and now her speech came swiftly when she was all alone and helpless you were her friend it was the deed of a man but mrs laramie isnt the only unfortunate woman in the world i too am unfortunate ah how i may soon need a friend will you be my friend im so alone im terribly worried i feari fearoh surely ill need a friend soonsoon oh im afraid of what youll find out sooner or later i want to help you let us save life if not honor must i stand aloneall alone will youwill you be her voice failed  it seemed to duane that she must have discovered what he had begun to suspectthat her father and lawson were not the honest ranchers they pretended to be perhaps she knew more her appeal to duane shook him deeply he wanted to help her more than he had ever wanted anything and with the meaning of the tumultuous sweetness she stirred in him there came realization of a dangerous situation  i must be true to my duty he said hoarsely  if you knew me youd know i could never ask you to be false to it  well thenill do anything for you  oh thank you im ashamed that i believed my cousin floyd he liedhe lied im all in the dark strangely distressed my father wants me to go back home floyd is trying to keep me here theyve quarreled oh i know something dreadful will happen i know ill need you ififwill you help me  yes replied duane and his look brought the blood to her face    chapter xix  after supper duane stole out for his usual evenings spying the night was dark without starlight and a stiff wind rustled the leaves duane bent his steps toward the longstreths ranchhouse he had so much to think about that he never knew where the time went this night when he reached the edge of the shrubbery he heard lawsons wellknown footsteps and saw longstreths door open flashing a broad bar of light in the darkness lawson crossed the threshold the door closed and all was dark again outside not a ray of light escaped from the window  little doubt there was that his talk with longstreth would be interesting to duane he tiptoed to the door and listened but could hear only a murmur of voices besides that position was too risky he went round the corner of the house  this side of the big adobe house was of much older construction than the back and larger part there was a narrow passage between the houses leading from the outside through to the patio  this passage now afforded duane an opportunity and he decided to avail himself of it in spite of the very great danger crawling on very stealthily he got under the shrubbery to the entrance of the passage in the blackness a faint streak of light showed the location of a crack in the wall he had to slip in sidewise it was a tight squeeze but he entered without the slightest noise as he progressed the passage grew a very little wider in that direction and that fact gave rise to the thought that in case of a necessary and hurried exit he would do best by working toward the patio it seemed a good deal of time was consumed in reaching a vantagepoint when he did get there the crack he had marked was a foot over his head there was nothing to do but find toeholes in the crumbling walls and by bracing knees on one side back against the other hold himself up once with his eye there he did not care what risk he ran longstreth appeared disturbed he sat stroking his mustache his brow was clouded lawsons face seemed darker more sullen yet lighted by some indomitable resolve  well settle both deals tonight lawson was saying thats what i came for  but suppose i dont choose to talk here protested longstreth impatiently i never before made my house a place to  weve waited long enough this places as good as any youve lost your nerve since that ranger hit the town first now will you give ray to me  floyd you talk like a spoiled boy give ray to you why shes a woman and im finding out that shes got a mind of her own i told you i was willing for her to marry you i tried to persuade her but ray hasnt any use for you now she liked you at first but now she doesnt so what can i do  you can make her marry me replied lawson  make that girl do what she doesnt want to it couldnt be done even if i tried and i dont believe ill try i havent the highest opinion of you as a prospective soninlaw floyd but if ray loved you i would consent wed all go away together before this damned miserable business is out then shed never know and maybe you might be more like you used to be before the west ruined you but as matters stand you fight your own game with her and ill tell you now youll lose  whatd you want to let her come out here for demanded lawson hotly it was a dead mistake ive lost my head over her ill have her or die dont you think if she was my wife id soon pull myself together since she came weve none of us been right and the gang has put up a holler no longstreth weve got to settle things tonight  well we can settle what rays concerned in right now replied longstreth rising come on well ask her see where you stand  they went out leaving the door open duane dropped down to rest himself and to wait he would have liked to hear miss longstreths answer but he could guess what it would be lawson appeared to be all duane had thought him and he believed he was going to find out presently that he was worse  the men seemed to be absent a good while though that feeling might have been occasioned by duanes thrilling interest and anxiety finally he heard heavy steps lawson came in alone he was leadenfaced humiliated then something abject in him gave place to rage he strode the room he cursed then longstreth returned now appreciably calmer duane could not but decide that he felt relief at the evident rejection of lawsons proposal  dont fuss about it floyd he said you see i cant help it were pretty wild out here but i cant rope my daughter and give her to you as i would an unruly steer  longstreth i can make her marry me declared lawson thickly  how  you know the hold i got on youthe deal that made you boss of this rustler gang  it isnt likely id forget replied longstreth grimly  i can go to ray tell her that make her believe id tell it broadcasttell this rangerunless shed marry me  lawson spoke breathlessly with haggard face and shadowed eyes he had no shame he was simply in the grip of passion longstreth gazed with dark controlled fury at this relative in that look duane saw a strong unscrupulous man fallen into evil ways but still a man it betrayed lawson to be the wild and passionate weakling duane seemed to see also how during all the years of association this strong man had upheld the weak one but that time had gone for ever both in intent on longstreths part and in possibility lawson like the great majority of evil and unrestrained men on the border had reached a point where influence was futile reason had degenerated he saw only himself  but floyd rays the one person on earth who must never know im a rustler a thief a redhanded ruler of the worst gang on the border replied longstreth impressively  floyd bowed his head at that as if the significance had just occurred to him but he was not long at a loss  shes going to find it out sooner or later i tell you she knows now theres something wrong out here shes got eyes mark what i say  ray has changed i know but she hasnt any idea yet that her daddys a boss rustler rays concerned about what she calls my duty as mayor also i think shes not satisfied with my explanations in regard to certain property  lawson halted in his restless walk and leaned against the stone mantelpiece he had his hands in his pockets he squared himself as if this was his last stand he looked desperate but on the moment showed an absence of his usual nervous excitement  longstreth that may well be true he said no doubt all you say is true but it doesnt help me i want the girl if i dont get heri reckon well all go to hell  he might have meant anything probably meant the worst he certainly had something more in mind longstreth gave a slight start barely perceptible like the switch of an awakening tiger he sat there head down stroking his mustache almost duane saw his thought he had long experience in reading men under stress of such emotion he had no means to vindicate his judgment but his conviction was that longstreth right then and there decided that the thing to do was to kill lawson for duanes part he wondered that longstreth had not come to such a conclusion before not improbably the advent of his daughter had put longstreth in conflict with himself  suddenly he threw off a somber cast of countenance and he began to talk he talked swiftly persuasively yet duane imagined he was talking to smooth lawsons passion for the moment lawson no more caught the fateful significance of a line crossed a limit reached a decree decided than if he had not been present he was obsessed with himself how duane wondered had a man of his mind ever lived so long and gone so far among the exacting conditions of the southwest the answer was perhaps that longstreth had guided him upheld him protected him the coming of ray longstreth had been the enteringwedge of dissension  youre too impatient concluded longstreth youll ruin any chance of happiness if you rush ray she might be won if you told her who i am shed hate you for ever she might marry you to save me but shed hate you that isnt the way wait play for time be different with her cut out your drinking she despises that lets plan to sell out herestock ranch propertyand leave the country then youd have a show with her  i told you weve got to stick growled lawson the gang wont stand for our going it cant be done unless you want to sacrifice everything  you mean doublecross the men go without their knowing leave them here to face whatever comes  i mean just that  im bad enough but not that bad returned longstreth if i cant get the gang to let me off ill stay and face the music all the same lawson did it ever strike you that most of the deals the last few years have been yours  yes if i hadnt rung them in there wouldnt have been any youve had cold feet and especially since this ranger has been here  well call it cold feet if you like but i call it sense we reached our limit long ago we began by rustling a few cattleat a time when rustling was laughed at but as our greed grew so did our boldness then came the gang the regular trips the one thing and another till before we knew itbefore i knew itwe had shady deals holdups and murders on our record then we had to go on too late to turn back  i reckon weve all said that none of the gang wants to quit they all think and i think we cant be touched we may be blamed but nothing can be proved were too strong  theres where youre dead wrong rejoined longstreth emphatically i imagined that once not long ago i was bullheaded who would ever connect granger longstreth with a rustler gang ive changed my mind ive begun to think ive reasoned out things were crooked and we cant last its the nature of life even here for conditions to grow better the wise deal for us would be to divide equally and leave the country all of us  but you and i have all the stockall the gain protested lawson  ill split mine  i wontthat settles that added lawson instantly  longstreth spread wide his hands as if it was useless to try to convince this man talking had not increased his calmness and he now showed more than impatience a dull glint gleamed deep in his eyes  your stock and property will last a long timedo you lots of good when this ranger  bah hoarsely croaked lawson the rangers name was a match applied to powder havent i told you hed be dead soonany timesame as laramie is  yes you mentioned thethe supposition replied longstreth sarcastically i inquired too just how that very desired event was to be brought about  the gang will lay him out  bah retorted longstreth in turn he laughed contemptuously  floyd dont be a fool youve been on the border for ten years youve packed a gun and youve used it youve been with rustlers when they killed their men youve been present at many fights but you never in all that time saw a man like this ranger you havent got sense enough to see him right if you had a chance neither have any of you the only way to get rid of him is for the gang to draw on him all at once then hes going to drop some of them  longstreth you say that like a man who wouldnt care much if he did drop some of them declared lawson and now he was sarcastic  to tell you the truth i wouldnt returned the other bluntly im pretty sick of this mess  lawson cursed in amazement his emotions were all out of proportion to his intelligence he was not at all quickwitted duane had never seen a vainer or more arrogant man  longstreth i dont like your talk he said  if you dont like the way i talk you know what you can do replied longstreth quickly he stood up then cool and quiet with flash of eyes and set of lips that told duane he was dangerous  well after all thats neither here nor there went on lawson unconsciously cowed by the other the thing is do i get the girl  not by any means except her consent  youll not make her marry me  no no replied longstreth his voice still cold lowpitched  all right then ill make her  evidently longstreth understood the man before him so well that he wasted no more words duane knew what lawson never dreamed of and that was that longstreth had a gun somewhere within reach and meant to use it then heavy footsteps sounded outside tramping upon the porch duane might have been mistaken but he believed those footsteps saved lawsons life  there they are said lawson and he opened the door  five masked men entered they all wore coats hiding any weapons a big man with burly shoulders shook hands with longstreth and the others stood back  the atmosphere of that room had changed lawson might have been a nonentity for all he counted longstreth was another mana stranger to duane if he had entertained a hope of freeing himself from this band of getting away to a safer country he abandoned it at the very sight of these men there was power here and he was bound  the big man spoke in low hoarse whispers and at this all the others gathered around him close to the table there were evidently some signs of membership not plain to duane then all the heads were bent over the table low voices spoke queried answered argued by straining his ears duane caught a word here and there they were planning and they were brief duane gathered they were to have a rendezvous at or near ord  then the big man who evidently was the leader of the present convention got up to depart he went as swiftly as he had come and was followed by his comrades longstreth prepared for a quiet smoke lawson seemed uncommunicative and unsociable he smoked fiercely and drank continually all at once he straightened up as if listening  whats that he called suddenly  duanes strained ears were pervaded by a slight rustling sound  must be a rat replied longstreth  the rustle became a rattle  sounds like a rattlesnake to me said lawson  longstreth got up from the table and peered round the room  just at that instant duane felt an almost inappreciable movement of the adobe wall which supported him he could scarcely credit his senses but the rattle inside longstreths room was mingling with little dull thuds of falling dirt the adobe wall merely dried mud was crumbling duane distinctly felt a tremor pass through it then the blood gushed back to his heart  what in the hell exclaimed longstreth  i smell dust said lawson sharply  that was the signal for duane to drop down from his perch yet despite his care he made a noise  did you hear a step queried longstreth  no one answered but a heavy piece of the adobe wall fell with a thud duane heard it crack felt it shake  theres somebody between the walls thundered longstreth  then a section of the wall fell inward with a crash duane began to squeeze his body through the narrow passage toward the patio  hear him yelled lawson this side  no hes going that way yelled longstreth  the tramp of heavy boots lent duane the strength of desperation he was not shirking a fight but to be cornered like a trapped coyote was another matter he almost tore his clothes off in that passage the dust nearly stifled him when he burst into the patio it was not a single instant too soon but one deep gasp of breath revived him and he was up gun in hand running for the outlet into the court thumping footsteps turned him back while there was a chance to get away he did not want to fight he thought he heard someone running into the patio from the other end he stole along and coming to a door without any idea of where it might lead he softly pushed it open a little way and slipped in    chapter xx  a low cry greeted duane the room was light he saw ray longstreth sitting on her bed in her dressinggown with a warning gesture to her to be silent he turned to close the door it was a heavy door without bolt or bar and when duane had shut it he felt safe only for the moment then he gazed around the room there was one window with blind closely drawn he listened and seemed to hear footsteps retreating dying away  then duane turned to miss longstreth she had slipped off the bed half to her knees and was holding out trembling hands she was as white as the pillow on her bed she was terribly frightened again with warning hand commanding silence duane stepped softly forward meaning to reassure her  oh she whispered wildly and duane thought she was going to faint when he got close and looked into her eyes he understood the strange dark expression in them she was terrified because she believed he meant to kill her or do worse probably worse duane realized he must have looked pretty hard and fierce bursting into her room with that big gun in hand  the way she searched duanes face with doubtful fearful eyes hurt him  listen i didnt know this was your room i came here to get awayto save my life i was pursued i was spying onon your father and his men they heard me but did not see me they dont know who was listening theyre after me now  her eyes changed from blank gulfs to dilating shadowing quickening windows of thought  then she stood up and faced duane with the fire and intelligence of a woman in her eyes  tell me now you were spying on my father  briefly duane told her what had happened before he entered her room not omitting a terse word as to the character of the men he had watched  my god so its that i knew something was terribly wrong herewith himwith the placethe people and right off i hated floyd lawson oh itll kill me ififits so much worse than i dreamed what shall i do  the sound of soft steps somewhere near distracted duanes attention reminded him of her peril and now what counted more with him made clear the probability of being discovered in her room  ill have to get out of here whispered duane  wait she replied didnt you say they were hunting for you  they sure are he returned grimly  oh then you mustnt go they might shoot you before you got away stay if we hear them you can hide ill turn out the light ill meet them at the door you can trust me wait till all quiets down if we have to wait till morning then you can slip out  i oughtnt to stay i dont want toi wont duane replied perplexed and stubborn  but you must its the only safe way they wont come here  suppose they should its an even chance longstrethll search every room and corner in this old house if they found me here i couldnt start a fight you might be hurt thenthe fact of my being here  duane did not finish what he meant but instead made a step toward the door white of face and dark of eye she took hold of him to detain him she was as strong and supple as a panther but she need not have been either resolute or strong for the clasp of her hand was enough to make duane weak  up yet ray came longstreths clear voice too strained too eager to be natural  no im in bed reading good night instantly replied miss longstreth so calmly and naturally that duane marveled at the difference between man and woman then she motioned for duane to hide in the closet he slipped in but the door would not close altogether  are you alone went on longstreths penetrating voice  yes she replied ruth went to bed  the door swung inward with a swift scrape and jar longstreth half entered haggard flamingeyed behind him duane saw lawson and indistinctly another man  longstreth barred lawson from entering which action showed control as well as distrust he wanted to see into the room when he had glanced around he went out and closed the door  then what seemed a long interval ensued the house grew silent once more duane could not see miss longstreth but he heard her quick breathing how long did she mean to let him stay hidden there hard and perilous as his life had been this was a new kind of adventure he had divined the strange softness of his feeling as something due to the magnetism of this beautiful woman it hardly seemed possible that he who had been outside the pale for so many years could have fallen in love yet that must be the secret of his agitation  presently he pushed open the closet door and stepped forth miss longstreth had her head lowered upon her arms and appeared to be in distress at his touch she raised a quivering face  i think i can go nowsafely he whispered  go then if you must but you may stay till youre safe she replied  ii couldnt thank you enough its been hard on methis finding outand you his daughter i feel strange i dont understand myself well but i want you to knowif i were not an outlawa rangerid lay my life at your feet  oh you have seen soso little of me she faltered  all the same its true and that makes me feel more the trouble my coming caused you  you will not fight my father  not if i can help it im trying to get out of his way  but you spied upon him  i am a ranger miss longstreth  and oh i am a rustlers daughter she cried thats so much more terrible than id suspected it was tricky cattle deals i imagined he was engaged in but only tonight i had strong suspicions aroused  how tell me  i overheard floyd say that men were coming tonight to arrange a meeting for my father at a rendezvous near ord father did not want to go floyd taunted him with a name  what name queried duane  it was cheseldine  cheseldine my god miss longstreth why did you tell me that  what difference does that make  your father and cheseldine are one and the same whispered duane hoarsely  i gathered so much myself she replied miserably but longstreth is fathers real name  duane felt so stunned he could not speak at once it was the girls part in this tragedy that weakened him the instant she betrayed the secret duane realized perfectly that he did love her the emotion was like a great flood  miss longstreth all this seems so unbelievable he whispered cheseldine is the rustler chief ive come out here to get hes only a name your father is the real man ive sworn to get him im bound by more than law or oaths i cant break what binds me and i must disgrace youwreck your lifer why miss longstreth i believe ii love you its all come in a rush id die for you if i could how fatalterriblethis is how things work out  she slipped to her knees with her hands on his  you wont kill him she implored if you care for meyou wont kill him  no that i promise you  with a low moan she dropped her head upon the bed  duane opened the door and stealthily stole out through the corridor to the court  when duane got out into the dark where his hot face cooled in the wind his relief equaled his other feelings  the night was dark windy stormy yet there was no rain duane hoped as soon as he got clear of the ranch to lose something of the pain he felt but long after he had tramped out into the open there was a lump in his throat and an ache in his breast all his thought centered around ray longstreth what a woman she had turned out to be he seemed to have a vague hopeless hope that there might be there must be some way he could save her    chapter xxi  before going to sleep that night duane had decided to go to ord and try to find the rendezvous where longstreth was to meet his men these men duane wanted even more than their leader if longstreth or cheseldine was the brains of that gang poggin was the executor it was poggin who needed to be found and stopped poggin and his righthand men duane experienced a strange tigerish thrill it was thought of poggin more than thought of success for macnellys plan duane felt dubious over this emotion  next day he set out for bradford he was glad to get away from fairdale for a while but the hours and the miles in no wise changed the new pain in his heart the only way he could forget miss longstreth was to let his mind dwell upon poggin and even this was not always effective  he avoided sanderson and at the end of the day and a half he arrived at bradford  the night of the day before he reached bradford no 6 the mail and express train going east was held up by trainrobbers the wellsfargo messenger killed over his safe the mailclerk wounded the bags carried away the engine of no 6 came into town minus even a tender and engineer and fireman told conflicting stories a posse of railroad men and citizens led by a sheriff duane suspected was crooked was made up before the engine steamed back to pick up the rest of the train duane had the sudden inspiration that he had been cudgeling his mind to find and acting upon it he mounted his horse again and left bradford unobserved as he rode out into the night over a dark trail in the direction of ord he uttered a short grim sardonic laugh at the hope that he might be taken for a trainrobber  he rode at an easy trot most of the night and when the black peak of ord mountain loomed up against the stars he halted tied his horse and slept until dawn he had brought a small pack and now he took his time cooking breakfast when the sun was well up he saddled bullet and leaving the trail where his tracks showed plain in the ground he put his horse to the rocks and brush he selected an exceedingly rough roundabout and difficult course to ord hid his tracks with the skill of a longhunted fugitive and arrived there with his horse winded and covered with lather it added considerable to his arrival that the man duane remembered as fletcher and several others saw him come in the back way through the lots and jump a fence into the road  duane led bullet up to the porch where fletcher stood wiping his beard he was hatless vestless and evidently had just enjoyed a morning drink  howdy dodge said fletcher laconically  duane replied and the other man returned the greeting with interest  jim my hoss s done up i want to hide him from any chance tourists as might happen to ride up curiouslike  haw haw haw  duane gathered encouragement from that chorus of coarse laughter  wal if them tourists aint too durned snooky the hossll be safe in the dobe shack back of bills here feed thar too but youll hev to rustle water  duane led bullet to the place indicated had care of his welfare and left him there upon returning to the tavern porch duane saw the group of men had been added to by others some of whom he had seen before without comment duane walked along the edge of the road and wherever one of the tracks of his horse showed he carefully obliterated it this procedure was attentively watched by fletcher and his companions  wal dodge remarked fletcher as duane returned thets safer n prayin fer rain  duanes reply was a remark as loquacious as fletchers to the effect that a long slow monotonous ride was conducive to thirst they all joined him unmistakably friendly but knell was not there and most assuredly not poggin fletcher was no common outlaw but whatever his ability it probably lay in execution of orders apparently at that time these men had nothing to do but drink and lounge around the tavern evidently they were poorly supplied with money though duane observed they could borrow a peso occasionally from the bartender duane set out to make himself agreeable and succeeded there was cardplaying for small stakes idle jests of coarse nature much bantering among the younger fellows and occasionally a mild quarrel all morning men came and went until all told duane calculated he had seen at least fifty toward the middle of the afternoon a young fellow burst into the saloon and yelled one word  posse  from the scramble to get outdoors duane judged that word and the ensuing action was rare in ord  what the hell muttered fletcher as he gazed down the road at a dark compact bunch of horses and riders fust time i ever seen thet in ord were gettin popular like them camps out of valentine wish phil was here or poggy now all you gents keep quiet ill do the talkin  the posse entered the town trotted up on dusty horses and halted in a bunch before the tavern the party consisted of about twenty men all heavily armed and evidently in charge of a cleancut leanlimbed cowboy duane experienced considerable satisfaction at the absence of the sheriff who he had understood was to lead the posse perhaps he was out in another direction with a different force  hello jim fletcher called the cowboy  howdy replied fletcher  at his short dry response and the way he strode leisurely out before the posse duane found himself modifying his contempt for fletcher the outlaw was different now  fletcher weve tracked a man to all but three miles of this place tracks as plain as the nose on your face found his camp then he hit into the brush an we lost the trail didnt have no tracker with us think he went into the mountains but we took a chance an rid over the rest of the way seein ord was so close anybody come in here late last night or early this mornin  nope replied fletcher  his response was what duane had expected from his manner and evidently the cowboy took it as a matter of course he turned to the others of the posse entering into a low consultation evidently there was difference of opinion if not real dissension in that posse  didnt i tell ye this was a wildgoose chase comin way out here protested an old hawkfaced rancher them hoss tracks we follored aint like any of them we seen at the watertank where the train was held up  im not so sure of that replied the leader  wal guthrie ive follored tracks all my life  but you couldnt keep to the trail this feller made in the brush  gimme time an i could thet takes time an heah you go hellbent fer election but its a wrong lead out this way if youre right this roadagent after he killed his pals would hev rid back right through town an with them mailbags supposin they was greasers some greasers has sense an when it comes to thievin theyre shore cute  but we sent got any reason to believe this robber who murdered the greasers is a greaser himself i tell you it was a slick job done by no ordinary sneak didnt you hear the facts one greaser hopped the engine an covered the engineer an fireman another greaser kept flashin his gun outside the train the big man who shoved back the cardoor an did the killinhe was the real gent an dont you forget it  some of the posse sided with the cowboy leader and some with the old cattleman finally the young leader disgustedly gathered up his bridle  aw hell thet sheriff shoved you off this trail mebbe he hed reasons savvy thet if i hed a bunch of cowboys with mei tell you whatid take a chance an clean up this hole  all the while jim fletcher stood quietly with his hands in his pockets  guthrie im shore treasurin up your friendly talk he said the menace was in the tone not the content of his speech  you canan be damned to you fletcher called guthrie as the horses started  fletcher standing out alone before the others of his clan watched the posse out of sight  luck fer youall thet poggy wasnt here he said as they disappeared then with a thoughtful mien he strode up on the porch and led duane away from the others into the barroom when he looked into duanes face it was somehow an entirely changed scrutiny  dodge whered you hide the stuff i reckon i git in on this deal seein i staved off guthrie  duane played his part here was his a tiger after prey he seized it first he coolly eyed the outlaw and then disclaimed any knowledge whatever of the trainrobbery other than fletcher had heard himself then at fletchers persistence and admiration and increasing show of friendliness he laughed occasionally and allowed himself to swell with pride though still denying next he feigned a lack of consistent willpower and seemed to be wavering under fletchers persuasion and grew silent then surly fletcher evidently sure of ultimate victory desisted for the time being however in his solicitous regard and close companionship for the rest of that day he betrayed the bent of his mind  later when duane started up announcing his intention to get his horse and make for camp out in the brush fletcher seemed grievously offended  why dont you stay with me ive got a comfortable dobe over here didnt i stick by you when guthrie an his bunch come up supposin i hednt showed down a cold hand to him youd be swingin somewheres now i tell you dodge it aint square  ill square it i pay my debts replied duane but i cant put up here all night if i belonged to the gang it d be different  what gang asked fletcher bluntly  why cheseldines  fletchers beard nodded as his jaw dropped  duane laughed i run into him the other day knowed him on sight sure hes the kingpin rustler when he seen me an asked me what reason i had for bein on earth or some such likewhy i up an told him  fletcher appeared staggered  who in allfired hell air you talkin about  didnt i tell you once cheseldine he calls himself longstreth over there  all of fletchers face not covered by hair turned a dirty white cheseldinelongstreth he whispered hoarsely gord almighty you braced the then a remarkable transformation came over the outlaw he gulped he straightened his face he controlled his agitation but he could not send the healthy brown back to his face duane watching this rude man marveled at the change in him the sudden checking movement the proof of a wonderful fear and loyalty it all meant cheseldine a master of men  who air you queried fletcher in a queer strained voice  you gave me a handle didnt you dodge thets as good as any shore it hits me hard jim ive been pretty lonely for years an im gettin in need of pals think it over will you see you manana  the outlaw watched duane go off after his horse watched him as he returned to the tavern watched him ride out into the darknessall without a word  duane left the town threaded a quiet passage through cactus and mesquite to a spot he had marked before and made ready for the night his mind was so full that he found sleep aloof luck at last was playing his game he sensed the first slow heave of a mighty crisis the end always haunting had to be sternly blotted from thought it was the approach that needed all his mind  he passed the night there and late in the morning after watching trail and road from a ridge he returned to ord if jim fletcher tried to disguise his surprise the effort was a failure certainly he had not expected to see duane again duane allowed himself a little freedom with fletcher an attitude hitherto lacking  that afternoon a horseman rode in from bradford an outlaw evidently well known and liked by his fellows and duane beard him say before he could possibly have been told the trainrobber was in ord that the loss of money in the holdup was slight like a flash duane saw the luck of this report he pretended not to have heard  in the early twilight at an opportune moment he called fletcher to him and linking his arm within the outlaws he drew him off in a stroll to a log bridge spanning a little gully here after gazing around he took out a roll of bills spread it out split it equally and without a word handed one half to fletcher with clumsy fingers fletcher ran through the roll  five hundred he exclaimed dodge thets damn handsome of you considerin the job wasnt  considerin nothin interrupted duane im makin no reference to a job here or there you did me a good turn i split my pile if thet doesnt make us pards good turns an money aint no use in this country  fletcher was won  the two men spent much time together duane made up a short fictitious history about himself that satisfied the outlaw only it drew forth a laughing jest upon duanes modesty for fletcher did not hide his belief that this new partner was a man of achievements knell and poggin and then cheseldine himself would be persuaded of this fact so fletcher boasted he had influence he would use it he thought he pulled a stroke with knell but nobody on earth not even the boss had any influence on poggin poggin was concentrated ice part of the time all the rest he was bursting hell but poggin loved a horse he never loved anything else he could be won with that black horse bullet cheseldine was already won by duanes monumental nerve otherwise he would have killed duane  little by little the next few days duane learned the points he longed to know and how indelibly they etched themselves in his memory cheseldines hidingplace was on the far slope of mount ord in a deep highwalled valley he always went there just before a contemplated job where he met and planned with his lieutenants then while they executed he basked in the sunshine before one or another of the public places he owned he was there in the ord den now getting ready to plan the biggest job yet it was a bankrobbery but where fletcher had not as yet been advised  then when duane had pumped the now amenable outlaw of all details pertaining to the present he gathered data and facts and places covering a period of ten years fletcher had been with cheseldine and herewith was unfolded a history so dark in its bloody regime so incredible in its brazen daring so appalling in its proof of the outlaws sweep and grasp of the country from pecos to rio grande that duane was stunned compared to this cheseldine of the big bend to this rancher stockbuyer cattlespeculator propertyholder all the outlaws duane had ever known sank into insignificance the power of the man stunned duane the strange fidelity given him stunned duane the intricate inside working of his great system was equally stunning but when duane recovered from that the old terrible passion to kill consumed him and it raged fiercely and it could not be checked if that redhanded poggin if that coldeyed deadfaced knell had only been at ord but they were not and duane with help of time got what he hoped was the upper hand of himself    chapter xxii  again inaction and suspense dragged at duanes spirit like a leashed hound with a keen scent in his face duane wanted to leap forth when he was bound he almost fretted something called to him over the bold wild brow of mount ord but while fletcher stayed in ord waiting for knell and poggin or for orders duane knew his game was again a waiting one  but one day there were signs of the long quiet of ord being broken a messenger strange to duane rode in on a secret mission that had to do with fletcher when he went away fletcher became addicted to thoughtful moods and lonely walks he seldom drank and this in itself was a striking contrast to former behavior the messenger came again whatever communication he brought it had a remarkable effect upon the outlaw duane was present in the tavern when the fellow arrived saw the few words whispered but did not hear them fletcher turned white with anger or fear perhaps both and he cursed like a madman the messenger a lean darkfaced hardriding fellow reminding duane of the cowboy guthrie left the tavern without even a drink and rode away off to the west this west mystified and fascinated duane as much as the south beyond mount ord where were knell and poggin apparently they were not at present with the leader on the mountain after the messenger left fletcher grew silent and surly he had presented a variety of moods to duanes observation and this latest one was provocative of thought fletcher was dangerous it became clear now that the other outlaws of the camp feared him kept out of his way duane let him alone yet closely watched him  perhaps an hour after the messenger had left not longer fletcher manifestly arrived at some decision and he called for his horse then he went to his shack and returned to duane the outlaw looked in shape both to ride and to fight he gave orders for the men in camp to keep close until he returned then he mounted  come here dodge he called  duane went up and laid a hand on the pommel of the saddle fletcher walked his horse with duane beside him till they reached the log bridge when he halted  dodge im in bad with knell he said an it pears im the cause of friction between knell an poggy knell never had any use fer me but poggys been square if not friendly the boss has a big deal on an here its been held up because of this scrap hes waitin over there on the mountain to give orders to knell or poggy an neither ones showin up ive got to stand in the breach an i aint enjoyin the prospects  whats the trouble about jim asked duane  reckon its a little about you dodge said fletcher dryly knell hadnt any use fer you thet day he aint got no use fer a man onless he can rule him some of the boys here hev blabbed before i edged in with my say an theres hell to pay knell claims to know somethin about you thatll make both the boss an poggy sick when he springs it but hes keepin quiet hard man to figger thet knell reckon youd better go back to bradford fer a day or so then camp out near here till i come back  why  wal because there aint any use fer you to git in bad too  the gang will ride over here any day if theyre friendly ill light a fire on the hill there say three nights from tonight if you dont see it thet night you hit the trail ill do what i can jim fletcher sticks to his pals so long dodge  then he rode away  he left duane in a quandary this news was black things had been working out so well here was a setback at the moment duane did not know which way to turn but certainly he had no idea of going back to bradford friction between the two great lieutenants of cheseldine open hostility between one of them and another of the chiefs righthand men among outlaws that sort of thing was deadly serious generally such matters were settled with guns duane gathered encouragement even from disaster perhaps the disintegration of cheseldines great band had already begun but what did knell know duane did not circle around the idea with doubts and hopes if knell knew anything it was that this stranger in ord this new partner of fletchers was no less than buck duane well it was about time thought duane that he made use of his name if it were to help him at all that name had been macnellys hope he had anchored all his scheme to duanes fame duane was tempted to ride off after fletcher and stay with him this however would hardly be fair to an outlaw who had been fair to him duane concluded to await developments and when the gang rode in to ord probably from their various hidingplaces he would be there ready to be denounced by knell duane could not see any other culmination of this series of events than a meeting between knell and himself if that terminated fatally for knell there was all probability of duanes being in no worse situation than he was now if poggin took up the quarrel here duane accused himself againtried in vain to revolt from a judgment that he was only reasoning out excuses to meet these outlaws  meanwhile instead of waiting why not hunt up cheseldine in his mountain retreat the thought no sooner struck duane than he was hurrying for his horse  he left ord ostensibly toward bradford but once out of sight he turned off the road circled through the brush and several miles south of town he struck a narrow grassgrown trail that fletcher had told him led to cheseldines camp the horse tracks along this trail were not less than a week old and very likely much more it wound between low brushcovered foothills through arroyos and gullies lined with mesquite cottonwood and scruboak  in an hour duane struck the slope of mount ord and as he climbed he got a view of the rolling blackspotted country partly desert partly fertile with long bright lines of dry streambeds winding away to grow dim in the distance he got among broken rocks and cliffs and here the open downwardrolling land disappeared and he was hard put to it to find the trail he lost it repeatedly and made slow progress finally he climbed into a region of all rock benches rough here smooth there with only an occasional scratch of iron horseshoe to guide him many times he had to go ahead and then work to right or left till he found his way again it was slow work it took all day and night found him halfway up the mountain he halted at a little sidecanon with grass and water and here he made camp the night was clear and cool at that height with a darkblue sky and a streak of stars blinking across with this day of action behind him he felt better satisfied than he had been for some time here on this venture he was answering to a call that had so often directed his movements perhaps his life and it was one that logic or intelligence could take little stock of and on this night lonely like the ones he used to spend in the nueces gorge and memorable of them because of a likeness to that old hidingplace he felt the pressing return of old haunting thingsthe past so long ago wild flights dead facesand the places of these were taken by one quiveringly alive white tragic with its dark intent speaking eyesray longstreths   that last memory he yielded to until he slept  in the morning satisfied that he had left still fewer tracks than he had followed up this trail he led his horse up to the head of the canon there a narrow crack in low cliffs and with branches of cedar fenced him in then he went back and took up the trail on foot  without the horse he made better time and climbed through deep clefts wide canons over ridges up shelving slopes along precipicesa long hard climbtill he reached what he concluded was a divide going down was easier though the farther he followed this dim and winding trail the wider the broken battlements of rock above him he saw the black fringe of pinon and pine and above that the bold peak bare yellow like a desert butte once through a wide gateway between great escarpments he saw the lower country beyond the range and beyond this vast and clear as it lay in his sight was the great river that made the big bend he went down and down wondering how a horse could follow that broken trail believing there must be another better one somewhere into cheseldines hidingplace  he rounded a jutting corner where view had been shut off and presently came out upon the rim of a high wall beneath like a green gulf seen through blue haze lay an amphitheater walled in on the two sides he could see it lay perhaps a thousand feet below him and plain as all the other features of that wild environment there shone out a big red stone or adobe cabin white water shining away between great borders and horses and cattle dotting the levels it was a peaceful beautiful scene duane could not help grinding his teeth at the thought of rustlers living there in quiet and ease  duane worked halfway down to the level and well hidden in a niche he settled himself to watch both trail and valley he made note of the position of the sun and saw that if anything developed or if he decided to descend any farther there was small likelihood of his getting back to his camp before dark to try that after nightfall he imagined would be vain effort  then he bent his keen eyes downward the cabin appeared to be a crude structure though large in size it had of course been built by outlaws  there was no garden no cultivated field no corral excepting for the rude pile of stones and logs plastered together with mud the valley was as wild probably as on the day of discovery duane seemed to have been watching for a long time before he saw any sign of man and this one apparently went to the stream for water and returned to the cabin  the sun went down behind the wall and shadows were born in the darker places of the valley duane began to want to get closer to that cabin what had he taken this arduous climb for he held back however trying to evolve further plans  while he was pondering the shadows quickly gathered and darkened if he was to go back to camp he must set out at once still he lingered and suddenly his wideroving eye caught sight of two horsemen riding up the valley the must have entered at a point below round the huge abutment of rock beyond duanes range of sight their horses were tired and stopped at the stream for a long drink  duane left his perch took to the steep trail and descended as fast as he could without making noise it did not take him long to reach the valley floor it was almost level with deep grass and here and there clumps of bushes twilight was already thick down there duane marked the location of the trail and then began to slip like a shadow through the grass and from bush to bush he saw a bright light before he made out the dark outline of the cabin then he heard voices a merry whistle a coarse song and the clink of iron cookingutensils he smelled fragrant woodsmoke he saw moving dark figures cross the light evidently there was a wide door or else the fire was out in the open  duane swerved to the left out of direct line with the light and thus was able to see better then he advanced noiselessly but swiftly toward the back of the house there were trees close to the wall he would make no noise and he could scarcely be seenif only there was no watchdog but all his outlaw days he had taken risks with only his useless life at stake now with that changed he advanced stealthy and bold as an indian he reached the cover of the trees knew he was hidden in their shadows for at few paces distance he had been able to see only their tops from there he slipped up to the house and felt along the wall with his hands  he came to a little window where light shone through he peeped in he saw a room shrouded in shadows a lamp turned low a table chairs he saw an open door with bright flare beyond but could not see the fire voices came indistinctly without hesitation duane stole farther alongall the way to the end of the cabin peeping round he saw only the flare of light on bare ground retracing his cautious steps he paused at the crack again saw that no man was in the room and then he went on round that end of the cabin fortune favored him there were bushes an old shed a woodpile all the cover he needed at that corner he did not even need to crawl  before he peered between the rough corner of wall and the bush growing close to it duane paused a moment this excitement was different from that he had always felt when pursued it had no bitterness no pain no dread there was as much danger here perhaps more yet it was not the same then he looked  he saw a bright fire a redfaced man bending over it whistling while he handled a steaming pot over him was a roofed shed built against the wall with two open sides and two supporting posts duanes second glance not so blinded by the sudden bright light made out other men three in the shadow two in the flare but with backs to him  its a smoother trail by long odds but aint so short as this one right over the mountain one outlaw was saying  whats eatin you panhandle ejaculated another blossom an me rode from faraway springs where poggin is with some of the gang  excuse me phil shore i didnt see you come in an boldt never said nothin  it took you a long time to get here but i guess thats just as well spoke up a smooth suave voice with a ring in it  longstreths voicecheseldines voice  here they werecheseldine phil knell blossom kane panhandle smith boldthow well duane remembered the namesall here the big men of cheseldines gang except the biggestpoggin duane had holed them and his sensations of the moment deadened sight and sound of what was before him he sank down controlled himself silenced a mounting exultation then from a lessstrained position he peered forth again  the outlaws were waiting for supper their conversation might have been that of cowboys in camp ranchers at a roundup duane listened with eager ears waiting for the business talk that he felt would come all the time he watched with the eyes of a wolf upon its quarry blossom kane was the leanlimbed messenger who had so angered fletcher boldt was a giant in stature dark bearded silent panhandle smith was the redfaced cook merry profane a short bowlegged man resembling many rustlers duane had known particularly luke stevens and knell who sat there tall slim like a boy in build like a boy in years with his pale smooth expressionless face and his cold gray eyes and longstreth who leaned against the wall handsome with his dark face and beard like an aristocrat resembled many a rich louisiana planter duane had met the sixth man sat so much in the shadow that he could not be plainly discerned and though addressed his name was not mentioned  panhandle smith carried pots and pans into the cabin and cheerfully called out if you gents air hungry fer grub dont look fer me to feed you with a spoon  the outlaws piled inside made a great bustle and clatter as they sat to their meal like hungry men they talked little  duane waited there awhile then guardedly got up and crept round to the other side of the cabin after he became used to the dark again he ventured to steal along the wall to the window and peeped in the outlaws were in the first room and could not be seen  duane waited the moments dragged endlessly his heart pounded longstreth entered turned up the light and taking a box of cigars from the table he carried it out  here you fellows go outside and smoke he said knell come on in now lets get it over  he returned sat down and lighted a cigar for himself he put his booted feet on the table  duane saw that the room was comfortably even luxuriously furnished there must have been a good trail he thought else how could all that stuff have been packed in there most assuredly it could not have come over the trail he had traveled presently he heard the men go outside and their voices became indistinct then knell came in and seated himself without any of his chiefs ease he seemed preoccupied and as always cold  whats wrong knell why didnt you get here sooner queried longstreth  poggin damn him were on the outs again  what for  aw he neednt have got sore hes breakin a new hoss over at faraway an you know him where a hoss s concerned that kept him i reckon more than anythin  what else get it out of your system so we can go on to the new job  well it begins back a ways i dont know how long agoweeksa stranger rode into ord an got down easylike as if he owned the place he seemed familiar to me but i wasnt sure we looked him over an i left tryin to place him in my mind  whatd he look like  rangy powerful man white hair over his temples still hard face eyes like knives the way he packed his guns the way he walked an stood an swung his right hand showed me what he was you cant fool me on the gunsharp an he had a grand horse a big black  ive met your man said longstreth  no exclaimed knell it was wonderful to hear surprise expressed by this man that did not in the least show it in his strange physiognomy knell laughed a short grim hollow laugh boss this here big gent drifts into ord again an makes up to jim fletcher jim you know is easy led he likes men an when a posse come along trailin a blind lead huntin the wrong way for the man who held up no 6 why jimhe up an takes this stranger to be the fly roadagent an cottons to him got money out of him sure an thats what stumps me more whats this mans game i happen to know boss that he couldnt have held up no 6  how do you know demanded longstreth  because i did the job myself  a dark and stormy passion clouded the chiefs face  damn you knell youre incorrigible youre unreliable another break like that queers you with me did you tell poggin  yes thats one reason we fell out he raved i thought he was goin to kill me  why did you tackle such a risky job without help or plan  it offered thats all an it was easy but it was a mistake i got the country an the railroad hollerin for nothin i just couldnt help it you know what idleness means to one of us you know also that this very life breeds fatality its wrongthats why i was born of good parents an i know whats right were wrong an we cant beat the end thats all an for my part i dont care a damn when that comes  fine wise talk from you knell said longstreth scornfully go on with your story  as i said jim cottons to the pretender an they get chummy theyre together all the time you can gamble jim told all he knew an then some a little liquor loosens his tongue several of the boys rode over from ord an one of them went to poggin an says jim fletcher has a new man for the gang poggin you know is always ready for any new man he says if one doesnt turn out good he can be shut off easy he rather liked the way this new part of jims was boosted jim an poggin always hit it up together so until i got on the deal jims pard was already in the gang without poggin or you ever seein him then i got to figurin hard just where had i ever seen that chap as it turned out i never had seen him which accounts for my bein doubtful id never forget any man id seen i dug up a lot of old papers from my kit an went over them letters pictures clippins an all that i guess i had a pretty good notion what i was lookin for an who i wanted to make sure of at last i found it an i knew my man but i didnt spring it on poggin oh no i want to have some fun with him when the time comes hell be wilder than a trapped wolf i sent blossom over to ord to get word from jim an when he verified all this talk i sent blossom again with a message calculated to make jim hump poggin got sore said hed wait for jim an i could come over here to see you about the new job hed meet me in ord  knell had spoken hurriedly and low now and then with passion his pale eyes glinted like fire in ice and now his voice fell to a whisper  who do you think fletchers new man is  who demanded longstreth  buck duane  down came longstreths boots with a crash then his body grew rigid  that nueces outlaw that twoshot aceofspades gunthrower who killed bland alloway  an hardin knell whispered this last name with more feeling than the apparent circumstance demanded  yes and hardin the best one of the rim rock fellowsbuck duane  longstreth was so ghastly white now that his black mustache seemed outlined against chalk he eyed his grim lieutenant they understood each other without more words it was enough that buck duane was there in the big bend longstreth rose presently and reached for a flask from which he drank then offered it to knell he waved it aside  knell began the chief slowly as he wiped his lips i gathered you have some grudge against this buck duane  yes  well dont be a fool now and do what poggin or almost any of you men woulddont meet this buck duane ive reason to believe hes a texas ranger now  the hell you say exclaimed knell  yes go to ord and give jim fletcher a hunch hell get poggin and theyll fix even buck duane  all right ill do my best but if i run into duane  dont run into him longstreths voice fairly rang with the force of its passion and command he wiped his face drank again from the flask sat down resumed his smoking and drawing a paper from his vest pocket he began to study it  well im glad thats settled he said evidently referring to the duane matter now for the new job this is october the eighteenth on or before the twentyfifth there will be a shipment of gold reach the ranchers bank of val verde after you return to ord give poggin these orders keep the gang quiet you poggin kane fletcher panhandle smith and boldt to be in on the

bank val verdes a pretty big town never been any holdups there town feels safe make it a clean fast daylight job thats all have you got the details  knell did not even ask for the dates again  suppose

on hand steadies him and i say againlook to it that nothing happens either you or poggin carry the job through but i want both of you in it break for the hills and when you get up in the rocks where you can hide your tracks head for mount ord when alls quiet again ill join you here thats all call in the boys  like a swift shadow and as noiseless duane stole across the level toward the dark wall of rock every nerve was a strung wire for a little while his mind was cluttered and clogged with whirling thoughts from which like a flashing scroll unrolled the long baffling order of action the game was now in his hands he must cross mount ord at night the feat was improbable but it might be done he must ride into bradford forty miles from the foothills before eight oclock next morning he must telegraph macnelly to be in val verde on the twentyfifth he must ride back to ord to intercept knell face him be denounced kill him and while the iron was hot strike hard to win poggins halfwon interest as he had wholly won fletchers failing that last he must let the outlaws alone to bide their time in ord to be free to ride on to their new job in val verde in the mean time he must plan to arrest longstreth it was a magnificent outline incredible alluring unfathomable in its nameless certainty he felt like fate he seemed to be the iron consequences falling upon these doomed outlaws  under the wall the shadows were black only the tips of trees and crags showing yet he went straight to the trail it was merely a grayness between borders of black he climbed and never stopped it did not seem steep his feet might have had eyes he surmounted the wall and looking down into the ebony gulf pierced by one point of light he lifted a menacing arm and shook it then he strode on and did not falter till he reached the huge shelving cliffs here he lost the trail there was none but he remembered the shapes the points the notches of rock above before he reached the ruins of splintered ramparts and jumbles of broken walls the moon topped the eastern slope of the mountain and the mystifying blackness he had dreaded changed to magic silver light it seemed as light as day only soft mellow and the air held a transparent sheen he ran up the bare ridges and down the smooth slopes and like a goat jumped from rock to rock in this light he knew his way and lost no time looking for a trail he crossed the divide and then had all downhill before him swiftly he descended almost always sure of his memory of the landmarks he did not remember having studied them in the ascent yet here they were even in changed light familiar to his sight what he had once seen was pictured on his mind and true as a deer striking for home he reached the canon where he had left his horse  bullet was quickly and easily found duane threw on the saddle and pack cinched them tight and resumed his descent the worst was now to come bare downward steps in rock sliding weathered slopes narrow black gullies a thousand openings in a maze of broken stonethese duane had to descend in fast time leading a giant of a horse bullet cracked the loose fragments sent them rolling slid on the scaly slopes plunged down the steps followed like a faithful dog at duanes heels  hours passed as moments duane was equal to his great opportunity but he could not quell that self in him which reached back over the lapse of lonely searing years and found the boy in him he who had been worse than dead was now grasping at the skirts of lifewhich meant victory honor happiness duane knew he was not just right in part of his mind small wonder that he was not insane he thought he tramped on downward his marvelous faculty for covering rough ground and holding to the true course never before even in flight so keen and acute yet all the time a spirit was keeping step with him thought of ray longstreth as he had left her made him weak but now with the game clear to its end with the trap to spring with success strangely haunting him duane could not dispel memory of her he saw her white face with its sweet sad lips and the dark eyes so tender and tragic and time and distance and risk and toil were nothing  the moon sloped to the west shadows of trees and crags now crossed to the other side of him the stars dimmed then he was out of the rocks with the dim trail pale at his feet mounting bullet he made short work of the long slope and the foothills and the rolling land leading down to ord the little outlaw camp with its shacks and cabins and row of houses lay silent and dark under the paling moon duane passed by on the lower trail headed into the road and put bullet to a gallop he watched the dying moon the waning stars and the east he had time to spare so he saved the horse knell would be leaving the rendezvous about the time duane turned back toward ord between noon and sunset they would meet  the night wore on the moon sank behind low mountains in the west the stars brightened for a while then faded gray gloom enveloped the world thickened lay like smoke over the road then shade by shade it lightened until through the transparent obscurity shone a dim light  duane reached bradford before dawn he dismounted some distance from the tracks tied his horse and then crossed over to the station he heard the clicking of the telegraph instrument and it thrilled him an operator sat inside reading when duane tapped on the window he looked up with startled glance then went swiftly to unlock the door  hello give me paper and pencil quick whispered duane  with trembling hands the operator complied duane wrote out the message he had carefully composed  send thisrepeat it to make surethen keep mum ill see you again goodby  the operator stared but did not speak a word  duane left as stealthily and swiftly as he had come he walked his horse a couple miles back on the road and then rested him till break of day the east began to redden duane turned grimly in the direction of ord  when duane swung into the wide grassy square on the outskirts of ord he saw a bunch of saddled horses hitched in front of the tavern he knew what that meant luck still favored him if it would only hold but he could ask no more the rest was a matter of how greatly he could make his power felt an open conflict against odds lay in the balance that would be fatal to him and to avoid it he had to trust to his name and a presence he must make terrible he knew outlaws he knew what qualities held them he knew what to exaggerate  there was not an outlaw in sight the dusty horses had covered distance that morning as duane dismounted he heard loud angry voices inside the tavern he removed coat and vest hung them over the pommel he packed two guns one belted high on the left hip the other swinging low on the right side he neither looked nor listened but boldly pushed the door and stepped inside  the big room was full of men and every face pivoted toward him knells pale face flashed into duanes swift sight then boldts then blossom kanes then panhandle smiths then fletchers then others that were familiar and last that of poggin though duane had never seen poggin or heard him described he knew him for he saw a face that was a record of great and evil deeds  there was absolute silence the outlaws were lined back of a long table upon which were papers stacks of silver coin a bundle of bills and a huge goldmounted gun  are you gents lookin for me asked duane he gave his voice all the ringing force and power of which he was capable and he stepped back free of anything with the outlaws all before him  knell stood quivering but his face might have been a mask the other outlaws looked from him to duane jim fletcher flung up his hands  my gawd dodge whatd you bust in here fer he said plaintively and slowly stepped forward his action was that of a man true to himself he meant he had been sponsor for duane and now he would stand by him  back fletcher called duane and his voice made the outlaw jump  hold on dodge an youall everybody said fletcher let me talk seein im in wrong here  his persuasions did not ease the strain  go ahead talk said poggin  fletcher turned to duane pard im takin it on myself thet you meet enemies here when i swore youd meet friends its my fault ill stand by you if you let me  no jim replied duane  but whatd you come fer without the signal burst out fletcher in distress he saw nothing but catastrophe in this meeting  jim i aint pressin my company none but when im wanted bad  fletcher stopped him with a raised hand then he turned to poggin with a rude dignity  poggy hes my pard an hes riled i never told him a word thetd make him sore i only said knell hadnt no more use fer him than fer me now what you say goes in this gang i never failed you in my life heres my pard i vouch fer him will you stand fer me theres goin to be hell if you dont an us with a big job on hand  while fletcher toiled over his slow earnest persuasion duane had his gaze riveted upon poggin there was something leonine about poggin he was tawny he blazed he seemed beautiful as fire was beautiful but looked at closer with glance seeing the physical man instead of that thing which shone from him he was of perfect build with muscles that swelled and rippled bulging his clothes with the magnificent head and face of the cruel fierce tawnyeyed jaguar  looking at this strange poggin instinctively divining his abnormal and hideous power duane had for the first time in his life the inward quaking fear of a man it was like a coldtongued bell ringing within him and numbing his heart the old instinctive firing of blood followed but did not drive away that fear he knew he felt something here deeper than thought could go and he hated poggin  that individual had been considering fletchers appeal  jim i ante up he said an if phil doesnt raise us out with a big handwhy hell get called an your pard can set in the game  every eye shifted to knell he was dead white he laughed and any one hearing that laugh would have realized his intense anger equally with an assurance which made him master of the situation  poggin youre a gambler you arethe acehigh straightflush hand of the big bend he said with stinging scorn ill bet you my roll to a greaser peso that i can deal you a hand youll be afraid to play  phil youre talkin wild growled poggin with both advice and menace in his tone  if theres anythin you hate its a man who pretends to be somebody else when hes not thet so  poggin nodded in slowgathering wrath  well jims new pardthis man dodgehes not who he seems ohho hes a hell of a lot different but i know him an when i spring his name on you poggin youll freeze to your gizzard do you get me youll freeze an your handll be stiff when it ought to be lightninall because youll realize youve been standin there five minutesfive minutes alive before him  if not hate then assuredly great passion toward poggin manifested itself in knells scornful fiery address in the shaking hand he thrust before poggins face in the ensuing silent pause knells panting could be plainly heard the other men were pale watchful cautiously edging either way to the wall leaving the principals and duane in the center of the room  spring his name then you said poggin violently with a curse  strangely knell did not even look at the man he was about to denounce he leaned toward poggin his hands his body his long head all somewhat expressive of what his face disguised  buck duane he yelled suddenly  the name did not make any great difference in poggin but knells passionate swift utterance carried the suggestion that the name ought to bring poggin to quick action it was possible too that knells manner the import of his denunciation the meaning back of all his passion held poggin bound more than the surprise for the outlaw certainly was surprised perhaps staggered at the idea that he poggin had been about to stand sponsor with fletcher for a famous outlaw hated and feared by all outlaws  knell waited a long moment and then his face broke its cold immobility in an extraordinary expression of devilish glee he had hounded the great poggin into something that gave him vicious monstrous joy  buck duane yes he broke out hotly the nueces gunman that twoshot aceofspades lone wolf you an iweve heard a thousand times of himtalked about him often an here he in front of you poggin you were backin fletchers new pard buck duane an hed fooled you both but for me but i know him an i know why he drifted in here to flash a gun on cheseldineon youon me bah dont tell me he wanted to join the gang you know a gunman for youre one yourself dont you always want to kill another man an dont you always want to meet a real man not a fourflush its the madness of the gunman an i know it well duane faced youcalled you an when i sprung his name what ought you have done what would the bossanybodyhave expected of poggin did you throw your gun swift like you have so often naw you froze an why because heres a man with the kind of nerve youd love to have because hes greatmeetin us here alone because you know hes a wonder with a gun an you love life because you an i an every damned man here had to take his front each to himself if we all drew wed kill him sure but whos goin to lead who was goin to be first who was goin to make him draw not you poggin you leave that for a lesser manmewhove lived to see you a coward it comes once to every gunman youve met your match in buck duane an by god im glad heres once i show you up  the hoarse taunting voice failed knell stepped back from the comrade he hated he was wet shaking haggard but magnificent  buck duane do you remember hardin he asked in scarcely audible voice  yes replied duane and a flash of insight made clear knells attitude  you met himforced him to drawkilled him  yes  hardin was the best pard i ever had  his teeth clicked together tight and his lips set in a thin line  the room grew still even breathing ceased the time for words had passed in that long moment of suspense knells body gradually stiffened and at last the quivering ceased he crouched his eyes had a soulpiercing fire  duane watched them he waited he caught the thoughtthe breaking of knells musclebound rigidity then he drew  through the smoke of his gun he saw two red spurts of flame knells bullets thudded into the ceiling he fell with a scream like a wild thing in agony  duane did not see knell die he watched poggin and poggin like a stricken and astounded man looked down upon his prostrate comrade  fletcher ran at duane with hands aloft  hit the trail you liar or youll hev to kill me he yelled  with hands still up he shouldered and bodied duane out of the room  duane leaped on his horse spurred and plunged away    chapter xxiii  duane returned to fairdale and camped in the mesquite till the twentythird of the month the few days seemed endless all he could think of was that the hour in which he must disgrace ray longstreth was slowly but inexorably coming in that waiting time he learned what love was and also duty when the day at last dawned he rode like one possessed down the rough slope hurdling the stones and crashing through the brush with a sound in his ears that was not all the rush of the wind something dragged at him  apparently one side of his mind was unalterably fixed while the other was a hurrying conglomeration of flashes of thought reception of sensations he could not get calmness by and by almost involuntarily he hurried faster on action seemed to make his state less oppressive it eased the weight but the farther he went on the harder it was to continue had he turned his back upon love happiness perhaps on life itself  there seemed no use to go on farther until he was absolutely sure of himself duane received a clear warning thought that such work as seemed haunting and driving him could never be carried out in the mood under which he labored he hung on to that thought several times he slowed up then stopped only to go on again at length as he mounted a low ridge fairdale lay bright and green before him not far away and the sight was a conclusive check there were mesquites on the ridge and duane sought the shade beneath them it was the noonhour with hot glary sun and no wind here duane had to have out his fight duane was utterly unlike himself he could not bring the old self back he was not the same man he once had been but he could understand why it was because of ray longstreth temptation assailed him to have her his wife it was impossible the thought was insidiously alluring duane pictured a home he saw himself riding through the cotton and rice and cane home to a stately old mansion where longeared hounds bayed him welcome and a woman looked for him and met him with happy and beautiful smile there mightthere would be children and something new strange confounding with its emotion came to life deep in duanes heart there would be children ray their mother the kind of life a lonely outcast always yearned for and never had he saw it all felt it all  but beyond and above all other claims came captain macnellys it was then there was something cold and deathlike in duanes soul for he knew whatever happened of one thing he was surehe would have to kill either longstreth or lawson longstreth might be trapped into arrest but lawson had no sense no control no fear he would snarl like a panther and go for his gun and he would have to be killed this of all consummations was the one to be calculated upon  duane came out of it all bitter and callous and sorein the most fitting of moods to undertake a difficult and deadly enterprise he had fallen upon his old strange futile dreams now rendered poignant by reason of love he drove away those dreams in their places came the images of the oliveskinned longstreth with his sharp eyes and the dark evilfaced lawson and then returned tenfold more thrilling and sinister the old strange passion to meet poggin  it was about one oclock when duane rode into fairdale the streets for the most part were deserted he went directly to find morton and zimmer he found them at length restless somber anxious but unaware of the part he had played at ord they said longstreth was home too it was possible that longstreth had arrived home in ignorance  duane told them to be on hand in town with their men in case he might need them and then with teeth locked he set off for longstreths ranch  duane stole through the bushes and trees and when nearing the porch he heard loud angry familiar voices longstreth and lawson were quarreling again how duanes lucky star guided him he had no plan of action but his brain was equal to a hundred lightningswift evolutions he meant to take any risk rather than kill longstreth both of the men were out on the porch duane wormed his way to the edge of the shrubbery and crouched low to watch for his opportunity  longstreth looked haggard and thin he was in his shirtsleeves and he had come out with a gun in his hand this he laid on a table near the wall he wore no belt  lawson was red bloated thicklipped all fiery and sweaty from drink though sober on the moment and he had the expression of a desperate man in his last stand it was his last stand though he was ignorant of that  whats your news you neednt be afraid of my feelings said lawson  ray confessed to an interest in this ranger replied longstreth  duane thought lawson would choke he was thicknecked anyway and the rush of blood made him tear at the soft collar of his shirt duane awaited his chance patient cold all his feelings shut in a vise  but why should your daughter meet this ranger demanded lawson harshly  shes in love with him and hes in love with her  duane reveled in lawsons condition the statement might have had the force of a juggernaut was longstreth sincere what was his game  lawson finding his voice cursed ray cursed the ranger then longstreth  you damned selfish fool cried longstreth in deep bitter scorn all you think of is yourselfyour loss of the girl think once of memy homemy life  then the connection subtly put out by longstreth apparently dawned upon the other somehow through this girl her father and cousin were to be betrayed duane got that impression though he could not tell how true it was certainly lawsons jealousy was his paramount emotion  to hell with you burst out lawson incoherently he was frenzied ill have her or nobody else will  you never will returned longstreth stridently so help me god id rather see her the rangers wife than yours  while lawson absorbed that shock longstreth leaned toward him all of hate and menace in his mien  lawson you made me what i am continued longstreth i backed youshielded you youre cheseldineif the truth is told now its ended i quit you im done  their gray passioncorded faces were still as stones  gentlemen duane called in farreaching voice as he stepped out youre both done  they wheeled to confront duane  dont move not a muscle not a finger he warned  longstreth read what lawson had not the mind to read his face turned from gray to ashen  what dye mean yelled lawson fiercely shrilly it was not in him to obey a command to see impending death  all quivering and strung yet with perfect control duane raised his left hand to turn back a lapel of his open vest the silver star flashed brightly  lawson howled like a dog with barbarous and insane fury with sheer impotent folly he swept a clawing hand for his gun duanes shot broke his action  before lawson ever tottered before he loosed the gun longstreth leaped behind him clasped him with left arm quick as lightning jerked the gun from both clutching fingers and sheath longstreth protected himself with the body of the dead man duane saw red flashes puffs of smoke he heard quick reports something stung his left arm then a blow like wind light of sound yet shocking in impact struck him staggered him the hot rend of lead followed the blow duanes heart seemed to explode yet his mind kept extraordinarily clear and rapid  duane heard longstreth work the action of lawsons gun he heard the hammer click fall upon empty shells longstreth had used up all the loads in lawsons gun he cursed as a man cursed at defeat duane waited cool and sure now longstreth tried to lift the dead man to edge him closer toward the table where his own gun lay but considering the peril of exposing himself he found the task beyond him he bent peering at duane under lawsons arm which flopped out from his side longstreths eyes were the eyes of a man who meant to kill there was never any mistaking the strange and terrible light of eyes like those more than once duane had a chance to aim at them at the top of longstreths head at a strip of his side  longstreth flung lawsons body off but even as it dropped before longstreth could leap as he surely intended for the gun duane covered him called piercingly to him  dont jump for the gun dont ill kill you sure as god ill kill you  longstreth stood perhaps ten feet from the table where his gun lay duane saw him calculating chances he was game he had the courage that forced duane to respect him duane just saw him measure the distance to that gun he was magnificent he meant to do it duane would have to kill him  longstreth listen cried duane swiftly the games up youre done but think of your daughter ill spare your lifeill try to get you freedom on one condition for her sake ive got you nailedall the proofs there lies lawson youre alone ive morton and men to my aid give up surrender consent to demands and ill spare you maybe i can persuade macnelly to let you go free back to your old country its for rays sake her life perhaps her happiness can be saved hurry man your answer  suppose i refuse he queried with a dark and terrible earnestness  then ill kill you in your tracks you cant move a hand your word or death hurry longstreth be a man for her sake quick another second nowill kill you  all right buck duane i give my word he said and deliberately walked to the chair and fell into it  longstreth looked strangely at the bloody blot on duanes shoulder  there come the girls he suddenly exclaimed can you help me drag lawson inside they mustnt see him  duane was facing down the porch toward the court and corrals miss longstreth and ruth had come in sight were swiftly approaching evidently alarmed the two men succeeded in drawing lawson into the house before the girls saw him  duane youre not hard hit said longstreth  reckon not replied duane  im sorry if only you could have told me sooner lawson damn him always ive split over him  but the last time longstreth  yes and i came near driving you to kill me too duane you talked me out of it for rays sake shell be in here in a minute thisll be harder than facing a gun  hard now but i hope itll turn out all right  duane will you do me a favor he asked and he seemed shamefaced  sure  let ray and ruth think lawson shot you hes dead it cant matter duane the old side of my life is coming back its been coming itll be here just about when she enters this room and by god id change places with lawson if i could  glad yousaid that longstreth replied duane and surelawson plugged me its our secret  just then ray and ruth entered the room duane heard two low cries so different in tone and he saw two white faces ray came to his side she lifted a shaking hand to point at the blood upon his breast white and mute she gazed from that to her father  papa cried ray wringing her hands  dont give way he replied huskily both you girls will need your nerve duane isnt badly hurt but floyd isis dead listen let me tell it quick theres been a fight itit was lawsonit was lawsons gun that shot duane duane let me off in fact ray he saved me im to divide my propertyreturn so far as possible what ive stolenleave texas at once with duane under arrest he says maybe he can get macnelly the ranger captain to let me go for your sake  she stood there realizing her deliverance with the dark and tragic glory of her eyes passing from her father to duane  you must rise above this said duane to her i expected this to ruin you but your father is alive he will live it down im sure i can promise you hell be free perhaps back there in louisiana the dishonor will never be known this country is far from your old home and even in san antonio and austin a mans evil repute means little then the line between a rustler and a rancher is hard to draw in these wild border days rustling is stealing cattle and i once heard a wellknown rancher say that all rich cattlemen had done a little stealing your father drifted out here and like a good many others he succeeded its perhaps just as well not to split hairs to judge him by the law and morality of a civilized country some way or other he drifted in with bad men maybe a deal that was honest somehow tied his hands this matter of land water a few stray head of stock had to be decided out of court im sure in his case he never realized where he was drifting then one thing led to another until he was face to face with dealing that took on crooked form to protect himself he bound men to him and so the gang developed many powerful gangs have developed that way out here he could not control them he became involved with them and eventually their dealings became deliberately and boldly dishonest that meant the inevitable spilling of blood sooner or later and so he grew into the leader because he was the strongest whatever he is to be judged for i think he could have been infinitely worse    chapter xxiv  on the morning of the twentysixth duane rode into bradford in time to catch the early train his wounds did not seriously incapacitate him longstreth was with him and miss longstreth and ruth herbert would not be left behind they were all leaving fairdale for ever longstreth had turned over the whole of his property to morton who was to divide it as he and his comrades believed just duane had left fairdale with his party by night passed through sanderson in the early hours of dawn and reached bradford as he had planned  that fateful morning found duane outwardly calm but inwardly he was in a tumult he wanted to rush to val verde would captain macnelly be there with his rangers as duane had planned for them to be memory of that tawny poggin returned with strange passion duane had borne hours and weeks and months of waiting had endured the long hours of the outlaw but now he had no patience the whistle of the train made him leap  it was a fast train yet the ride seemed slow  duane disliking to face longstreth and the passengers in the car changed his seat to one behind his prisoner they had seldom spoken longstreth sat with bowed head deep in thought the girls sat in a seat near by and were pale but composed occasionally the train halted briefly at a station the latter half of that ride duane had observed a wagonroad running parallel with the railroad sometimes right alongside at others near or far away when the train was about twenty miles from val verde duane espied a dark group of horsemen trotting eastward his blood beat like a hammer at his temples the gang he thought he recognized the tawny poggin and felt a strange inward contraction he thought he recognized the cleancut blossom kane the blackbearded giant boldt the redfaced panhandle smith and fletcher there was another man strange to him was that knell no it could not have been knell  duane leaned over the seat and touched longstreth on the shoulder  look he whispered cheseldine was stiff he had already seen  the train flashed by the outlaw gang receded out of range of sight  did you notice knell wasnt with them whispered duane  duane did not speak to longstreth again till the train stopped at val verde  they got off the car and the girls followed as naturally as ordinary travelers the station was a good deal larger than that at bradford and there was considerable action and bustle incident to the arrival of the train  duanes sweeping gaze searched faces rested upon a man who seemed familiar this fellows look too was that of one who knew duane but was waiting for a sign a cue then duane recognized himmacnelly cleanshaven without mustache he appeared different younger  when macnelly saw that duane intended to greet him to meet him he hurried forward a keen light flashed from his eyes he was glad eager yet suppressing himself and the glances he sent back and forth from duane to longstreth were questioning doubtful certainly longstreth did not look the part of an outlaw  duane lord im glad to see you was the captains greeting then at closer look into duanes face his warmth fledsomething he saw there checked his enthusiasm or at least its utterance  macnelly shake hand with cheseldine said duane lowvoiced  the ranger captain stood dumb motionless but he saw longstreths instant action and awkwardly he reached for the outstretched hand  any of your men down here queried duane sharply  no theyre uptown  come macnelly you walk with him weve ladies in the party ill come behind with them  they set off uptown longstreth walked as if he were with friends on the way to dinner the girls were mute macnelly walked like a man in a trance there was not a word spoken in four blocks  presently duane espied a stone building on a corner of the broad street there was a big sign ranchers bank  theres the hotel said macnelly some of my men are there weve scattered around  they crossed the street went through office and lobby and then duane asked macnelly to take them to a private room without a word the captain complied when they were all inside duane closed the door and drawing a deep breath as if of relief he faced them calmly  miss longstreth you and miss ruth try to make yourselves comfortable now he said and dont be distressed then he turned to his captain macnelly this girl is the daughter of the man ive brought to you and this one is his niece  then duane briefly related longstreths story and though he did not spare the rustler chief he was generous  when i went after longstreth concluded duane it was either to kill him or offer him freedom on conditions so i chose the latter for his daughters sake he has already disposed of all his property i believe hell live up to the conditions hes to leave texas never to return the name cheseldine has been a mystery and now itll fade  a few moments later duane followed macnelly to a large room like a hall and here were men reading and smoking duane knew themrangers  macnelly beckoned to his men  boys here he is  how many men have you asked duane  fifteen  macnelly almost embraced duane would probably have done so but for the dark grimness that seemed to be coming over the man instead he glowed he sputtered he tried to talk to wave his hands he was beside himself and his rangers crowded closer eager like hounds ready to run they all talked at once and the word most significant and frequent in their speech was outlaws  macnelly clapped his fist in his hand  thisll make the adjutant sick with joy maybe we wont have it on the governor well show them about the ranger service duane howd you ever do it  now captain not the half nor the quarter of this jobs done the gangs coming down the road i saw them from the train theyll ride into town on the dottwothirty  how many asked macnelly  poggin blossom kane panhandle smith boldt jim fletcher and another man i dont know these are the picked men of cheseldines gang ill bet theyll be the fastest hardest bunch you rangers ever faced  pogginthats the hard nut to crack ive heard their records since ive been in val verde wheres knell they say hes a boy but hell and blazes  knells dead  ah exclaimed macnelly softly then he grew businesslike cool and of harder aspect duane its your game today im only a ranger under orders were all under your orders weve absolute faith in you make your plan quick so i can go around and post the boys whore not here  you understand theres no sense in trying to arrest poggin kane and that lot queried duane  no i dont understand that replied macnelly bluntly  it cant be done the drop cant be got on such men if you meet them they shoot and mighty quick and straight poggin that outlaw has no equal with a gununlesshes got to be killed quick theyll all have to be killed theyre all bad desperate know no fear are lightning in action  very well duane then its a fight thatll be easier perhaps the boys are spoiling for a fight out with your plan now  put one man at each end of this street just at the edge of town let him hide there with a rifle to block the escape of any outlaw that we might fail to get i had a good look at the bank building its well situated for our purpose put four men up in that room over the bankfour men two at each open window let them hide till the game begins they want to be there so in case these foxy outlaws get wise before theyre down on the ground or inside the bank the rest of your men put inside behind the counters where theyll hide now go over to the bank spring the thing on the bank officials and dont let them shut up the bank you want their aid let them make sure of their gold but the clerks and cashier ought to be at their desks or window when poggin rides up hell glance in before he gets down they make no mistakes these fellows we must be slicker than they are or lose when you get the bank people wise send your men over one by one no hurry no excitement no unusual thing to attract notice in the bank  all right thats great tell me where do you intend to wait  duane heard macnellys question and it struck him peculiarly he had seemed to be planning and speaking mechanically as he was confronted by the fact it nonplussed him somewhat and he became thoughtful with lowered head  wherell you wait duane insisted macnelly with keen eyes speculating  ill wait in front just inside the door replied duane with an effort  why demanded the captain  well began duane slowly poggin will get down first and start in but the others wont be far behind theyll not get swift till inside the thing isthey mustnt get clear inside because the instant they do theyll pull guns that means death to somebody if we can we want to stop them just at the door  but will you hide asked macnelly  hide the idea had not occurred to duane  theres a wideopen doorway a sort of round hall a vestibule with steps leading up to the bank theres a door in the vestibule too it leads somewhere we can put men in there you can be there  duane was silent  see here duane began macnelly nervously you shant take any undue risk here youll hide with the rest of us  no the word was wrenched from duane  macnelly stared and then a strange comprehending light seemed to flit over his face  duane i can give you no orders today he said distinctly im only offering advice need you take any more risks youve done a grand job for the servicealready youve paid me a thousand times for that pardon youve redeemed yourselfthe governor the adjutantgeneralthe whole state will rise up and honor you the games almost up well kill these outlaws or enough of them to break for ever their power i say as a ranger need you take more risk than your captain  still duane remained silent he was locked between two forces and one a tide that was bursting at its bounds seemed about to overwhelm him finally that side of him the retreating self the weaker found a voice  captain you want this job to be sure he asked  certainly  ive told you the way i alone know the kind of men to be met just what ill do or where ill be i cant say yet in meetings like this the moment decides but ill be there  macnelly spread wide his hands looked helplessly at his curious and sympathetic rangers and shook his head  now youve done your worklaid the trapis this strange move of yours going to be fair to miss longstreth asked macnelly in significant low voice  like a great tree chopped at the roots duane vibrated to that he looked up as if he had seen a ghost  mercilessly the ranger captain went on you can win her duane oh you cant fool me i was wise in a minute fight with us from coverthen go back to her you will have served the texas rangers as no other man has ill accept your resignation youll be free honored happy that girl loves you i saw it in her eyes shes  but duane cut him short with a fierce gesture he lunged up to his feet and the rangers fell back dark silent grim as he had been still there was a transformation singularly more sinister stranger  enough im done he said somberly ive planned do we agreeor shall i meet poggin and his gang alone  macnelly cursed and again threw up his hands this time in baffled chagrin there was deep regret in his dark eyes as they rested upon duane  duane was left alone  never had his mind been so quick so clear so wonderful in its understanding of what had heretofore been intricate and elusive impulses of his strange nature his determination was to meet poggin meet him before any one else had a chancepoggin firstand then the others he was as unalterable in that decision as if on the instant of its acceptance he had become stone  why then came realization he was not a ranger now he cared nothing for the state he had no thought of freeing the community of a dangerous outlaw of ridding the country of an obstacle to its progress and prosperity he wanted to kill poggin it was significant now that he forgot the other outlaws he was the gunman the gunthrower the gunfighter passionate and terrible his fathers blood that dark and fierce strain his mothers spirit that strong and unquenchable spirit of the surviving pioneerthese had been in him and the killings one after another the wild and haunted years had made him absolutely in spite of his will the gunman he realized it now bitterly hopelessly the thing he had intelligence enough to hate he had become at last he shuddered under the driving ruthless inhuman bloodlust of the gunman long ago he had seemed to seal in a tomb that horror of his kindthe need in order to forget the haunting sleepless presence of his last victim to go out and kill another but it was still there in his mind and now it stalked out worse more powerful magnified by its rest augmented by the violent passions peculiar and inevitable to that strange wild product of the texas frontierthe gunfighter and those passions were so violent so raw so base so much lower than what ought to have existed in a thinking man actual pride of his record actual vanity in his speed with a gun actual jealousy of any rival  duane could not believe it but there he was without a choice what he had feared for years had become a monstrous reality respect for himself blindness a certain honor that he had clung to while in outlawryall like scales seemed to fall away from him he stood stripped bare his soul nakedthe soul of cain always since the first brand had been forced and burned upon him he had been ruined but now with conscience flayed to the quick yet utterly powerless over this tiger instinct he was lost he said it he admitted it and at the utter abasement the soul he despised suddenly leaped and quivered with the thought of ray longstreth  then came agony as he could not govern all the chances of this fatal meetingas all his swift and deadly genius must be occupied with poggin perhaps in vainas hardshooting men whom he could not watch would be close behind this almost certainly must be the end of buck duane that did not matter but he loved the girl he wanted her all her sweetness her fire and pleading returned to torture him  at that moment the door opened and ray longstreth entered  duane she said softly captain macnelly sent me to you  but you shouldnt have come replied duane  as soon as he told me i would have come whether he wished it or not you left meall of usstunned i had no time to thank you oh i dowith all my soul it was noble of you father is overcome he didnt expect so much and hell be true but duane i was told to hurry and here im selfishly using time  go thenand leave me you mustnt unnerve me now when theres a desperate game to finish  need it be desperate she whispered coming close to him  yes it cant be else  macnelly had sent her to weaken him of that duane was sure and he felt that she had wanted to come her eyes were dark strained beautiful and they shed a light upon duane he had never seen before  youre going to take some mad risk she said let me persuade you not to you saidyou cared for meand ioh duanedont youknow  the low voice deep sweet as an old chord faltered and broke and failed  duane sustained a sudden shock and an instant of paralyzed confusion of thought  she moved she swept out her hands and the wonder of her eyes dimmed in a flood of tears  my god you cant care for me he cried hoarsely  then she met him hands outstretched  but i doi do  swift as light duane caught her and held her to his breast he stood holding her tight with the feel of her warm throbbing breast and the clasp of her arms as flesh and blood realities to fight a terrible fear he felt her and for the moment the might of it was stronger than all the demons that possessed him and he held her as if she had been his soul his strength on earth his hope of heaven against his lips  the strife of doubt all passed he found his sight again and there rushed over him a tide of emotion unutterably sweet and full strong like an intoxicating wine deep as his nature something glorious and terrible as the blaze of the sun to one long in darkness he had become an outcast a wanderer a gunman a victim of circumstances he had lost and suffered worse than death in that loss he had gone down the endless bloody trail a killer of men a fugitive whose mind slowly and inevitably closed to all except the instinct to survive and a black despair and now with this woman in his arms her swelling breast against his in this moment almost of resurrection he bent under the storm of passion and joy possible only to him who had endured so much  do you carea little he whispered unsteadily  he bent over her looking deep into the dark wet eyes  she uttered a low laugh that was half sob and her arms slipped up to his neck  a littler oh duaneduanea great deal  their lips met in their first kiss the sweetness the fire of her mouth seemed so new so strange so irresistible to duane his sore and hungry heart throbbed with thick and heavy beats he felt the outcasts need of love and he gave up to the enthralling moment she met him halfway returned kiss for kiss clasp for clasp her face scarlet her eyes closed till her passion and strength spent she fell back upon his shoulder  duane suddenly thought she was going to faint he divined then that she had understood him would have denied him nothing not even her life in that moment but she was overcome and he suffered a pang of regret at his unrestraint  presently she recovered and she drew only the closer and leaned upon him with her face upturned he felt her hands on his and they were soft clinging strong like steel under velvet he felt the rise and fall the warmth of her breast a tremor ran over him he tried to draw back and if he succeeded a little her form swayed with him pressing closer she held her face up and he was compelled to look it was wonderful now white yet glowing with the red lips parted and dark eyes alluring but that was not all there was passion unquenchable spirit womans resolve deep and mighty  i love you duane she said for my sake dont go out to meet this outlaw face to face its something wild in you conquer it if you love me  duane became suddenly weak and when he did take her into his arms again he scarcely had strength to lift her to a seat beside him she seemed more than a dead weight her calmness had fled she was throbbing palpitating quivering with hot wet cheeks and arms that clung to him like vines she lifted her mouth to his whispering kiss me she meant to change him hold him  duane bent down and her arms went round his neck and drew him close with his lips on hers he seemed to float away that kiss closed his eyes and he could not lift his head he sat motionless holding her blind and helpless wrapped in a sweet dark glory she kissed himone long endless kissor else a thousand times her lips her wet cheeks her hair the softness the fragrance of her the tender clasp of her arms the swell of her breastall these seemed to inclose him  duane could not put her from him he yielded to her lips and arms watching her involuntarily returning her caresses sure now of her intent fascinated by the sweetness of her bewildered almost lost this was what it was to be loved by a woman his years of outlawry had blotted out any boyish love he might have known this was what he had to give upall this wonder of her sweet person this strange fire he feared yet loved this mate his deep and tortured soul recognized never until that moment had he divined the meaning of a woman to a man that meaning was physical inasmuch that he learned what beauty was what marvel in the touch of quickening flesh and it was spiritual in that he saw there might have been for him under happier circumstances a life of noble deeds lived for such a woman  dont go dont go she cried as he started violently  i must dear goodby remember i loved you  he pulled her hands loose from his stepped back  ray dearesti believeill come back he whispered  these last words were falsehood  he reached the door gave her one last piercing glance to fix for ever in memory that white face with its dark staring tragic eyes  duane  he fled with that moan like thunder death hell in his ears  to forget her to get back his nerve he forced into mind the image of pogginpoggin the tawnyhaired the yelloweyed like a jaguar with his rippling muscles he brought back his sense of the outlaws wonderful presence his own unaccountable fear and hate yes poggin had sent the cold sickness of fear to his marrow why since he hated life so poggin was his supreme test and this abnormal and stupendous instinct now deep as the very foundation of his life demanded its wild and fatal issue there was a horrible thrill in his sudden remembrance that poggin likewise had been taunted in fear of him  so the dark tide overwhelmed duane and when he left the room he was fierce implacable steeled to any outcome quick like a panther somber as death in the thrall of his strange passion  there was no excitement in the street he crossed to the bank corner a clock inside pointed the hour of two he went through the door into the vestibule looked around passed up the steps into the bank the clerks were at their desks apparently busy but they showed nervousness the cashier paled at sight of duane there were menthe rangerscrouching down behind the low partition all the windows had been removed from the iron grating before the desks the safe was closed there was no money in sight a customer came in spoke to the cashier and was told to come tomorrow  duane returned to the door he could see far down the street out into the country there he waited and minutes were eternities he saw no person near him he heard no sound he was insulated in his unnatural strain  at a few minutes before half past two a dark compact body of horsemen appeared far down turning into the road they came at a sharp trota group that would have attracted attention anywhere at any time they came a little faster as they entered town then faster still now they were four blocks away now three now two duane backed down the middle of the vestibule up the steps and halted in the center of the wide doorway  there seemed to be a rushing in his ears through which pierced sharp ringing clipclop of iron hoofs he could see only the corner of the street but suddenly into that shot leanlimbed dusty bay horses there was a clattering of nervous hoofs pulled to a halt  duane saw the tawny poggin speak to his companions he dismounted quickly they followed suit they had the manner of ranchers about to conduct some business no guns showed poggin started leisurely for the bank door quickening step a little the others close together came behind him blossom kane had a bag in his left hand jim fletcher was left at the curb and he had already gathered up the bridles  poggin entered the vestibule first with kane on one side boldt on the other a little in his rear  as he strode in he saw duane  hells fire he cried  something inside duane burst piercing all of him with cold was it that fear  buck duane echoed kane  one instant poggin looked up and duane looked down  like a striking jaguar poggin moved almost as quickly duane threw his arm  the guns boomed almost together  duane felt a blow just before he pulled trigger his thoughts came fast like the strange dots before his eyes his rising gun had loosened in his hand poggin had drawn quicker a tearing agony encompassed his breast he pulledpulledat random thunder of booming shots all about him red flashes jets of smoke shrill yells he was sinking the end yes the end with fading sight he saw kane go down then boldt but supreme torture bitterer than death poggin stood mane like a lions back to the wall bloodyfaced grand with his guns spouting red  all faded darkened the thunder deadened duane fell seemed floating there it driftedray longstreths sweet face white with dark tragic eyes fading from his sight fading  fading    chapter xxv  light shone before duanes eyesthick strange light that came and went for a long time dull and booming sounds rushed by filling all it was a dream in which there was nothing a drifting under a burden darkness light sound movement and vague obscure sense of timetime that was very long there was firecreeping consuming fire a dark cloud of flame enveloped him rolled him away  he saw then dimly a room that was strange strange people moving about over him with faint voices far away things in a dream he saw again clearly and consciousness returned still unreal still strange full of those vague and faraway things then he was not dead he lay stiff like a stone with a weight ponderous as a mountain upon him and all his bound body racked in slow dullbeating agony  a womans face hovered over him white and tragiceyed like one of his old haunting phantoms yet sweet and eloquent then a mans face bent over him looked deep into his eyes and seemed to whisper from a distance duaneduane ah he knew me  after that there was another long interval of darkness when the light came again clearer this time the same earnestfaced man bent over him it was macnelly and with recognition the past flooded back  duane tried to speak his lips were weak and he could scarcely move them  poggin he whispered his first real conscious thought was for poggin ruling passioneternal instinct  poggin is dead duane shot to pieces replied macnelly solemnly what a fight he made he killed two of my men wounded others god he was a tiger he used up three guns before we downed him  whogotaway  fletcher the man with the horses we downed all the others duane the jobs doneits done why man youre  what ofofher  miss longstreth has been almost constantly at your bedside she helped the doctor she watched your wounds and duane the other night when you sank lowso lowi think it was her spirit that held yours back oh shes a wonderful girl duane she never gave up never lost her nerve for a moment well were going to take you home and shell go with us colonel longstreth left for louisiana right after the fight i advised it there was great excitement it was best for him to leave  have iachanceto recover  chance why man exclaimed the captain youll get well youll pack a sight of lead all your life but you can stand that duane the whole southwest knows your story you need never again be ashamed of the name buck duane the brand outlaw is washed out texas believes youve been a secret ranger all the time youre a hero and now think of home your mother of this noble girlof your future  the rangers took duane home to wellston  a railroad had been built since duane had gone into exile wellston had grown a noisy crowd surrounded the station but it stilled as duane was carried from the train  a sea of faces pressed close some were faces he rememberedschoolmates friends old neighbors there was an upflinging of many hands duane was being welcomed home to the town from which he had fled a deadness within him broke this welcome hurt him somehow quickened him and through his cold being his weary mind passed a change his sight dimmed  then there was a white house his old home how strange yet how real his heart beat fast had so many many years passed familiar yet strange it was and all seemed magnified  they carried him in these ranger comrades and laid him down and lifted his head upon pillows the house was still though full of people duanes gaze sought the open door  some one entereda tall girl in white with dark wet eyes and a light upon her face she was leading an old lady grayhaired austerefaced somber and sad his mother she was feeble but she walked erect she was pale shaking yet maintained her dignity  the some one in white uttered a low cry and knelt by duanes bed his mother flung wide her arms with a strange gesture  this man theyve not brought back my boy this mans his father where is my son my sonoh my son  when duane grew stronger it was a pleasure to lie by the west window and watch uncle jim whittle his stick and listen to his talk the old man was broken now he told many interesting things about people duane had knownpeople who had grown up and married failed succeeded gone away and died but it was hard to keep uncle jim off the subject of guns outlaws fights he could not seem to divine how mention of these things hurt duane uncle jim was childish now and he had a great pride in his nephew he wanted to hear of all of duanes exile and if there was one thing more than another that pleased him it was to talk about the bullets which duane carried in his body  five bullets aint it he asked for the hundredth time  five in that last scrap by gum and you had six before  yes uncle replied duane  five and six that makes eleven by gum a mans a man to carry all that lead but buck you could carry more theres that nigger edwards right here in wellston hes got a ton of bullets in him doesnt seem to mind them none and theres cole miller ive seen him been a bad man in his day they say he packs twentythree bullets but hes bigger than yougot more flesh funny wasnt it buck about the doctor only bein able to cut one bullet out of youthat one in your breastbone it was a fortyone caliber an unusual cartridge i saw it and i wanted it but miss longstreth wouldnt part with it buck there was a bullet left in one of poggins guns and that bullet was the same kind as the one cut out of you by gum boy itd have killed you if itd stayed there  it would indeed uncle replied duane and the old haunting somber mood returned  but duane was not often at the mercy of childish old heroworshiping uncle jim miss longstreth was the only person who seemed to divine duanes gloomy mood and when she was with him she warded off all suggestion  one afternoon while she was there at the west window a message came for him they read it together  you have saved the ranger service to the lone star state  macnelley  ray knelt beside him at the window and he believed she meant to speak then of the thing they had shunned her face was still white but sweeter now warm with rich life beneath the marble and her dark eyes were still intent still haunted by shadows but no longer tragic  im glad for macnellys sake as well as the states said duane  she made no reply to that and seemed to be thinking deeply duane shrank a little  the painis it any worse today she asked instantly  no its the same it will always be the same im full of lead you know but i dont mind a little pain  thenits the old moodthe fear she whispered tell me  yes it haunts me ill be well soonable to go out then thatthat hell will come back  no no she said with emotion  some drunken cowboy some fool with a gun will hunt me out in every town wherever i go he went on miserably buck duane to kill buck duane  hush dont speak so listen you remember that day in val verde when i came to youplead with you not to meet poggin oh that was a terrible hour for me but it showed me the truth i saw the struggle between your passion to kill and your love for me i could have saved you then had i known what i know now now i understand thatthat thing which haunts you but youll never have to draw again youll never have to kill another man thank god  like a drowning man he would have grasped at straws but he could not voice his passionate query  she put tender arms round his neck because youll have me with you always she replied because always i shall be between you and thatthat terrible thing  it seemed with the spoken thought absolute assurance of her power came to her duane realized instantly that he was in the arms of a stronger woman that she who had plead with him that fatal day  wellwell be married and leave texas she said softly with the red blood rising rich and dark in her cheeks  ray  yes we will though youre laggard in asking me sir  but dearsuppose he replied huskily suppose there might bebe childrena boy a boy with his fathers blood  i pray god there will be i do not fear what you fear but even sohell be half my blood  duane felt the storm rise and break in him and his terror was that of joy quelling fear the shining glory of love in this womans eyes made him weak as a child how could she love himhow could she so bravely face a future with him yet she held him in her arms twining her hands round his neck and pressing close to him her faith and love and beautythese she meant to throw between him and all that terrible past they were her power and she meant to use them all he dared not think of accepting her sacrifice  but rayyou dear noble girlim poor i have nothing and im a cripple  oh youll be well some day she replied and listen i have money my mother left me well off all she had was her fathersdo you understand well take uncle jim and your mother well go to louisianato my old home its far from here theres a plantation to work there are horses and cattlea great cypress forest to cut oh youll have much to do youll forget there youll learn to love my home its a beautiful old place there are groves where the gray moss blows all day and the nightingales sing all night  my darling cried duane brokenly no no no  yet he knew in his heart that he was yielding to her that he could not resist her a moment longer what was this madness of love  well be happy she whispered oh i know comecomecome  her eyes were closing heavylidded and she lifted sweet tremulous waiting lips  with bursting heart duane bent to them then he held her close pressed to him while with dim eyes he looked out over the line of low hills in the west down where the sun was setting gold and red down over the nueces and the wild brakes of the rio grande which he was never to see again  it was in this solemn and exalted moment that duane accepted happiness and faced a new life trusting this brave and tender woman to be stronger than the dark and fateful passion that had shadowed his past  it would come backthat wind of flame that madness to forget that driving relentless instinct for blood it would come back with those pale drifting haunting faces and the accusing fading eyes but all his life always between them and him rendering them powerless would be the faith and love and beauty of this noble woman
