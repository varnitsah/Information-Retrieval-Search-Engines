  copyright 1913 by gk chesterton   the knickerbocker press new york     the characters  the duke doctor grimthorpe the rev cyril smith morris carleon hastings the dukes secretary the stranger patricia carleon  the action takes place in the dukes drawingroom     note  this play was presented under the management of kenelm foss at the little theatre london on november 7 1913 with the following cast  the stranger             franklin dyall patricia carleon         miss grace croft the rev cyril smith     op heggie dr grimthorpe           william farren the duke                 fred lewis hastings                 frank randell morris carleon           lyonel watts     the prelude        scene a plantation of thin young trees in a misty and rainy      twilight some woodland blossom showing the patches on the earth      between the stems       the stranger is discovered a cloaked figure with a pointed hood      his costume might belong to modern or any other time and the      conical hood is so drawn over the head that little can be seen of      the face       a distant voice a womans is heard halfsinging halfchanting      unintelligible words the cloaked figure raises its head and      listens with interest the song draws nearer and patricia carleon      enters she is dark and slight and has a dreamy expression      though she is artistically dressed her hair is a little wild she      has a broken branch of some flowering tree in her hand she does      not notice the stranger and though he has watched her with      interest makes no sign suddenly she perceives him and starts      back  patricia oh who are you  stranger ah who am i commences to mutter to himself and maps out the ground with his staff       i have a hat but not to wear      i wear a sword but not to slay      and ever in my bag i bear      a pack of cards but not to play  patricia what are you what are you saying  stranger it is the language of the fairies o daughter of eve  patricia but i never thought fairies were like you why you are taller than i am  stranger we are of such stature as we will but the elves grow small not large when they would mix with mortals  patricia you mean they are beings greater than we are  stranger daughter of men if you would see a fairy as he truly is look for his head above all the stars and his feet amid the floors of the sea old women have taught you that the fairies are too small to be seen but i tell you the fairies are too mighty to be seen for they are the elder gods before whom the giants were like pigmies they are the elemental spirits and any one of them is larger than the world and you look for them in acorns and on toadstools and wonder that you never see them  patricia but you come in the shape and size of a man  stranger because i would speak with a woman  patricia drawing back in awe i think you are growing taller as you speak       the scene appears to fade away and give place to the milieu of      act one the dukes drawingroom an apartment with open french      windows or any opening large enough to show a garden and one house      fairly near it is evening and there is a red lamp lighted in the      house beyond the rev cyril smith is sitting with hat and      umbrella beside him evidently a visitor he is a young man with      the highest of high church dogcollars and all the qualities of a      restrained fanatic he is one of the christian socialist sort and      takes his priesthood seriously he is an honest man and not an      ass  to him enters mr hastings with papers in his hand  hastings oh good evening you are mr smith pause i mean you are the rector i think  smith i am the rector  hastings i am the dukes secretary his grace asks me to say that he hopes to see you very soon but he is engaged just now with the doctor  smith is the duke ill  hastings laughing oh no the doctor has come to ask him to help some cause or other the duke is never ill  smith is the doctor with him now  hastings why strictly speaking he is not the doctor has gone over the road to fetch a paper connected with his proposal but he hasnt far to go as you can see thats his red lamp at the end of his grounds  smith yes i know i am much obliged to you i will wait as long as is necessary  hastings cheerfully oh it wont be very long       exit       enter by the garden doors dr grimthorpe reading an open paper      he is an oldfashioned practitioner very much of a gentleman and      very carefully dressed in a slightly antiquated style he is about      sixty years old and might have been a friend of huxleys  doctor folding up the paper i beg your pardon sir i did not notice there was anyone here  smith amicably i beg yours a new clergyman cannot expect to be expected i only came to see the duke about some local affairs  doctor smiling and so oddly enough did i but i suppose we should both like to get hold of him by a separate ear  smith oh theres no disguise as far as im concerned ive joined this league for starting a model publichouse in the parish and in plain words ive come to ask his grace for a subscription to it  doctor grimly and as it happens i have joined in the petition against the erection of a model publichouse in this parish the similarity of our position grows with every instant  smith yes i think we must have been twins  doctor more goodhumouredly well what is a model publichouse do you mean a toy  smith i mean a place where englishmen can get decent drink and drink it decently do you call that a toy  doctor no i should call that a conjuring trick or in apology to your cloth i will say a miracle  smith i accept the apology to my cloth i am doing my duty as a priest how can the church have a right to make men fast if she does not allow them to feast  doctor bitterly and when you have done feasting them you will send them to me to be cured  smith yes and when youve done curing them youll send them to me to be buried  doctor after a pause laughing well you have all the old doctrines it is only fair you should have all the old jokes too  smith laughing also by the way you call it a conjuring trick that poor people should drink moderately  doctor i call it a chemical discovery that alcohol is not a food  smith you dont drink wine yourself  doctor mildly startled drink wine wellwhat else is there to drink  smith so drinking decently is a conjuring trick that you can do anyhow  doctor still goodhumouredly well well let us hope so talking about conjuring tricks there is to be conjuring and all kinds of things here this afternoon  smith conjuring indeed why is that       enter hastings with a letter in each hand  hastings his grace will be with you presently he asked me to deal with the business matter first of all       he gives a note to each of them  smith turning eagerly to the doctor but this is rather splendid the dukes given £50 to the new publichouse  hastings the duke is very liberal       collects papers  doctor examining his cheque very but this is rather curious he has also given £50 to the league for opposing the new publichouse  hastings the duke is very liberalminded       exit  smith staring at his cheque liberalminded absentminded i should call it  doctor sitting down and lighting a cigar well yes the duke does suffer a little from absence puts his cigar in his mouth and pulls during the pause of mind he is all for compromise dont you know the kind of man who when you talk to him about the five best breeds of dog always ends up by buying a mongrel the duke is the kindest of men and always trying to please everybody he generally finishes by pleasing nobody  smith yes i think i know the sort of thing  doctor take this conjuring for instance you know the duke has two wards who are to live with him now  smith yes i heard something about a nephew and niece from ireland  doctor the niece came from ireland some months ago but the nephew comes back from america tonight he gets up abruptly and walks about the room i think i will tell you all about it in spite of your precious publichouse you seem to me to be a sane man and i fancy i shall want all the sane men i can get tonight  smith rising also i am at your service do you know i rather guessed you did not come here only to protest against my precious publichouse  doctor striding about in subdued excitement well you guessed right i was family physician to the dukes brother in ireland i knew the family pretty well  smith quietly i suppose you mean you knew something odd about the family  doctor well they saw fairies and things of that sort  smith and i suppose to the medical mind seeing fairies means much the same as seeing snakes  doctor with a sour smile well they saw them in ireland i suppose its quite correct to see fairies in ireland its like gambling at monte carlo its quite respectable but i do draw the line at their seeing fairies in england i do object to their bringing their ghosts and goblins and witches into the poor dukes own back garden and within a yard of my own red lamp it shows a lack of tact  smith but i do understand that the dukes nephew and niece see witches and fairies between here and your lamp       he walks to the garden window and looks out  doctor well the nephew has been in america it stands to reason you cant see fairies in america but there is this sort of superstition in the family and i am not easy in my mind about the girl  smith why what does she do  doctor oh she wanders about the park and the woods in the evenings damp evenings for choice she calls it the celtic twilight ive no use for the celtic twilight myself it has a tendency to get on the chest but what is worse she is always talking about meeting somebody some elf or wizard or something i dont like it at all  smith have you told the duke  doctor with a grim smile oh yes i told the duke the result was the conjurer  smith with amazement the conjurer  doctor puts down his cigar in the ashtray the duke is indescribable he will be here presently and you shall judge for yourself put two or three facts or ideas before him and the thing he makes out of them is always something that seems to have nothing to do with it tell any other human being about a girl dreaming of the fairies and her practical brother from america and he would settle it in some obvious way and satisfy some one send her to america or let her have her fairies in ireland now the duke thinks a conjurer would just meet the case i suppose he vaguely thinks it would brighten things up and somehow satisfy the believers interest in supernatural things and the unbelievers interest in smart things as a matter of fact the unbeliever thinks the conjurers a fraud and the believer thinks hes a fraud too the conjurer satisfies nobody that is why he satisfies the duke       enter the duke with hastings carrying papers the duke is      a healthy hearty man in tweeds with a rather wandering eye in      the present state of the peerage it is necessary to explain that      the duke though an ass is a gentleman  duke goodmorning mr smith so sorry to have kept you waiting but were rather in a rush today turns to hastings who has gone over to a table with the papers you know mr carleon is coming this afternoon  hastings yes your grace his train will be in by now i have sent the trap  duke thank you turning to the other two my nephew dr grimthorpe morris you know miss carleons brother from america i hear hes been doing great things out there petrol or something must move with the times eh  doctor im afraid mr smith doesnt always agree with moving with the times  duke oh come come progress you know progress of course i know how busy you are you mustnt overwork yourself you know hastings was telling me you laughed over those subscriptions of mine well well i believe in looking at both sides of a question you know aspects as old buffle called them aspects with an allembracing gesture of the arm you represent the tendency to drink in moderation and you do good in your way the doctor represents the tendency not to drink at all and he does good in his way we cant be ancient britons you know       a prolonged and puzzled silence such as always follows the more      abrupt of the dukes associations or disassociations of thought  smith at last faintly ancient britons  doctor to smith in a low voice dont bother its only his broadmindedness  duke with unabated cheerfulness i saw the place youre putting up for it mr smith very good work very good work indeed art for the people eh i particularly liked that woodwork over the west doorim glad to see youre using the new sort of graining  why it all reminds one of the french revolution       another silence as the duke lounges alertly about the room      smith speaks to the doctor in an undertone  smith does it remind you of the french revolution  doctor as much as of anything else his grace never reminds me of anything       a young and very high american voice is heard calling in the      garden say could somebody see to one of these trunks       mr hastings goes out into the garden he returns with morris      carleon a very young man hardly more than a boy but with very      grownup american dress and manners he is dark smallish and      active and the racial type under his americanism is irish  morris humorously as he puts in his head at the window see here does a duke live here  doctor who is nearest to him with great gravity yes only one  morris i reckon hes the one i want anyhow im his nephew       the duke who is ruminating in the foreground with one eye      rather off turns at the voice and shakes morris warmly by the      hand  duke delighted to see you my dear boy i hear youve been doing very well for yourself  morris laughing well pretty well duke and better still for paul t vandam i guess i manage the old mans mines out in arizona you know  duke shaking his head sagaciously ah very goahead man very goahead methods im told well i dare say he does a great deal of good with his money and we cant go back to the spanish inquisition       silence during which the three men look at each other  morris abruptly and hows patricia  duke a little hazily oh shes very well i think she       he hesitates slightly  morris smiling well then wheres patricia       there is a slightly embarrassed pause and the doctor speaks  doctor miss carleon is walking about the grounds i think       morris goes to the garden doors and looks out  morris its a mighty chilly night to choose does my sister commonly select such evenings to take the airand the damp  doctor after a pause if i may say so i quite agree with you i have often taken the liberty of warning your sister against going out in all weathers like this  duke expansively waving his hands about the artist temperament what i always call the artistic temperament wordsworth you know and all that       silence  morris staring all what  duke continuing to lecture with enthusiasm why everythings temperament you know its her temperament to see the fairies its my temperament not to see the fairies why ive walked all round the grounds twenty times and never saw a fairy well its like that about this wizard or whatever she calls it for her there is somebody there for us there would not be somebody there dont you see  morris advancing excitedly somebody there what do you mean  duke airily well you cant quite call it a man  morris violently a man  duke well as old buffle used to say what is a man  morris with a strong rise of the american accent with your permission duke i eliminate old buffle do you mean that anybody has had the tarnation coolness to suggest that some man  duke oh not a man you know a magician something mythical you know  smith not a man but a medicine man  doctor grimly i am a medicine man  morris and you dont look mythical doc       he bites his finger and begins to pace restlessly up and down the      room  duke well you know the artistic temperament  morris turning suddenly see here duke in most commercial ways were a pretty forward country in these moral ways were content to be a pretty backward country and if you ask me whether i like my sister walking about the woods on a night like this well i dont  duke i am afraid you americans arent so advanced as id hoped why as old buffle used to say       as he speaks a distant voice is heard singing in the garden it      comes nearer and nearer and smith turns suddenly to the doctor  smith whose voice is that  doctor it is no business of mine to decide  morris walking to the window you need not trouble i know who it is       enter patricia carleon  still agitated patricia where have you been  patricia rather wearily oh in fairyland  doctor genially and whereabouts is that  patricia its rather different from other places its either nowhere or its wherever you are  morris sharply has it any inhabitants  patricia generally only two oneself and ones shadow but whether he is my shadow or i am his shadow is never found out  morris he who  patricia seeming to understand his annoyance for the first time and smiling oh you neednt get conventional about it morris he is not a mortal  morris whats his name  patricia we have no names there you never really know anybody if you know his name  morris what does he look like  patricia i have only met him in the twilight he seems robed in a long cloak with a peaked cap or hood like the elves in my nursery stories sometimes when i look out of the window here i see him passing round this house like a shadow and see his pointed hood dark against the sunset or the rising of the moon  smith what does he talk about  patricia he tells me the truth very many true things he is a wizard  morris how do you know hes a wizard i suppose he plays some tricks on you  patricia i should know he was a wizard if he played no tricks but once he stooped and picked up a stone and cast it into the air and it flew up into gods heaven like a bird  morris was that what first made you think he was a wizard  patricia oh no when i first saw him he was tracing circles and pentacles in the grass and talking the language of the elves  morris sceptically do you know the language of the elves  patricia not until i heard it  morris lowering his voice as if for his sister but losing patience so completely that he talks much louder than he imagines see here patricia i reckon this kind of thing is going to be the limit im just not going to have you let in by some blamed tramp or fortuneteller because you choose to read minor poetry about the fairies if this gipsy or whatever he is troubles you again  doctor putting his hand on morriss shoulder come you must allow a little more for poetry we cant all feed on nothing but petrol  duke quite right quite right and being irish dont you know celtic as old buffle used to say charming songs you know about the irish girl who has a plaid shawland a banshee sighs profoundly poor old gladstone       silence as usual  smith speaking to doctor i thought you yourself considered the family superstition bad for the health  doctor i consider a family superstition is better for the health than a family quarrel he walks casually across to patricia well it must be nice to be young and still see all those stars and sunsets we old buffers wont be too strict with you if your view of things sometimes gets a bitmixed up shall we say if the stars get loose about the grass by mistake or if once or twice the sunset gets into the east we should only say dream as much as you like dream for all mankind dream for us who can dream no longer but do not quite forget the difference  patricia what difference  doctor the difference between the things that are beautiful and the things that are there that red lamp over my door isnt beautiful but its there you might even come to be glad it is there when the stars of gold and silver have faded i am an old man now but some men are still glad to find my red star i do not say they are the wise men  patricia somewhat affected yes i know you are good to everybody but dont you think there may be floating and spiritual stars which will last longer than the red lamps  smith with decision yes but they are fixed stars  doctor the red lamp will last my time  duke capital capital why its like tennyson silence i remember when i was an undergrad       the red light disappears no one sees it at first except      patricia who points excitedly  morris whats the matter  patricia the red star is gone  morris nonsense rushes to the garden doors its only somebody standing in front of it say duke theres somebody standing in the garden  patricia calmly i told you he walked about the garden  morris if its that fortuneteller of yours       disappears into the garden followed by the doctor  duke staring somebody in the garden really this land campaign       silence       morris reappears rather breathless  morris a spry fellow your friend he slipped through my hands like a shadow  patricia i told you he was a shadow  morris well i guess theres going to be a shadow hunt got a lantern duke  patricia oh you need not trouble he will come if i call him       she goes out into the garden and calls out some halfchanted and      unintelligible words somewhat like the song preceding her      entrance the red light reappears and there is a slight sound as      of fallen leaves shuffled by approaching feet the cloaked      stranger with the pointed hood is seen standing outside the garden      doors  patricia you may enter all doors       the figure comes into the room  morris shutting the garden doors behind him now see here wizard weve got you and we know youre a fraud  smith quietly pardon me i do not fancy that we know that for myself i must confess to something of the doctors agnosticism  morris excited and turning almost with a snarl i didnt know you parsons stuck up for any fables but your own  smith i stick up for the thing every man has a right to perhaps the only thing that every man has a right to  morris and what is that  smith the benefit of the doubt even your master the petroleum millionaire has a right to that and i think he needs it more  morris i dont think theres much doubt about the question minister ive met this sort of fellow often enoughthe sort of fellow who wheedles money out of girls by telling them he can make stones disappear  doctor to the stranger do you say you can make stones disappear  stranger yes i can make stones disappear  morris roughly i reckon youre the kind of tough who knows how to make a watch and chain disappear  stranger yes i know how to make a watch and chain disappear  morris and i should think you were pretty good at disappearing yourself  stranger i have done such a thing  morris with a sneer will you disappear now  stranger after reflection no i think ill appear instead he throws back his hood showing the head of an intellectuallooking man young but rather worn then he unfastens his cloak and throws it off emerging in complete modern evening dress he advances down the room towards the duke taking out his watch as he does so goodevening your grace im afraid im rather too early for the performance but this gentleman with a gesture towards morris seemed rather impatient for it to begin  duke rather at a loss oh goodevening why reallyare you the  stranger bowing yes i am the conjurer       there is general laughter except from patricia as the others      mingle in talk the stranger goes up to her  stranger very sadly i am very sorry i am not a wizard  patricia i wish you were a thief instead  stranger have i committed a worse crime than thieving  patricia you have committed the cruellest crime i think that there is  stranger and what is the cruellest crime  patricia stealing a childs toy  stranger and what have i stolen  patricia a fairy tale        curtain     act ii        the same room lighted more brilliantly an hour later in the      evening on one side a table covered with packs of cards pyramids      etc at which the conjurer in evening dress is standing quietly      setting out his tricks a little more in the foreground the duke      and hastings with a number of papers  hastings there are only a few small matters here are the programmes of the entertainment your grace wanted mr carleon wishes to see them very much  duke thanks thanks takes the programmes  hastings shall i carry them for your grace  duke no no i shant forget i shant forget why youve no idea how businesslike i am we have to be you know vaguely i know youre a bit of a socialist but i assure you theres a good deal to dostake in the country and all that look at remembering faces now the king never forgets faces waves the programmes about i never forget faces catches sight of the conjurer and genially draws him into the discussion why the professor here who performs before the king puts down the programmesyou see it on the caravans you knowperforms before the king almost every night i suppose  conjurer smiling i sometimes let his majesty have an evening off and turn my attention of course to the very highest nobility but naturally i have performed before every sovereign potentate white and black there never was a conjurer who hadnt  duke thats right thats right and youll say with me that the great business for a king is remembering people  conjurer i should say it was remembering which people to remember  duke well well now looks round rather wildly for something being really businesslike  hastings shall i take the programmes for your grace  duke picking them up no no i shant forget is there anything else  hastings i have to go down the village about the wire to stratford the only other thing at all urgent is the militant vegetarians  duke ah the militant vegetarians youve heard of them im sure wont obey the law to the conjurer so long as the government serves out meat  conjurer let them be comforted there are a good many people who dont get much meat  duke well well im bound to say theyre very enthusiastic advanced toooh certainly advanced like joan of arc       short silence in which the conjurer stares at him  conjurer was joan of arc a vegetarian  duke oh well its a very high ideal after all the sacredness of life you knowthe sacredness of life shakes his head but they carry it too far they killed a policeman down in kent  conjurer killed a policeman how vegetarian well i suppose it was so long as they didnt eat him  hastings they are asking only for small subscriptions indeed they prefer to collect a large number of halfcrowns to prove the popularity of their movement but i should advise  duke oh give them three shillings then  hastings if i might suggest  duke hang it all we gave the antivegetarians three shillings it seems only fair  hastings if i might suggest anything i think your grace will be wise not to subscribe in this case the antivegetarians have already used their funds to form gangs ostensibly to protect their own meetings and if the vegetarians use theirs to break up the meetingswell it will look rather funny that we have paid roughs on both sides it will be rather difficult to explain when it comes before the magistrate  duke but i shall be the magistrate conjurer stares at him again thats the system my dear hastings thats the advantage of the system not a logical systemno rousseau in itbut see how well it works i shall be the very best magistrate that could be on the bench the others would be biassed you know old sir lawrence is a vegetarian himself and might be hard on the antivegetarian roughs colonel crashaw would be sure to be hard on the vegetarian roughs but if ive paid both of em of course i shant be hard on either of emand there you have it just perfect impartiality  hastings restrainedly shall i take the programmes your grace  duke heartily no no i wont forget em exit hastings well professor whats the news in the conjuring world  conjurer i fear there is never any news in the conjuring world  duke dont you have a newspaper or something everybody has a newspaper now you know theerdaily swordswallower or that sort of thing  conjurer no i have been a journalist myself but i think journalism and conjuring will always be incompatible  duke incompatibleoh but thats where i differthats where i take larger views larger laws as old buffle said nothings incompatible you knowexcept husband and wife and so on you must talk to morris about that its wonderful the way incompatibility has gone forward in the states  conjurer i only mean that the two trades rest on opposite principles the whole point of being a conjurer is that you wont explain a thing that has happened  duke well and the journalist  conjurer well the whole point of being a journalist is that you do explain a thing that hasnt happened  duke but youll want somewhere to discuss the new tricks  conjurer there are no new tricks and if there were we shouldnt want em discussed  duke im afraid youre not really advanced are you interested in modern progress  conjurer yes we are interested in all tricks done by illusion  duke well well i must go and see how morris is pleasure of seeing you later       exit duke leaving the programmes  conjurer why are nice men such asses turns to arrange the table that seems all right the pack of cards that is a pack of cards and the pack of cards that isnt a pack of cards the hat that looks like a gentlemans hat but which in reality is no gentlemans hat only my hat and i am not a gentleman i am only a conjurer and this is only a conjurers hat i could not take off this hat to a lady i can take rabbits out of it goldfish out of it snakes out of it only i mustnt take my own head out of it i suppose im a lower animal than a rabbit or a snake anyhow they can get out of the conjurers hat and i cant i am a conjurer and nothing else but a conjurer unless i could show i was something else and that would be worse       he begins to dash the cards rather irregularly about the table      enter patricia  patricia coldly i beg your pardon i came to get some programmes my uncle wants them       she walks swiftly across and takes up the programmes  conjurer still dashing cards about the table miss carleon might i speak to you a moment he puts his hands in his pockets stares at the table and his face assumes a sardonic expression the question is purely practical  patricia pausing at the door i can hardly imagine what the question can be  conjurer i am the question  patricia and what have i to do with that  conjurer you have everything to do with it i am the question you  patricia angrily well what am i  conjurer you are the answer  patricia the answer to what  conjurer coming round to the front of the table and sitting against it the answer to me you think im a liar because i walked about the fields with you and said i could make stones disappear well so i can im a conjurer in mere point of fact it wasnt a lie but if it had been a lie i should have told it just the same i would have told twenty such lies you may or may not know why  patricia i know nothing about such lies       she puts her hand on the handle of the door but the conjurer      who is sitting on the table and staring at his boots does not      notice the action and goes on as in a sincere soliloquy  conjurer i dont know whether you have any notion of what it means to a man like me to talk to a lady like you even on false pretences i am an adventurer i am a blackguard if one can earn the title by being in all the blackguard societies of the world i have thought everything out by myself when i was a guttersnipe in fleet street or lower still a journalist in fleet street before i met you i never guessed that rich people ever thought at all well that is all i have to say we had some good conversations didnt we i am a liar but i told you a great deal of the truth       he turns and resumes the arrangement of the table  patricia thinking yes you did tell me a great deal of the truth you told me hundreds and thousands of truths but you never told me the truth that one wants to know  conjurer and what is that  patricia turning back into the room you never told me the truth about yourself you never told me you were only the conjurer  conjurer i did not tell you that because i do not even know it i do not know whether i am only the conjurer  patricia what do you mean  conjurer sometimes i am afraid i am something worse than the conjurer  patricia seriously i cannot think of anything worse than a conjurer who does not call himself a conjurer  conjurer gloomily there is something worse rallying himself but that is not what i want to say do you really find that very unpardonable come let me put you a case never mind about whether it is our case a man spends his time incessantly in going about in thirdclass carriages to fifthrate lodgings he has to make up new tricks new patter new nonsense sometimes every night of his life mostly he has to do it in the beastly black cities of the midlands and the north where he cant get out into the country now and again he does it at some gentlemans countryhouse where he can get out into the country well you know that actors and orators and all sorts of people like to rehearse their effects in the open air if they can smiles you know that story of the great statesman who was heard by his own gardener saying as he paced the garden had i mr speaker received the smallest intimation that i could be called upon to speak this evening patricia controls a smile and he goes on with overwhelming enthusiasm well conjurers are just the same it takes some time to prepare an impromptu a man like that walks about the woods and fields doing all his tricks beforehand and talking all sorts of gibberish because he thinks he is alone one evening this man found he was not alone he found a very beautiful child was watching him  patricia a child  conjurer yes that was his first impression he is an intimate friend of mine i have known him all my life he tells me he has since discovered she is not a child she does not fulfil the definition  patricia what is the definition of a child  conjurer somebody you can play with  patricia abruptly why did you wear that cloak with the hood up  conjurer smiling i think it escaped your notice that it was raining  patricia smiling faintly and what did this friend of yours do  conjurer you have already told me what he did he destroyed a fairy tale for he created a fairy tale that he was bound to destroy swinging round suddenly on the table but do you blame a man very much miss carleon if he enjoyed the only fairy tale he had had in his life suppose he said the silly circles he was drawing for practice were really magic circles suppose he said the bosh he was talking was the language of the elves remember he has read fairy tales as much as you have fairy tales are the only democratic institutions all the classes have heard all the fairy tales do you blame him very much if he too tried to have a holiday in fairyland  patricia simply i blame him less than i did but i still say there can be nothing worse than false magic and after all it was he who brought the false magic  conjurer rising from his seat yes it was she who brought the real magic       enter morris in eveningdress he walks straight up to the      conjuringtable and picks up one article after another putting      each down with a comment  morris i know that one i know that i know that lets see thats the false bottom i think that works with a wire i know that it goes up the sleeve thats the false bottom again thats the substituted pack of cardsthat  patricia really morris you mustnt talk as if you knew everything  conjurer oh i dont mind anyone knowing everything miss carleon there is something that is much more important than knowing how a thing is done  morris and whats that  conjurer knowing how to do it  morris becoming nasal again in anger thats so eh being the hightoned conjurer because you cant any longer take all the sidewalk as a fairy  patricia crossing the room and speaking seriously to her brother really morris you are very rude and its quite ridiculous to be rude this gentleman was only practising some tricks by himself in the garden with a certain dignity if there was any mistake it was mine come shake hands or whatever men do when they apologize dont be silly he wont turn you into a bowl of goldfish  morris reluctantly well i guess thats so offering his hand shake they shake hands and you wont turn me into a bowl of goldfish anyhow professor i understand that when you do produce a bowl of goldfish they are generally slips of carrot that is so professor  conjurer sharply yes produces a bowl of goldfish from his tail pockets and holds it under the others nose judge for yourself  morris in monstrous excitement very good very good but i know how thats donei know how thats done you have an indiarubber cap you know or cover  conjurer yes       goes back gloomily to his table and sits on it picking up a pack      of cards and balancing it in his hand  morris ah most mysteries are tolerably plain if you know the apparatus enter doctor and smith talking with grave faces but growing silent as they reach the group i guess i wish we had all the old apparatus of all the old priests and prophets since the beginning of the world i guess most of the old miracles and that were a matter of just panel and wires  conjurer i dont quite understand you what old apparatus do you want so much  morris breaking out with all the frenzy of the young freethinker well sir i just want that old apparatus that turned rods into snakes i want those smart appliances sir that brought water out of a rock when old man moses chose to hit it i guess its a pity weve lost the machinery i would like to have those old conjurers here that called themselves patriarchs and prophets in your precious bible  patricia morris you mustnt talk like that  morris well i dont believe in religion  doctor aside hush hush nobody but women believe in religion  patricia humorously i think this is a fitting opportunity to show you another ancient conjuring trick  doctor which one is that  patricia the vanishing lady       exit patricia  smith there is one part of their old apparatus i regret especially being lost  morris still excited yes  smith the apparatus for writing the book of job  morris well well they didnt know everything in those old times  smith no and in those old times they knew they didnt dreamily where shall wisdom be found and what is the place of understanding  conjurer somewhere in america i believe  smith still dreamily man knoweth not the price thereof neither is it found in the land of the living the deep sayeth it is not in me the sea sayeth it is not with me death and destruction say we have heard tell of it god understandeth the way thereof and he knoweth the place thereof for he looketh to the ends of the earth and seeth under the whole heaven but to man he hath said behold the fear of the lord that is wisdom and to depart from evil is understanding turns suddenly to the doctor hows that for agnosticism dr grimthorpe what a pity that apparatus is lost  morris well you may just smile how you choose i reckon but i say the conjurer here could be the biggest man in the big blessed centuries if he could just show us how the holy old tricks were done we must say this for old man moses that he was in advance of his time when he did the old tricks they were new tricks he got the pull on the public he could do his tricks before grown men great bearded fighting men who could win battles and sing psalms but this modern conjuring is all behind the times thats why they only do it with schoolboys there isnt a trick on that table i dont know the whole trades as dead as mutton and not half so satisfying why he pointing to the conjurer brought out a bowl of goldfish just nowan old trick that anybody could do  conjurer oh i quite agree the apparatus is perfectly simple by the way let me have a look at those goldfish of yours will you  morris angrily im not a paid playactor come here to conjure im not here to do stale tricks im here to see through em i say its an old trick and  conjurer true but as you said we never show it except to schoolboys  morris and may i ask you professor hocus pocus or whatever your name is whom you are calling a schoolboy  conjurer i beg your pardon your sister will tell you i am sometimes mistaken about children  morris i forbid you to appeal to my sister  conjurer that is exactly what a schoolboy would do  morris with abrupt and dangerous calm i am not a schoolboy professor i am a quiet business man but i tell you in the country i come from the hand of a quiet business man goes to his hip pocket at an insult like that  conjurer fiercely let it go to his pocket i thought the hand of a quiet business man more often went to someone elses pocket  morris you       puts his hand to his hip the doctor puts his hand on his      shoulder  doctor gentlemen i think you are both forgetting yourselves  conjurer perhaps his tone sinks suddenly to weariness i ask pardon for what i said it was certainly in excess of the young gentlemans deserts sighs i sometimes rather wish i could forget myself  morris sullenly after a pause well the entertainments coming on and you english dont like a scene i reckon ill have to bury the blamed old hatchet too  doctor with a certain dignity his social type shining through his profession mr carleon you will forgive an old man who knew your father well if he doubts whether you are doing yourself justice in treating yourself as an american indian merely because you have lived in america in my old friend huxleys time we of the middle classes disbelieved in reason and all sorts of things but we did believe in good manners it is a pity if the aristocracy cant i dont like to hear you say you are a savage and have buried a tomahawk i would rather hear you say as your irish ancestors would have said that you have sheathed your sword with the dignity proper to a gentleman  morris very well ive sheathed my sword with the dignity proper to a gentleman  conjurer and i have sheathed my sword with the dignity proper to a conjurer  morris how does the conjurer sheath a sword  conjurer swallows it  doctor then we all agree there shall be no quarrel  smith may i say a word i have a great dislike of a quarrel for a reason quite beyond my duty to my cloth  morris and what is that  smith i object to a quarrel because it always interrupts an argument may i bring you back for a moment to the argument you were saying that these modern conjuring tricks are simply the old miracles when they have once been found out but surely another view is possible when we speak of things being sham we generally mean that they are imitations of things that are genuine take that reynolds over there of the dukes greatgrandfather points to a picture on the wall if i were to say it was a copy  morris wal the dukes real amiable but i reckon youd find what you call the interruption of an argument  smith well suppose i did say so you wouldnt take it as meaning that sir joshua reynolds never lived why should sham miracles prove to us that real saints and prophets never lived there may be sham magic and real magic also       the conjurer raises his head and listens with a strange air of      intentness  smith there may be turnip ghosts precisely because there are real ghosts there may be theatrical fairies precisely because there are real fairies you do not abolish the bank of england by pointing to a forged banknote  morris i hope the professor enjoys being called a forged banknote  conjurer almost as much as being called the prospectus of some american companies  doctor gentlemen gentlemen  conjurer i am sorry  morris wal lets have the argument first then i guess we can have the quarrel afterwards ill clean this house of some encumbrances see here mr smith im not putting anything on your real miracle notion i say and science says that theres a cause for everything science will find out that cause and sooner or later your old miracle will look mighty mean sooner or later science will botanise a bit on your turnip ghosts and make you look turnips yourselves for having taken any i say  doctor in a low voice to smith i dont like this peaceful argument of yours the boy is getting much too excited  morris you say old man reynolds lived and science dont say no he turns excitedly to the picture but i guess hes dead now and youll no more raise your saints and prophets from the dead than youll raise the dukes greatgrandfather to dance on that wall       the picture begins to sway slightly to and fro on the wall  doctor why the picture is moving  morris turning furiously on the conjurer you were in the room before us do you reckon that will take us in you can do all that with wires  conjurer motionless and without looking up from the table yes i could do all that with wires  morris and you reckoned i shouldnt know laughs with a high crowing laugh thats how the derned dirty spiritualists do all their tricks they say they can make the furniture move of itself if it does move they move it and we mean to know how       a chair falls over with a slight crash       morris almost staggers and momentarily fights for breath and      words  morris you  why  that  every one knows that  a sliding plank it can be done with a sliding plank  conjurer without looking up yes it can be done with a sliding plank       the doctor draws nearer to morris who faces about      addressing him passionately  morris you were right on the spot doc when you talked about that red lamp of yours that red lamp is the light of science that will put out all the lanterns of your turnip ghosts its a consuming fire doctor but it is the red light of the morning points at it in exalted enthusiasm your priests can no more stop that light from shining or change its colour and its radiance than joshua could stop the sun and moon laughs savagely why a real fairy in an elfin cloak strayed too near the lamp an hour or two ago and it turned him into a common society clown with a white tie       the lamp at the end of the garden turns blue they all look at it      in silence  morris splitting the silence on a high unnatural note wait a bit wait a bit ive got you ill have you he strides wildly up and down the room biting his finger you put a wire  no that cant be it  doctor speaking to him soothingly well well just at this moment we need not inquire  morris turning on him furiously you call yourself a man of science and you dare to tell me not to inquire  smith we only mean that for the moment you might let it alone  morris violently no priest i will not let it alone pacing the room again could it be done with mirrors he clasps his brow you have a mirror suddenly with a shout ive got it ive got it mixture of lights why not if you throw a green light on a red light       sudden silence  smith quietly to the doctor you dont get blue  doctor stepping across to the conjurer if you have done this trick for gods sake undo it       after a silence the light turns red again  morris dashing suddenly to the glass doors and examining them its the glass youve been doing something to the glass       he stops suddenly and there is a long silence  conjurer still without moving i dont think you will find anything wrong with the glass  morris bursting open the glass doors with a crash then ill find out whats wrong with the lamp       disappears into the garden  doctor it is still a wet night i am afraid  smith yes and somebody else will be wandering about the garden now       through the broken glass doors morris can be seen marching      backwards and forwards with swifter and swifter steps  smith i suppose in this case the celtic twilight will not get on the chest  doctor oh if it were only the chest       enter patricia  patricia where is my brother       there is an embarrassed silence in which the conjurer      answers  conjurer i am afraid he is walking about in fairyland  patricia but he mustnt go out on a night like this its very dangerous  conjurer yes it is very dangerous he might meet a fairy  patricia what do you mean  conjurer you went out in this sort of weather and you met this sort of fairy and so far it has only brought you sorrow  patricia i am going out to find my brother       she goes out into the garden through the open doors  smith after a silence very suddenly what is that noise she is not singing those songs to him is she  conjurer no he does not understand the language of the elves  smith but what are all those cries and gasps i hear  conjurer the normal noises i believe of a quiet business man  doctor sir i can understand your being bitter for i admit you have been uncivilly received but to speak like that just now       patricia reappears at the garden doors very pale  patricia can i speak to the doctor  doctor my dear lady certainly shall i fetch the duke  patricia i would prefer the doctor  smith can i be of any use  patricia i only want the doctor       she goes out again followed by dr grimthorpe the others look      at each other  smith quietly that last was a wonderful trick of yours  conjurer thank you i suppose you mean it was the only one you didnt see through  smith something of the kind i confess your last trick was the best trick i have ever seen it is so good that i wish you had not done it  conjurer and so do i  smith how do you mean do you wish you had never been a conjurer  conjurer i wish i had never been born       exit conjurer       a silence the doctor enters very grave  doctor it is all right so far we have brought him back  smith drawing near to him you told me there was mental trouble with the girl  doctor looking at him steadily no i told you there was mental trouble in the family  smith after a silence where is mr morris carleon  doctor i have got him into bed in the next room his sister is looking after him  smith his sister oh then do you believe in fairies  doctor believe in fairies what do you mean  smith at least you put the person who does believe in them in charge of the person who doesnt  doctor well i suppose i do  smith you dont think shell keep him awake all night with fairy tales  doctor certainly not  smith you dont think shell throw the medicinebottle out of window and administerera dewdrop or anything of that sort or a fourleaved clover say  doctor no of course not  smith i only ask because you scientific men are a little hard on us clergymen you dont believe in a priesthood but youll admit im more really a priest than this conjurer is really a magician youve been talking a lot about the bible and the higher criticism but even by the higher criticism the bible is older than the language of the elveswhich was as far as i can make out invented this afternoon but miss carleon believed in the wizard miss carleon believed in the language of the elves and you put her in charge of an invalid without a flicker of doubt because you trust women  doctor very seriously yes i trust women  smith you trust a woman with the practical issues of life and death through sleepless hours when a shaking hand or an extra grain would kill  doctor yes  smith but if the woman gets up to go to early service at my church you call her weakminded and say that nobody but women can believe in religion  doctor i should never call this woman weakmindedno by god not even if she went to church  smith yet there are many as strongminded who believe passionately in going to church  doctor werent there as many who believed passionately in apollo  smith and what harm came of believing in apollo and what a mass of harm may have come of not believing in apollo does it never strike you that doubt can be a madness as well be faith that asking questions may be a disease as well as proclaiming doctrines you talk of religious mania is there no such thing as irreligious mania is there no such thing in the house at this moment  doctor then you think no one should question at all  smith with passion pointing to the next room i think that is what comes of questioning why cant you leave the universe alone and let it mean what it likes why shouldnt the thunder be jupiter more men have made themselves silly by wondering what the devil it was if it wasnt jupiter  doctor looking at him do you believe in your own religion  smith returning the look equally steadily suppose i dont i should still be a fool to question it the child who doubts about santa claus has insomnia the child who believes has a good nights rest  doctor you are a pragmatist       enter duke absentmindedly  smith that is what the lawyers call vulgar abuse but i do appeal to practise here is a family over which you tell me a mental calamity hovers here is the boy who questions everything and a girl who can believe anything upon which has the curse fallen  duke talking about the pragmatists im glad to hear ah very forward movement i suppose roosevelt now silence well we move you know we move first there was the missing link silence no first there was protoplasmand then there was the missing link and magna carta and so on silence why look at the insurance act  doctor i would rather not  duke wagging a playful finger at him ah prejudice prejudice you doctors you know well i never had any myself       silence  doctor breaking the silence in unusual exasperation any what  duke firmly never had any marconis myself wouldnt touch em silence well i must speak to hastings       exit duke aimlessly  doctor exploding well of all the turns to smith you asked me just now which member of the family had inherited the family madness  smith yes i did  doctor in a low emphatic voice on my living soul i believe it must be the duke        curtain     act iii        room partly darkened a table with a lamp on it and an empty      chair from room next door faint and occasional sounds of the      tossing or talking of the invalid       enter doctor grimthorpe with a rather careworn air and a      medicine bottle in his hand he puts it on the table and sits down      in the chair as if keeping a vigil       enter conjurer carrying his bag and cloaked for departure as he      crosses the room the doctor rises and calls after him  doctor forgive me but may i detain you for one moment i suppose you are aware thathe hesitates that there have been rather grave developments in the case of illness which happened after your performance i would not say of course because of your performance  conjurer thank you  doctor slightly encouraged but speaking very carefully nevertheless mental excitement is necessarily an element of importance in physiological troubles and your triumphs this evening were really so extraordinary that i cannot pretend to dismiss them from my patients case he is at present in a state somewhat analogous to delirium but in which he can still partially ask and answer questions the question he continually asks is how you managed to do your last trick  conjurer ah my last trick  doctor now i was wondering whether we could make any arrangement which would be fair to you in the matter would it be possible for you to give me in confidence the means of satisfying thisthis fixed idea he seems to have got he hesitates again and picks his words more slowly this special condition of semidelirious disputation is a rare one and connected in my experience with rather unfortunate cases  conjurer looking at him steadily do you mean he is going mad  doctor rather taken aback for the first time really you ask me an unfair question i could not explain the fine shades of these things to a layman and even ifif what you suggest were so i should have to regard it as a professional secret  conjurer still looking at him and dont you think you ask me a rather unfair question dr grimthorpe if yours is a professional secret is not mine a professional secret too if you may hide truth from the world why may not i you dont tell your tricks i dont tell my tricks  doctor with some heat ours are not tricks  conjurer reflectively ah no one can be sure of that till the tricks are told  doctor but the public can see a doctors cures as plain as  conjurer yes as plain as they saw the red lamp over his door this evening  doctor after a pause your secret of course would be strictly kept by every one involved  conjurer oh of course people in delirium always keep secrets strictly  doctor no one sees the patient but his sister and myself  conjurer starts slightly yes his sister is she very anxious  doctor in a lower voice what would you suppose       conjurer throws himself into the chair his cloak slipping back      from his evening dress he ruminates for a short space and then      speaks  conjurer doctor there are about a thousand reasons why i should not tell you how i really did that trick but one will suffice because it is the most practical of all  doctor well and why shouldnt you tell me  conjurer because you wouldnt believe me if i did       a silence the doctor looking at him curiously       enter the duke with papers in his hand his usual gaiety of      manner has a rather forced air owing to the fact that by some      vague sickroom associations he walks as if on tiptoe and begins      to speak in a sort of loud or shrill whisper this he fortunately      forgets and falls into his more natural voice  duke to conjurer so very kind of you to have waited professor i expect dr grimthorpe has explained the little difficulty we are in much better than i could nothing like the medical mind for a scientific statement hazily look at ibsen       silence  doctor of course the professor feels considerable reluctance in the matter he points out that his secrets are an essential part of his profession  duke of course of course tricks of the trade eh very proper of course quite a case of noblesse oblige silence but i dare say we shall be able to find a way out of the matter he turns to the conjurer now my dear sir i hope you will not be offended if i say that this ought to be a business matter we are asking you for a piece of your professional work and knowledge and if i may have the pleasure of writing you a cheque  conjurer i thank your grace i have already received my cheque from your secretary you will find it on the counterfoil just after the cheque you so kindly gave to the society for the suppression of conjuring  duke now i dont want you to take it in that way i want you to take it in a broader way free you know with an expansive gesture modern and all that wonderful man bernard shaw       silence  doctor with a slight cough resuming if you feel any delicacy the payment need not be made merely to you i quite respect your feelings in the matter  duke approvingly quite so quite so havent you got a cause or something everybody has a cause now you know conjurers widows or something of that kind  conjurer with restraint no i have no widows  duke then something like a pension or annuity for any widows you mayerprocure gaily opening his chequebook and talking slang to show there is no illfeeling come let me call it a couple of thou       the conjurer takes the cheque and looks at it in a grave and      doubtful way as he does so the rector comes slowly into the      room  conjurer you would really be willing to pay a sum like this to know the way i did that trick  duke i would willingly pay much more  doctor i think i explained to you that the case is serious  conjurer more and more thoughtful you would pay much more suddenly but suppose i tell you the secret and you find theres nothing in it  doctor you mean that its really quite simple why i should say that that would be the best thing that could possibly happen a little healthy laughter is the best possible thing for convalescence  conjurer still looking gloomily at the cheque i do not think you will laugh  duke reasoning genially but as you say it is something quite simple  conjurer it is the simplest thing there is in the world that is why you will not laugh  doctor almost nervously why what do you mean what shall we do  conjurer gravely you will disbelieve it  doctor and why  conjurer because it is so simple he springs suddenly to his feet the cheque still in his hand you ask me how i really did the last trick i will tell you how i did the last trick i did it by magic       the duke and doctor stare at him motionless but the rev      smith starts and takes a step nearer the table the conjurer      pulls his cloak round his shoulders this gesture as of      departure brings the doctor to his feet  doctor astonished and angry do you really mean that you take the cheque and then tell us it was only magic  conjurer pulling the cheque to pieces i tear the cheque and i tell you it was only magic  doctor with violent sincerity but hang it all theres no such thing  conjurer yes there is i wish to god i did not know that there is  duke rising also why really magic  conjurer contemptuously yes your grace one of those larger laws you were telling us about       he buttons his cloak up at his throat and takes up his bag as he      does so the rev smith steps between him and the door and stops      him for a moment  smith in a low voice one moment sir  conjurer what do you want  smith i want to apologize to you i mean on behalf of the company i think it was wrong to offer you money i think it was more wrong to mystify you with medical language and call the thing delirium i have more respect for conjurers patter than for doctors patter they are both meant to stupify but yours only to stupify for a moment now i put it to you in plain words and on plain human christian grounds here is a poor boy who may be going mad suppose you had a son in such a position would you not expect people to tell you the whole truth if it could help you  conjurer yes and i have told you the whole truth go and find out if it helps you       turns again to go but more irresolutely  smith you know quite well it will not help us  conjurer why not  smith you know quite well why not you are an honest man and you have said it yourself because he would not believe it  conjurer with a sort of fury well does anybody believe it do you believe it  smith with great restraint your question is quite fair come let us sit down and talk about it let me take your cloak  conjurer i will take off my cloak when you take off your coat  smith smiling why do you want me to fight  conjurer violently i want you to be martyred i want you to bear witness to your own creed i say these things are supernatural i say this was done by a spirit the doctor does not believe me he is an agnostic and he knows everything the duke does not believe me he cannot believe anything so plain as a miracle but what the devil are you for if you dont believe in a miracle what does your coat mean if it doesnt mean that there is such a thing as the supernatural what does your cursed collar mean if it doesnt mean that there is such a thing as a spirit exasperated why the devil do you dress up like that if you dont believe in it with violence or perhaps you dont believe in devils  smith i believe after a pause i wish i could believe  conjurer yes i wish i could disbelieve       enter patricia pale and in the slight négligée of the amateur      nurse  patricia may i speak to the conjurer  smith hastening forward you want the doctor  patricia no the conjurer  doctor are there any developments  patricia i only want to speak to the conjurer       they all withdraw either at the garden or the other doors      patricia walks up to conjurer  patricia you must tell me how you did the trick you will i know you will o i know my poor brother was rude to you hes rude to everybody breaks down but hes such a little little boy  conjurer i suppose you know there are things men never tell to women they are too horrible  patricia yes and there are things women never tell to men they also are too horrible i am here to hear them all  conjurer do you really mean i may say anything i like however dark it is however dreadful it is however damnable it is  patricia i have gone through too much to be terrified now tell me the very worst  conjurer i will tell you the very worst i fell in love with you when i first saw you       sits down and crosses his legs  patricia drawing back you told me i looked like a child and  conjurer i told a lie  patricia o this is terrible  conjurer i was in love i took an opportunity you believed quite simply that i was a magician but i  patricia it is terrible it is terrible i never believed you were a magician  conjurer astounded never believed i was a magician  patricia i always knew you were a man  conjurer doing whatever passionate things people do on the stage i am a man and you are a woman and all the elves have gone to elfland and all the devils to hell and you and i will walk out of this great vulgar house and be married every one is crazy in this house tonight i think what am i saying as if you could marry me o my god  patricia this is the first time you have failed in courage  conjurer what do you mean  patricia i mean to draw your attention to the fact that you have recently made an offer i accept it  conjurer oh its nonsense its nonsense how can a man marry an archangel let alone a lady my mother was a lady and she married a dying fiddler who tramped the roads and the mixture plays the cat and banjo with my body and soul i can see my mother now cooking food in dirtier and dirtier lodgings darning socks with weaker and weaker eyes when she might have worn pearls by consenting to be a rational person  patricia and she might have grown pearls by consenting to be an oyster  conjurer seriously there was little pleasure in her life  patricia there is little a very little in everybodys the question is what kind we cant turn life into a pleasure but we can choose such pleasures as are worthy of us and our immortal souls your mother chose and i have chosen  conjurer staring immortal souls and i suppose if i knelt down to worship you you and every one else would laugh  patricia with a smile of perversity well i think this is a more comfortable way she sits down suddenly beside him in a sort of domestic way and goes on talking yes ill do everything your mother did not so well of course ill darn that conjurers hatdoes one darn hatsand cook the conjurers dinner by the way what is a conjurers dinner theres always the goldfish of course  conjurer with a groan carrots  patricia and of course now i come to think of it you can always take rabbits out of the hat why what a cheap life it must be how do you cook rabbits the duke is always talking about poached rabbits really we shall be as happy as is good for us well have confidence in each other at least and no secrets i insist on knowing all the tricks  conjurer i dont think i know whether im on my head or my heels  patricia and now as were going to be so confidential and comfortable youll just tell me the real practical tricky little way you did that last trick  conjurer rising rigid with horror how i did that trick i did it by devils turning furiously on patricia you could believe in fairies cant you believe in devils  patricia seriously no i cant believe in devils  conjurer well this room is full of them  patricia what does it all mean  conjurer it only means that i have done what many men have done but few i think have thriven by he sits down and talks thoughtfully i told you i had mixed with many queer sets of people among others i mixed with those who pretend truly and falsely to do our tricks by the aid of spirits i dabbled a little in tablerapping and tableturning but i soon had reason to give it up  patricia why did you give it up  conjurer it began by giving me headaches and i found that every morning after a spiritualist séance i had a queer feeling of lowness and degradation of having been soiled much like the feeling i suppose that people have the morning after they have been drunk but i happen to have what people call a strong head and i have never been really drunk  patricia i am glad of that  conjurer it hasnt been for want of trying but it wasnt long before the spirits with whom i had been playing at tableturning did what i think they generally do at the end of all such tableturning  patricia what did they do  conjurer they turned the tables they turned the tables upon me i dont wonder at your believing in fairies as long as these things were my servants they seemed to me like fairies when they tried to be my masters i found they were not fairies i found the spirits with whom i at least had come in contact were evil  awfully unnaturally evil  patricia did they say so  conjurer dont talk of what they said i was a loose fellow but i had not fallen so low as such things i resisted them and after a pretty bad time psychologically speaking i cut the connexion but they were always tempting me to use the supernatural power i had got from them it was not very great but it was enough to move things about to alter lights and so on i dont know whether you realize that its rather a strain on a man to drink bad coffee at a coffeestall when he knows he has just enough magic in him to make a bottle of champagne walk out of an empty shop  patricia i think you behaved very well  conjurer bitterly and when i fell at last it was for nothing half so clean and christian as champagne in black blind pride and anger and all kinds of heathenry because of the impudence of a schoolboy i called on the fiends and they obeyed  patricia touches his arm poor fellow  conjurer your goodness is the only goodness that never goes wrong  patricia and what are we to do with morris ii believe you now my dear but hehe will never believe  conjurer there is no bigot like the atheist i must think       walks towards the garden windows the other men reappear to      arrest his movement  doctor where are you going  conjurer i am going to ask the god whose enemies i have served if i am still worthy to save a child       exit into garden he paces up and down exactly as morris has      done as he does so patricia slowly goes out and a long silence      follows during which the remaining men stir

characterized by humor of an original and delightful character and repartee that is distinctly clever  gp putnams sons new york    london     irish plays by lady gregory   lady gregorys name has become a household word in america and her works should occupy an exclusive niche in every library mr george bernard shaw in a recently published interview said lady gregory is the greatest living irishwoman even in the plays of lady gregory penetrated as they are by that intense love of ireland which is unintelligible to the many drunken blackguards with irish names who make their nationality an excuse for their vices and their worthlessness there is no flattery of the irish she writes about the irish as molière wrote about the french having a talent curiously like molière  the witchery of yeats the vivid imagination of synge the amusing literalism mixed with the pronounced romance of their imitators have their place and have been given their praise without stint but none of these can compete with lady gregory for the quality of universality the best beauty in lady gregorys art is its spontaneity it is never forced she has read and dreamed and studied and slept and wakened and worked and the great ideas that have come to her have been nourished and trained till they have grown to be of great staturechicago tribune  gp putnams sons new york    london     irish folkhistory

gregory has preferred going for her material to the traditional folkhistory rather than to the authorized printed versions and she has been able in so doing to make her plays more living one of these kincora telling of brian boru who reigned in the year 1000 evoked such keen local interest that an old farmer travelled from the neighborhood of kincora to see it acted in dublin  the story of grania on which lady gregory has founded one of these plays was taken entirely from tradition grania was a beautiful young woman and was to have been married to finn the great leader of the fenians but before the marriage she went away from the bridegroom with his handsome young kinsman diarmuid after many years when diarmuid had died and finn had a hand in his death she went back to finn and became his queen  another of lady gregorys plays the canavans dealt with the stormy times of queen elizabeth whose memory is a horror in ireland second only to that of cromwell  the white cockade is founded on a tradition of king james having escaped from ireland after the battle of the boyne in a wine barrel  the choice of folk history rather than written history gives a freshness of treatment and elasticity of material which made the late jm synge say that lady gregorys method had brought back the possibility of writing historic plays  all these plays except grania which has not yet been staged have been very successfully performed in ireland they are written in the dialect of kiltartan which had already become familiar to leaders of lady gregorys books  gp putnams sons new york
